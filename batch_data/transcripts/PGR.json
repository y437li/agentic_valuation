This conference call is also available via an audio webcast. Webcast participants will be able to listen only throughout the duration of the call. In addition, this conference is being recorded at the request of Progressive. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. The company will not make detailed comments in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q, quarterly reports to shareholders, and letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's Web site and will use this conference call to respond to questions. Today's moderator for the call will be Matt Downing. At this time I will turn the call over to Mr. Downing. Matt Downing - Investor Relations : Thank you, Carolyn. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on what I imagine is a busy morning for many of you. Participating on today's call are Glenn Renwick, our CEO, and Brian Domeck, our CFO. Also on the line is Dave Benson, who will be sitting in for Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer. The call is scheduled to last about an hour. As always, our discussions on this call may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during this call. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available on our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, issued during 2014, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements relating to forward-looking statements, and other discussions of the risks, uncertainties, and other challenges we face. Each of those documents can be found via the Investors page of our Web site, progressive.com. Carolyn, we're now ready to take our first question. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we are ready to begin the formal question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Dwelle - RBC Capital Markets : Yes. Good morning. I was kind of surprised to be first. The question that I had was, we're seeing a lot of the aggregators kind of increased their ad spend. Are you seeing an increase in lead submission coming from that channel? Glenn Renwick : Mark, we would agree with you there is a lot more activity on aggregator space. I'm not going to comment directly on our leads there, in some cases, to be quite frank with you, we have reduced our leads from some aggregators. There's not a clear answer to one across the board. But, in some cases, we have not had the results that we would find consistent with our price point for other independent agency distribution product. So we've taken a range of actions, in some cases, less production with some aggregators. In some cases we have a strong relationship with some aggregators. So the point I think that you're getting at is, is this becoming a bigger part of a landscape production, yes, I think that's a very fair assessment. Recognize that for, I would say, let me just go with say two-thirds, two-thirds of all new business production you can throw sort of two or three carriers that track that, so we're not talking necessarily about the largest production of new business, but it is a function for some who do not necessarily in my opinion do not necessarily have quite the same brand strength to be able to promote themselves in the way that we do. Mark Dwelle - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, thanks. I guess that's my question. I'll get back in the queue. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next questionnaire comment comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields - KBW: Thanks. This is sort of a nit-picky question, but when I look at the Qs, when you talk about severity trends, I'm going to focus on BI. It's 3% to 4% for the second quarter and the first six months, but the first three months were higher like 6%, so I'm trying to understand how the math works for that? Glenn Renwick : Yes. Well, actually we have our Chief Actuary here. So will try to give you as much insight to that as we have. Gary, would like to take that over? Gary Traicoff : Sure. Hi, this is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. So on the year-to-date basis, our overall BI severity is running around 4% or so. And on the quarterly basis, we had talked about was more of 2% to 3% range. So all we're really looking at our \u2013 the overall severity in the first half of the year compared to the first half of last year. And what you can see and looking at that, that in the second quarter our severity was up a little bit more than what we experienced in the first quarter. Meyer Shields - KBW: You mean the other way around, right? Gary Traicoff : Yes. I'm sorry. The other way around. Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Bigger picture, I guess, Glenn, you made reference to competitors' rate actions. On a month-to-month basis is that getting better or worse? Glenn Renwick : I'm not sure quite what better or worse means there, I probably answer it in a different way. In the early part of the year, focusing on our own rate actions, we took in several states and rates that we're probably let's say heading for a three to four kind of rate action for the year. And we see competitors \u2013 it ranges across, but we see two to three to four sort of relatively consistent there as well. I'm not sure what the outlook will be for the rest of the year. We obviously will react how we see things, but it is reasonably possible based on what I'm seeing now, netting aside sort of hail and all that sort of stuff, that we might be in for a period of several months of reasonably stable rate to action. We are very comfortable with that current rates and at least relative to our outlook and relative to the trends that some of which we just discussed, we feel that's consistent with the way we're priced for the future, we're always pricing to a point in the future. So we're not seeing anything that takes us up our pricing estimates. I can't comment on others. We've seen some rate actions from others that are in about the same league as ours, and if I had to go out on a limb, I would say that probably there will be a relatively stable rate environment for the next quarter or two. But that could change if we see trends change, you just commented on the difference in trend, and if that changed, we'd have to react. Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay. Fantastic. Thank you very much. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next questionnaire comment comes from Josh Stirling from Bernstein. Your line is open. Josh Stirling - Bernstein: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the call. So Glenn, I have to ask a question on Snapshot. At your investor day, I think you showed us the sort of a real-time image of your GPS enabled devices floating around Northeast Ohio. And I was curious, it's been a couple of months since then, since you started shipping, and I'm wondering if you get a sense of how it's going? How many units have you shipped with the new chip? What are you finding about customer opt-in rates with this new feature and greater monitoring? And how \u2013 and I think one of the most interesting questions related to this is, how are you tweaking sort of the customer interface and customer facing sort of product offering, whether it's pricing or sort of what data you share with them based on this new information you're collecting? Glenn Renwick : A lot in there. Josh, I think what we showed you was a look into the sort of a way we think in the way we expect to shape our product. Let me suggest you that we will bring out changes more in a product design change as opposed to leaking them out sort of individually. That will happen in a timeframe that is to be determined, I'm not getting on front of myself or some a competitive perspective here but you can be sure that we will let you know when that happens. What have we done since then, the whole idea of sort of big data analysis and what we showed there was not necessarily the types of things that will absolutely find their way into the product but hopefully a good indication of the way we can apply things and match external data sets along with their internal data sets and just totally enrich the whole environment and that is continuing to go very well, very well except for the fact that we seem go always need more servers to put into a Hadoop our cluster and so on and so forth, but I guess that's good news. One thing I did comment on and I want to be very careful not to suggest that these are the leading indicators of product change but recognized that one of the things I'd say with Snapshot is that we were very much like our agents to be able to create a level of penetration amongst consumers, much more consistent with what we think the consumers willingness to accept would be. I will derive my proxy for the consumers willingness to accept based on our penetration and direct. So as we had a chance which is a very rare opportunity for us to enter an agent distribution state where we had not been, Massachusetts in this case. We actually tried some things and the product designers tried some things that not again \u2013 not necessarily reflective of exactly what will come about. But, they wanted to test different hypothesis. And what was interesting is that as one of the problems with Snapshot is that the rate and this sort of goes a little bit to the whole field of comparative rating how things are changing in a way that the rates that is coded may not necessarily be reflective of the rate that the customer actually realizes only a short time thereafter based on driving behaviors. So this pre and post rating variable issue is a very important one I think in that field. But, we gave the agents the opportunity to be able to give some part of a discount. Let's just go with me here because I'm trying to give you information but not play our hand. Let's assume the expected value of a discount is known. We gave some portion of that expected value of the discount as an upfront discount. We all know statistics that means some people are going to get that, some people are going to get more, some people are going to get less. So we actually tried that as a way to see if ultimately the same end result might occur but by shifting part of the discount to the shopping process whether agents' ability to match the penetration of Snapshot consistent with direct, in fact close. And while we have early reads, and I reported on that in my letter. That's something we're very intrigued because we would love to see our agents be able to offer this more consistently with what we think the consumer demand is for it. And, those were sorts of things that you can probably expect to see in future designs in some way shape of form along with the other R&D type of efforts that we gave you a glimpse into in our Investor Day. All the other elements that you can expect from Snapshot, our comfort with segmentation, our comfort with retention. Those things there is nothing dramatic to report since Investor Day but those things are still exactly where we would like to have them. Josh Stirling - Bernstein: That's really helpful, Glenn. Thank you. If I could, I'd ask you another question, not on the Snapshot, but maybe go behind the curtain a little bit. You took an opportunity in your letter to talk about your systems upgrade, that you're 80% done. And, I think you talked about this last time really a couple of years ago maybe when you started. I'm wondering if you could remind us, what exactly the systems upgrade was intending to accomplish, what sort of functionality or new data you could get or flexibility to manage the business. And I think, taking it up to sort of our level, is this something that ultimately leads to like greater capacity for growth? Or should we think about this as an initiative for you guys to reduce your processing or data costs and ultimately drive sort of a higher bottom line? Glenn Renwick : Good. Thanks. Throw it in there, I didn't really think people care too much about the things that are sort of behind the scene, so critical to day-to-day activities for us so expensive and so demanding of our lot of resources. So I'm happy to talk about it a little bit.  Bottom-line is we are \u2013 we like so many companies had a pretty good systems but they were designed in an era where effectively batch processing was the design criteria, that doesn't mean that it is entirely batch, it's been changed and modified over years and everybody has words for that, I'll stay away from them. But, for the most part, we really wanted to take a look at what the future Progressive would like on both the capacity perspective, real-time processing and if you had to choose one major thing, this would be sort of a complete rewrite of everything in to real-time processing as opposed to a combination of things that had been a little bit. The core was never designed that way, and all the art houses around that have been changed to be modern but not necessarily totally consistent. This does provide us some functionality that we never had before, but I think for your purposes that would be pretty boring in terms of date organization of endorsements and so on and so forth. It certainly also brought us into a mode where Progressive where we might have designed and did in fact design system that said, most of what we see are relatively small family units two, three car units. So things with more than five cars or more than five drivers would not necessarily a design criteria, and in fact they were capped. Now we have no such need to cap them, and it's reflective of our business environment. And I'm sure if I was actually on the processing of phones, there are lot of other benefits that are presented in the system. But, if I were you, I would tell you it is one of those things that allows Progressive not to be constrained in the types of things that we're talking about, whether it's mobile, Internet, total real-time consumer interactions and allowing the consumer to be much more a user of our systems where the systems that were designed well over 30 years ago, we're designed with a user that was an employee in mind and a lot of that has been put into this and I don't think I'm overstating it we're really happy with the outcome. It took longer than we expected, it cost more than we expected. I guess that's not new, not new news for systems. The point that I would emphasize is that the risks that are so inherent in a project that takes that long, cost that much, uses that many resources, at least those risk now seem to be largely behind us and the benefits are starting to be accrued both by our customers, our own people and by the ability to design products that are able to take advantage of the futures. Josh Stirling - Bernstein: Great. Well, thank you, Glenn, and we'll stay tuned. Operator : Thank you. Our next questionnaire comment comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Your line is open. Adam Klauber - William Blair : Thanks. I\u2019ve noticed that you've got a greater level of short-term securities than usual. I think the number at June 30 was over $3 billion. As we think about dividends and potential capital return whether share buyback or dividends for the end of the year, will that have an impact on capital return? Glenn Renwick : Brian, why don\u2019t you take that and maybe have Dave comment on that. Brian Domeck :  Sure. I wouldn't link up our investment portfolio composition with our capital return and timing of those things. I think more of the \u2013 we always want to have our portfolios be liquid and diversified and obviously being liquid, helps facilitate things like debt repayments and share repurchases and dividends and the like. But, in terms of keeping that much in terms of our short-term investment is more \u2013 investment portfolio decision as opposed to keeping it for capital management activities. We still have lots of flexibility on the capital management activities and we don't direct, Bill and Dave necessarily to what their investment portfolio composition should be to effect those changes. And Dave if you want to add any color as to what we are holding in short-term investments and why? Dave Benson :  Sure. We had increase in the short-term on the quarter primarily driven by three factors, our debt issuance, and we executed in April. Second, we modestly reduced the duration of the portfolio in the quarter and to effect that, we sold treasuries in most of those proceeds, went into short-term. And ten third, cash from operations, we\u2019re not entirely invested in fixed income or equities, the residual float in the short-term and that's a function of our view on risk and risk premium. Risk premiums are awfully tight and we're exercising patience essentially waiting for a better set of risk return opportunities to develop. Thanks. Adam Klauber - William Blair : Okay. Thanks. And actually, then, could you just comment on how we should think about capital returns for the end of the year? Obviously, did a lot of dividends at the end of the year and, well, beginning of this year, and you had some level of buybacks. As we think about this year, it's reasonable to assume that you could be at the current level or how should we think about it? Thanks. Brian Domeck : It is what I would say. One, capital position is strong. So we have continued to generate capital throughout the year both from an underwriting perspective as well as investment return. So capital position is strong and we added to it by taking advantage of the interest rate environment in issuing that, so capital position is strong. We have sufficient capital to grow the business as much as we can and that's our first quarter of investment in terms of returning and growing the business. What you can count on at least for the end of the year is, one component of our capital management and that's a variable dividend. But, even that, it subject to the constraints that comprehensive income after tax underwriting profit has to be higher than comprehensive income. But, given our position today and positive return of portfolio, we\u2019re well on position to that. That variable dividend, just as a reminder, is one-third of after-tax underwriting profits, then multiplied by the gain share factor. And if you're actually calculate where we are through the end of June, that dividend through the end of June is about $0.31. And that's purely calculable. But, obviously, the second half of the year would factor in both in terms of underwriting profit as well as final gain shares where we'd influence that final dividend. That component of piece we\u2019ve articulated and sourced that. What we do in terms of any other activities like the share repurchases or in the past on occasion we have used special dividends, it's a function of both our aggregate capital position needs in the business, our share repurchases would be our assessment of the market value of our stock versus our own internal assessment of intrinsic value. And if we think it is a good buy, we will make share repurchases, you see those. We don't forecast, we don't say here is how much we're going to buy over the year, obviously you can see each and every month in our news release. And then, if we are the vehicles of capital generation, exceed variable dividend, share repurchases and we still think we have more capital than we could consider a special dividend \u2013 as of right now we have not discussed that. Adam Klauber - William Blair : Okay. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next questionnaire comment comes from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital. Your line is open. Brian Domeck : Before we go to that next question, I want to \u2013 I should correct something, I'd said comprehensive income has to be higher than after-tax underwriting income. I think I inadvertently reversed the order. So I want to correct that before we leave the call. Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital :  Thank you. Glenn, you're talking -- good morning. You're talking in terms of stable pricing over the near-term environment and stable results. The personal ends auto cycle has just been a lot more stable than I\u2019ve seen in my 30 plus year career, where you and Geico and Allstate are earning attractive returns and attractive margins. And, it's sort of an orderly competitive environment, where market share swings aren't that dramatic, and your direct business is growing; your agent business is struggling. And you're, in total, growing slower than you have over your history. Why is this going to change? Do you agree with my sort of characterization of the environment that this is just a lot more stable business than it's been? Are we possibly in an environment where what we see over the next couple months is what we're going to see over the next couple of years? Glenn Renwick :  I think I would largely agree with your characterization except for the last part, I just \u2013 not that I disagree with it, I just don\u2019t know. You've seen this business as long as I have and there are times where frankly you think you're in a stable environment were gone everything from very rapid trend increases to deflation period or a slight deflation in periods. So I don't know, I think what you have to do is step back a little bit and ask sort of two things, what are sort of happening environmentally to the industry that's outside of our control and what are things that we would do ourselves relative to things that are inside of our control from a growth perspective. So I can take your \u2013 I generally agree with your premise and then do that. External, I think we addressed that at least some of the things that have to be on everybody's minds and they are appropriate to be everybody\u2019s minds. The whole vehicle technology cycle I mean do I expect frequency to come down, yeah I do but I also expect that we will see opportunities to ensure things and act differently than probably we can even predict today. So I think there is a strong factor of change that would suggest certain aspects of vehicle technology are going to produce lower accidents, fine. That doesn't scare me as much as I think it scares some other people, I think that will have some consolidating effect on the industry but that's to be determined. What we have to do is think about our strategy and I think our IR meeting was at least a significant portion of that, so a strategy. We want to find ways to almost be disruptive in the rating stability and not necessarily aggregate rate but ultimately lower levels of segmentation and the best address of that and I think the reason that Josh asked the question each time is that by taking data from the vehicle which is directly related to my first comment, the vehicle technology, we think we see Progressive being a leader, we think we're geared up for it, we think it's in our DNA to find ways to segment driving behavior very differently that weren't done before. And, ultimately in a way that is smaller segmentation, more accurate segmentation and quite possibly disruptive and that we believe will play to our advantage. The second major thing that we do that is for growth, we've really outlined in our third era comments and lot of what we are doing now and some of it is at very different stages, so we are far from mature on these types of things. But, as we have grown and you've seen our growth through certain segments of the market we have attained some pretty healthy market shares. Now the grow, we want to grow in other parts of the market place where we weren't historically strong and we're starting now to say to be strong, we need this compliment our product offerings and you know what we're doing there but that's not a little once in a while, we'll do it for a year or two. This is a major repositioning of the company without leaving behind the things that we're already strong on. But there, the growth will no doubt get slower. But when we enter a path of the marketplace that we haven\u2019t been strong, we're been very clear to say we don't have strong market share, don't even have little market share in some cases. We think we will be a very credible offering when we come and are starting to come to market with strong PHA partners, there are opportunities for us to get even stronger in that bundling. We announced the renters product, which is certainly not a premium play, that is a play to primarily get consumers and start to get that attachment point that we believe will be light for a group of customers that were becoming a sort of customer who can stay around for 20, 25 years. So those were our two biggest paths, we could go into more detail but we see our growth opportunities by continuing not to float along as it was yesterday but to challenge the opportunity to segment a much more aggressively and at the same time be able to provide the products that allow us to go deeper into that insurance journey of our customers that are more likely to go into that insurance journey and ultimately become a significant part of the market for the customers that we call the Robinsons. Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital : Well, very thoughtful answer. Glenn, if you -- and, Progressive's competitive position is strong and the returns are great. The one, sort of, missing piece when you roll it all up is the growth angle. And you're growing where you want it, and stable where you want it, but when you roll it all up, Progressive is going to be generating growth numbers that are way below what, historically, the company has given. Does Progressive have the DNA to sort of continue to execute the strategy like you suggest and report mid-single digit top line growth if the environment just stays in a stable scenario? Glenn Renwick : I'm going to say \u2013 answer your question little bit differently. At least as long as I'm in this role, we have the DNA to keep thinking about what the hell it is that's going to drive us to higher growth in the future. I don't panic when the situation is where it is but I sure need answers as to why we will proactively be able to drive and be a catalyst for different numbers in the future and I think we've \u2013 I think we've outlined that, the fact is we're going to grow in fact, we don't have to extract more out of the sectors that we're already strong in, we of course want to keep that at the current or better pace. But, I feel terrific that we're really being an almost a new entry into a 40% part of the marketplace, we're the strong brand, strong product, and starting to associate with the right kind of products that will need to really be able to play in there. Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital : Great answer. Thank you, Glenn. Operator :  Thank you. Our next questionnaire comment comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : Thank you very much. So one question I had if I could. We've talked a bit about growth broadly, maybe drilling down into the agency business. If I recall, you guys took some rate in maybe early part of 2013 to make some adjustments, and we saw new applications fall commentarily which makes sense. And, I think you've talked about that rate activity moderating recently. We haven't really seen the new apps reverse or kind of an inflection in pace in. I'm just wondering, am I reading that right, maybe I'm not, but if I'm not, then maybe you could help me sort of triangulate what I'm missing? Thanks. Glenn Renwick : Yeah. I think I can help there and if I don't and I walk along too long you can redirect. But to Bob's previous those discussion that was more of a longer term so let me flip a little bit to different time view. We even took some rate earlier this year in agency channel in selective states so we are always taking rates so it's very hard to characterize Progressive nationwide versus specific states, but we'll try to do it in a meaningful way. Here is my assessment. I will do current sort of environment, I will do some very short term responses, I will do some what I think are slightly longer-term responses and then to the overall positioning if I can think about it that way. My assessment I wish one of the things I wish I had all through my career is the real ability to know what same store sales were like. I don't know with any real precision exactly what shopping behavior is going on. We have seen, I think extraordinarily well intending proxies and different groups coming out whether its credit reports or internet traffic or whatever it might be sometimes they are even conflicting, but they are all intending, but there is no perfect proxy for shopping behavior. My assessment right now is it's relatively flat in the agency channel. I get there based on the quotes that we are seeing, which are relatively flat. I get there based on comments that we and other have made that they are seeing reasonably favorable retention in their book. So if they are seeing reasonably favorable retention, then you could assume that there is not a increase in shopping behavior. Our sales are down, there is no secret about that and that is if you have to say tactically sort of what you are worried right this second, agency growth no question about it. It's on your mind, it's on our mind. Why that? We are the largest player in that channel. It's well known and two or so of the other large players in that channel clearly confident and want to increase their growth so they have come with new product, new propositions to agents and that's not, that's not the first nor the last time that we'll see it or they will see it from us. So that's the spirit of competition and we know there are things out there. I\u2019m not going to comment on others, but yes it's very clear that we are getting the same number of quotes and we are not getting the same number of sales so it's not hard to do that math. Short-term, we have got some responses; there are some product responses that we'll do not going to go into the little nitty-gritty detail, but there are sorts of things that probably will have some affect. I don't think you will see a dramatic change, but shopping discounts relative to the timing of when someone shops with us, a few situations with age of vehicle. There are things that we can do in a short period of time. There are also some bill plan restrictions that we put on when we saw the market conditions in a couple of state, a little differently in the early part of the year than what we see now so we can adjust those. John Saurland has probably more at the prior meeting by giving your some insight into the fact that we are doing some degree of underwriting filtering and that I bring that out Progressive is much more of a, we find a rate for everybody, but unfortunately not everybody is buying for the purpose of insurance and we want to make sure that we can filter out those. So we've got underwriting filters in and we would say we are relatively pleased with the use of those underwriting filters, but also be assured like everything else they have a sense of evolution, we have to fine tune them and there is some fine tuning that we can do that was some of the short-term actions that we are likely to be able to, did not likely, we will do and on top of that we'll do the one that never seems to fail to work either against us and sometimes even for us. We will provide agents with some degree of incentive to reconsider their positioning with Progressive. So we will do some agent incentives, where it makes sense to do so. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : And I guess the competitive, Glenn you mentioned a couple of other competitors. I mean, are you seeing the impact of competitors sort of reformulating products at a lower price point? Have you seen the impact of that manifest in your, in that sort of quote to bind? Is that what you -- I guess you don\u2019t know for sure, but I mean is that a supposition at least here recently? Glenn Renwick : No. We don't know for sure. We can track at least well if not for sure awfully close. So we will take and let me be very clear here I'd like to talk about Progressive not other companies. We will take a sampling of our distribution of agents with a certain competitor and without a certain competitor and we'll see the growth rates with and without. So and we will look at their results and we will see what their new business production is and recognize with at least the size of ourselves and a couple of other players in that channel if the aggregates not going up then there is a little bit of shifting. So I think I was trying to be very clear there to say that yes we think we are losing some that we were previously getting through actions being taken my others again not the first time or the last time we will see that don't expect us not to fight back gave you some short-term stuff, some long-term stuff and we always talk about this, but we are not as perhaps we don't name them as much as some other companies. Our R&D efforts are always ongoing. We are currently doing things that we will have a new product release, as we continually have product releases that are addressing more of the preferred customer or the Robinsons as we're calling them. We're also doing some things in our customer service environment to make sure that we have customer service that relates well to the let\u2019s say Robinson customers and I already touched on this before, but the renters product that is not something that you can sort of sit and say you will see the results next week, we have rolled it out in Ohio, we're happy. We'll roll it out in Pennsylvania, our PHA will double our agents. So there is a series of both short-term and long-term actions that we will take and not to be too Pollyannaish about it, but we tried to show you at the IR Meeting that we have effectively in that channel the lowest expense ratio. We believe the lowest loss adjustment expense. We believe segmentation and when I say lowest segmentation I said that before, I mean a more detail segmentation, more granular. We in our own assessment don't feel like we give up anything to anybody there. So it's an awfully hard combination to beat with the one caveat on top of all that that we have an expected margin for ourselves and for our shareholders that we don't comprise. But we think we are extraordinarily well positioned on those macro factors for a long time and with the combination of the adjustments, product design. I feel pretty about the future, but there is no question we're losing something in the last quarter and we'll have to see how those sort of things go and we'll quote very openly and honestly in the third quarter, but don't assume we're not conscious of it and trying to do something about it. Brian Domeck : The only other thing I'd add just to give some context, the time period you referenced. We raised rates a fair amount in the second half of 2012 and that was in agency channel. We also did it in some in direct with an agency and that was more on the magnitude of 6% to 7% in the aggregate rate change and that obviously, slowed growth in the last half of 2012. We started to rebound particularly in the agency channel at least on a year-over-year basis in terms of new business growth towards the last half of this year, last half of last year. This year, we've raised rate in agency between 2% and 3%. So it's not nearly the magnitude that we did in 2012. It's keeping up with loss trends, severity trends, et cetera. But in 212, when we raised that much, we also not only saw a decrease in the new business, but we also absolutely hurt our retention. And the 2% to 3% is much more manageable in terms of effect on the retention and while PLEs are growing more so in the direct channel than the agency channel the 2% to 3%, we want to keep rates much more stable as supposed to the large swings, larger swings that happened in 2012. And I think, I think we can accomplish that. Glenn Renwick : Yeah. Just, I guess yeah sorry. Go ahead. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : No, I'm just saying, just the new apps being you kind of flip negative again in the second quarter, despite what would look like kind of easy comps in the second quarter of 2013 so that sort of a piece I was just trying to turn -- because it sounds like all of that makes sense, but it just sounds like you didn't see that, maybe the response that you might have expected from kind of more moderate rate activity in? Brian Domeck : Well, I think, what we did see is, we saw a drop in our conversion, but I think we also saw a drop in conversion more than we might expect just to the other competitor rate activities in the marketplace. So it's not only what we did, but some things that other competitors have done. And as Glenn mentioned it's a competitive marketplace, but long term, we can compete in that market place very, very well. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Great. Thank you. And I'm sorry Glenn. Glenn Renwick : I was just going to throw in something, since we're talking about the agency channel not to forget our commercial presence there, which really is a big help in a lots of different ways even if it's not the biggest chunk of the premium and there I think I tried to comment in my letter that we really have had to take some pricing actions specifically in the for higher segments specialty and so on and so forth. We really have a good outlook on our current price levels. We may have even overreacted in a couple of places relative to some part more of a smaller business auto and contracted segments. We think we've got those all adjusted now so that's also an opportunity to make sure agents are feeling more comfortable with another product from us that has a good rate level and we're looking towards seeing a little bit more growth coming in the commercial sector having gone through a fairly significant adjustment period there. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : All right. Actually that was my -- the only last question I wanted to ask was on the commercial markets. So it sounds like you've taken rate action there. How are you feeling about the action you've taken and whether competitively others are following suit? And are you liking that market in terms of positioning for further growth at this point? Or are you a bit more cautious just kind of given the trends that you've seen recently? And thanks for all the answers; I really appreciate it. Glenn Renwick : Actually I'd give you, the answer is, I'm liking it lot more and if I told you the answer at the end of last year or even into the first quarter, I'd have been more edged on it. We were seeing a fair amount of volatility. We took fairly significant rate action over a reasonable period of time. Any time you take that much rate you've affected mix, you\u2019ve affected all sorts of things. We've gotten into in the second quarter a little bit more of a stable sort of mix. We know what coming in. We realized as I said, we possibly over reacted a little bit in some of the sectors. We've been historically very strong and we've actually taken small decrease there and feeling actually very good as is the general manager and the product managers of the commercial group. And their intent on getting back to where we just historically have been is always a nice profitable grower in the sector. With regard to competitors, there have been good number of comments made. We always had to sort of totally reconcile them. I think we are maybe a little ahead of the pricing actions that others starting to think about taking or have recently taken. Brian Domeck : The other thing I'd mention sort of relative to the commercial lines reserving has been a challenge, but I think we feel much better about our reserve, accuracy and levels now in the last prior to 2014 in the last couple of years, we have had unfavorable loss reserve development in the commercial line so far this year, we had a small amount of favorable development, which is fine. And given that business limits profile etcetera, there is much more volatility in it, but from a reserving standpoint we feel about that and that helps the product management folks, product managers, general managers help in terms of setting the right rate level. So I think we feel good about that. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thank you so much. Sorry for taking so much time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questionnaire coming is from Vinay Misquith from Evercore. Your line is open. Vinay Misquith - Evercore: Hi. Good morning. I have two questions. The first is a two-part question. In thinking philosophically about the agency channel and PIF growth there, looking at your expense ratio of 20% and versus peers I think roughly around the 24 mark. Trying to figure out why Progressive would not be winning more business in an environment of competitive raters because I believe all the business then gets more evenly shopped. So are we missing something? So that's the first part. And the second part is, we've seen a preferred auto company just report with a 2% growth and just so they're getting 2% growth, curious as to why Progressive can't move the dial on the agency side a little bit more? Wondering if it's having a harder time in the preferred segment? Glenn Renwick : I almost have the same question as you do sometimes as why with lower expense ratio, why aren't we winning. Let me just suggest to you without overplaying things that I can't possibly no we do business with many, many thousands of agent I\u2019m sure there are all different issues, but there are commission issues that sometimes help with the placement of business. There are other products that sometimes are influential. So while they have access to the competitive raters I'm not necessarily saying that they are always going to and certainly they would tell me they don't always place at the lowest possible price. What we got to make sure is that we're not only the lowest possible price, which we're not all the time so let's not assume that even though the expense ratio at the macro level gives us that opportunity and over a long time I'd bet on that but certainly when you take segmentation and you take individual price, you're going to see a wide range of prices from carriers in the marketplaces. And the again we are very clear about our margins requirements and I can't speak to others. So the comparative rater is certainly an issue and those with ultimately long term low prices will work, I don\u2019t know that necessarily means necessarily that we or anyone else has to be the lowest we have to provide product that sells. And we believe and we talked about this to some degree, we believe that now we have a commission level that is highly reflective of what we see is the macro cost of acquisition regardless of channel. So we have tried to keep our acquisition cost at least at the macro channel level roughly equal between direct and agency and we think that that's actually long term the best possible thing we could do to allow the agency channel to continually be not only relevant but competitive within the other channel and allow it to be the consumers choice of how they shop. With regard to preferred, with that's just do we think we can move the needle absolutely I mean I said it before in the answer to Bob's question this is an area where it maybe harder for many of you to think but this was not a space that we really, really played in within a great intensity. We\u2019ve taken stock over the last several years, it's not like a one day thing, of what do we need to pull out what do we need to really play, we kind of got many other things right, we started into the specifically the agency channel with a home owners offering that didn't it wasn't the right match and that doesn't necessarily mean anything bad it just wasn't the right match. So we regrouped on that and now we feel after some significant period of evaluation not only do we have the right match we may have just the best possible match that we could find. So our outlook for the preferred in the agency channel, A there is a lot there. B, it's hard to get. C, we didn't really have all the tools now we think we have and just because we have all the tools it doesn't mean we\u2019re going to displace others overnight but I think we're going to give agents a really viable alternative and one of the things you may or may not have heard me talk about is I don't want to go with just the same product that others have. I want to feel like the product is designed to almost is if the consumer was thinking about how a product might be designed. So things like single deductible for property claims that involve the auto, the things like that if we can make a better product and give that to the agent the idea of the fact that it comes from two different distributors that are working very closely together, I don't think will be our -- be an Achilles' heel at all. Vinay Misquith - Evercore: That's helpful. Just a second question. Was wondering if you could comment on recent share sales by top management? Thanks Glenn Renwick : I think that involved me but I didn\u2019t quite catch the question. Vinay Misquith - Evercore: Yes. So there was a significant amount of share sales -- Glenn Renwick : I seriously didn't catch it but I wasn't trying to avoid it. Vinay Misquith - Evercore: I know. Glenn Renwick : Happy to do that. Never fun to sort of talk about yourself, so let me try and give you what I think is the operative issues. We had a situation here mid year and someone else can give you the specifics where we had what I'll call three chances of performance based stock come and do it was actually two but one had a multiplier on it and that motor player was at the max so here I have an event that actually all happened essentially at exactly the same time, I'm not going to be defensive here just give you the facts we may if you go back and look at proxies you'll see I haven't changed by cash compensation and well over 10 or 12 years don't intensive I take everything on a performance basis so I\u2019m paid in equity. Here I got a situation that frankly precipitated with a short note that told me how much I had to pay in taxes and I have consistently kept an extraordinarily high amount of Progressive equity in fact to the point that most people think I am making a big mistake just because it's so concentrated I am extraordinarily happy with that I board all of my options that ever came due over a long period of time. So I had ex amount of shares, I was forced to meet tax obligations to sell something that was the precipitating event. What I decided to do with a little bit more discussion than I had planned was to keep my holdings in Progressive which are over 4 million shares and another 1 million outside or in a unvested situation about level and I think you'll find that what happened with this transaction pre and post my holdings in Progressive were about the same, I want to make one other point just from the issue that this would come up with regard to confidence. By far, the majority of that over 3 million shares 3.2 I think are in a deferred account so that is my commitment that Progressive is going to go strong for a long time after I'm not here and that's paid over 10 year period and is not changeable for any other investment instrument. So I would tell you not to read too much into that frankly I had to sell something to do something I told little more than necessary I decided just to stay stable. I have a requirement from the board to be at about five times my salary, I am looking around to see if that's the right number, I haven't looked at a long time in equity I hold somewhere between 100 and 200% of my salary in stock. Hopefully that's all I need to say about that. Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners : You know, I didn't mean to be disrespectful, but this is \u2013 I mean this really great color, so thank you very much. Operator : That concludes the questionnaire's comment. Glenn Renwick : I didn't mean to shut things down. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Your line is open. Ian Gutterman - Balyasny: For a second there I thought I wasn't making it. I guess, first, Glenn, I guess a couple of follow-ups. The earlier question on BI severity, I was just \u2013 since I looked at your report today comparing your comments about 3% to 4% versus there's and they're about 1% for the half. And I'm certainly not asking you to explain their results, but just curious if you feel that your BI severity is running either higher than may be you have anticipated or higher than industry? Or is there anything that makes you feel that, that should be coming down going forward or that you're struggling with anything? Glenn Renwick : No. Actually, I would actually be happy that someone else is seeing something a little lower, it might be foretelling of the future, it makes in up profile of limits or it's going to be a little bit of a factor there, that's a moderately significant difference. Gary do you have any insight as why that? Gary Traicoff : Yes. We see on our industry data, we see BI severity in the 2.5 to 3 range. So we feel that we're fairly consistent with what we're seeing with respect to the industry. Ian Gutterman - Balyasny: Got it, got it. Glenn Renwick : One thing I didn't comment on in my letter was PIP and PIP can be obviously very important so it\u2019s not BI, but it's the same range or same medically driven issue. And in PIP we're seeing \u2013 we're eliminating sort of comparisons at four to five kind of trend in PIP and probably for those who are close followers, Florida is always a very interesting PIP state and we're starting to see in Florida some of the actions that John Saurland had outlined with regard to underwriting. We're starting to see the frequency of PIP claims that are submitted within the first 60 days actually come to a level that we would think is more normal so we may have actually talked it out the sort of things that are driving PIP, overall PIP cost, it's not severity issue, but the frequency issue, so we're able to keep the price right for everybody who intends to keep the coverage. So generally we're seeing good things in our PIP and as -- Gary nothing extraordinary as we look at our claims auditing process, we're not seeing anything in BI that is overly concerning. Ian Gutterman - Balyasny: Got it. Helpful color. Thank you. On the question on the investment changes, can you tell us what your new money rates are right now? And also to the comment that part of the high cash is, essentially, sounded like waiting for rates to go up, sort of what you would need to see in the environment to make the deploy? Is it just the PIP starting to raise rates? Or is it -- are we a couple hundreds bps away from you guys wanting to deploy that? Just some sort of sense of what make that come down over time. Other than, like you said, the debt proceeds that are kind of a temporary factor? Glenn Renwick : David, why don't you take a shot at that? Dave Benson : Sure. New money investments on the quarter, this would include treasuries and non treasuries. We're in the 2.30 range pretty wide dispersion around that but that's on a fully taxable equivalent basis. And on kind of getting more aggressive in investments, we're absolute in relative value, investors I don't want to prejudge the ultimate destination for rates, but it feels good to take less rate risk here. Economic data and balance has been strong since the first quarter. As we get closer to the end of the fed taper and beginning the rate normalization process the market will begin to discount that reality fairly aggressively I think and risk premiums are non treasuries are awfully tight. And So we\u2019re just being patient waiting for a better set of opportunities. Ian Gutterman - Balyasny: That makes perfect sense. And then, Glenn, if I could throw one more in about marketing ad campaign. I'm just curious, any new thoughts on direction? Does Flo feel tired at all to you? Or I know you've, obviously, experimented with a couple of things over the past two, three years that haven't necessarily taken off. When I think sort of when the large competitors, they seem to sort of \u2013 they get something really popular or push it hard for a few years, and they get off it, and come up with a new thing. You guys haven't really taken that strategy. I'm just sort of wondering if there's any thoughts about that. Whether it be changing Flo or adding something new as sort of second program either way? Glenn Renwick : Somewhat both, Flo we measure you can reasonably imagine and we've shown you some statistics from time to time, but we measure a lot of them, we show you a few. We have no reason statistically to think that Flo is wearing or wearing in a way that is negative. So expect to see Flo for sometime to come. That doesn't mean that you should also expect to see some ads that don't involve Flo and you may see them that are in the same general setting as the Superstore. Think of that as the white background store which sometimes we take a great deal of liberty on and it might show up as a changing airport or a living room. So there is a leverage of brand equity in the Superstore, there is clearly brand equity in the character of Flo. You'll see both of them developed individually and together and you will see some things that are quite different. We did show at the Investor Relations meeting what I'll call is more of a much more of an overlay it's not a scream out and say come by our product right away and that's what we call the thread campaign. The feature is the apron. And again, keep seeing all the brand linkage between Superstore, Flo, the apron as an icon. We tried to do what we call rate suckers which was really a way of demonstrating but in Snapshot you may very well be paying for other drivers and that unless you try Snapshot you don't know that. That campaign was actually okay, it wasn't necessarily break out, but it was okay and it gives us greater confidence as to the type of things we want to move to. The bottom line is Flo and Superstore worked really well. We do not want to make it so one trick pony that we don't have a balance and you will see a balance in our commercials. You also see us take Flo in different directions. But, when you got something that absolutely is working because I can certainly give you another company that use something for quite sometime and continue to get benefit from it. So there is a great deal to be set for a brand that has instant recognition, and in this day and age, I'm probably answering your question longer than you want me to but with so much of TV, other than live sports being watched on a delayed basis, you got to be really conscious of sort of fast forwards. And when you got sort of iconography, color, those sorts of things absolutely matter and we want to make sure that people know that we're out there advertising and wanting their business. So we're actually quite happy, expect to see Flo, expect to see other things as well as we will never want to get to a point where we are not well-prepared should something show in different consumer reactions if Flo and Superstore we're not to resonate as well. We clearly will not be waiting for that time to develop new ideas. Ian Gutterman - Balyasny: This may be a suggestion, Glenn, as much a question, but I guess what I was kind of pondering was as you're trying to move from sort of Diane's to the Robinson's, Flo, maybe, is more of a Diane-type campaign, and I wondered if there needed to be something new, whether it be new characters or if I can be cheeky, Flo gets married and becomes a Robinson or whatever it might be. But, something that's sure to signal that second track of the company you're trying to launch? Glenn Renwick : We'll take all ideas. We just not going to pay for them per se if that's okay. Ian Gutterman - Balyasny: That's okay. All right. Thank you so much guys. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields - KBW: Thanks very much for fitting me in. I just wanted to follow-up, to get a sense of the really, really strong underwriting profits in commercial lines over the past few months and how that's likely to play out in near-term? Glenn Renwick : Yes, they have in fact, I think the easiest statement there is the rate increases that we took really did stick. So what I mean by that is you can take rates, but if doesn't ultimately flow through to your average earned premium, then it hasn't really stuck and you've driven away customers and so on and so forth. So we've been lucky enough to actually see those rate changes flow through to average earned premium and losses have come, those that are not with this and those that we didn't think we had the right price for, they're not with us and the losses are much more in line with what we expected. And, as I said earlier, we may be at the top end of what price we need for that sector and this we expect good profits from commercial, let's not be bashful about that. We're probably seeing something right now that's certainly on the good side of norm. Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporations Investor Relations Conference Call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. The company will not make detailed comments in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q, quarterly report to shareholders and letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website, and will be -- and will use this conference call to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the call will be Matt Downing. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. Downing. Matt Downing : Thank you, Caroline, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Progressive's conference call. Participating on today's call are Glenn Renwick, our CEO; Brian Domeck, our CFO; and Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer. The call is scheduled to last about 1 hour. As always, our discussions on this call may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and they are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during this call.

That document can be found via the Investors page of our website, progressive.com. Caroline, we are now ready to take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just one question, Glenn, to start out. You kind of talked about the personal book outside of auto and that was running at a comfortable margin -- it implied it was running at a comfortable margin, can you go into a little bit more detail in terms of what you're seeing out of the non-personal auto book and what we should expect from that as you continue to likely grow that business? Glenn M. Renwick: Michael, you're referring to the special lines business? Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Correct. Glenn M. Renwick: Yes, okay. There's 2 outside of auto. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : [indiscernible] not commercial, yes. Glenn M. Renwick: The special lines business, as you know, is just a great business for us and this year -- every year has always got a story with it. This year, it was just a little bit surprising in the sense that the loss ratios ran a little softer, more favorably to margins, pretty much through the entire seasonality of the line. So it's really hard to sort of put a single issue, sometimes weather makes a really easy explanation. But I would just say there we actually had some nice favorable margin results. We don't necessarily think those will be reproduced. We feel good about our pricing, but it certainly also gives us the opportunity to be more stable with those rates going into next season. And as I indicated in my letter, while we're very, very happy with the business, we still think we can actually grow it a little faster than we've been growing the last couple of years and we've got the right rates to do that. So overall, it's just a really good story there. I'm not sure if I'm addressing your question. Commercial is a different story. And I think this is one where perhaps a little bit more what I'll call a classic play, at least we try to make it a classic play from Progressive. We get ahead of rate at least as early as anyone in the marketplace, we think. And commercial clearly started to see some trends, and John Barbagallo gave you some insight to that at the investor relations meeting some of which, frankly, we did some misses on. So we got a lot of that cleaned up in late '12, mostly in '13, with some rates, some better understanding of some underwriting requirements. And it was for that period in time mostly all hands on deck to get the profitability back to where we needed to, so we didn't get out of control there. That's rarely happened. And to some extent, as you can see in the results, that profitability has come back very nicely. We're very comfortable with that. There's probably a very few places we're not interested in pricing away the margins that we have unless there's some very good reasons do it. But there's probably some areas in our traditional sweet spot of commercial auto, which would be business auto and contractors, where we've actually got some results that we think there's room for movement there to be able to get a little bit more growth into the season coming up as we start to get into the new year. And we're making adjustments as necessary, but they're pretty much fine-tuning type of adjustments. The bigger issue on the competitive outlook there is that at least our view, what we see is the market is starting to harden. So the price actions that we took in anticipation of many of the real trends -- yes, we made a couple of mistakes as well, but many of the real trends that we price for seemed to be emerging for others. And for us, that has resulted in a stronger third quarter and we hope that will continue into the fourth and first with regard to unit growth. So the outlook on commercial really is just to fix the problems and now it's actually nice tuning and getting ready for some growth and frankly it's a good part of our business, an exciting one. Special lines is under great control. We just like to grow it a little bit more. We think we've got the rate level to enter next season set very well. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And then, I guess talking about the agency channel a bit. I know you made a few comments in your letter. What about Snapshot there? I mean, I know you've got 1 stated lease where you making some headway, but is it possible to offer like a reward or something to the agent specifically for integrating Snapshot? I would think that from their perspective that price is going to be very competitive for the drivers that select that product. I'm just curious, what efforts have you made or what changes have you made this year? Or do you anticipate to try and address either via Snapshot or outside that you haven't already undertaken or you hadn't undertaken in the past? Glenn M. Renwick: Good. I appreciate that question. Yes, I did make some comments so there shouldn't be any ambiguities to how I feel about the reductions that we have seen in new business applications in the agency field. And while words are just words, the most important one is we should never be underestimated there. We have a lot of changes that we're planning to make, and I did state they won't change overnight. Let me focus on the Snapshot. I want to make sure I answer your question. And I'm going to tell you, ahead of time, I'm going to be a little more obtuse than I like to be, simply because we're hitting at a time where we're just starting to come to market and explain to others. So this is not the format to do that about the change. But I've indicated I think in at least maybe the last call and in my letter that we took some changes into the Massachusetts marketplace with Snapshot, and I'm referring specifically to agencies here, and the impacts were very favorable to us. We will release a new version of Snapshot that will be released into the marketplace late this year. December 5 is the first entry and then into next year. Now let me just spend a little time on that because I think it's important. With the amount of data that we've been able to get, now approaching 12 billion miles, we're able to do something that I consider very, very important. We're able to clearly confirm that it is an explanatory variable that can't have a proxy from 3 or 4 other variables. However, we can start to create a reasonable estimate of certain groups that we would expect to get a discount. And to the extent that we can approximate groups that we would expect -- in this case, the expected value of the discount to be within a range, we are prepared statistically to move that forward in the point of sale process. And that is largely a big part of the design that will help agents ultimately have an even more attractive price at point of sale for those people that we think will benefit from the specific driving experience as we relate that. Again, it's an independent variable and explains things on its own, but we can do those true-ups. But we will be able to make intelligent estimates based on the data that we've got today of trying to move that further forward in the process. I'm not going to say a lot more about that until we've had a chance to sort of roll that out and talk with agents and others that are affected in that process, but it's pretty exciting. So while we always knew the discount was there, it's even more exciting to be able to say, \"I think, within some reasonable certainty, I can actually give you part of it now and part of it later.\" And that sort of hedges you back. And there's a true-up process, that can happen if it's not perfect out of the gate and we're not suggesting that it'll be perfect out of the gate, but that's the purpose of having the 6-month monitoring period. That will, in my opinion, change a great deal of receptivity for the agent. So it's a little different than your suggestion of perhaps incenting the agent. Ultimately, we think, long term, the better price to the consumer is what ultimately wins in this environment. It's what the agents want, what we want, it's what the consumer wants. So we'll work primarily from that perspective. Although from time-to-time, we will do things that create a little incentive program. We've actually just come up one in the summer for our agents and those are not out of the question. But it's not what I'll call a primary play. Operator : Our next question or comment is from Cliff Gallant from Nomura. Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Holdings, Inc.: I wanted to ask about the jump you saw in PIP. In the 2013 10-Q I think was a 17% jump. Do you have any insight as to what might be driving that? Glenn M. Renwick: Yes, let's -- maybe, Gary and Brian will provide a more detailed insight into that. It's absolutely correct to see that jump off the page in the Q. It was put there to give you, certainly, a first indication of the volatility of this type of a coverage. I think we've discussed that on many occasions. I will say that this one is going to be just a little tricky to totally explain because as you know, Florida, only a year or so ago was implementing House Bill 119. There are some changes there. As the market evolves, as our procedures evolve relative to what's in emergent medical care. Obviously, the real obvious ones are broken bones, lacerations, emergency room and so on and so forth, we're fine. But there are some others where it's not as clear. So those things are settling down in the marketplace and it may be that the denominator last year was a little different than what the real run rate would be. So again, percentages can be misleading. Michigan had a rough third quarter from a weather perspective and probably had a slight difference in trend in that quarter than it's had for the year-to-date. And all I'm doing here is just meant to -- we'll always tell you what we see. But in this case, it's a convoluted picture and it very much commands our attention. But maybe Gary and Brian collectively can you give you a little bit more insight into the actual trends. Brian C. Domeck: Yes, this is Brian. I'll try to give a little bit more color and then Gary can fill in if necessary. I think there's -- I will try to break it down into various component pieces. Certainly, as Glenn mentioned, on a quarter-over-quarter basis last year, we actually had recorded that PIP that was variable was down 4% which is sort of not necessarily the norm for the PIP coverage to see some areas going down, but some of that was driven certainly by the regulatory changes in Florida. But last third quarter was a lower-than-norm severity. Another component piece is some of the aggregate PIPs of areas explained by geographic mix differences and the PIP coverage varies greatly by individual state. The limits are not the same, et cetera. So geographic mix composition makes up some of it. And for example, we are growing more in -- and faster in Downstate New York area, Southern Florida, and also in Michigan, all of which those geographies tend to have higher severities within their -- Michigan, just in general, and then those geographies within those states. So some of it is explained by geographic mix changes and where we're growing and then what you may call sort of the underlying severity trends. And it varies actually, again, a little bit by jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, we are seeing more billings per feature. And in a few of those jurisdictions, we're actually seeing the charge per billing going up. We think the aggregate of those sort of underlying severity changes is more in the 7% range, so higher single-digit ranges. And that certainly has our attention and is higher than recent trends, but that is how I would sort of describe the various components. Some of it is low denominator, some of it is geographic mix, and then some is the base underlying what we would call base underlying severity trend. It differs a little bit by jurisdiction, but certainly, anything going up of that magnitude has our attention and we continue to dissect it. Product managers for the individual states as well as claims organizations in those states are paying great attention to it, and we're ready to react if we were to see these trends continue. But I wouldn't say 17% is the underlying severity cost. I would say the underlying severity costs are more in that 7% range, high single digits, and even that is high. So it certainly has our attention. And I think the 7% more closely probably approximates more our pace of severity trends that we're seeing in PIP. That's how I'd characterize it. Gary, if there's anything you want to add or? Gary Traicoff : This is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. I just think Brian gave a nice summary. So nothing to add to that other than we think probably that 7% range is kind of what our true underlying cost is. William M. Cody: So those long-term followers of Progressive, the one thing that certainly has been a consistent statement we've always made is that PIP can truly be volatile and while the run rate might be considerably less than 17% and it's all a matter of your starting point, all that sort of stuff. This certainly was a, not so much a wake-up call because we're always watching it, but it certainly one that we'll be watching a great deal because PIP can get volatile quickly. Brian C. Domeck: Yes. And just since we're on the topic of PIP, I would say, the other thing to note is that while PIP frequency and aggregate PIP is down, there are some jurisdictions, principally Florida, where we are starting to see an increase in PIP frequency and that covers all the geographies throughout the state for the most part. So PIP is very much a state-by-state view and different sort of outcomes in each of those states. But Florida, from both the frequency going up as well as seeing severity going up as well as some of the changes that are in the marketplace as a result, House Bill 119 in Florida very much has our attention these days. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : I think you did a great job of being accurate but obtuse on the first question about your Massachusetts product, but I wanted to ask you a couple of follow-ups, if I may, on that. So it sounds like that we're going to get a new version of Snapshot starts going in December 5. When do you think we should -- when should we expect it to be rolled out nationally? Is it -- are these going to be agency-only changes? Or do they go into direct? And I'm wondering, I mean, I recognize you're going to be circumspect about this, but what can you tell us about what you'll be looking for, say, for this, your quote volume and close rates for making a switch to the product? Glenn M. Renwick: Yes. Let me see if I can hit most of those. Both channels. So the changes would reflect both channels. Some of the changes are the sorts of things, and you certainly have had at least as much interest in this as anyone so you'll appreciate it. The algorithms are always, always maturing. In fact, I will be obtuse here in terms of what we're looking at. But I sort of get -- it just feels really cool to me that we're now able to look at things that sort of would have seemed just totally ridiculous to think about few years ago. The kinds of things that we can see in the data, the regularity of certain behaviors that we wouldn't necessarily have even dreamed about a few years ago, we now actually can see and test those hypothesis. So the algorithm is just getting richer. That will be consistent in both channels. To the extent that we have already experienced a very different take rate in direct and agency, what I'm hoping for is that moving the -- or some part of the discount further forward will have a more dramatic effect in agency than it will in direct. I may be wrong on that, it may have equal effect in both channels, but for me the biggest thing is that it does have some effect in the agency channel. That's what we'll be looking for. So from your continuous study of this, you should be thinking about this as how are we maturing the product based on data. Because some of the things we could have done a long time ago but you wouldn't have nearly the certainty that you're headed in the right direction based on the data that we have today and then just the continuous evolution of our algorithm which will only continue to get richer as we put in even more features, including GPS into the Snapshot device which we have -- they had previous experience with but will actually use that more aggressively in the next several years. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : That's helpful, Glenn. Separately, I wonder if you can give us an update how you guys are thinking about your many... I'm sorry, go ahead. Glenn M. Renwick: I'm sorry, I missed your first -- the rollout will be starting in December, but first quarter will pick up momentum for many states and then we'll just keep the rollout going. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Oh, great. I thought I was going to have to ask that one offline. So if -- just a quick one. Give us your thoughts on your mobile strategy as it relates to Snapshot. Obviously, there's a major competitor of yours who's now making a bit more noise about their 16 states. They have a mobile product UBI app launched. We all know you guys have had a beta test of the Snapshot iPhone app, but I don't think we've seen anything -- seen you guys launch anything widespread. And I guess, I'm curious, if you could help me understand, is this a sign of you guys making a different technology bet? Are others getting ahead in the sort of the arms race here? Or should we just stay tuned? Glenn M. Renwick: No, I can comment a little bit on that. Obviously, the chip is a great way to be sure that it's that vehicle and so on and so forth and we're much more comfortable with that as a reliable data set. I think I've said on numerous occasions, I would be just as happy to get out of the business of plugging things into cars. That's not really an integral part of our business. And as cars become moving IP addresses, that will happen. And we are very much, as you would -- could reasonably assume, very much in sync with the manufacturers that are making those kind of changes so that we will be there when that's available. But being out of the dongle business, that's okay by me. The interim of a iPhone or Android device, yes, you're right, we've had that. We obviously, therefore, match it against other data that we feel is reliable and we continually try to find something that we would be as comfortable that the proxy data from a device that may or may not be in the car at the time. It's the same device that's in your pocket when you're landing an aircraft. You're going to get data, but it won't relate to the driving experience. So it's not quite as simple as it would seem. And now we also have other vendors that we've invited to actually participate in a, I would say, a bake-off a little bit to see who can actually do even better than we may have done. So we're very interested in mobile devices. We are not sort of folding the tent on that one, but we're also not going to go with something where we think the approximation to data isn't as good as what we can get barring another source. When that threshold is crossed at some reasonable point, that would be another arrow in our quiver, so to speak. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from James Engle from John W. Bristol & Co. James Allyn Engle - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.: My question is on policy life expectancy. It looks like for 12 months, agent was flat and direct was up 6%. And for 3 months, agent was down 6% whereas direct was up 1%. Could you give us some color on that? And also, could you weave in what's going on with Progressive Home Advantage? Brian C. Domeck: Yes, I'll first give some color on the PLEs and then I'll turn it over to Glenn to describe what's going on in the PHA program. You're right in terms of the numbers and the changes. We're seeing PLE growth continued in the direct channel and starting to see some degradation in the agency channel. It used to be that direct and agency PLEs were roughly about the same and now the direct channel has a few months higher average PLE than the agency channel is. And some of the degradation we'd see in the agency channel relates to a decrease in some of our renewal rates and some of that has been more recent, so that's why it's showing up more in the trailing 3 months rather than the trailing 12-month measure I'd indicated in May, that the 3-month uses more recent data. And I would say a lot of the change or a fair amount of change in the agency PLE is due to actually a little bit decrease in our renewal retention rates whereas we've seen some in the direct channel but not nearly as much. And part of why -- one of the things that is helping with the direct channel PLE is we continue to get more of our policies to have more than one product, and in fact that's a lot of strategy of the PHA program and the bundling there, and we're continuing to grow the percentage of policies in both channels that have that. But obviously, we're growing more in the direct channel. Glenn might want to share some more details about what's going on in the PHA? Glenn M. Renwick: Sure. I think there's maybe 5 points to touch on since most of you know the broad details there. It's all about getting multi-policy households and that is effectively continuing to go up. These are not massive increases on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but it's a great trend and we're very happy with that. We did add our 12th carrier to our PHA program in the last quarter and probably more important than any of those things is ultimately the issue of are we really bundling. So it's one thing to sell a product, but the real question is we were trying to sell bundles of home and auto, and the best measure of that probably we get the cleanest measure from our direct channel. And you could just think about 3/4 of the home and auto are bundled together of those customers. So while we will sell a home policy or a renter's policy, and it may not be with the auto at same time or vice versa, about 3/4 of those policy holders are households ultimately end up bundling. Now the development that will discontinue to take on more and more strength would be our in-house agency where we have relationships with some of the carriers that we offer a homeowner's product to our customers. I'll touch renters in a second, because that's a little bit different. We have, historically, been able to do that in an online mode or perhaps we will actually refer in some cases a customer back to our partner and their call center. We are now adopting more and more holding the quoting relationship inside Progressive and being able to make sure that we use the breadth of companies that we represent. If it's not possible on online mode, then we'll have an in-house agency that will be able to provide the best product. And it may not be as one-to-one, it may be that we have the whole resource of the 12 carriers available or some number of those 12. So the in-house agency is proceeding and growing. And the fifth point I'd make in that arena is the renter's product that we've just taken to marketplace. I think I've said, if I haven't then I'll say now, our aspirations on renters are not about significant premiums, but really getting people stickier with us and having that second product be a very valuable product at an earlier part of their insurance cycle that ultimately leads to the PHA. So we were happy. There's not a lot to report on the renters at this point in time. I think we'll have a lot more to say when we get together in our IR meeting in mid-year next year. Good stuff across the board. And it's still I probably should say it's certainly a place where growth rates for our PHA-type program, which typically is highly aligned with more preferred, growth rates barring excess of anything you see printed as the aggregate. So this is a significant growth part of our business. James Allyn Engle - John W. Bristol & Co., Inc.: Is ASI still the only carrier with agents? Glenn M. Renwick: Correct. Yes, with agents it gets considerably trickier to have more than one. But more importantly than that, we have just a terrific relationship with ASI, and are very happy with them and will continue to work with them. And there are probably things that we, again, we can talk about this time or our IR meeting next year, but there are opportunities for us to do some things with ASI that I think would be quite exciting. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : A year ago, we were talking a lot about medical cost inflation and the effects of the reforms there. Now it's a ways out, are there any lessons learned? Did we see anything that affected -- in your medical cost trends, that were affected by those reforms or did it become just sort of a nonissue? Glenn M. Renwick: Paul, I'm going to refer this to -- there's a couple of folks in the room. So I don't see anybody with a hand in the air with something important to say. So I think that -- and I mean that in a light way, I think that there's nothing that we can sort of pull out that says, \"Hey, here is the one thing you can take away from the accountable care act and how its trickled through to our costs. And if you look at the very macro level, while I'm sure on a couple of calls maybe earlier this year I've talked about BI trend which is one that I tend to watch a lot more, maybe 3 to 5. I think you might strengthen that 4 to 6, but I don't know that we can relate that to the accountable care act or any form of reform. The bigger issue that Brian went into in some detail in PIP, I don't think you can sort of relate that to the medical card. That's much more specific to the individual state issues. So I would say nothing dramatic and any small effects, they're never going to be noticeable or detectable. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from Vinay Misquith from Evercore. Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Just want to follow up on the homeowners on the agency side. Glenn, why, in your opinion, do you think that the traction is not as strong bundling products on the agency side? And so is it that the branding of the homeowners needs to be better? Do customers prefer, I mean, a joint highly-branded product for the homeowners and the auto together, or is it something else? Glenn M. Renwick: No. I think we've just got some opportunities to really make our bundle work even better than it does today. So the acceptance with some agents is actually very strong. There's no question. This is a place where, unlike most things, we're the ones that are coming into the market a little bit later than some established carriers. But we've got to break in and we've got to make our presence meaningful. I think we've got every ability to do that, but that's not going to be one that we turn around instantaneously. But I would say actually we're gaining with agents on a regular basis and I sort of alluded, and that's all I'm going to do at this point, I think there's a lot more that we can do with ASI to really make our products very attractive as an even more integrated bundle. I like to think of this as not so much 2 products, but starting to sort of present at least to the consumer that this is just the insurance you need. It's sort of our problem to figure out which part of it falls into which line of insurance. And the more we can do that and make this a more viable consumer proposition, I think that's going to be our strength to market and strength with the agents. So being a little bit circuitous on your answer, I don't see any major roadblock there. In fact, agents have accepted this, consumers have accepted it. We need agents to accept it even more willingly. And I think the biggest issue there is they have options. And many of those options are good options. So let's just be realistic about that. We need to come to market with continuously better ones. Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Sure. And do you think the commission rate for the agents is maybe a stumbling block? And would you consider raising the commission rate for the agents? Glenn M. Renwick: Yes, it's a little bit of a stumbling block only in the sense that others will pay more, and not so much that we think we're wrong and there are 2 parties to pay the commission. While I'm not going to get out over our skis too much, what we can consider other options, everything can be on the table as we think about a bundle that comes to market where we really, really want to play in this marketplace, but assume that, that will be part of something more comprehensive as opposed to just a tactical reaction to market commissions. Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : And the last thing, just a follow-up. On the order side, you're doing pretty well in terms of margins. Curious as to whether you see the PIP growth issue as a margin issue whereby you can maybe lower price a little bit? Or do you think it's more to do outside of margins and therefore you would rather just keep your margins where they are? Glenn M. Renwick: We have our target margins. We're very clear about that. You know what those are and when we do better than that, that's good. We acknowledge it. The thing that is always tricky and very easy to see from a macro level is why don't you turn the switch and put it a little bit here, increase growth is not quite that simple. I would just tell you, you should assume that, I for one, am not willing to give away margin unless there is a more than proportionate growth to be had. But in general, as we've said all along, we want to grow as fast as possible at or better than our target margins. So while we're reporting sort of 92 and change year-to-date and for the quarter, we've also given you some indication that there are some trends and severity that are starting to outstrip the frequency declines. So for me, my general outlook and this is very general because states are specific, we have a rate level that can stay in place for a while longer without dramatic change. And that's always a good thing for a consumer versus up and down. So I think we're well positioned as we go into the remaining part of this year, and most importantly, well positioned for the bigger season in the first quarter next year. Operator : Our next question or comment is from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : You mentioned that your biggest business opportunity is in the Robinsons consumer segment with bundled products. I just wonder, given the development in the reinsurance market was alternative capital coming in, have you considered that actually putting homeowners business on your own balance sheet that you can actually transfer some of the volatility while sort of basically growing your customer base? Glenn M. Renwick: Kai, not directly. And while if we would ever do something like that, you could reasonably assume there would be fair amount of reinsurance, I also don't overly pick a strategy based on markets that are available today but may or may not be at a different point in time. We will always consider our long-term strategy of being a destination insurer there will almost unquestionably be things we will do over the next several of years. But I'd much rather tell you what those are when we do them. But I wouldn't be jumping to any conclusions about writing homeowners in our paper. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, that's great. Then on capital management, if you consider you have operating earnings about $900 billion -- $900 million each year and then how much of that would you say you need to retain for your future business growth versus than what's priority for the variable annual dividends or special dividends this year? Glenn M. Renwick: I'll let Brian take that one. Brian C. Domeck: In terms of how much do we need for growth, we try to target insurance underwriting companies at a 3 :1 premium-to-surplus ratio. In most jurisdictions we have that ability. We also have some additional capital at some noninsurance companies. But for the premium growth that we're talking about, and let's call it $1 billion a year or slightly more than $1 billion dollar a year, you might need $400 million of capital for the growth, $350 million or $400 million for the growth at that 3 :1 sort of ratio. Then obviously, in terms of our capital management structure, we have the variable annual dividend which is certainly formulaic and it's 1/3 of the aftertax underwriting profit times our gain share. So that amount for the variable dividend obviously can change each and every year based upon both the underwriting margin as well as the gain share factor. I can just let people know as of September month end, if you were trying to calculate what the variable dividend through 3 quarters is, based upon our underwriting profit and our gain share factor, it would be about $0.49 per share based upon 2 or 3 quarters of activity. Obviously, we have the fourth quarter underwriting profit to go and the gain share factor will be finalized in December. But you can calculate the magnitude of the variable dividend based upon that. But those 2 components, the growth, $350 million to $400 million plus the variable dividend, which can change every year. And then, after that, then we have the opportunities for both share repurchases. And so far this year, we've repurchased around $235 million worth of shares. And then, we still believe our current capital position is strong but we feel good about that. It gives us opportunities that we choose to in terms of continuing the share repurchases and then consider other alternatives. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Just finally, what's your cash -- holding company cash utilization at quarter end? Glenn M. Renwick: Bill, the picky assets at the end of the third quarter were $1.3 billion? William M. Cody: Yes. Glenn M. Renwick: And that can act just like cash but the assets held out at picky are $1.3 billion. Operator : Our next question or comment is from Mike Zaremski from Balyasny. Michael Zaremski : My first question is on the expense ratio. If I look, it's been slowly but surely turning down over the years and I'm aware if we go back many years the ratio has been at 20% before, but can you elaborate on what's been driving this reduction so we can better understand if it's -- it can continue or potentially reverse? Glenn M. Renwick: Sure. Brian, jump in on this one, as well. I think, as we talk about the expense ratio, let's break at least for direct, or well for both I think is fine, into 2 pieces : acquisition and non-acquisition expense ratio. I think that's an important distinction to make. Acquisition, as you know, for agency is primarily commissions and we've been stable there for some period of time. Don't expect any major changes there. So that's a function really of earned premium. And on the direct side, we will spend, and we've gone through this discussion several times, we will spend what makes most sense relative to the yield that we see. So yes, that could go up faster than our premium under certain circumstances, but that would be based on good business judgment. The non-acquisition expense ratio you should reasonably assume has a great deal of management oversight that says we would need a really good reason to grow any expense faster than earn premium. So we should be able to continue to keep our expense ratio very much in the levels that you're seeing, at least, on the non-acquisition expense ratio. Something like benefits, not quite as controllable and may not necessarily be a direct function of earned premium, but we can control things like salaries, headcounts, certainly premium taxes, those sorts of things. So while you've seen that go down over time, that's been a very deliberate action for us to get to something closer to the run rate expense ratios that you're now seeing on a pretty consistent basis and that the trend being a favorable trend. The biggest change that we will likely be able to bring about in our expense ratio will be continuing to increase policy life expectancy and having more and more of our customers with multiple products. That denominator effect, if you like, or scale effect, is the one that will give us the next quantum. But the active management, which has been going on for some time, to control non-acquisition expense ratio has frankly been extremely positive and got us to a level that we feel very comfortable is sustainable. But for some really exogenous event like benefits costs or something like that which is not likely to move the needle significantly anyway. Brian, anything in that...? Brian C. Domeck: No. I think just a conscious focus internally to try to keep what we call the non-acquisition costs growing at less than earned premium growth. And I don't think we're going to change that view or philosophy any time soon. I think it's going to continue to be a focus. We know that has an influence on the competitiveness of our rates in the marketplace, which ultimately is how we win. So I think we've done a nice job in recent years. And I don't think there's going to be any letup in there. As Glenn mentioned, the advertising and how much you spend on advertising is a function of how much we think we can spend relative to the yield. And on that front, if we see greater and increased opportunities, we'd be more than willing to send more money on the advertising side and that requires us to keep a focus on all those other costs which we are and we'll continue to do that. Michael Zaremski : On the ad spend, are there any separate trends there in terms of ad spend getting more or less expensive kind of an absolute basis when you occupy the Internet or Internet ad spend with Facebook and Google versus the TV networks. Is there anything at play there? Glenn M. Renwick: Well, certainly in terms of our media mix, it certainly is changing in terms of more of the increase in advertising spend, would be more web-based, social media, et cetera, versus maybe TV per se, although TV still is a very, very large component of our media mix. And I would just say that, in general, we continue to see cost per impressions, CPMs, that media outlets charges continually going up a little bit. And I don't see that necessarily going down, but that's more of a function of supply and demand in the marketplace, but currently certainly CPMs are going up -- still going up a little bit. Michael Zaremski : Okay, great. And lastly as a follow-up, Glenn, to you commentary about, if I understood it correctly, you're offering certain agency customers a discount based on data you've learned from Snapshot, what percentage of the population of the drivers could the discount you're speaking of pertain to? I know you want to be reserved, but just hoping to get a sense of whether that could impact a large or small population of your agency quotes. Glenn M. Renwick: Actually, the discount will apply to both direct and agency. I just indicated that I think it'll have a little bit more of a marketable effect in the agency environment. So just to clarify that. I'd call it large because it just won't be the same discount for every customer. So there's that kind of notion I went through earlier of expected value. So there will be a large percentage of customers be able to get some form of discount advanced through the point of sale. And in some cases, it might be a larger discount. In some cases, it's smaller. But the number that will likely get some part of the expected discount advanced will actually be significant. And we see numbers far in excess -- and you've sort of seen this, we're not giving out the exact numbers but our indications are that far in excess of 50%, 60% sort of individuals are deserving of the discount that only Snapshot and driving behavior can identify. So those haven't changed. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : How are you dealing in a low interest rate world from an investment perspective? If I look at your 10-Q, this may be totally unrelated, but it looks like you sold governments and munis in the quarter and rerisked in corporate RMBSs, in particular AMBSs, which is consistent with the sort of the opposite direction of how they moved in the second quarter, third quarter, so it makes some sense. But is the strategy to rerisk to get more yield, do you think rates are going to stay low for longer than maybe you would articulate it at the last couple of meetings in public? Where are you on the investment portfolio overall? Glenn M. Renwick: Sure. Bill, why don't you take that? William M. Cody: Yes, sure. The strategy stays the same as far as trying to protect our capital and focus on total return. And as you've pointed out, during the quarter, we do make moves in the portfolio that are based on value. So we added some ABS, some short ABS which used some cash and some short treasuries for us because they offered us a little bit better yield and a lot of safety. So not high-yielding assets but better than cash and short treasuries. Munis, we sold a little bit because they had runs really far and for us, as a corporate taxpayer in some instances, we're able to sell them at relatively flat yield to the Treasury, so if you can sell a credit product at almost Treasury yields, you should do that. And the corporate market where we sold earlier in the year is that same sort of situation where spreads have tightened pretty sharply to the point where, in some cases, they didn't represent good value to us. We reversed that a little bit in the third quarter as spreads widened particularly in the high-yield market where we're able to add some paper at, we thought were attractive spreads. So unfortunately, we have to operate in the market that we're operating in. What we're trying to do is keep it in the fairway and maintain flexibility. Where we find some opportunities, we'll put some money to work. And where we find some opportunities to sell, because pricing has gotten, in our point of view, way too aggressive, we'll sell. On the duration front, yes, we do think that rates will rise. I think the U.S. economy is doing well. And the Fed just announced yesterday that they will end their 2-week program now and -- or at the end of the month and there's a lot of speculation as to whether or not they raise rates in the third quarter or fourth quarter next year. And that, whether it's one quarter or another is less relevant to us than the overall direction. And our view is that rates will go up as the economy does better and we'll have a better opportunity to spend duration and take some duration risk and get paid a little bit more for doing that. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : How long have you had that view that rates are going to go higher, Bill? William M. Cody: It's been a long time. Now it didn't pay off for us last year but, yes, it's been a while. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Now it seems like your tactical moves have been really good particularly in the equity side, but the view, I mean, you're with the consensus that rates are going higher and that hasn't seemed to work, but you're going to stick with that position from here. And the last question is to what extent does your view on interest rate layer into the actuary's view on less cost severity. I mean, is there an integrated strategy on the asset liability side of the balance sheet on what inflation could it be? Or do you operate more independently, which is the case for most insurance companies? Gary Traicoff : This is Gary, Chief Actuary. We operate more independently. We're truly looking at the medical and the inflation cost would come in. Obviously, everybody knows what interest rates are, but we're really kind of independent of that. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : So on the liability side, you could have a view that inflation won't be that bad, isn't consistent with the investment side if possible. I mean, I know you're looking at a more micro level than Bill is, but they do interact to some extent. Gary Traicoff : Yes, what we're going to look at countrywide, obviously, medical costs, CPI costs, things like that. So that does come into play somewhat, but not necessarily what the interest rates are doing. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Brian C. Domeck: This is Brian. I just want to clarify, at least, maybe some of my earlier statements relating to capital and how much capital is required. I referenced $1 billion of premium growth, that's approximately what our premium growth has been in the last year. So use that as an example as opposed to saying that's actually what our premium growth will always be. I used that as an example, so I just want to clarify that one. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from Arash Soleimani from KBW. Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Just had a follow-up question on the Florida PIP comments earlier. Just curious if you have any thoughts on how the outcome of the upcoming governor's election could impact your PIP severity, if at all ongoing forward? Glenn M. Renwick: I don't, and I'm sorry. I'd like to be as helpful, but I simply don't. I don't think that's going to change most of what House Bill 119 was all about and how that's being interpreted and reinterpreted through the quote systems. That would be -- that's beyond my paygrade. Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's fair, just thought I would ask. Brian C. Domeck: I would echo Glenn's comments. Operator : And our last question at this time comes from David Small from JPMorgan. David Small : Yes. Could you just give us some more color about the growth challenges that you're seeing in the agency channel? Maybe just talk about competitive behavior and why you think you've been struggling to grow. Glenn M. Renwick: Yes. We do a lot of decomposition and I'll try to give some color here to be responsive to the question without absolute specifics, but we decomp that. We know some part of it is rate, some part of it is actually some underwriting actions that we have taken, and that will stabilize over time and frankly we're okay with that. But that's a small piece of it. There is clearly some changes in receptivity to some of the more aggregators that we talked about last time on the call. That's a piece of it. But let's not suggest that it's not partly and significantly the competitive environment. We've seen some results from competitors. I'm sure you've seen them. But I'd suggest that they are getting some significant pickup in new business in some cases after a period of not doing quite as well. So it's a competitive environment, one that we've played in for lots of years and we will respond. We will respond, however, without breaking our discipline around what we've always said, we'll go as fast as possible at our target margins. Frankly, I sit here. I was comfortable making the statements that I make. This is not what I like. We've got so much of the business working really well. We've got some new things that we are not ripe to talk about yet, but our agency production in new business is probably the one place that prevented this quarter being an even better quarter because it was pretty good. But we're on it, and there's no question. This is, in the trenches, competition in the agency channel and we've got to come at that with our best tools, new products, new Snapshot design, some multiproduct news with our homeowners partner. All of those things are absolutely happening and as I did indicate in my letter, don't -- those are not things to sort of Tuesday next week it will be turned around, but as we go into '16 -- or '15, excuse me, I think we'll be even better positioned. David Small : Just a follow-up. Do you think that your competitive position with any average agency has changed given the moves that your competitors have made just in terms of the where you're priced relative to peers or other metrics that you look at? Glenn M. Renwick: Yes, I think -- yes, that would be the conclusion I drew because, frankly, we've changed less and then the very early part of the year we were clucking along at some very different rates. So the only way that really happens is if someone comes and introduces some variable, i.e. a price point, that is lower. And we may or may not be prepared to match that price point, but it's not quite that simple. It's more complex. But yes, I'd say the competitive environment has absolutely tried to change our position, our conversion rate in individual agents. Matt Downing : I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call.

That document can be found via the Investors page of our website, progressive.com. We are now ready to take our first question. Operator : Thank you. At this time we are ready to begin the formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first quarter is from Max Zormello [ph] with Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. First question is on the agency channel. I am wondering are the growth challenges in that channel related to your inability to provide a well branded bundled Homeowner product or is this something else going on and how long do you think it takes before you reach an inflection point in the agency channel and we start to see an improvement in growth and policy life expectancy? Glenn Renwick : Thanks Max. Frankly of all the things that are going well for us the one that has my greatest attention is the production in the agency channel. So you are right to bring that up as a primary question. Don\u2019t look at it is -- I would encourage you to look it as an inability to have that bundled product, our traditional offering in the agency channel didn\u2019t rely on that. That is really sort of the next generation where we hope that to be simply additives. Obviously we are doing it for some time, we expect to ramp that up.  But we have outlined quite a few challenges, some of them competitive some of them are own pricing challenges. Last year we took rate in the channel. I call it 3.5% but most of that was in the first-half or around about the midpoint. So we are still seeing it come through a little bit in our renewals but towards the later part of the year that rate was actually moderated quite substantially.  So we look forward to that flowing through into the renewals and seeing a different reaction there. The competitive reactions we have said probably on a past call that we had a multi response to that. I would say many of those responses were relatively marginal and their results, one of the biggest things that we were doing which is far from marginal is introducing our new product, and I want to be careful here since other companies do this a little differently.  We are always bringing out not only a new product into the marketplace where we have R&D, so from time-to-time we\u2019ll talk about new products and also on R&D, it\u2019s a continuous process for us but we did release what we would call our most recent full market product in Missouri very recently and we\u2019re starting to see some signs from that introduction that are positive.  I\u2019ll say positive in a couple of ways; one, it\u2019s producing more preferred business and that was one of the goals of that rate revision. I know the goal built into that rate revision was the adoption of Snapshot at a higher level inside of the agency than we had seen in the past and we\u2019re also seeing that reaction.  So identification of the issue is correct. Agency is not performing as well as we think we should be performing in that sector, still performing well but we think we\u2019ve got a good rate level. We think we\u2019re leading into a renewal period that will be less dramatic in terms of rate change for consumers and we have new product in the marketplace and then add on to the top of that a lot of what we talked about in the specific conference call in December where we\u2019ve entered into our arrangement with ASI and we expect that as a bundling option to take on a whole different phase for agents seeing Progressive/ASI as an entity and bringing something distinct to them. I\u2019ve said very clearly that our number one goal with that controlling interest is to actually have something that agents want to sell, which is very different than having something that\u2019s there. It\u2019s another alternative, it\u2019s something they want to sell and the consumers will want to have. So we look forward to that. That\u2019s not going to turn the tide in any sort of immediate timeframe. So we have short-term with new product, we have, to be effective last year\u2019s rate revisions mitigating and we also have a longer term strategy with our bundled policies that we\u2019ll be reporting on a great deal more as that starts to come to life. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for the thorough answer. One other quick one if I may, are you willing to, in a direction are you willing to take the consolidated compound ratio up to 96% in order to grow in that channel meaningfully this year? Glenn Renwick : Simple answer would be yes. My commitment to shareholders is that the overall company will produce 96. Clearly you know the relative size of the portion\u2019s agency in direct column roughly equal. But it is not an intent necessarily to have combined ratios substantially lower than 96%. If we believe we can grow and grow attractively by any closure of the margin that we might be attaining in the 96%. I have quite a physical reaction to go in over 96, so that won\u2019t happen by design but absolutely a good growth and profitability combination in our direct channel to put the combined ratio closer to 96 is a very acceptable outcome, especially if it\u2019s coupled with that growth combination. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Brian Domeck : This is Brian. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is keep in mind in the direct channel, particularly as it relates to drivers of demand one of the functions is advertising and advertising spend and we measure that on the cost per sale or yield relative to allowable acquisition cost and so as long as we are meeting those new and renewal targets we are more than willing to continue to spend on advertising and you might see that as a change in expense ratio from time to time and you saw January, you saw that our direct channel expense ratio is a little bit elevated in January and yes indeed in January we did spend a fair amount on the advertising, higher than the growth rate. But we believe meeting those cost for sale versus allowable acquisition targets. So that is one of things that we have a lever on in terms of how much we spend on the advertising. But they always have to meet those new and renewal targets. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Josh Sterling with Sanford Bernstein. Josh Stirling : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the call. So Glenn I was hoping we could chat a little bit about more about your acquisition of the Homeowners company. I think you did a nice job in your shareholders letter of talking about sort of the destination era and how this sort of fits in both as an offensive opportunity as well as a defensive one of making sure you have the ability to continue to manufacture and you continue to have or have partnership and the ability to deliver Homeowners business in sort of any conceivable scenario in the future. But I\u2019d love to get a better sense if we think, not on the defensive side but on the offensive side, what are you guys really hoping to do with this?  What does -- I think you just said are creating product that agents want to sell. I think I can imagine a few different things that might fit there but I'd really love to hear kind of what you guys are thinking that you'd really like to do with this to actually drive agency sales growth of bundled products, whether that\u2019s, I mean commissions, new product designs, introductions in more states, it would be really, really great to have a better handle on what the actual operating agenda is going to be and then sort of a realistic timeframe of what you're going to hold the organization to. Thank you. Glenn Renwick : Yes, very fair question Josh and hopefully I have sort at least outlined, what I can outline at this stage. There is work going on and I am not one to sort of avoid the question, so it always makes me awkward when I just know more than I am prepared to say right now. There is work going on right now in a joint design with ASI/Progressive folks as to what a responsive product for agents will look like, and you mentioned some factors in there. Those are all being considered. I am going to suggest to you that that will be a better question for us to address; we may or may not be ready, but if we are we will address it in our IR meeting in May. I am not avoiding the question. I am just saying that it's a real-time discussion going on right now with the answers having not been determined in specific detail but there are lot of things on the table that could happen. I think you know me well enough to know that we don't sell futures, we absolutely are working on things. So are things like commissions on the table? Could be. Are things like policy period and coordination of policy period on the table? Could be. Those sorts of things are absolutely important and do we think that there will be a group of agents that will see the combination of a Progressive/ASI as something potentially special and more importantly those that can think see what would that look like five years from now, 10 years from now. We're going to try to put that proposition out there with real substance.  So for me this is exciting, we didn't go in just to get something because it was available or that we liked it. It is to make a meaningful difference for both companies and their ability to create a bundle that will be meaningful for consumers and to the extent I think I heard this in your question, yes, it does provide a lot of optionality for us going forward. We won't get everything right out of the gates but this relationship will provide an awful lot of optionality to be able to continuously change, modify and have the relationship that isn't. So the two companies are trying to sort of work through agendas, it will be very much a one agenda with regard to bundled policies. Josh Stirling : That's great. We'll stay tuned for the investor meeting. If I could, I have to ask something, I mean you brought up the Missouri product launch of your sort of recent Snapshot generation. I am wondering if you can give us a better sense of what you think the impact of that would be if we could imagine that it sort of were rolled out nationally. Is this going to be something that actually moves the needle on the margin side or is this new business growth vehicle and if that's the case, now how do we think we should be thinking about sizing that? Glenn Renwick : There\u2019s two choices. I wouldn't think about it as a margin issue at all. We try to get the same margin across the board regardless of rating segmentation. So to me it's just a segmentation variable, if it\u2019s segments we feel that are favorable then we will price them to the point that their favorability is incorporated into their rate. So don't think of it as a margin issue, think of it as a growth issue. Last year you almost threw me asking ASI before our step short questions. So I thought I would cover a couple of other Snapshot issues.  We were up with our Snapshot program about 28% last year; targets or margins very, very close to what we're looking at and where we're off, it's off on older models. So we're very comfortable with what we're doing in the marketplace. The Missouri entry which will be followed by many other states this year, the roll out will start, I believe late April into May. What we have seen so far and I'll just restrict this to a snapshot is I mean I report the news and I will be the first to admit when it's not the news or different but we have seen a substantial tick up in agent take rate as measured by quoting activity.  So first of all it was very low to start with. So the fact that we have seen a tick up is promising, it's encouraging. It's supportive of what we saw in Massachusetts where we tried the same sort of issue. It is not at the levels that we see on a direct basis but we see directionally that we have made a difference and hopefully for agents and to be very and to be very fair, this is something that agents are going to have to get a little bit more comfortable with, but bringing at least partial discounts forward in the rating process. I don\u2019t think it took that much creativity to believe that, that would likely have an effect. It has had an effect. We will continue to monitor that, but based on everything we see, both now in the Massachusetts, sort of early pilot and Missouri where it\u2019s incorporated into our model design, we have every expectation of continuing that rollout and we have every expectation that agent take rate will reflect a better proposition for them to present to their customers. Couple other things just on Snapshot, since they may or may not be on people\u2019s minds; we did finalize an agreement with GM very late in the year, so it\u2019ll actually go into effect more in the summer this year, where we actually were able to use the OnStar device, I think I\u2019ve said on this call or other formats, I would just as soon be long-term device agnostic or not even in the device business. So this is a very first step we ultimately will be able to use the technology that\u2019s in the car, totally with the consumers consent to be able to actually have one more source of data. We\u2019ll continue to push based on the results that I gave you of the 28% growth last year and as we recognize premium, we\u2019re now sorted in the above $2.5 billion, that\u2019s associated with Snapshot. I want to point out Snapshot is not a separate program, it\u2019s a rating variable. And I suspect one of the questions might be a little bit later. So I\u2019ll just get right on to it, is the indication that we gave maybe on a call last time or the time before that, with regard to our interest in using Snapshot to really understand the changing macro economy with regard to gas prices. And what gas prices might do, might not do, what mileage might be correlated, might not be correlated. I can tell you, it\u2019s actually a quite fun to be fitting here looking at data on a weekly basis and I\u2019m sure there are people looking at it on a daily basis by state, and I once made a comment that I could tell the weather outside by the number of motorcycle losses. Now I think we\u2019ve got another way of knowing what the weather is. But there is a macro trend to increase the mileage. We\u2019re not going to be specific with the data that we\u2019re seeing. We think that\u2019s an important internal dataset for us. So we\u2019ve actually -- we\u2019re doing indications for our rating based on different gas prices and we can actually correlate that to frequency. So we\u2019re actually getting quite sophisticated in our pricing as to what to might happen, might not happen, what we will be [ph] paid in different circumstances. And most importantly the miles that are being driven are not necessarily direct duplicates of the miles that were being driven. People don\u2019t commute more to work just because they have lower gas prices. So it\u2019s a different type of mile. You could recently imagine it\u2019s longer trips and the frequency on those trips or the frequency per mile is different and those are also have intricacies that the Snapshot program is allowing us to see on a pretty large statistical basis that we feel very good about that input and we will have to wait six months or three months to see governmental data to adjust our pricing. We will be able to factor that into our trend. So to me that\u2019s a very exciting thing to be able to actually see, signal as we are starting to develop imperfect, but very exciting. Josh Stirling : Glenn, you just answered about seven questions. So thanks for the response. Glenn Renwick : Okay. Thanks Josh. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Joshua Shanker : Yes, good morning everyone. And thank you for taking my question. Why is the moving to Homeowners happening now on an equity basis? What changed in the past year, I mean, I maybe going to mischaracterizing it and you please can correct me. But I feel in some ways Progressive has always said, we don\u2019t want to take on that kind of risks, it doesn\u2019t fit with how we run our business and it makes this feel like the least worst option? Or I\u2019m totally mischaracterizing and please just excuse me of that, but it seems like this is a change of strategy, something you\u2019ve avoided in the past. Am I mischaracterizing it? Glenn Renwick : I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re mischaracterizing that. Look out of my list is definitely the words that I\u2019m not interested in Homeowners as a fundamental use of our capital. The leverage is different, order was absolutely where our focus was and I am if nothing else someone who believe a great deal in focus. So what has changed? It\u2019s a fair question and I tried to address that in a couple of different ways, but let\u2019s take one more shot. Joshua Shanker : Now I guess. Glenn Renwick : Yes, that's fair. Why now, we have for probably and I might be mischaracterizing but let me say five years, maybe six had a multiple relationships with Homeowners to be able to bundle our auto. There is a segment and let's just start with the segment. There is a segment of consumers that we simply don't really have the product that represents their long-term interest. We call them the Robinson, it doesn\u2019t matter if you haven't sort of caught up on that nomenclature but Progressive has been incredibly successful in my mind, attacking certain market segments and getting over indexed market share relative to our indexed share of the entire PPA market. But that leaves about a 40% part of the consumer base that is not really well represented by our product. Is it because our auto product is not a fit. I think the answer to that is no. It's because those customers need more product and tend to bundle.  So I have no interest with the brand that we have of being left out of 40% of the marketplace. So why now, because A, we have a brand that's appealing to what we consider to be the future long tenured customers. Auto is a primary first product purchase and we are very aware that many people in their relationship with us simply because their life is changing and they need additional products. We would like very much to use our business model, leverage the business model that we've had but use it to start to say how can we keep those people for a longer period of time and that does require additional products. We are more than happy to provide those additional products under our brand umbrella which is working well for us even if we don't manufacture them, even if we don't manufacture them, which is true for the vast majority of the ones that we offer.  With regard to ASI it is more difficult to have a strong relationship in the agency channel that works. One, that has the capacity, one that has the knowledge of what agents want and ASI for us was just a perfect match of that and we are delighted to have not only them as a strong partner but we could use them in other ways but for right now that gives us something in the agency channel that we simply haven't really cracked into.  We have been more successful in creating the bundles on the direct side than we have on the agency side. And if we don't come to the market, which is a huge part of our business with something that agents truly want to sell and make sense than we don't really have that part of the marketplace, that 40%, we're not really attacking it. And that seems to be, for me a major opportunity for growth and that's pretty much why now.  We're very, very comfortable with the other parts of our business that are growing well, we're very comfortable with that traditional niche in the model line auto. We're very comfortable with our special lines, we're very comfortable with that brand, we're very comfortable with our direct addition. We want to provide more to our agents and to the extent that ASI is a viable player in the direct channel we will consider that as time goes on. Brian Domeck : Yeah, and just to add to that. I think it's -- we saw the success that we have with Progressive home advantage in the direct channel, where we had many companies and we saw the success of having our auto policy holders take a property product, the benefits of the POE extension and the like and we want it to have a similar entry into the agency market for that same type of customer who wants to bundle or have both of their products together. And so the ARX transaction was an investment in the agency channel to give us a vehicle to have agents and consumers in the agency channel also have that opportunity.  And prior to this investment and acquisition, the penetration in the agency channel was pretty modest. And so this is an investment to get to a higher share of those customers in the agency channel. And our belief was where in the direct channel, we have multiple companies a multi-company approach in the agency channel will be very difficult to achieve. So we've worked with ARX/ASI for a number of years, love what they do in terms of their discipline and their results and their management. And so that's why we thought now would be a good time because we need to have a viable product offering that can suit the needs agents and the consumers in that segment. Glenn Renwick : And just one more comment on this so we don\u2019t perhaps lose the focus and I have stated this really clearly in several places, it is ultimately our goal to retain the customers that we bring on, we lose customers, some don\u2019t pay. There\u2019s a lot of reasons you lose customers early in their tenure. The last thing I want to do is lose a customer who has been with us for a reasonable period of time and has no dissatisfaction with our service or our product simply because they need more product. We will find that and meet that need for them even if we don\u2019t manufacture it. Joshua Shanker : That\u2019s perfectly reasonable. The one follow-up that I have is how should the investors think about Progressive\u2019s long-term commitment to returning earnings to shareholders in light of this change? Glenn Renwick : No, I don\u2019t see any change. I am trying to comment but don\u2019t see\u2026 Brian Domeck : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed at all. Joshua Shanker : Your ability is unchanged you believe? Brian Domeck : Well in terms of the ability, I think what we all have always said is we will return under leveraged capital, if you will to shareholders, right. And so to the extent that we have sufficient capital and more capital then we need our commitment is returning that extra capital back to shareholders, where it that via dividends or shareholders. So that philosophy of returning under leveraged capital hasn\u2019t changed at all. How much capital is generated and the like, certainly we believe this acquisition helps us retain some of our customers longer, which should generate more capital and we also have expectations based upon ARX\u2019s historical results that we can generate capital there as well.  Certainly the capital requirement of the Homeowners business will be different. It\u2019s unlikely that we can write at a 3 :1 ratio for Homeowners but the philosophy of returning under leveraged capital to shareholders hasn\u2019t changed at all. Joshua Shanker : Thank you for all your answers and I wish you good luck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Thank you, good morning. Glenn, I was hoping you could clarify the comments you made in the letter about commercial auto. The way it sounded to me that you are now optimistic about achieving faster growth without really sacrificing the very strong margins that you\u2019ve been putting up, and the response ratios getting [indiscernible]. Glenn Renwick : Yes, I think you are getting it correct. Let me put a little color on it. That commercial lines group is really quite a phenomenal group and they do really great work. The last couple of years has been a lot more bouncy and John Barbagallo clearly gave some indications of where we got behind the A pool [ph] on a couple of places and they have worked very hard to get caught up. So in my commentary there, sort of reiterated that we get profitability but no growth, no growth in profitability. It has been a little rockier than you would take the long term history of that group.  Where I truly believe they are now is having found a very nice combination of pricing and profitability. The reported numbers that you are seeing in profitability are great when you get them. Don\u2019t assume that we price to those and that if all our pricing decisions are as rational as we hope them to be, those margins will close to some degree but they will still be very attractive. And a good way to think about that is that in the last three months thereabouts rate changes in commercial have been sort of plus or minus about a half a point.  So while we have over the last couple of years being taking bigger swings those swings now have moderated significantly and to me that is really finding the equilibrium. So not only are we positioned very well in our own internal perspective for where we need to be but the market\u2019s coming to us a little bit as well. So trying not to do too many forward-looking statements that I might live to regret but I feel very good about commercial and hopefully that was the general intent of the paragraph in the Annual Report notwithstanding that has definitely been lot more rocky for the last couple of years, my expectation is that we are on a much better glide path now. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s very positive. On a related note you talked a little bit earlier about the relationship between the gas cycles and frequency and so on, is there any similar relationship on the commercial side? Glenn Renwick : I am going to have say better not to answer that because I really don\u2019t know with any specificity. We do have an arrangement right now where we actually have in truck monitoring but it\u2019s a fraction small, small fraction of anything we have on the auto side. So I don\u2019t really have good indications to that. We as an organization may have information that I'm not up to speed on. I just don\u2019t know. I think freight miles are probably a lot more indicative of supply and demand in supermarkets and other retail and all the rest of it. A fair question, let\u2019s see if we don\u2019t have a better answer for you in May but I don\u2019t have the level of insight that we do vis-\u00e0-vis specialty auto. Meyer Shields : Okay thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Paul Newsome : Good morning and thanks for the call. I was hoping you could give us your most recent thoughts on the aggregators in the direct channel because there\u2019s been a lot of talk about various websites trying to aggregate the direct channel more and just maybe talk a little bit about how do you see barriers and opportunities within that particular market segment? Glenn Renwick : Yes, fair question Paul. We\u2019re very well aware of that. We talk to a lot of them. So I'm going to be a little bit hedging on my comments because those conversations are sort of ongoing. For the most part I would tell you that we concentrate a lot on our own brand and bringing people directly to us rather than intermediation that may or may not be value added. That\u2019s not a commentary on that side. I'm just saying that we would prefer consumers to understand our brand, to respect our brand, know what we can do for them and come directly to us. That\u2019s the model that works best for us.  I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the other major player in the direct space probably feels the same way I don\u2019t know. So aggregators don\u2019t always get a fair representation of competitors relative to market share. So that\u2019s always the challenge for aggregators. It might sound attractive to some consumers that I have X but if X doesn\u2019t necessarily include the major suppliers that can be awkward. So we\u2019re going to focus primarily on our own brand from a direct perspective. We\u2019re very well aware of aggregators in the agency arena as well. Aggregators in the direct arena I think it\u2019s no great surprise that Google has interest in things in where they could clearly consult with us. We have never exactly set enough timeframes on that one. So a lot of things going on. Ultimately we know best product best price is going to be a big win and we feel very good about our ability to get that message out.  If I were in a different position and didn\u2019t have a consumer brand, my answer to this might be quite different. Paul Newsome : That leads me to a follow-up question. I know you folks have looked outside the U.S. at different markets and had some experiments there. And my sense, and please tell me if I'm wrong, is that the U.S. market is different and the brand has a different impact in the U.S. versus other markets. Is that right, have you seen evidence of that and is there any way to kind of think about and quantify that from our perspective? Glenn Renwick : I think you are right, Paul and the conference call would not be the right setting to get into it but for example I know the UK market, I think quite well and the differences, I think are quite notable and what necessarily or what might work in one market may or may not work in another market. I'm sure that\u2019s a healthy debate with everybody having sides in that, but we do think we understand the U.S. market very well. We like our positioning in it. That will be our focus so while we look outside the United States we always look to get different ideas but for the most part our focus is close to a 100% here. Paul Newsome : Great thank you and best of luck for 2015. Glenn Renwick : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yeah, good morning. A couple of quick questions here for you. First one, Glenn, I'm just curious with respect to getting better growth in your agency segment, Homeowners going in hopefully that helps out. But what about commission rates, I mean is there a need here do you think to raise commission rates to get that preferred customer, particularly maybe on packaged business and stuff. Glenn Renwick : The answer to that Brian is maybe. We are very comfortable with our commission rate that we provide relative to our monoline auto and so on and so forth. And we recognized where that is in many respects relative to others. The but on that is we think we're providing agents with effectively a cost structure that is very close if not so to modeled off what we see in that direct structure.  To the extent that we are trying to do something quite different with bundles, treat agents very differently, do what I said before, really have them feel great about the product, commissions and other things will be on the table and I'm sure if you caught the very beginning but those are very active conversations going on right now. So rather than sort of get ahead of those when the decisions haven't been made but do I think commissions maybe a part of that when the agent\u2019s doing considerably more work to package things together, maintain that relationship? Yes absolutely. It's not an aversion to paying more commission. It's just trying to make sure that we've got a product that is priced well overall for the consumer that's buying it and wants to stay with that combination for a long period of time. Brian Meredith : Great. And then the next question, I'm just curious you all do a terrific job using Big Data for risk selection pricing and analytics and stuff. I'm just curious from a technology perspective, any thoughts on kind of using that for value added services to customers, be it through risk mitigation, loss mitigation for customers when they\u2019re driving or Homeowners products and that kind of things? Glenn Renwick : None yet, we have a pretty long list of things that we're very interested in doing internally which I sort of harp on that, because it's fun, it\u2019s exciting, but none yet. I suspect there will be other opportunities for us to do things. You mentioned risk mitigation in homes. We're all very well aware of sort of the daily articles about autonomous cars and driverless cars and this and the like. Clearly what excites me about that, I get excited about it is the technology journey that will get us there. I don't necessarily opine exactly what the end outcome might be but the technology journey that will get us there.  We've said very publicly that we expect our long-term trend on frequency to be down. So far that has been matched or more than matched by severity change. But I think that same trend will happen in homes. While homes don't drive themselves they certainly could put out their own fires before anyone knew. And technology will have a great deal of influence in the home and while we are not home owner savvy per se, ASI certainly is. And as we match our own Big Data competencies those are sort of opportunities that while will not be next week by any stretch of imagination, you should think of Progressive as continuing to leverage its fundamental strengths around data analysis and segmentation as we create some additional options for ourselves as well. Brian Meredith : Great, thanks for the answer. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Mike Zaremski with Balyasny. Michael Zaremski : Hey, good morning. Just have a question about frequencies. One of that largest auto writers in the U.S. on uptake and frequencies are relative to their expectations, late in 2014, and I was curious if you guys experienced that phenomenon as well. I believe Glenn you spoke earlier about being able to I think you had talked about being able to react faster than in the past to the data you've encountered from Snapshot. Glenn Renwick : That's true. That would be more pricing for frequency, so we should see the same frequency. I think I understand the company you're referring to and that's fine and different companies will see different things. But on the frequency basis we actually saw flat to even slightly negative in the very later part of the year. Always tricky to take any one measurement in any one quarter, but if we look to the whole year we probably have a slightly negative frequency in BI that doesn\u2019t necessarily match with some of the numbers that I've seen.  That's just data, so we're looking at a flat frequency right now and as we think about the future, gas price could very well have an effect on future frequency employments. While we can't always say what's positive, we definitely have correlations between employment and frequency or unemployment and frequency whichever way you want to look at that. So there are several things.  We believe frequency long-term is declining and that is based largely on vehicle technology. But they'll always be some short term variations based on more micro events in the economy, gas prices employment. And those are things that are very hard to forecast with any accuracy, but as of right now we're seeing a more mitigated frequency than some of our competitors apparently. Michael Zaremski : That's helpful. Thank you. Julia Hornack : It looks like that was the last caller. So that concludes our call today. Wendy I will turn it back over to you for the closing script. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Progressive Corporation's Investor Relations conference call. An instant replay of the call will be available through Friday March 20 by calling 1800-285-8790 or can be accessed via the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year.

[Operator Instructions]. In addition, this conference is being recorded at the request of Progressive. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. The Company will not make detailed comments in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and letter to the shareholders, which have been posted to the Company's website and will use this conference call to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the call will be Julia Hornack. At this time, I will turn the call over to Ms. Hornack. Julia Hornack : Good morning. Welcome to Progressive's conference call. Participating on today's call are; Glenn Renwick, our CEO; John Sauerland, our CFO; and Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer. Today's call is scheduled to last about an hour. As always, our discussions on this call may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on Management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during this call. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2014 annual report on form 10-K and our first quarter 2015 quarterly report on form 10-Q where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements relating to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the risks, uncertainties and other challenges we face. These documents can found via the Investors page of our website progressive.com. We are now ready to take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Amit Kumar : My first question relates to obviously the focus on miles driven and the lost coast trends we're seeing. We are getting a lot of incoming questions from investors that, it's only a matter of time before these frequency trends surface at Progressive too. Can you talk about why we are not seeing these trends at Progressive and maybe loop that in with the discussion on the risks occurred as to where you write business? Glenn Renwick : Sure. I suspect you're more than referencing a few data points that have come out with regard to frequency? Amit Kumar : Yes. Glenn Renwick : Let me just start by saying no matter what frequencies are reported, they're all samples from an overall population. And even if we do frequency by channel, we're going to have slightly different numbers. I think what you're more likely focused on is what would be a fairly dramatic difference let's suggest, with Allstate having reported recently and Progressive. I'm not going to even attempt to try to explain those differences but let me give you a fair amount of color as to where I see things going. We spend a reasonable amount of time looking at our frequency and severity. But I'll focus just on frequency for now because I think that's the guts of your question. Relative to PCI data, and while we don't lay on top of PCI directly, and right now a little more favorable i.e., our frequency is a little lower, we are a lot more comparable to the PCI data than we were for example, Allstate. That can happen. You sample any population, you're going to have different outcomes. So it's not a question of what's right and wrong, but starting to explain mix differences and mix differences can occur through urban concentrations, rural concentrations, different states. So recognize all of these data points really need to be broken down. You referenced miles driven. One of the advantages that Progressive has suggested to investors before, is that we have an early look system at miles driven. Again, it's a sample of a very large population but with our Snapshot population being sizable, we're very comfortable that we are actually getting sort of on a daily, weekly, whatever we choose to examine basis, any real detection of miles driven changes. I'm not going to become a free data source and give you the specifics. But, I will tell you in July there was an uptick in miles driven. We had seen an uptick all year, but it had been reasonably constant and then in July, on a July over July basis, it was more significant uptick. Again, what's more important there is, what kind of miles are being driven and we're analyzing that from a point of view. So I'll just give you one break that we use and that is miles - or trips, single continuous trips over 15 miles. We are actually seeing that become a higher percentage of miles driven. So again, frequency will track with the type of miles and we're seeing longer trips and there's a different frequency for longer trips then there are for shorter trips. We simply are observing our frequencies, we report them as they are. Obviously, very favorable right now. I don't know that you should assume that Progressive is anything other than a large player. So our frequencies may be reflective of the environment. They may change. Whenever we see another data point that's inconsistent with our own, clearly, it puts our attention to make sure that we're not perhaps overlooking a future trend to the data point. Clearly what we measure is what we measure. The real issue is, which direction is it going? So we are seeing miles driven up. We are seeing a certain type of miles driven up, we believe that that could result in higher frequencies, but so far, we are not betting on a dramatic change in the frequencies and we're very comfortable with what we have. All of that, should be translated into pricing. It's really not a matter of what the frequency is, it's whether or not you're priced for that frequency and priced for that severity. And right now, we're very comfortable that we've actually previously seen opportunities to take our rates up, believing that frequencies would rise. And, we're in a very comfortable position as we see it right now. We have mechanisms inside of our rates, whereby we keep those rates moving up a small amount. And hopefully, we will match frequency and severity for a period of time when we simply get out of match, that's when we take more dramatic or quantum rate changes 1%, 2%, whatever is necessary. Did that get at your question? Amit Kumar : Yes, that is actually very helpful. The only follow-up I have is, we've talked about Snapshot and you talked about the insight it gives you. 2.5 million I guess is the ballpark number of Snapshot customers. When you talk about insight, how should we think about what is the percent of that book which is transmitting real-time data back to you? Glenn Renwick : That's a fair question and I don't have a particularly good answer for you. So that is the size of the book but not all those customers have an active chip. Because once they've actually gone through the first six months, we will actually have been them give the chip back and we will recycle it. While you can always make the assessment that more data is better, there is also a cost to more data so it's really a question of the marginal costs versus the marginal return of new information. But, we are looking at something in the order of one million trips a day. So think about it as, not so much how many vehicles but what we are really getting from it. Cumulatively, we're well over 13 or probably approaching 15 billion miles driven and one million trips a day is a big number relative to sample statistics. So we're very comfortable that we've got that inside look and while it may not have been the primary driving force behind Snapshot, clearly it wasn't, it's an awfully good side effect. Operator : Your next question or comment Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi : Thank you. Just following up on Amit's question there. I guess, the one question I have is, you have two, both you and Allstate, and I'm not asking to comment on their trend. But you have two carriers that are big that write across the spectrum and probably have some overlap in demographic. You almost have two - with miles driven rising, I understand your comment on PCI, but we literally have two endpoints in terms of experience. With a large pool, I'm just trying to - it doesn't seem intuitive to me that we could be seeing two dramatically different experiences. And I get your point on rate, but rate is a top line - I'm sorry rate is more of a function of top line, whereas frequency should be more margin related. Is there anything that we just not being operators, is there something else that could explain two really, really large populations with vastly different experience? Glenn Renwick : It's a very fair question, Michael, and I'm not in a position to try and even explain someone else's issues other than the fact that the good news is, we all measure frequency. It's not a make-believe number, so for the most part, we can assume that both numbers are right. Why they are so disparate from the same population, I don't have a great answer for you. I certainly can give you lots of pieces why they will never be the same. In 30 years of being in the business, I often have trouble reconciling between channels and other carriers. But this is a pretty big difference and I have not seen that on very many occasions. So I don't have a good explanation. If I had to speculate, I would say mix is probably a good chunk of that. I mentioned the urban and rural kind of environment. I don't have the ability, I don't think anyone does, to be able to dissect the mix of the business to see if it could be an explanatory variable. That one's a tough one. I think the key thing for us, and maybe this is just part of my nature, is I get more paranoid when things are going well. So you can be sure that if someone else is seeing something, we'll be looking. But it's not something that we're worried about missing. We know how many claims are coming in on a daily basis, we know how to count those claims, and if we see any sort of upticks, you can be sure we'll be adjusting for it. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. I'm sorry? Glenn Renwick : And we're not seeing that right now. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. I guess, just switching on the homeowners side. Can you talk about, you mentioned some points in your letter but as you're getting agents on board, can you talk about what that entails in terms of expenses, commission differences and also, just the information and education to get agents to understand the differentiated nature of this offering? Not just verses what you were offering before or what others offer but just from the fact that you're moving placement from being just a more of a pure auto writer to now a bundled provider and looking to be in that space. Thanks. Glenn Renwick : Good. I'm glad you picked up on that because platinum, think about our relationship with ASI in its current form of being one quarter in and we've gotten within that first 90 days, we're out in the marketplace with a product that basically is just us. Not one or the other or two together. It's us together. Which I find to be the most exciting thing that we've done in a long time. And I said in there it will be a limited distribution. I will come back and comment on that. You talked about costs and startup. There will definitely be some startup costs but most of those will be just a reallocation of costs that we have in the marketplace. So we're not necessarily hiring new people or so on and so forth. There'll be some incremental costs but probably not ones that will flow through to any degree that you would see them. On the other hand, the commission costs, we absolutely are prepared to pay more commission and will do so, for these platinum agents if they provide us with the exact intent, the bundled product that we are looking for. So that should reflect, it will be a little hard to see. I will be more than willing to take those sort of questions after another quarter, six months. But you may have trouble seeing that flow through in the expense ratio because it will be relatively small. Why are we doing limited distribution? Frankly, we really want to get at a class, and I tried to note this a little bit in my letter, a class of customer that for the most part, and I'll separate here just, not very often, but I will for now, Progressive and ASI. The more preferred customer that while we've always wanted them, we've always had a product, has not been the sweet spot for us in the agency channel. And this gives us an opportunity to literally get a data set of those customers and understand if there is truly a different pure premium that they represent versus perhaps a more mass distributed product. And obviously, we're making a very, we think an intelligent and informed but, to be fair, imperfect at this point in time, determination that that pure premium will be lower and support a higher commission. And as we get more of that data, which we're excited to start having come in, we will be able to A, confirm that, or, as I hope is possible, recognize that there's possibly even more there as we address this pure premium segment that we really haven't seen before of both bundled and a class of customers that a group of agents have access to that we previously have not captured. So a little bit up on commission costs but that will probably be very small in the aggregate. But to help you with that, I'm more than willing to give you some data on that as we have future calls like this. Our internal expenses, while we are allocating sales, resources and rolled out expenses, I wouldn't worry about that too much. Operator : Your next question or comment Jay Gelb from Barclays. Jay Gelb : Thanks and good morning. With Allstate saying it's going to put back on expenses which includes advertising, my sense is that could result in a slower growth rate in policies in force for auto insurance for Allstate. Does that offer an opportunity for Progressive to expand its growth across the auto product overall and the direct channel in particular? Glenn Renwick : The answer to that has to be, yes. We hope that we're a recipient of that and if you think about the definitive new business that we get when people switch, we're obviously one of those considerations. So calibrating that, the good news is we report monthly, you'll get to see. And over time we will - we will, certainly, internally, look at the percentage of new business that had come in with proof of prior from Allstate and so on and so forth. But we do that as a natural course of business anyway. We have seen, starting at about May, John, correct me if I'm wrong there, that the paid search from Allstate and even Esurance to a degree, they've actually gone down pretty significantly. We track those sort of things. So the comments of pulling back on advertising, certainly we've seen that in the paid search area which is the easiest one for us to get a clean handle on which is great from our perspective. Obviously, we're not doing that. In fact, our ad spend has been strengthened just a little bit. So this is a time where as long as we are very comfortable with our rate level, we've talked about some of the macro trends of miles driven, frequency, these are all of the things that we spend - that's basically what we do. We spend our time trying to make sure we've got those in balance. As long as we think we've got them in balance, this is actually a good time for us. But, I would also tell you, building on my prior comment of being paranoid, when you grow fast, the book changes. And while we're big and no matter how much new business, it doesn't change dramatically. We've got to be very conscience of new business effects. To the extent that new business comes in with prior insurance, that is actually better for us then those that have no prior insurance. Is it an opportunity? Absolutely. But we've got to make sure that we do our job and not worry too much about what others are doing. And right now, we're positioned in a really nice way. So I feel great about the marketplace, I feel great about our pricing and we'll take it when it's there. Operator : Your next question or comment Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Ian Gutterman : Glenn, I just wanted to go into a little bit of the first half results and understand what's happening on the loss side a little bit. When I look at accidents in the year loss ratio, so I strip out the cats, I strip out the development. In the first quarter, you were up about 3 points year-over-year, and in second quarter, 2 points but then if I back out, my best guess with the mix of home, it was also close to about 3 points. So why do we see the accident year go up 3 points if loss trends have been reasonably within expectations? Glenn Renwick : Those numbers seem right to me. But we are priced to a level. Recognize that we're also at a point where accident year results would be comfortable. There's no question the calendar year results are better than the accident year results. We fully - that's why we publish so that you can actually get to those things right now given what we've just talked about, market conditions, our ability to attract new business. I am perfectly happy to be close to our target combined ratio when I can get a disproportionate growth to go along with that. So you're right, but I'm not concerned about that and I think we're priced to the right pure premium trends. Ian Gutterman : Okay. I guess I was looking to - John Sauerland : I'm sorry this is John. I would add that yes, prior year development has been favorable. The good news there is, we've talked a lot about frequency on this call but our severity trends have been good as well. Severity has come in below what we projected and obviously reserve for and that allows us to show the favorable prior year development. The other component that I think you need to think about when you look at that total, is the expense ratio. So we target a budgetary loss ratio that is driven by our expense ratio and we've been able to drive that down some. I think about maybe about 0.5 point there. So you're just looking at the loss ratio. Combined ratio, obviously, calendar year-over-year is down a bit. Exit the year, yes, up a bit, but very confident, as Glenn said, that we are pricing to our targets and are a good place rate level wise. Ian Gutterman : Okay. Because I guess what surprised me a little bit, John, was I thought normally, I'd have to go double check this, but I thought normally we would see in a period of a lot of releases and especially when those releases are coming from the most recent accident year, releases would be driven by severity coming in better than expected. And if that was the case, that would probably help your picks for the current year, right? So just seems odd to me that the picks are going up at the same time development is getting better. I would have thought those would go in the same direction? John Sauerland : I don't - I'm not sure I understand what you mean by picks are going up? Ian Gutterman : I guess what I'm saying just again, if you look at your overall 2015 loss ratios, you're basically flat year-over-year. But developments helped about 3 points - it changed. Development's been about a 3 point help year to date. So on an accident year basis, you've deteriorated by that amount year to date. So it seems like the 2015 accident year is being reserved to a higher loss ratio than the 2014 accident year. And the reason the calendar year's the same is because the reserve at least is from 2014. John Sauerland : The prior year development is actually a little less than 2 points to start with. So I'm not sure where the 3 is coming from? Ian Gutterman : I was doing the delta in it. That's okay. I'll move on I guess. The other thing Glenn, just - Glenn Renwick : Let me just make a point here and I'm not sure I'm directly on your question. But, historically, we will react very quickly to trends because the penalty for not doing so is severe. Occasionally, we get out ahead of trend and it doesn't materialize or competitors don't necessarily take the rate increase. Our - if you want to put it in the highest terms, our penalty function for being out in front of trends that maybe doesn't materialize, is wider margins. Here we think we've actually got our pricing very close to what our run rate accident year would need to be So, to me, I don't think about a deterioration in loss ratio as necessarily a positive or a negative. I'm much more focused on the target that we're trying to achieve under the different market conditions. So, if we get out ahead, and we've done that, we actually end up with wider margins. This is a time I don't think we're out ahead, I think we can bring in a good volume of new business at and our renewals with it, at our objective targets. So that deterioration seems like a negative. I would caution at least for me, to say we're moving towards our more optimal ordered peer of pricing target for profitability and the ability to grow as fast as possible which is exactly what we say is our primary objective. Ian Gutterman : That make sense. Just real quick, on the - I guess this is as much a severity question as frequency. But I believe the National Highway data showed an increase in vehicular deaths this year and talking to some of the life insurance companies who have seen some adverse mortality, they've discussed an increase in auto related deaths. Have you seen that pickup and has that been an impact on severity at all? Glenn Renwick : You know what, I'm not really able to be informative on that one. You're probably right on all points but I don't have that information. I would just be speculating and I don't like to do that. Operator : Your next question or comment Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Paul Newsome : Sorry to beat a dead horse here, could we talk a little bit about the favorable reserve development and the components thereof in the first half of the year? They do seem a little bit larger than what you have historically had. And, if I recall, you folks are one of the better ones at trying to actually get dead on over time. Is there changes in the reserving philosophy? Is there anything particular that's driving a little bit of an increase in the favorable development? Glenn Renwick : Why don't you take that with certainly the philosophy is no change and then we've got Gary, our Chief Actuary with us. Let's let John take that and Gary come in. John Sauerland : Sure. We have been quite accurate over the past several years when it comes to reserving and it is always our objective of being as close as possible. So there's been absolutely no change in reserving philosophy. The year-to-date experience has simply been that severity, especially for BI, has come in materially lower than we expect. If you look at a long-term trend line of BI severity, it's very positive. So I think 3 or 4 points a year, we are down below that right now and we think that is due to some improvements in our claims handling. We think it's a good problem to have. This doesn't mean that we'll dial everything down quickly to the new experience, but Gary is certainly watching that closely and will adjust as appropriate. We're seeing the improvement across business lines so that's another indication that there may be a handling improvement that we are seeing within our claims organization because their claims organization handles all lines within the same order. So we feel great about the BI severity trends we've seen and we'll take the adjustments as we see fit. On the property side, we have taken some adjustments there as well. It's been a little more in terms of percentage of losses then on the vehicle side. We're just beginning to really ensure the process around those reserves and Gary is getting very engaged with folks who run ASI to ensure we have similarly design processes around the ASI reserves. Anything you want to add to that, Gary? Gary Traicoff : I think that's a very good answer by John. The only thing I would add to that is geographically, the development we're seeing is fairly consistent across most states as well. It's not just a few states driving the development that you are seeing and the improvement in the loss costs. Glenn Renwick : And Gary, why don't you do the split commercial personal auto? Gary Traicoff : And respect to commercial versus personal auto, we are seeing fairly favorable development in both of those sides. On the commercial side, the development is more so in our business auto and contractors business and that's making up roughly about $40 million or so the development that you are seeing this year. Paul Newsome : Do you anticipate that as the property comes on that we'll see a little bit different reserve pattern over time? My sense is that it's a little bit easier to be dead on, on auto book than it is on a home book. Maybe I'm wrong with that. John Sauerland : I think it's a little early for us to project what we'll see there down the road. I think it's a little early to answer that in our case. Glenn Renwick : Yes, keep asking it, Paul. But our overall philosophy will be pretty much as you've known it for an awful long time. We're not interested in worrying about what this report in a calendar year. We live accident year and just ASI. So we will always attempt to get that right because that's pricing in the marketplace and we know we have to price to. Paul Newsome : And just one quick one if I can squeeze it in that has nothing to do with the reserves. On the new product, platinum, that increase in commission, is that a straight commission increase or is that related to a contingent commission? Glenn Renwick : There's components of both. Components of both, so agents should see this as quite favorable. So, we're - I'll just hit some top line issues when looking at all the details but if I'm an agent producing, I will absolutely get an immediate recognition of more commission. Certainly from the Progressive side, it will be additive to what I would have otherwise got. Then, there is a level at which you can attain different compensation overrides later, based on certain levels of production. And, while I know that, I couldn't explain them all to you right this second. We're very comfortable that that level of commission puts us in a competitor situation, not necessarily overly competitive, but agents certainly will not be able to say, gee, I would love to use you but your commission isn't quite there what I might get from another carrier. It's in that ballpark and those that actually use us very well, can even expect more than that. We've made what I would call, not a concession, just a marketing approach. It will be a very small percentage of our policies in force but we've also tried to coordinate policy periods so that those who are truly committed to that destination type of situation that we've been talking to you about, can have an annual policy and a home policy with comparent or simultaneous renewal dates. Those sorts of things are changes. We know the pluses and minuses of doing those sorts of things but they've been very well received by agents so far. I can't give you a great deal of insight as to platinum's receptivity. We'll be in the market in Texas about 40 days as of the end of the quarter. Indiana I think snuck in just in the quarter, if I remember correctly. I don't know if we wrote a policy in the quarter, but we are in there and will continue to roll that out. I will tell you that the initial receptivity from sales folks, now sales folks tend to have a way of being more excited than sometimes I am, is very, very positive. So I'd be disappointed if that wasn't the case. But I can't give you a really good feel right now about incremental volume over the offerings that the agent already had. We are certainly of the belief that is incremental. We just don't have a good sizing on that that would feel comfortable giving to you at this point in time. Operator : Your next question or comment Meyer Shields from KBW Meyer Shields : Thanks, good morning. This is going to be a little bit long but we are seeing an increase in average commercial policy size despite the fact that the results are phenomenal. So I'm assuming that's mix shift. First, is that true? And second, if it is, does it drive your combined ratio closer to 96 faster than it would've been if you just allow trends to erode the excess profits embedded in rates? Glenn Renwick : Only in a friendly way, Meyer. There is no such thing as excess profits. There is absolutely some to that. Our commercial business in general, and we gave you this in the Q, is average premiums are actually up period across the board. Is that on all segments? Yes, but is it more dramatic in some segments? Also, yes. So the mix shift towards for higher business, transportation and specialty lines, with the higher average premiums, absolutely that's part of it. The second part of the question, was should we expect erosion on the combined ratio because of that? The answer is, not by design in any way shape or form. We try to price all pieces of our business, we call them CMT, doesn't really matter just market tiers, commercial market tiers. So we are looking for the same kind of margin in each segment. Why we have been able to get rate and have a good loss results is in large part reflective of the market really hardened in those segments and there are less availability of carriers that we're benefiting from that. We are happy to do that. We don't think that will last forever. And you also use 96 in some cases. We don't price every segment through a 96. Our clear explanation in the annual report is all - the amalgam of all of our products comes to a 96. So in places where we believe there are higher risks, and there are higher risks in commercial simply because you have lower unit numbers and lower losses to deal with. So our, what we will call indications, always have a little bit more volatility to them, so we include volatility in part of our targets. A lot in there but no, you shouldn't assume that because we have a slight mix change to the all higher segments, which is driving average premium, that necessarily that should drive the lost costs. We price each piece to be consistent with our targets. John Sauerland : I might add to that, that in the Q we did tell you [indiscernible] business for commercial average premium there is up 20% to 25%. So that clearly is indicative of the shift that Glenn mentioned. We look very closely at the profitability by new business and by renewal business and by the marketing tiers that Glenn mentioned. And we not only feel great about our profitability and aggregate, we feel great about new and renewal by all of those marketing tiers. We're watching that pretty closely and it is shifting for sure, but we're feeling pretty good about what's going on. Glenn Renwick : Just two other segments that we'll just comment on is that more recent, or let's just say later in the quarter, we started to see a little bit more active growth in our business auto which is the higher number of units but lower average premium business. So we're starting to see some growth in that. The first growth really came in the four higher segments. Not yet at all confirmed, but we're starting to see an uptick in the contractor business. And that may be a little bit more reflective of some declines and now just a little bit more recovery in the economy. But at least we're starting to see the early signs, don't think we'll be able to comment with any veracity until at least another quarter, but we're starting to see some early signs. So the incoming quoting mix changed but it's also starting to change again and for us, that's a very good thing. A good balance book is great. Meyer Shields : Okay, that was very thorough. Thank you. I understand that you don't report comprehensive loss cost trends because there's a lot of volatility there related to the weather. But if you look other components of it, and I'm thinking here specifically of theft. Is there any sort of macroeconomic trend? I don't know if people are doing better economically. Is there a reduction in theft or anything like that? Glenn Renwick : Good question. I see Gary scrambling for some notes here. I don't have an answer for you but he may. Gary Traicoff : What I have in front of me, is in terms of total comprehensive trends and this would be excluding cat information. What we are seeing, severity is running around 3% to 4%, frequency is relatively flat. I don't have the theft broken out right now but that's easy enough to get if we want to get that information. John Sauerland : Gary was quoting the most recent quarter numbers there. Gary Traicoff : Correct. Glenn Renwick : Hopefully the long-term trend on that will be very favorable and I mean long-term trend. But pretty soon, cars will be able to tell you exactly where they are, so hopefully we'll lose less of them or the criminals might get smarter. I don't know. Operator : Your next question or comment Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. First question, can you give us an update on the success you're having or traction with the new Snapshot product in the agency segment? Glenn Renwick : Sure. Snapshot continues to be a big exciting venture for us. Probably the biggest things we've done, we gave you an update at the IR meeting. What brought it into the marketplace, the terminology internally we use is 3.0. Don't worry too much about that. And we put it in concert with the most recent overall personal lines product design and that's out now five to six states something like that. In the four states that I have received data on and looked at, here are a couple of the points that are notable. The increase in usage of Snapshot by the agents has gone up fairly significantly but still at a low level. That's important. Absolutely, we achieved something that we were setting out to achieve. Did we get to a level that we would say approximates the direct? No. So think of that as more in the 10% range in terms of usage by agents. Whereas, with regard to direct, think about it a little bit more in the 30% to 40% range. We're not going to give absolute estimates on that but I'll give you those ranges and you can assume that they are very accurate. One of the things that is important to us in Snapshot is that if you take the customers that specifically are now indirect, that are using a multi-product quoting mechanism, actually the numbers are considerably higher. So those who intend to buy multi-product from us, are quoting and buying at rates closer to 45%, 50% using Snapshot. So we're actually very excited about that. A term that we may have used in the discussions in May is sort of the future Robinsons. Obviously, we use Robinsons but the future Robinsons, those Diane's that are transitioning. That group is showing a high propensity to consider Snapshot. So when I say Diane's it could be with a renters product, it could be those that have become just early Robinsons. It's filling a niche that's very useful to us and when you start getting into those numbers, while we can continue to say there are parts of the population that are just still saying no, I don't want that level of intrusion in my vehicle, whatever their reasons are for that. So we're not expecting 100% by any stretch of the imagination. But it's a pretty good part of the marketplace that we actually want and expect to be a big part of our destination era. There are those that are buying more traditionally nonstandard, which we clearly continue to want to offer. They're not always interested in having quite that level of active involvement in their insurance and they may or may not keep it very long. But those that we want to be with us at the best rates are actually showing very high take rates. So comfortable with that, I gave you some information on the mileage driven. In terms of our discounts, we're comfortable that at renewal we're seeing something around 60% plus of people actually getting their renewal quote which gives them at least the discounts we advance to them at point-of-sale. Now there's still another percentage they're actually getting a discount but maybe not quite as much as we advanced at the point-of-sale. So that general 70/30 we've shown you in the past, is suggesting that there is still sort of 70%-ish, possibly a little more, little less depending on the state, that are benefiting from the Snapshot. So the greater good theory here is clearly working in our favor. There are a percent of those that are not exposed to a significant increase. And then, frankly there are those that use a disproportionate amount of the loss costs and we are applying a surcharge with this new model and we recognize that that will be, for those individuals either a non-renewal or reluctant renewal, whatever that might be. However, as long as the numbers are as favorable as we see them, we're comfortable that we've got a good design out in the marketplace that can sustain and match loss costs better with the individual. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. And then, next question just curious. I see that you added two new states in agency segment for the PHA program. How is that going to play off against the platinum product? Is there going to be both PHA and platinum in states? Certain agents gets one then the other? How is that going to work going forward? Glenn Renwick : You got it. That's essentially how it's going to work. There are agents that are very happy to have ASI home and Progressive. But I'm not necessarily the agent that says, this is a must have. I'm going to build around this and put it as one of my primary providers. But those who are willing to make that commitment, we are willing to commit more and that's what the platinum program is all about. And I will tell you, that the interest from agents is meeting expectations at that level. Now I'm doing a personal commercial. But, frankly, I wouldn't take the bet against a combination of ASI and Progressive for the future. What we can do when we get the data together, I think we can really provide agents a serious, serious product for their bundled higher end customers. And I think many are accepting that. John Sauerland : I'd add onto that commercial and say, the first step is the renters for a lot of households. And, in the states in which we've rolled our renters so far, we appoint 75% to 80%-ish of our agents with the renters program. So they can bundle auto and renters. We get better retention when we have that package. We have a far greater likelihood of graduating them to the home and auto package as well. Obviously, that's with a little tighter distribution with PHA. And then, yes, the pinnacle or platinum set agents is an even tighter distribution. Julia Hornack : This is Julia. Thank you so much for everybody's questions today. We have great participation and quite a few people still in queue and we're running out of time. So I'd just like to encourage people to limit their questions to one question and one follow-up please. Thank you. Operator : Your next question or comment Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple quick ones I think. Hopefully quick ones on the property business with ARX. I would say during the quarter, net written premiums grew a little more than we would have expected. I'm wondering if there's any portion of that that we can attribute to higher retention or different reinsurance buying or anything along those lines? Glenn Renwick : No. Why don't we try to give you a little bit of insight to those numbers. I know they're confusing in some parts. There will be some changes in the way we address direct written premium with the reinsurance accounting and so on and so forth. Bottom line is, ARX's first quarter and second quarter were not dramatically different. While we didn't have ownership at the levels we have and consolidated reporting, so we haven't given you that. But if you really want to look, you can find the statutory numbers out there. And I'd tell you the second quarter is roughly the same as the first. But nothing in this league of dramatic that is worth reporting or dramatic change in retention. Frankly, in the 90 days, while we are extremely happy with everything that's going on, there is nothing dramatic to report. Ryan Tunis : Okay. And then I guess just on the expense ratio ex the - John Sauerland : I would just reiterate what Glenn said, we had a change in the way we account for a reinsurance obligations that take place normally around June and December each year. That net written premium may not be wholly indicative of the growth rate. The direct written premium will be much more indicative of the actual growth rate. So I would focus on that number. We can't obviously report prior year because we didn't have the ownership stake. So we can't give you apples to apples right now. Their second quarter statutory data will come out fairly soon and you'll be able to see the direct written premium growth in those statements. I also add though, that while growth in homeowners is great, the more important growth is growth in bundles. So that was the intent of the transaction and come together far more closely than it previously did. And that's where we're going to get the biggest benefit. If we could overnight bundle the entire ARX book with auto, we'd be way happier than growing the homeowner piece. So just want to reiterate that's the intent of what we're trying to do there. Glenn Renwick : And closely coupled with that, when we talk bundled, you should think policy life expectancy and amortization of fixed expenses and the like and improvement typically in loss costs. So those are the things that really are, as I think I wrote once before, the currency of this transaction. Ryan Tunis : Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just on the expense ratio. Again, trying to reconcile that ARX to some of the stat data we seen. I thin ex amortization costs, so the low 30s? I mean is that a good run rate to use going forward, or is there anything we should be thinking about there in terms of a drop off in expenses or anything of the like? John Sauerland : I would make two comments on that. We do have Trevor Hillier, the CFO of ASI here with us. First, I want to clarify a comment I made earlier in the call talking about our expense ratio being down 0.5 point. That is on the vehicle side of personal lines side. You add in the ARX expense ratio and look at our total, we're flatter. But the ASI expense ratio net of amortization expenses, is more in the low 20s. I think 24-ish. Correct me if I'm wrong on that. Trevor? Trevor Hillier : That's correct. It's between 23% and 24%. We've held that for a few periods. I think one thing you mentioned was comparing our statutory numbers with the numbers reported in the Progressive numbers. Is that correct? Ryan Tunis : I did, yes. Trevor Hillier : The difference there is mainly with our consolidated group that's reported with Progressive includes our managing general agents which is not included in the statutory results. The statutory results are just insurance companies. So, it won't reconcile one to one. Operator : Your next question or comment Todd Bault with Citi. Todd Bault : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a variant question on something you raised earlier about high growth rates could change nicks. For what it's worth, our research has shown that over the last few years, you've done a pretty good job of your pricing and loss trend tracking each other. Within a couple of points of course. Who knows if that's correct. But, knowing what you know about your pricing and monitoring systems, if you went through a period where your pricing was more or less tracking your loss trends, would that have an ancillary effect of maintaining your portfolio homogeneity? In other words, your risks would be more or less as you expect it. Or those played independent. In other words, could you have pricing track loss trend well but you could still have pretty large shifts in homogeneity. And that's all I have. Thanks. Glenn Renwick : No I think that our intent is to always have pricing track out losses and to the extent that a new inflow of business changes the homogeneity of the book in place, it's always easier to manage a static book. It's not much fun, but it's easier. The real question is, is the new incoming mix equivalent to, similar to, different than, what you currently have? And we don't expect that to necessarily be the case. In fact, and this is conjecture, so not a statement of fact. Everything we are doing and seeing and I've reported several of the trends today, Snapshot usage, how that's trending to multi-product customers, the notion of platinum, we have every reason to believe the mix of business coming in may be more preferred overall than what we've seen before. So that would be positive. And then, your pricing unlikely to have any great effect, but should be positive to the loss costs. Operator : Your next question or comment Al Copersino with Columbia Management. Al Copersino : Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to a couple earlier questions just because I personally was a bit confused and that's probably my own fault. In response to questions from Ian, you all spoke about the importance of looking at the overall calendar year combined ratio. In response to questions from Meyer, I believe you said that your focus is on the accident year more so than the calendar year. And so, number one, I want to make sure I understood that right and maybe there are two separate issues being discussed. And then the second verily in part of that was, it does appear, as Ian was saying, that the reserve for leases remain strong but the underlying loss ratio continues to be higher. I don't know if that should be cause for concern or if that should be cause for future optimism. That the reserve releases may in fact be a leading indicator of an eventual improvement in the underlying loss ratio. I wonder if you could respond to those two issues? Glenn Renwick : I will try. I don't remember the specific reference to calendar but that may be me. Let me just suggest to you, as far as I'm concerned, we think in terms of accident year most of the time. Calendar year is just an adjustment for the quality defects and reserving in a previous period. So accident year, for me, is almost exclusively the way we like to look at the business. Clearly, we all understand that those adjustments are made from an accounting perspective. But accident year is probably a better way to look at the economics verses the accounting. I thought I'd try to get at this with Ian's question, maybe I wasn't clear. Degradation in the loss ratio under certain circumstances might be a really bad situation. If on the other hand, the loss ratio was lower than your previously designed target, then it might be perfectly acceptable to move toward your target. Clearly not acceptable to go beyond your target. If and when market conditions are such that you're willing to give up a point of loss ratio and get what you consider to be proportionate volume or the elasticity of the market is willing to give it to you, then those are trade outs that not only do we make, it's sort of the heart and soul of what we say is the guiding principles of Progressive. And that is, we attempt to make a 4% underwriting profit. If and when we do, we try to go as fast as possible. And it's very much that sequence and we are quite comfortable right now seeing that the market will give us some growth and we want to be priced as close to our target as we can. So, hopefully that clarifies it. But think accident year is by far more of the economics of the Company, the calendar year is the accounting. Operator : Your next question or comment Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Josh Shanker : Thank you for getting me in at the end. I appreciate always all the tools you give us to analyze things. And I asked this question on the Allstate conference call but not sure that I'm any smarter. Can you tell me the difference between paid frequency trends and incurred frequency trends? And to the extent is incurred frequency generally a more leading indicator? Glenn Renwick : I'm actually probably going to ask Gary to determine that. I will tell you that from my perspective, I spend most of my time on incurred. Paid may or may not be an indicator not necessarily one way or another, sort of which way ultimately your prior trend pricks might be adjusted. But Gary spends more of his time on this. If I were you, I would focus more on incurred frequency. Gary Traicoff : This is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. I think just to add to Glenn's point, we look at both. But I typically rely more on the incurred frequency as opposed to paid. A couple of the issues you could have with paid frequency is when you changes in closer rate for example, that could distort what you're paid frequency looks like. Whereas, the incurred frequency should be a lot more stable. Josh Shanker : And when you spoke about July frequency being up, is that a spike relative to July 2014 or relative to June 2015? John Sauerland : I think we should clarify the earlier comments. Glenn said, vehicle miles traveled are up in July. He didn't say frequency was up in July. Josh Shanker : Good point. John Sauerland : He also commented that the mix of types of trips has changed. So I think of it as gas prices have gotten more competitive, more people are taking vacations instead of staycations this summer. We did not say frequency is up in July, miles traveled is up and up more than it's been. I think we showed you back in May, it's been up for a number of months now and July took a little further tick up. Operator : Your next question or comment Vinay Misquith with Sterne Agee. Vinay Misquith : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on one thing, the accident year combined ratio ex cats on the personal lines business. So the first quarter year-over-year, my numbers show that the accident year combined was up around 2.9 points. Second quarter, that slows down to plus 0.6 points. So curious as to what's happening there. Why is the rate of deterioration slowing? Have you been taking pricing up or have loss cost trends slowed recently? Glenn Renwick : You want to do that one, John? John Sauerland : I'm not sure what numbers you're looking at. So you're saying accident year loss ratio through the first quarter of 2014 relative to the first quarter of 2015? And then second quarter 2014 versus second quarter 2015? Vinay Misquith : Yes, and that's following the personal lines, correct. I'm talking about the combined ratio. John Sauerland : You're talking about the accident year combined ratio. The expense ratio will be the same. So the loss ratio would be the driver of those. Vinay Misquith : Yes. John Sauerland : I'd go back to Glenn's answer on that issue. We are always pricing the business to - and I would add maybe a little confusion to what he had said actually and say when we price business, we're pricing the lifetime combined ratios. So there are instances where we are growing segments faster or slower and the new business is always going to be a different combined ratio than renewal business. And the mix of that business can drive calendar effects.  We are pricing to the lifetime combined ratio by segment but we are also managing the Company to that 96 or better calendar year constantly. So there's a couple different objective functions we are meeting there. And I think again, we're really comfortable with our pricing across all business lines and we think we are doing exactly what Glenn said which is meeting or beating that 96 and we want to grow as fast as we can. Glenn Renwick : I would also encourage you to think about, at least in the case of Progressive, is pricing is more of a continuous variable than a discrete variable that happens every so often. We give you in the Q, the average premium, the rate of increase of average premium. You can see that's reasonably healthy which is also going to affect the loss ratio as long as that average premium is going up faster than the rate of increase in the pure premium. So just factor all of those things in. There are a lot of moving parts. This is more an informational comment. One of the things that we do is we track all rate revisions done on a monthly basis. That's usually for us, that we track about 200 to 400 rate revisions. So think 50 states, many carriers.  We are seeing on average, and I cluster the last data points because it's quite a variable function. As I cluster the last data points, I'm seeing the market rate of increase at about 2.6 give or take. And there is a give or take to that. And we gave you an average premium increase of 4% in our personal lines business. So we are at least sort of keeping up with that or perhaps our pricing got ahead of that and others are now perhaps catching up.  We also have some mechanisms in our rate. In many states, we're actually continuously taking just a little bit. It doesn't account for a great deal, but it means that each time we can stop on the discrete event of having to adjust for rates. So don't be surprised that you'll see over time, a little bit of closer even in the situation that you are recognizing other than our pricing targets, which is the biggest one, but you will see premiums change at a slightly different rate than pure premiums and in some part that's by design. Julia Hornack : We find ourselves just past the top of the hour. Operator, I'm going to turn it back over to you for closing scripts.

[Operator Instructions] In addition, this conference is being recorded at the request of Progressive. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. The company will not make detailed comments in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website, and will use this conference call to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the call will be Julia Hornack. At this time, I will turn the call over to Ms. Hornack. Julia Hornack : Good morning. Welcome to Progressive's conference call. Participating on today's call are Glenn Renwick, our CEO; John Sauerland, our CFO; and Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer. The call is scheduled to last about an hour.  As always, our discussions on this call may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during this call. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K and our first quarter 2015 quarterly report on Form 10-Q, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements relating to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the risks, uncertainties and other challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investors page of our website, progressive.com. Tory, we are now ready to take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Vinay Misquith from Sterne Agee Center. Vinay Misquith : So the hot topic of discussion, I guess, is frequency. So I'd be curious to hear from you, what changed this quarter? Was it the past for the higher frequency? Was it individual states? And what do you think is going to happen for the future? Glenn Renwick : Yes, sure. And I can easily understand why that'd be a topic. So let's try to give as much color as possible. Tell me if I'm being responsive to your questions. If I look at frequency, the one thing I would tell you, at least I would encourage you, look at the time sequence of frequency because individual data points can be sort of interesting, but all over the map. So if we look at sort of through the second quarter, we were right in line with the industry. And so nothing particularly notable there on frequency. And we did have, and I'm sure it's been a story, obviously, a couple of companies, big companies, very credible companies reported frequency that was considerably higher than the industry. This quarter, we're reporting frequency up and not dramatically so. So I'm going to break that down a little bit and try to give you a sense of how with -- or our thinking around that is. So BI and PD are sort of in the 4 range. And frankly, from my perspective, if you remember, this time a year ago, we're at negative. So recognize percentage change over a prior data point is important as well. But 3 to 5, I would tell you, my expectations of any reasonable period of time, maybe not a single data point or a quarter, 3 to 5 on bodily injury tells me, sort of, we're in reasonable normal range. So we're not seeing anything on frequency that is shocking or different than or inconsistent with our expectations for the future. And I say expectations for the future because that's what it all comes down to is how are you priced for June of next year, not necessarily tomorrow. So the one place on frequency that I would say is a bit more of a call-out is the collision. Collision is up around 6%. And while it hasn't necessarily been a data point consistent with prior data points, it's not inconsistent with what we would see as the macroeconomic forces. We've reported and others have reported. I think we can do it in a little bit more quick manner that mileage on a \"month over month over month\" basis is up about 4%. So miles driven definitely are up. We measure that through our Snapshot. I have the most recent month, and that seems to be consistent with the annual trend. We have 1 or 2 spikes, Labor Day weekend, those sorts of things. But for the most part, I think of mileage being up 4% year-over-year. That's really consistent with the trend on gasoline consumption, but again, we've got too many factors to go into there with gas efficiencies and so on and so forth. So we know that, that's a driver. I would say, as you think about the effective frequency, you also factor in, of course, severity. And we are in a very nice position with our severity management, specifically on our bodily injury claims. So you actually see our severity there almost offsetting the frequency. That's a string I don't expect to last forever. We're always trying to improve our claims processes. And you know that they're certainly ones we're very, very proud of, but we've found ways that we think we can even improve that. That's been an ongoing initiative inside of claims. So we have a nice offset for now, but frequency will be the thing to watch. But we are not shocked that it's in that sort of longer-term, normal range, or I call it normal range, 3 to 5. Collision has both a frequency uptick and a severity uptick. That would be something that while it doesn't cause us headaches from a reserving perspective as much as a bodily injury or UMPD might, that's certainly something that, as you would detect hopefully from my letter, don't get behind on pricing. Make sure that we don't assume that today's prices last forever. And the key for us, and I -- hopefully, I tried to give a little color on this, if you take all of these factors, a little bit of a change in frequency, definitely some moving parts in severity, try to see what the real norms are, try to project the future and make sure that we take that pricing in increments that doesn't disturb our momentum and doesn't shock our customers and certainly doesn't get us behind the eight ball. That's clearly a very complex set of estimations, but that's the real issue for now. And I don't see any signs of either frequency or severity that are unmanageable in the light of being able to also be able to be very nimble and quick and adjusting our pricing. And I'll come back to a statement that we made, because all of this can be summarized with a rather pithy phrase we made at our IR meeting that said 3 1s are better than 1 3. And what we meant there was recognizing all these changes happen, next month's single-quarter points will be different. It's really just matching that trend over time. And the single biggest macro driver, frequency, I would agree with most of the other comments in the industry, mileages there. I noted last time, you also need to be very conscious of mileage and how it's being used. So trips over 15 miles, that is the place we're actually seeing mileage increasing versus the commuting to work more often. That clearly doesn't happen. Does that hit most of your request? Vinay Misquith : Yes, it does. In fact, just to follow up on that, so you hit a good point that severity for Progressive is about minus 1. We've seen for the industry more in the 3% to 5% range. So if you put it all together, frequency, as you said, 3% to 5%, and let's say that severity caused that to normalize levels. Progressive, I believe, is raising rates around 4%. Do you anticipate Progressive having to raise rates more near term? Number one. And number two is would you be willing to sacrifice near-term profitability since everybody's hurting? And so would you be willing to let your combineds go up near term so that you can gain share? And then sort of price it back up in 2017? Glenn Renwick : Two questions in there. First of all, our current pricing actually is in very good shape. I'm not going to give you our indications, but I -- probably more than I've ever done before. We'd tell you instantaneously, our indications are not positive. So that's a good place to be. The real issue is taking a little bit of rate to stay on the crest of the breaking wave and not go over it. That is the challenge, and that's the challenge I outlined. I don't think, a, I am willing and nor do I think it is necessary for us to sacrifice our #1 commitment to shareholders, and that is to produce an aggregate 96 for our products. For a close observer, you will notice that Direct, which is growing very, very well, will have, at least on an accident year basis, a little bit of pressure on it relative to that 96. It's a complicated message to say we'll never sacrifice the 96. But can I expect that with a higher and very satisfactory inflow of new business in Direct, that I would be more comfortable operating an accident year aggregate for that part of the business, higher than a 96? You bet you. Because we know how that business runs up. We have high confidence. We're not betting on the future. That's a simple bet. And if we can take on the new business where we think that's appropriate, we're going to do that. So don't expect us to be moving in directions of cutting back our advertising. We think we've got the momentum. We're going to keep that momentum. We're just going to keep a little bit of rate coming along so that our rates stay and keep us on the crest of that wave. And frankly, these are market conditions that are extraordinary for us. And it's up to us to make sure that we ride them out as best we possibly can. John Sauerland : If I could just add to that, this is John, if we allow that calendar or accident year period for Direct to drift up to the 97, we're still very confident that business is running out on a lifetime basis at or materially below that 96 combined ratio. And the other business segments we run, we don't necessarily target a 96, so we think that our different businesses having different target margins, depending upon the marketplace, their appetite. But again, the aggregate we are always very conscientious around running that below the calendar year 96. Operator : Our next question is from Ryan Tunis with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ryan Tunis : I guess, my first question, Glenn, I was a little bit surprised to hear you talk about BI frequency, and a 3% to 5% range seemed normal. Because I think back in Investor Day, you talked about contemplating a longer-term downtick secularly in frequency. So I'm just wondering if that's normal for now, or if there's a change there, now you're thinking about frequency longer term. Glenn Renwick : Yes, that's fair to call out now, Ryan. My career has been based on something that might not be the next 30 years as well, so 3% to 5% is how I've always felt. I think that's how we feel is the norm for now, to the extent there are pressures, macro pressures in terms of vehicle technology and so on and so forth, but that will change. But the likely influence of that in the short term is going to be so small that it won't change my 3% to 5% for some time. But do I believe that 30 years from now, we'll be sitting with different measures? Probably. John Sauerland : Just add to that, so Glenn started out saying we should be looking at a trend series as opposed to a data point. And absolutely, if you look at the very long-term trend, a positive number on frequency and a negative number on severity is not what we expect. And as we showed you at Investor Day, has not been the case for the past 4 decades or so. So important to think of the longer term. Again, the most important question is are we priced for tomorrow and for next year. And as Glenn said, we feel pretty confident where we're sitting, and we continue to have robust appetite for growth. Ryan Tunis : Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting gears, I guess, to thinking about capital management, growth this year has been robust. Obviously, you've grown in Home, which is a little bit more of a capital-intensive product as well. And I think in the past, obviously, you've been able to play some capital at year-end via special dividend. I'm just wondering how we should think about balancing organic growth and capital return heading into the end of the year relative to maybe what you did like 2012 and 2013. Glenn Renwick : I think we get this question -- I'm actually smiling a little bit, I'm hopeful -- in my response, if we get this question about this time each year, and let's just -- let the year play out. The special dividend, you have the means to determine where we stand on that. So that's not a secret in any way, shape or form and any other capital management would have said the same thing so many times that we care a great deal about effective capital management, good capital husbandry. And if we think there is something more to do, we'll do it if there are other options. But we've always said, we want to invest in the business. We've got some nice growth going. We can fund that growth. That's great. But if there are other opportunities, that would be used. And if not, we'll return on the leveraged capital if we think that's the right thing to do. But we just don't make forward-looking statements on that. And frankly, there's enough volatility in the investment marketplaces to just say, \"Let's just -- let's count it on the day that we're supposed to count it.\" Ryan Tunis : That makes sense. And then I just want to sneak one more in on Agency. I think, Glenn, you highlighted in your letter that renewal -- that the renewal -- or the retention measures in Agency still are lagging a little bit on the new issued apps. I'm just wondering if you had to take more rate in Agency, that would seemingly put more pressure on renewals. I mean, is it reasonable to think that if you had to take more rate in the Agency channel, you could still generate pith [ph] growth there? Glenn Renwick : Yes, it is. And I want to sort of try to measure this. This is -- comes back to the same statement I just said, 3 1s better than 1 3. It's a question of how you take rate. We have certainly been on these calls and told you that we've taken rate in larger quantities. That was absolutely the right thing to do. We needed to do it. But it has an equal and opposite offset on affecting consumers and putting consumers into the shopping marketplace. Clearly, there's no perfect number, but we do a lot of work on elasticity of the consumer relative to the size of rate change that they can absorb. And also, you have to sort of factor in the competitive environment. So right now, we're seeing a lot of rate action, greater rate action than we ever needed to take this year in all channels, but certainly, the Agency channel. And as a result, we're competitive in that channel and it's shown by our new apps. Can we sustain a gradual rate increase to match our future expectations of trend? Yes, I think we absolutely can and shouldn't be assumed that it's quite as dramatic as a binary kind of take rate, therefore, growth comes up. We're really trying to signal. And my comment, while designed or not, about the paranoia that I have is exactly that. It's how can you just keep creeping your rate in. And for some close observers of Progressive, we actually have some things built in structurally to our rate order in many states where we actually have ways of matching continuous inflation or trend. And those are ways to keep all changes relatively low, so we don't shock the consumer, and we don't want to do that, but at the same time, keep up with trends. So the answer to your question is, we almost certainly will have to take some rate in all channels over a reasonable period of time. This is not an industry where rates yet are systemically going down. So we'll do that. The real question and the only question I think is on the table for the continued momentum of Progressive, can we match that in small increments and stay right with inflation, and we have a perfect opportunity to be able to do that. Operator : Our next question is from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Joshua Shanker : A question about the variable dividend. I saw the note in the 10-Q. I'm just wondering, is that at your discretion? If underwriting income were below comprehensive income, could the -- the board can do anything, could you choose to pay the dividend anyways? Glenn Renwick : Let me answer that a little bit -- I'll answer it, but the board has final discretion. The board also has discretion to do a special dividend. So they have a lot of discretion. So my comment about managing capital, there is clear discretion built in. With regard to the trigger, it'll either trigger or it won't trigger. If we gave you an analysis as of right this moment, it would be different than the analysis at the end of the quarter. So this -- the variable dividend is designed to give to the board a very clear set of understanding. If it triggers, expect it to be paid. If it doesn't trigger, yes, there is some discretion. Joshua Shanker : And can I assume that the circumstances that have led to this condition right now are not the circumstances that this trigger mechanism was designed for in the first place? Glenn Renwick : No, I wouldn't say that. No. Think about it from a shareholder perspective. We're having a great banner year in terms of operations. I fully respect that. But even if it's on a total mark-to-market basis, if your capital is not doing what you want it to do, then you might question the logic of giving it back at that point in time. And that's what the trigger was designed to, at least, be in place to do. It worked exactly as designed in 2008, and I admit that was a much more dramatic set of circumstances where the operating income was positive. But clearly, the mark-to-market on our portfolio suggested it would not have been the right move to do. This year, you know the market as well as I do. It's interesting that we were close. And when I say close, well, I mean close. So we'll just let that one play out. But no, it was in place to do exactly this situation. And relevant to your first question, if you ever had a situation, and please do not try to read more into my statement than just what I'm saying, if you ever had a situation that was simply -- that doesn't make sense, then that's why a discretion was put into place as part of the whole dividend structure. Operator : Next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : So one question on the severity, and I'm trying to think the best way to ask this, was the moderation in BI severity a function of the frequency increases? But if you look at the same sort of claims, you're seeing the same rate of increasing costs. Or is there something else going on? Glenn Renwick : That's a good observation. Certainly, you could say there are a higher frequency of smaller claims coming in, and that will clearly change your severity. And that probably has a contributing piece, but I would tell you the greater contribution has been a very orchestrated initiative in that claims organization to take a very close look at specials, managing the specials appropriately, and there are literally hundreds of ways that -- to do that and to do it accurately and correctly, making sure that we have our liability assessments. As we grow, we always have newer people. So it's a never-ending job to keep going back and making sure liability determinations and contributory damages and the like are absolutely taken into account in the right way. So those initiatives are absolutely in place, and we're seeing some very positive results from them. I would tell you our specials to general ratio is going down. These are all active managements. So I would read in most of the change in severity to be active management as opposed to mix-driven. John Sauerland : And just for clarifications, when we say specials, we mean the medical cost portion of the bodily injury claim and the generals were the pain and sufferings. So that's managing the medical cost portion of it to, we think, more accurate outcomes. Meyer Shields : And that's helpful. If I could switch gears to Commercial Auto. You noted in the Q something of a mix shift with writing larger policies, and I'm guessing that the competitive situation is getting better there. Is that the reason that you're seeing some year-over-year compression in the underwriting margin in Commercial Auto? Or is that just the anticipated erosion from the nominal possible levels? Glenn Renwick : Why don't you take that? John Sauerland : So we are very happy with our Commercial Lines margins. So any erosion we're seeing is simply a -- migration is -- slow migration back to what we think might be our targets. So we are growing a lot in the truck end of the Commercial Lines spectrum. We report our new business average premium to you as well as our renewal, and we're seeing a lot of business coming in on the trucking end. We took a lot of rate there. Probably 2 years ago now, 2 to 3 years ago, instituted some material changes in our underwriting to tighten up. So we think we got ahead of that market. And when we look at our combined ratios across the segments, meaning truck down to what we call business auto, we're very comfortable with what we're seeing. And there again, are very interested in continuing to grow at a rapid pace. We're seeing great trends there. So any margin erosion you're seeing, we're not at all concerned with, and we are still well below our target combined ratios in all of the segments we write in Commercial Lines. Glenn Renwick : And just to add one other comment, it wasn't specific in your question, but maybe it's a good reminder, if you didn't know. We often say we're focused on high-frequency, low-severity claims but adjudicate relatively quickly. Some of the zones of Commercial Auto take you into higher-limit-type business. Just to make a mental note that anything over $1 million is reinsured, so we're not really subject to that sort of very low-frequency, high-severity hit. We've decided to run our business in a way where we're much more comfortable with the underlying limits. And therefore, we don't have quite the same volatility at higher MBI claims. John Sauerland : And as you note in our Q, perhaps a little different place to some other companies that have been reporting lately around reserve development in that segment. We have been taking reserves down in our Commercial Lines group. So we're pretty confident with our reserves there as well as our combined ratios. Operator : Next question is from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Paul Newsome : I want to ask a capital question and a long-term capital question related to how you think about capital management as well -- and the diversification benefits of -- anyway, we've had a lot of interesting press on AIG talking about a large diversification benefit for being a diversified financial. Historically, you have not been, but you've added Home. And I'd love to hear how you think of the interaction of capital management as the Home business and as the commercial business increases in size. Glenn Renwick : Okay. I think -- well, maybe I said most of that before, but it's worth reinforcing. So I'm going to let Bill come on the call. Is he there? Bill Cody : Yes, I'm here. Sure. As far as the diversification benefit from a portfolio point of view, we do think about the assets in that part of the business being a longer duration, the claims a little bit longer tail risk and managed from a more conservative perspective than our auto book. [Technical Difficulty] Glenn Renwick : We may have lost Bill. Maybe I can pick that up. So the Commercial Lines is certainly growing and is now getting to a point of sort of 15% of premium outside of the property, which has slightly higher capital requirements. For sure is we're writing higher-limit business there but not materially higher than the Personal Auto. The property side is still, while new to us for sure, it's still very small. And we continue to follow the approach that ASI had when we took a majority interest in the company, which is to only have a maximum of 10% of surplus at risk in any given store. So you can see from the statutory filings, they used reinsurance extensively and protect capital pretty, pretty well. And again, relative to the total Progressive capital, it's pretty small. So there may be some diversification benefit there. We, obviously, consider the premium-to-surplus ratios the regulators require by line of coverage, maybe require is a strong word, but generally look to. Obviously, the rating agencies as well. So there's greater capital requirements in property. Where we're very comfortable with auto at a 3 :1, property, you can think of probably half that, and we consider that into our capital models and ensure that we continue to have plenty of contingency capital. And to the other question around dividends and capital deployment, we are very much comfortable at call it our balanced range. So we're doing modestly different things in terms of capital management, given ASI. But again, it's a pretty small piece of our business now, pretty conservatively managed with reinsurance, so not a big deal at the total balance sheet level. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian Meredith : I just go back to the frequency situation, sorry to belabor this, but the 3% to 5%, when you talk about 3% to 5%, is that different from what we would see ISO reporting? Because if I look at long-term frequency trends, they've been actually flat to down for more than a decade. And even if I look at when you're reporting on frequency since the beginning of '09, it's been flat. Glenn Renwick : Gary, you probably have a better perspective on long term ISO. Clearly, I recognize the 3% to 5%, I'm just saying it's sort of not unrealistic and not sort of unusual. We've also shown you, as John talked about in the IR meetings, the long-term frequency trends 30 years, and frankly, we're forecasting the next 30 will not be significantly different, maybe even steeper. Frequency is going down. But at any moment in time, for pricing purposes, especially when you have a macroeconomic change in the economy and miles being driven, 3% to 5% does not sort of take me out of a range that I'm uncomfortable with or have seen in general. Maybe Gary, if you can comment on the long-term 12-month ISO term. Gary Traicoff : Sure. This is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. I think to your point and Glenn's, the long term both with Fast Track industry data and Progressive data, frequency is down. When we look at just particular quarter, so if we take second quarter of this year to second quarter of last year, from fast-track data, it's a little over 2% and we were about 1.5%. So we're a little bit below that. If I look at Fast Track over the last year, they're about 1% as well as Progressive. We don't have third quarter Fast Track data yet. But when I am comparing our data versus industry data, at least, over the last 3, 4 quarters, it is up overall but tracking very closely to each other. Brian Meredith : Got you. That's very helpful. And then Glenn, going on to the Agency businesses, looking at your renewal ratios, continuing to be negative here, I'm just curious when do you think that could potentially stabilize or turn positive. And then also, in that question, the Platinum product, when do you think that could potentially have an impact on those retention ratios in your Agency business? Glenn Renwick : Yes. Retention on the Direct side is actually behaving predictably and well. And what I try to do, and I admit I'm a little bit in the cautious camp, I hope I'll always stay there, that I like to see things before I report them happening. And on the Agency side, it's just -- frankly, it's just a lot slower to sort of show the pickup that I think we should reasonably expect, given our market competitiveness and rate competitiveness. But I think it's coming, and I would just say, give me another quarter to confirm that. And I'll confirm it or tell you exactly what's going on. I had thought that we probably would be able to do a more positive statement about Agency retention in the third quarter. When you can't do it, don't do it. With regard to Platinum, recognize Platinum for now is going to be a very small part of the business. So that's going to be hard to see blend in to the entire retention trend. That probably will be more something we'll start to call out for you more deliberately because you just simply won't be able to pull it out of the macro numbers. And that's fine. We'll be happy to sort of give you, at least, color as to our expectation on Platinum. But we can start with a very clear assumption that I have given. Part of the reason why ASI and Progressive are working the way they're working together is that we had no doubt from our first work in PHA that when customers bundle, they have highly retentive behavior. And there is nothing that has suggested to us that, that is not going to play out in the scenarios that we have in place on the Direct side and now on the Platinum side. So Platinum's pretty exciting for us and for the Agency. So we look at it as a source of growth in the Agency. We look at it as a source of new customer mix, and we certainly look at it as a source of customer mix that will show different retention behaviors longer than we have typically experienced, so all positives on that one. John Sauerland : And while Platinum is going to be a fairly small part of our independent agent production here in the near term, we're starting slower there. And absolutely, that bundle is far more likely to stay with us. The precursor of the Platinum program is our newest product model. And we have worked hard to continue to get more and more competitive on preferred business with iterative product models we're rolling out. And what we're seeing with our latest product model is more mixed to multicar, which inherently retains longer, more mix towards full coverage, towards customers who have their insurance in place for a longer period. So that's new business mix. That takes a while to move into the book to affect overall retention levels. But while we're seeing our current book getting a little more stable and improving in terms of retention, we're getting new business in that we think will retain longer as well. So we think we've got a number of forces there that will push that retention number into the positive territory soon. Glenn Renwick : Right. Just for those following along, we often talk about the product as 8.3, the new product going into the marketplace. But we also talked at our IR meeting about the next one, 8.4. I know they're not glamorous titles, but 8.3 is in about 12 states right now and is tightly coupled with Platinum, even though Platinum is in 8 states right now with about 4 more to go. Those are the same states. There's just a slight bit of delay. And then you've also heard us talk about the new model for Snapshot. That's really all part of 8.3 as well. So the same states will have each of those. And I've reported previously both disappointment with uptake in Snapshot by the Agency channel and the new product model offering a discount upfront has actually moved the needle on that. I would be far away from suggesting it's gotten to the Direct levels. It hasn't, but it has gone in the range of double what it was. So a new Snapshot model also leads to what we fully expect is longer retention, simply because those who get the right rates are likely to stay in the marketplace and they won't be able to necessarily shop for a better rate than that. Having said all of that, we've also told you that there will be the opportunity for a smaller percentage of the book to get rate increases, though some of those people will be more inclined to leave. So we'll try over the next year to give you a very clear picture of the moving parts that involve in retention, but we would -- sitting here today, we would be disappointed if we didn't see the Agency retention start to track on a nice upward path. That's a good question, if not answered in our other documents for the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi : Just back to the frequency conversation just for -- just a second here, if we could. Can you talk just about what you saw through the quarter and into October in terms of the trend that it wasn't stable, did it deteriorate? And then when you think about this call again next quarter, what would you have to see from frequency to start to be concerned about the potential for adverse selection, if you feel like that's a risk at all? Glenn Renwick : Let's say I quaked at the adverse selection piece on frequency, so I'll start there. Michael Nannizzi : If you're just writing new business, you're pulling new business in and the frequency trends deteriorate... Glenn Renwick : Oh, mispricing. Michael Nannizzi : Yes. Glenn Renwick : Okay. Actually, your point on adverse selection is not a bad one either. Obviously, Snapshot work is trying to find people with what we believe, as a group, will be lower frequency and bring them into the book, welcome them in at a rate level that is good. And for those that have what we consider to be high frequency likely behaviors, they may not join us as rapidly. So there is some adverse selection. We hope it's actually not adverse to us. We will -- it's almost impossible to answer your question specifically. We have to do our indications based on forward-looking estimates of frequency and severity. We combine them. We call it pure premium. And that's going on, on a daily basis, and I mean daily. We will make estimates, and we have estimates. They are probably a little bit tamer than the single data point at the last quarter. And if that data point continues to start to suggest it's a little bit more of a time sequence, we will adjust very quickly for that. The point that I've been trying -- I, hopefully, have been making is we will take what we see now in small increments. So even if we get higher frequency or higher severity in the future, we can -- we're already on path to have placed that in. We just don't want to get behind the curve on doing that. And if we saw something -- it's not a single rate revision. We don't take rates across the country on a single day. We're taking rates all the time. It's a very dynamic structure. We've spent a lot of time and money making sure our systems can allow us to take rate changes relatively quickly, and that's the key. If you've got some uncertainty, take a half a point, take a point. We're not ever trying to do that in the sense that the consumer is having to bear the brunt, but it's absolutely in the best long-term interest of the consumer that we can take a point now, maybe a point in 6 months, maybe a point somewhere else. That is a stylized representation of what actually happens at individual states and in individual factors and individual geographies within the state. So it's much more complex than when we talk about it in generalities. But to your more specific question, if we can see -- even though we think the long-term frequency trend will be negative, if we see on route, certain conditions, mileage so on and so forth, that start to push it up a little bit, we will be very active in changing our longer-term estimates. And when I mean longer-term here, I don't mean the very long term. I mean the life of the price point that will exist in the marketplace. Another advantage that we have is we try to leave those price points in the marketplace as limited a time as possible. So it might be that we change them 3 or 4 times in a year. And the higher number of times we change them, we're more able to adapt to the estimates that we see as we look to price for that future period. So keeping the trend period as short as possible often works to our advantage. Michael Nannizzi : And through the -- you mentioned through the quarter and into October that frequency trend stabilized, that it wasn't rising. Was it reverting? Can you just briefly touch on that? Glenn Renwick : The good news is I really can't give you enough detail to be meaningful on October numbers, so you'll get to see those very quickly. John Sauerland : Yes. And throughout the quarter, I would say, again, frequency is important to look at on a trend basis. Looking at it a month-to-month is probably not what we want to start communicating and not what we react to. So you see the combined ratios throughout the quarter on a monthly basis, that should give you a pretty good indication of where pure premium, which is again, as Glenn mentioned, the product of frequency and severity is going. And I don't think it makes sense to comment on monthly frequency changes. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. And I just -- if I could squeeze in one last one, just on Snapshot and the Agency channel. Just trying to understand one thing. I mean, it seemed like the idea of Snapshot upfront was sort of good drivers selecting in because they believe that they would be able to get a better discount, a better price based on their own driving as opposed to these other demographic factors. And then it sounds like you introduced an iteration of Snapshot in the Agency channel, where it's sort of a discount upfront. But it seems like just psychologically that, that's a different value proposition, is -- the consumer may not feel like they're a great driver. Maybe they'll get a discount during that first year. And then if they're not a good driver, they'll just not renew once you guys figure that out. Have you seen -- has any of that manifested? That may be way off base, so I don't really know. But have you been doing this long enough to see in the Agency channel to see whether retention trends are different there than in the Direct channel? Glenn Renwick : In that way, I base it all human behavior is highly predictable, that, at least, some will take a discount at any year at any opportunity. We don't have a ton of data. This has not been in the marketplace a great deal of time. So we are seeing the uptake at the Agency point of distribution to be considerably improved. And I have little doubt that there are some customers that take a discount and maybe aren't exactly the right people, and we'll determine that in the first 6 months and their renewal rate will go up. That absolutely is a scenario that can and will happen. It is, however, the smaller part of the population. And agents, I think, are now starting to see the benefit of Snapshot for the larger group of customers that they have. We're seeing, and these are early numbers, we're seeing midterm retention, i.e. in the first period actually increased and not much yet notable, which wouldn't be surprising because we haven't been in the marketplace with this product that long for an update for what I'll call that first point of truth of the 7 month over the 6 month, that point of retention, which is clearly very important. And that's where people are getting quoted either the rate that they got as an initial discount, maybe even better, maybe slightly worse than the initial discount, but it will be the rate that they can expect going forward. And there will be a number, 30% or less, that will actually get the discount taken away. And those are, obviously, people who are going to react differently on renewal. But for the most part, this is attracting more new customers of the right type, and that certainly is an indication we can give earlier than getting retention estimates. We're seeing the kind of right credit mix, the right age and vehicle mix. So the mix of customers that are opting for Snapshot is actually meeting expectations in that regard, maybe even better. And just for one slight correction to your question, this product exists both in the Agency and the Direct channel, so it's available to both. So we really do have a lot of experience at much higher levels of acceptance on the Direct channel. About 1/3 of our sales are being made with Snapshot, so we have a really lot of data. And while there will almost certainly, as there is in every part of our business, be some aberrant behavior, some fraud, whatever it might be, the greater good here is far outweighing any concerns that we have about the individuals. Operator : Our next question is from David Small with JPMorgan. David Small : I just had a -- my question was, could you put your comments of this quarter in the context of what you said last quarter when the frequency trends were obviously different? Last quarter, you said you were comfortable with your pricing trends when you were seeing frequency lower. Now obviously, you're seeing frequency higher, and it seems like you're still saying you're comfortable with your pricing trends. I'm just trying to put those 2 together. Are you comfortable with your -- are you -- do you feel like -- is that meaning that you're going to wait to see if this trend persists, which it sounds like you think it will, so you're going to have to adjust your pricing to that? I'm just -- it seems like there's a different message last quarter than this quarter? Glenn Renwick : Yes, that's -- again, it's a time series. So last quarter, we didn't see ourselves being particularly different than the industry. The time series that we think is more reflective of future trends. So we take 2 things into consideration, historic trend and future trend. We're always making that estimate. And as we see individual data points that change that trend, either instantaneously or long term, we will adjust that future trend. But the future trend is not going to be nearly as volatile as a single data point or a single quarter. As I said, if we go back a year from now, we were reporting negative frequency, and so we're reporting a positive frequency over a negative frequency last year. The longer-term trend might be quite different, if you sort do 2 or 3, and don't do my math on that one. I'm just giving you an example. So we do feel comfortable with our rates because we're never stable. It's not like rate level was, a, at the beginning of the year hasn't changed. If you take a look at the market in general from a premium weighted perspective and there's going to be a standard deviation that is higher than normal or what I would consider normal. But you're going to look at rate that has changed for most competitors somewhere between 2 to 3.5, maybe get a little closer, clustering 3 -- 2.5, 3.5 of more recent times. We would be at the lower end but in that range, so we're continuing to take our rates up. And that's the point I'm making with comp. Our rate trend has approximated our pure premium trend. My comment that says I'm always, always concerned and we as an organization are always concerned, if that future trends change, then we need to just dial up our rate trend to meet it. But it's not a major right-hand turn. If we were at -- and I'll just make this number up, I'm just making it up. But if we were at 2.4 on an annualized rate take and that was matching with trend, future trend, all coverages in, and we see that go to 2.6 or a 2.8, then we'll dial up our rate trend and take it in small increments. So yes, there are data points that tell you and tell me watch out. It's probably not staying constant. No news there for us. Probably even though we believe long term, things will go down, now may not be the time. Why? We don't know the macroeconomic influences of mileage driven. And frankly, I'd tell you, if you break it down, which we must do, bodily injury, PD or human BI and PD, they're not doing anything to me that is sort of outside the norm of what I've seen through my career and most us in Progressive. PIP, frankly, is a highly variable coverage, and we've had many discussions in this setting about PIP frequency and severity. And that one just -- you almost just have to stay on it for the moment and be able to price for it as quickly as possible. But those PIP and collision and PD are shorter payout coverages. So we can actually adjust our pricing for those quickly, and it doesn't have the same carryover that a severity change in BI might to our reserves. So a long answer, but last quarter, I felt that we had our future pricing trends compatible with our expectations of future frequency and severity. We've just reported to you that we actually have some positive trend, positive in the sense of very attractive trends on severity of management of our bodily injury. We have to put those together. We're also -- we were reporting that we've seen a slight uptick in frequency. The offset of one to the other is important, and we just need to make sure that we're getting that future pricing trend to match our expectation of the future costs. But frankly, this is not a -- and I want to be clear here, for us, this is a pretty nice position to be in. I don't want the marketplace to be totally static. We think we've got an advantage when it's moving around because we are nimble and we can take rate changes and adjust up or down, much more likely to be up than down, as need be to keep that matching going. And we match into smaller increments as we can. John Sauerland : At the risk of making that a longer question, I would tell you that it's important to look at what we're getting in the marketplace versus what we're taking. So we can take rates up. We can take them down. What we ultimately get in the marketplace is obviously a function of where our competitors sit. So if I were in your shoes, I would pay close attention to the average premium changes that we report. And for Personal Auto, that average premium change, albeit influenced by mix changes, is 4%. It was up 4% this quarter last year as well. Last year-to-date, it was up 3%. This year-to-date, up 4%. So average premiums are at least -- assuming a common mix, are certainly keeping up with pure premium trends. David Small : And so if I could just follow up on that last comment, was actually my second question was, if I think about price versus loss trend and how that relates to margin, if I understand your earlier comments correctly where you're saying -- you talked about that long-term frequency and to look at everything over the long term. If I take frequency and severity together, I kind of have 5% in trends. And so if I'm getting 4% in premium, does that mean, kind of just simple math, there's a little bit more potential for margin compression. But obviously, things could bump around. So is that the right way to think about it? John Sauerland : We talked about pure premium, as Glenn mentioned previously, I think that does well. So we try to price to pure premium plus our cost structure. Pure premium is the product of frequency and severity. And yes, we try to project that out. So future trend is what we talk about. We're trying to predict the product frequency and severity out through the course of the period in which our rates will be in effect, plus our cost structure. Cost structure obviously is very competitive. Both expense ratio and LAE, they're not the lowest in the marketplace. They are sort of top 3-ish in both categories. So we project those out to create the rates. And yes, we're trying to keep up with that pure premium trend. So the math you're doing, while it's -- we give you, obviously, pretty high-level numbers there, is the math we do to set the rates. And again, that average premium, if you look over time, as reflected in the combined ratios, kept up with trend. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Klauber with William Blair. Adam Klauber : It seems like your paid loss ratio and paid to incurred for so far this year compared to last year is doing better. But again, frequency is ticking up. So could you help us with that? Glenn Renwick : So I think at the -- the core of your question is reserved changes, and are we priced adequately for next year, given where our accident year is. You can correct me if I'm wrong on that. So our accident year, loss and LAE is around 74. You add in our expense ratio, and you come to a number that is comfortably below 96. So we're approaching that 96, and we're cognizant of that, and appropriately taking rate as needed. That bodily injury trend that we discussed in terms of severity is what is driving the change in reserves and the positive development. So we think that is a systemic change, meaning we see why bodily injury severity is down. We think it's as a result of actions we take in our claims department to be more accurate in our settlements. We have more initiatives in the works to ensure that we continue to be as accurate as possible in injury settlements. So while we can't project where that severity line is going to go with tremendous accuracy, obviously, that's what we're charged with doing in our pricing group and our reserving group. We feel pretty good about where our reserves sit today and, again, can see the source of those changes. And in aggregate accident year basis, we are below that 96 and thinking of that well managed going forward. Adam Klauber : Okay. And then also frequency has been an issue for the whole industry, and everyone's been saying loss has ticked up. It seems like you've managed it better than a lot of the other competitors in the industry. Did having data from Snapshot and miles driven -- did that play a part in that? Glenn Renwick : I would -- that would be a nice complement to take, but let's -- frequency is always so tricky. Frequency is what it is. We're not living on a isolated island from our competitors. So while there will always be statistically different numbers reported, they all come from the same ecosystem of roads, drivers and vehicles. However, that's not true when we all have different mixes in different states and different types of drivers, rural, urban. It really does get quite tricky. I tried to put a small note in my cover letter that really suggests that we do a lot of work to try to make sure that we understand frequency at a level that we can at least reconcile with all the data points in the marketplace. But I would tell you that managing frequency better than anyone else is something I'm not sure that we're going to put our hand in the air and say, \"We can take credit for that.\" It is what it is. If everybody measures it the same way, it should be a representative, for example, of the overall industry, especially for larger players. Having said that, the point I'd make, and I will just use -- don't bring it up and use a competitor, but Geico's mix in New York is very different than our mix in New York. So as frequency in New York is different than in other state, that will show up, and you need to be very careful to draw conclusions about whether frequency is up or frequency in a specific place is up. I did mention before that Snapshot has a long-term benefit, we believe, of attracting lower-frequency drivers and, in some sense, making sure attracting them simply because we offer them the rate that we believe is best appropriate for their level of driving or their diligence and their driving behavior. That's what we've always said about Snapshot. It really is the first significant variable that is more causal than correlated. So most of the data that we deal with is correlated. Snapshot is causal. And to the extent that attracts lower-frequency drivers because of the lower pricing, then the long-term effect of that will be very interesting. That is awfully hard even for us to make a meaningful estimate of how we're managing frequency for our book versus the competitors. But that's one example of managing frequency. I would tell you, most of our effort is around managing severity and making sure our claims are paid the correct way and very fair but the exact right way. We see through segregation and other influences that there are high variances in claims, competency throughout the industry, or I won't say competency as much as claims practices. And we try to make sure our claims practices are absolutely fair and absolutely have the best loss cost management so that we can pass that on to the consumer in long-term pricing. So that's -- I can't say much more about managing frequency than our Snapshot. Overall, it will sort of work the way it works, except for mix differences.

This conference is also available via the audio webcast. Webcast participants will be able to listen only throughout the duration of the call. In addition, this conference is being recorded at the request of Progressive. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. The company will not make detailed comments in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, Annual Report to Shareholders and the Letter to Shareholders, which has been posted on the company\u2019s website, and will use this conference call to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the call will be Julia Hornack. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ms. Hornack. Julia Hornack : Good morning. Welcome to Progressive\u2019s conference call. Participating on today\u2019s call are Glen Renwick, our CEO; John Sauerland, our CFO; Tricia Griffith, our Personal Lines Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer. The call is scheduled to last about an hour. As always, our discussions on this call may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to the many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during this call. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements, and other discussions of the risks, uncertainties and other challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investors page of our website, progressive.com. Shirley, we are now ready to take our first question. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Glasspiegel. You may ask your question. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning, Glen. I was very encouraged by the last quarterly policy expectancy lengthening that you highlighted in the 10-K. How excited are you about that trend? Do you think that this is a breakout that suggests that Snapshot and other measures you\u2019re taking are working? Glen Renwick : How am I excited about it? I\u2019ve been waiting for it for a long time, so I\u2019m actually pretty excited and I think the 5%, thereabouts that we\u2019re seeing in the trailing three is really quite indicative of what we hope will flow through. Lots of reasons for that, always hard to pin them down, but general excitement, absolutely yes.  If you take a look at some of our published materials, you\u2019ll see that the average rate that consumers have seen over the last year, regardless of channel, agency and direct, is about a 4%, which I would tell you to think more in those terms than specific rate changes. So 4%, which means a good number of our consumers are still seeing rate changes that are on the high side of that, so as we mature into the rate revisions that we\u2019re now becoming even more comfortable with and rate levels that we\u2019re becoming more comfortable with, I would look forward to seeing while continued positives, maybe not quite in the 4 range but a closer distribution or a tighter distribution around the average, so we will potentially benefit even more so on retention, not losing those higher end or the right-hand distribution around the average of 4 last year. So really nice movement getting our new product into the marketplace, getting a rate level that we feel very comfortable with, maintaining that. You might remember we said at our IR meeting we had a strong preference for three 1% changes than one 3% change. All of that really is a big part of how we\u2019re trying to make sure that retention is front and center in all of our thinking. So nice to see it coming through. Frankly, I would tell you I\u2019ll be disappointed if that didn\u2019t continue. Bob Glasspiegel : Okay. Switching gears, Bill, the first quarter we\u2019ve seen sort of a stressful investment environment. Are you--maybe you can update us on how the fixed income has performed and the stress lines in? Are you taking this as an opportunity to increase risk, or are you de-risking on the portfolio? Glen Renwick : I\u2019ll let Bill jump in there. Bill Cody : Sure. We are taking this as an opportunity to increase risk modestly. We\u2019ve increased the bid in the corporate exposure, a little bit in CMBS as well. Some areas we\u2019ve decreased risk, and that would be primarily munis because those have traded really tightly and very opposite to the rest of the fixed income markets, and also we\u2019ve reduced some of our high yield exposure because the high yield that we own has performed really, really well, to the point where it\u2019s trading at spreads similar to triple-B paper.  So for us, we\u2019re in a good position to take some risk, and we\u2019re finding some more compelling opportunities to do that. Bob Glasspiegel : Thank you. Bill Cody : Performance-wise, we released our January numbers, which--our total returns. We\u2019ll release February in a couple weeks. Operator : Just as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Josh, your line is open. Go ahead with your question. Josh Stirling : Hi, sorry - mute button. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the call. Would love to ask you a question about the status of Snapshot. Over the past six months or so, you guys have announced you\u2019ve been rolling out a new smartphone app, and I think at the last annual meeting you walked us through that you were iterating the pricing designed at discounts up front. I guess I was curious, just wanted a bit of an update on how many states you\u2019ve rolled these things out with, as well as more importantly what\u2019s been the consumer response, I guess both from the app, which feels like a different consumer interface and is kind of a question of adoption and comfort and just sort of more open-ended questions about that - you know, how consumers like the app and whether perhaps it\u2019s something we\u2019ll sell, and then separately on the discounts, what kind of lift have you seen from this? Is there impact in conversion rates and maybe on new sales? Thank you. Glen Renwick : Yeah, we haven\u2019t done a little Snapshot update for a while, so let me see if I can hit all of those points and give you some flavor of what\u2019s going on. Starting into this year, we\u2019re still seeing our policies initiated with the Snapshot influence - discount, whatever it might be, to be faster than the rates of growth that you\u2019re seeing as we report on aggregate, so it\u2019s still our fastest growing sector. That remains true for a long time, but certainly even into January that was true. Starting to get a feel for what sort of mix of business is attainable.  So I\u2019ll just give you a quick look here, not to confuse you with any numbers, but in our direct book of business, where we\u2019ve been able to offer Snapshot, and realistically there\u2019s only two states now, California and North Carolina, where we\u2019re not offering it, but over a period of time with a cohort where the Snapshot has been available, that cohort of business is now approximating about 40% of the direct business for places where it was available for some period of time. So think in terms of can the little train really take momentum? We\u2019re looking to sort of 40 to 50% in the direct channel. I think I\u2019ve told you before, the acceptance in the direct channel far exceeds the agency channel, and with the new change that we made - it was very clear that we were hoping to see agency uptake on the--or the quotes include Snapshot with that discount [indiscernible] what I\u2019d call overly dramatic movement, but significant on the small base. Actually, we have some good news to report there. We actually introduced it into two, what I\u2019ll call higher average premiums states - Florida, Louisiana, and we\u2019re seeing the agent acceptance rates there, or the agent penetration into new quoting actually go up significantly, so probably approximating somewhere in the league of half to two-thirds the rate on our direct channel. So starting to make some traction there, and we\u2019re going to take a closer look. I think we did a better job of rolling that out to agents in those states who will take a close look at what we did well there, and make sure that we reinforce that in other places in the country.  So net-net, pretty good sized penetration in our direct book, and I don\u2019t want to project what the threshold might be as to overall penetration, but to think in terms of more than half of the book is not unreasonable based on what we\u2019ve experienced to date, and now we\u2019re starting to see opportunities where the agency business perhaps is, yes slower, but certainly starting to close some part of the gap, so good stuff there. With regard to the app, we\u2019ve discussed that. I want to make it very clear that we\u2019ve had apps that have approximated in one way, shape or form the activity for some time. That\u2019s not been an issue. The issue is really making sure we had an app that we felt had the data integrity that really matched with the in-car dongle, and we\u2019ve got to the point where we actually have that application and very comfortable with it. There are all sorts of stories, some of which I\u2019m not as close to as others, but you need to be able to determine the difference between a train ride and a plane ride and a car ride. You need to know whether the person got in the left door or the right door, are they driving, are they passenger. All those sorts of things are actually very important to us, so it\u2019s easy enough to create an app that does part of the job, it\u2019s very hard to create an app that does the--or gives us the level of integrity that we\u2019d be comfortable swapping out for the information that we get from the dongle.  We think we\u2019re there. Unfortunately, it\u2019s probably going to take us a little longer to get that into marketplace than we might like. There\u2019s a fair amount of work to do on the IT side, but certainly in \u201916 we expect to see that roll out, but it may be for all intents and purposes in large numbers later in the year. I think we\u2019ve probably mentioned we have a relationship with GM and OnStar that\u2019s been a little bit delayed, but we expect to be marketing that more actively in about the midyear time frame.  So Snapshot, for lots of reasons, continues to be something very important to us, not only as an indicator of the sorts of things that we think we\u2019ll do more of in the future, but it\u2019s really taking hold and you all know the power of Snapshot relative to a rating variable, so ultimately when we start talking about penetration numbers that are really in the range of that 40, perhaps even 50%, it starts to make a difference in terms of segmentation. So we couldn\u2019t be more happy with what we see, I just don\u2019t know what the high water mark will be. But we\u2019re going to find out, and I hope it\u2019s really high. Josh Stirling : Thanks Glen, that\u2019s really helpful. I wonder if you could just touch briefly on your other big product development initiative, rolling out a combined homeowners product in the agency channel. Give us a sense of--I think you\u2019re live at least in a couple of states. It\u2019d be useful to have a little bit of color for how agency\u2019s responding, what kind of traction you\u2019re getting, and then maybe if you\u2019d be willing to walk us through what your goals are for the program as you look out over the next year. Glen Renwick : Sure, and maybe I\u2019ll double team here with Tricia on a couple of points. Platinum is what we\u2019re talking about, and this is in short--I don\u2019t want to repeat things that were already written down, but in short it\u2019s the way that our ASI property business and Progressive come to the market, looking as if they are simply one. So let\u2019s not worry about the brand names, but the agents are seeing that as Platinum, we\u2019re in 12 states, we expect to be in an additional 22 this year, so that will give us some really nice penetration. Our goal is simple - our goal is to be a valid and almost significant choice inside the agency channel for those customers who want to bundle their auto and home together. We\u2019re comfortable if they start either way, but we really like the bundles. ASI is seeing about 50% now of their new quote volume being bundled, so we really--we\u2019re not going curtail in any way, shape or form mono line of either, but our real interest is in the bundle. We know what the effect of long-term retention there can be, so those things are great. Our interest is making sure on the agency channel we offer a really viable option and a, as I put it, must-have solution for agents. We know we\u2019ve got a great auto product - I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any dispute on that. With ASI, we have a great homeowners product. We\u2019re going to work together to put that into a great package, and there is still work to be done so we don\u2019t think we\u2019re across the finish line. We probably never will get across the finish line, we can always make it better. On the direct side, while ASI is not a big a player on the direct side, that\u2019s obviously a future option that we have for going forward.  Tricia, maybe you could talk a little bit about the sales force and how we\u2019ve [indiscernible] the sales force to make sure that we get the message out as well as possible. Tricia Griffith : Yeah Josh, I think to what Glen said, before I\u2019d say that, we really--you know, first of all, the second half of last year, getting the product out, the AT product was really important to get that preferred business and then continue with stable rates. Then we had to have both an agent and a customer value proposition, so we know we needed to add more commissions for these preferred customers, match policy terms. Then as we started to talk with our ASI partners, we realized we really needed to combine sales forces and have very specific sales reps that work with our platinum agents. So we\u2019ve just done that recently and we\u2019re very excited about that, and we continue to--we have 12 states out. We have continued to understand where we\u2019re competitive, when we\u2019re not what we need to do, and I think agents understand that. We really want to make sure that we reward our agents not just with more commission but with preference, so when they choose us as number one or two--in fact, just this week John Sauerland and I are able to make some calls to agents that have reached some certain levels. We have hurdles to get over determining how many bundles you have in your agency, so while the data\u2019s in with 12 states, I would consider 2016 really the year of execution, understanding more and more about, again, how to get that low pure premium business and how to integrate the right sales force with these very specific agents. Josh Stirling : Great, well we\u2019ll stay tuned. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Just as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. You may ask your question. Ian Gutterman : Hi, thank you. I guess first just a quick numbers question. When I was looking at your stat surplus for the end of the year and your leverage, normally obviously you\u2019re closer to three times. This year, you\u2019re at about 2.7, which I\u2019m assuming is the homeowners change, obviously. Just when I back that, if I kind of took your normal auto premiums divided by the 2.9 to 3 times and solved for the rest, home was coming in at about 1 times levered. Is that a good proxy? Glen Renwick : John, jump in here. You\u2019re right - the 2.7, a little bit influenced by the home. We would probably prefer to run the home business at more like 1.5, and I expect over time as these things, sometimes you get a little bit off, but think in terms of we\u2019re going to try to maximize on auto at about 3 to 1 if we possibly can, where we can - it never works out perfectly, and closer to a 1.5 on the homeowners business. Ian Gutterman : Okay, that\u2019s what I was wondering. Okay, great. Then on the reserves, I guess just first quickly on the January average development, normally--so I guess I\u2019m going back a tiny little bit here. There used to be big favor for leases in January due to sort of the catch-up from the prior December, and I recall you changed that process about three or four years to smooth that out. This January, we saw the lumpiness just in the other direction. Is it still the same process, or do we make a change in process back to the old way? Glen Renwick : We\u2019ve got Gary here. I think the IB&R was the process change coming off the table, so I\u2019ll let him take it away. But the unfavorable that you saw in December, I would--I don\u2019t want to be cavalier about it, but I would tell you, don\u2019t be too concerned about that. If that had been February over January, then it wouldn\u2019t be prior year. It just happens that it\u2019s the calendar close and therefore you see prior year development come through. As we looked at our January development for \u201916, there was really nothing that was surprising over the prior year, so we\u2019re pretty comfortable with that, Gary, why don\u2019t you put some more details there? Gary Traicoff : Sure. This is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. To your point, about three to four years ago we did make a process change, and then the last few years looked fairly stable. What happened this past January was really due to more late reported claims that happened in December. They got reported in January, and if you think back to the end of December, we did have some storms come through, particularly in that last week or so. So in January, we just recognized more late reported losses, which was really the driver of the development in January. Ian Gutterman : Got it, and Gary, while I have you, if I can clarify one other thing. I was looking in the K. On the reserves, it said our net reserve balance assumes that severity for acts in year 2015 over 2014 will be 4.2% higher for personal auto and 9.2% higher for commercial auto. I was trying to contrast that to earlier in the K when you talk about calendar year severity and give your frequency and severity stats, and the calendar year severity was, I guess, 3% for PD, 4% collision minus 2VI. If I sort of weight those, I get a very low single digit versus the 4.2 on the accident year. Is the difference between that low single digit and the 4.2 reserve releases, or is there some other way to interpret that? Gary Traicoff : That\u2019s a great question. Related to that, when I think of calendar period severity, which is what the low numbers you were talking about, our calendar period severity that came through in the year was fairly low, particularly in VI, it was actually negative. That was really the driver of why our reserves developed so favorably in 2015.  When we think ahead and going forward, we don\u2019t anticipate long-term severity will continue to be negative like that, so if we look at what we actually have booked in our reserving models, we are anticipating roughly a 4% severity going forward on liability. Now, that will include VI, PD, et cetera, so if you do all those cuts by state and by line, most of them are in the 2 to 6% range, but overall it rolls up to about 4.  When I look at commercial lines, it is about a 9%. Some of that, though, relates to mix changes in the business marketing targets we have, so if you normalize for that, think of it probably closer to a 6% range or so, which was actually fairly consistent with our commercial line severity in 2015. Ian Gutterman : Got it, and do you have something similar for that where the accident year frequency wasn\u2019t just used? Gary Traicoff : We did not report anything in there for accident year frequency. Typically though, calendar year and accident year frequencies are fairly well aligned. You\u2019re not going to have as much of a disconnect as you might have on the severity side, particularly with the VI and the long-tailed coverage. Ian Gutterman : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Just a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question. Brian Meredith : Yes, thank you. I guess back on the product, a couple of quick questions here. First, how PLEs looking so far with respect to the customers you\u2019re getting, and then on that also, I\u2019m just wondering, Glen, is there an opportunity here, given the consolidation we\u2019ve seen in the mass affluent market, that you could potentially go after that right now? Glen Renwick : Brian, could you just give me the second part of the question again, the consolidation piece? Brian Meredith : Sorry, yeah. With what we\u2019ve seen this far with the consolidation in the high net worth or mass affluent market from a homeowners perspective, is there an opportunity for you guys to really go after that, because I know agents are asking for new carriers there. Glen Renwick : Great. Let me take that first. I think we\u2019ve shown you at some prior IR meetings, and we\u2019re more than willing to show you as we get more and more information, that the bundled customer really does give us that notion of a meaningful - and I\u2019m going to stress that, a meaningful extension on our life expectancy. In my shareholders letter, I started to use some language that I think will become more common inside Progressive, moving away from policy life expectancy to customer life expectancy. I think you get that - it\u2019s really we are looking to at least a piece of our business, and I stress that - we\u2019ll still always do the pieces that we do well, a piece of our business being customers that actually stay with us in a reasonably long period of time--or actually not a reasonably long period, a very long period of time, and have multiple products. So a way to think about that, so yes, we are seeing--yes, that was our hypothesis, yes, we\u2019re seeing it, and the data is solid and meaningful. I think quite frankly, we might even be understating the customer life expectancy yet, because we haven\u2019t seen that kind of customer for a long period of time.  Something just internally, and this is just to give you a little bit of a mindset of how we think, we\u2019re starting to, and this is, I would say, something that 30 years ago certainly was not on our radar screen, what percentage of our customers have been with us for more than 10 years. Now, we have a meaningful double-digit, let\u2019s say around 15% of our customers that have been with us for more than 10 years. That wouldn\u2019t be a number that would impress USAA or State Farm, I\u2019m sure, but relative to the repositioning of Progressive, that\u2019s a number that\u2019s very important, and the type of customers that we\u2019re seeing go into that state of decade and decade-plus customers are the bundled customers, so nice stuff there. With regard to your question on the high net worth, I\u2019m going to be very frank. We\u2019ve got a big agenda in front of us and we\u2019re going to probably play in something below the high net worth customer, just put it out on the table exactly that way. That doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t make some phone calls and have other people\u2019s product to sell to those high net worth customers, at least on the home side, but that\u2019s probably not the focus that we\u2019re going to add to our property business anytime in the immediate future, given the very large market opportunity there is for us that we feel very comfortable realizing. Brian Meredith : Great, thanks. Just one other one. Any changes that we could think about with respect to your reinsurance program? Glen Renwick : We\u2019ll go through the reinsurance renewal. Trevor\u2019s actually here, but in the June-July type time frame and--John, correct me if I\u2019m wrong here, but no, I expect that we will take reinsurance with our property business very, very similar to the way that we have taken it in the past, at least for the excess layers. We may and likely will reassess some small part of a quota share. That really isn\u2019t necessary from our perspective going forward, but in terms of the layers, we\u2019re not looking to take higher in risk any greater than we have taken in the past, or ASI has taken in the past, and that was never the objective. The objective is to get more customers in the door. We\u2019ll take a reasonable amount of risk, but we feel very good about the amount of risk we\u2019re taking and don\u2019t intend to extend that. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Just a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question. Meyer Shields : Thanks, good morning. I have a few questions just to understand your reporting. Let me use one example. So you have in the K, there are direct renewal application changes that were 5%, I think, for the year. In earlier quarters, it\u2019s 7%, 7%, 8%, so should we look at that 5% as just a modest dip from the 8%, or is there a bigger dip in the fourth quarter that gets us full year to 5? Glen Renwick : Want to take that, John? John Sauerland : Sure, I can take that. Recognize we do have a calendar year that in some years has more weeks than in others, so in last December of \u201914, you might recall we had an extra week. We put that in a December release for you, so. In that release, I think we also normalized the premium for the month for you to give better perspective there. I would not interpret that at all to be a dip in renewals. The PLE is what you should be looking at to understand trends in terms of customer retention, and as we discussed earlier, we\u2019re seeing good changes there. I think you\u2019re just seeing a reporting anomaly, nothing material. Meyer Shields : Okay, that helps a lot. Thanks for clarifying. Second, if we look at the property side, so if I\u2019m doing the math right, you acquired $220 million of reserves and released a little bit more than 30. Is that sort of 15% a good representation of ASI\u2019s reserving philosophy? Glen Renwick : No, I\u2019m going to sort of answer that a little bit more generically. One of the things that I am delighted about in the first nine months of being together is that we feel, and I think ASI feels that we have some skills to offer, and clearly they have product and skills to offer as well. But one of the places that we were able to actually dig in together is on the reserving side, and we now have an actuary that has been on our actuarial staff working directly for Trevor, the CFO of ASI, but also having very direct line or dotted line, whatever we want to call it, as an integral part of our reserving group. During the course of that nine months, we applied some different techniques, we looked at data a little bit more specifically to ASI versus industry data that had been done before. There was no right or wrong, there was just we\u2019re digging in, in a way that perhaps is a little bit more intense, a little more reflective of the way Progressive has done reserving. In this particular case, it turned out we had some releases. It could have been the other way. We would have adjusted either way, but I would tell you that the reflection of the releases this time is a little bit more from a highly intense review, overlaying some models, overlaying some techniques, looking at data, looking at it more frequently, and I expect going forward - obviously I cannot guarantee anything, but what I expect going forward is we\u2019ll be much more on a glide path of the kind of approaches that we take traditionally with our auto business, and I suspect the volatility will reduce. So probably one-time volatility that is reflective of that process, but frankly it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to really work together in taking a look. I have to say it\u2019s always nicer that it\u2019s a release, not an add, but frankly I feel much better that we\u2019ve had the deep study and everybody is very comfortable. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Just a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question. Jay Gelb : Thanks and good morning. Now that you\u2019ve gone through the year-end 2015 process, I just wanted to get your updated views on why you feel Progressive is not being impacted nearly as much on the personal auto side as a result of increased miles driven translating into worse claims frequency trends, like we\u2019re seeing for essentially the rest of the industry. Glen Renwick : Jay, I might challenge the right of the industry piece there a little bit. Notwithstanding that frequency was up, we\u2019re reporting sort of across the board 2, 2.5. I don\u2019t think that is dramatically different than the PCI reporting part of the industry. Fully note that there were a couple of very large and very notable competitors who know perfectly well how to calculate frequency, they reported high numbers, and that\u2019s just a fact. I can\u2019t necessarily know, other than at least in one case probably a mix adjustment that really needed to be made to sort of normalize those numbers, but I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re the anomaly on that relative to the industry. With regard to--but to be fair, any time - and I mean this sincerely - any time we see anybody else seeing something that we\u2019re not seeing, trust me, the radar just goes off like crazy and we make sure that we\u2019re not the ones waiting too long to see that kind of effect. But as it\u2019s played through from an order perspective, we really didn\u2019t see a great deal in frequency. We didn\u2019t see any major trends. We saw it up a little bit in the third quarter, but for the most part that 2, 2.5, not bad. Now, remember systemically long term, we think maybe frequency is headed for a reduction for lots of reasons with vehicle technology.  Miles driven, no question that that would be the usual suspect for increase in frequency, and to the extent we didn\u2019t see it as much as some others, I would also tell you that our most recent reporting on mileage increase related clearly to gas prices, we\u2019re starting to see the second half of \u201915--or we did see the second half of \u201915 be a lot less dramatic of an increase over the prior year than the first half of \u201915. Our most recent data points might suggest that we have hit sort of the threshold of miles to be driven. I think we\u2019d be better off waiting to the spring and summer to see if we get another spring and summer effect, but for the most part, the more recent data points we\u2019ve seen, up to and including January since we get very real-time data, is that \u201916 mileage is not dramatic, or not even different from \u201915 mileage, and we\u2019re seeing that even in the last data points of \u201915 over \u201914. So the incremental, yes, there was incremental first half of \u201915 that was very measurable, quite notable, 3 to 5% on a month-to-month basis, but we\u2019re starting to see that level out. We still see in the mix of miles driven a little shift, about a 1% shift still to trips over 15 miles. We\u2019re not seeing anything dramatic in seasonally adjusted braking rates, probably not a statistic most other companies talk about, but something that we\u2019re particularly interested in. So net-net, the gas price change may have played its way through. I\u2019m going to say that with some ability to retract my statement next time we talk in May or whatever, so stay tuned. But I would just correct that maybe the rest of the industry didn\u2019t see the frequency quite as a high as perhaps an Allstate and Geico, I think are the two that come to mind when we see that, and certainly the two that took rate that was more reflective of that. Jay Gelb : Glen, all the miles driven trends you were just talking about, that\u2019s based on Progressive\u2019s own data? Glen Renwick : Yeah, we use the Snapshot population to see if we can get--we\u2019re kind of nutty about this. We even look at it sort of daily, weekly, whatever frequency we can, because these are the sorts of things that for years we\u2019ve reported even to you, we don\u2019t always know what drives frequency. You don\u2019t always know what drives severity. Well, now we actually do have at least one proxy for frequency, and miles driven is something we can measure. So it\u2019s only a piece of the puzzle, but we\u2019re pretty obsessed with trying to get it. Jay Gelb : I can imagine that. The only other thing I wanted to touch base on with regard to what some large writers of the industry and personal auto are seeing with regard to deteriorating margins, so if the frequency impact that Progressive is seeing is not inconsistent with that of the industry, why do you feel that Progressive\u2019s personal auto margins haven\u2019t been really impacted at all? Glen Renwick : Well, that\u2019s probably a longer story, but let me suggest to you that - and we\u2019ve done this on many, many calls, I\u2019ve always said when we see situations that make us believe that rates will go up, we tend to take it early. It wasn\u2019t that many years ago that we took, and talking in aggregates is not always the best thing but it might work for this, we took rates up and frankly some of the trends didn\u2019t materialize to the degree that we thought. Our penalty there is that we actually grow a little slower with healthy margins.  However, in more recent times we\u2019ve gotten to a rate level that we thought was appropriate, and perhaps others weren\u2019t quite at that level and therefore needed to take their rates up more. So the starting point matters, and that was sort of my point before. I like to think that we\u2019re trying to ride the crest of the breaking wave. We want to stay on the crest all the time. When you fall over the crest and your margins start to deteriorate, typically that\u2019s associated with a big hammer of rate, and we all know the implications of that to retention, to NPS, and to growth. The trick for us is really staying on that crest and, as I mentioned earlier, as opposed to looking at rate take by rate filings, which you could look at a premium-weighted adjusted basis, you\u2019ll see that the industry is about 2.5 to 3.5 last year, some exceptions to that for sure on the high side and low side. But I would always draw your attention to sort of what is the realized average premium, and you see in our case that was about 4% in both channels. We have ways that I\u2019m not going to get into in great detail of making sure that we build in some trend into our rating factors as well, so that doesn\u2019t always come through in the published rate changes. So our objective is really to stay on that crest of the wave, and answering your question, it depends on the starting point, so we were not inadequate and didn\u2019t need to take a big rate increase, and we actually have been taking small bites of the apple and we\u2019re going to keep taking bites of the apple. My expectation is in the first quarter of this year, we\u2019ll take about probably the better part of a point, at least in our direct channel, and maybe close to that in our agency channel, so we\u2019ll always take that kind of a rate. I\u2019m not going to speculate for the whole year, but it might be sort of slightly below the 4%.  Ian asked the question before about severities, and while we did have the fortuitous situation of severities going down and therefore we could release reserves based on the negative severity trends we saw, I will tell you one of the first lessons I ever learned in this business was people don\u2019t get less expensive to fix, so we certainly don\u2019t plan negative trends into our pricing indications, and we\u2019re much more likely to reflect the kinds of numbers that Gary talked about going forward. So long way of saying, but our job is to stay on the crest of the wave, and the good news is that we are not currently in the position of taking a significant hammer to our rates, or haven\u2019t had to for some time, and if we can stay on that crest of the wave without falling over by taking small bites of the apple, that\u2019s our objective and that produces some very nice outcomes. Jay Gelb : That\u2019s great, thank you. Julia Hornack : This is Julia. I just want to remind everyone that if you\u2019d like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. While we wait to see if anyone else is calling in or has a question, I just wanted to make a quick housekeeping announcement, which is that for those of you who would like to join us at our investor day this year, we will be holding it on the afternoon of Thursday, October 6 in Mayfield Village, Ohio. It looks like there are no further questions, so Shirley, I will turn it back over to you for the closing script. Operator : Thank you.

Nicole, we are now ready to take our first question Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Josh Stirling : So Glenn and team, I'd love to ask sort of big picture question on growth. You guys have had a really strong, really -- probably 6 months here with growth rates rising. I'm wondering if you can help us a bit to segregate it because there's a lot of moving pieces. And I think the big picture question I'm sort of struggling with is how much is the cyclical story because of the environment? And how much is structural and the impact of your initiative -- of the various initiatives? And so when I think about it, it would be really helpful to get your sort of color on how much you think it is a function of kind of just the competitive environment changing around -- other folks taking pricing maybe on the first point. But then you obviously have a lot of retention initiatives under way the second. And then you got new products, whether it's Snapshot or homeowners. I imagine these are having some impact, and -- probably more Snapshot than homeowners at this point. But what I'd love to get from your perspective, as we think about looking forward, how much of this is kind of a cyclical upswing in the growth rates and how much of this is the impact of big sort of powerful initiatives working the way through? Glenn Renwick : You did a nice summary of our strategy there. Yes, you're right. So I'm not sure I'm going to get as specific, but think about our October IR meeting is a better opportunity for us to address a lot of those issues. Frankly, some of them are a little bit tricky to -- but cause-and-effect to, but growth is actually, boy, sign me up for another first quarter like that one. I know we certainly has some hail at the end, but frankly, we also missed some winter. So no great consent there on 94.6 [ph] or whatever. The kind of growth rates we put together. Nice quarter. Why? The fact is it's not -- it's certainly not luck that other competitors take rate. We try to take rate at the right time and make sure we're always positioned. I use the analogy of the wave last time. We tried to ride the crest of the wave. That's sort of the underlying core of everything we do. So forget all the other initiatives. We've got to run the base business exactly the way we want to run it, and keep it at a point where we'll always be in a position to take advantage of market conditions when they swing our way. We expect always to grow. That's part of our two-pronged most important statement : 96, and grow as fast as possible. But when we get that opportunity that others are perhaps scurrying where we have perhaps got ahead, we'll take those opportunities and welcome them when they come. And then, second piece is you got to manufacture your own future growth. And the kind of things with Snapshot, you're more than familiar with Snapshot representing now almost close to 2 million policies being rated with Snapshot sort of fundamentals. So you've seen from the policies that I put in my letter. That's a material part of our book, and you know it's more material on the direct side than on the agency side. We've got some nice initiatives that we'll continue there with Snapshot. We've talked last time briefly about the app which we think can also give us an opportunity to reach out to yet some other customers that are perhaps not as comfortable with a dongle inside the car. We've announced something with General Motors that will kick off within about 10 days, where we have to actually collect vehicles -- vehicle data with General Motors. So we're starting to -- as I've always said, we're starting to worry more about just the data, the algorithms and the impact on rating, less about the method of collection. So Snapshot has got some real gas in the tank, and we'll continue that. Obviously, our brand strength, we continue to push on that, and we've been able to do that in an environment where others have perhaps pulled back just a little bit on their advertising. So it seems some nice brand strength measures moving the right direction. You flip over into the agency channel. Actually, I'll stay with both for a while. Product advancements, we've talked primarily about 8.3, but we're always get -- we're always in the hopper for 4 -- 8.4 or 8.5. So we're continuing to develop that, probably the biggest move in the agency channel. Other than rate competitiveness is our bundling initiatives that we really have done so nicely within the direct side. Lots more gas in the tank there where we use a lot of carriers. In the agency side, you know the story on ASI. That's not a big factor in agency growth right now, so I wouldn't overplay that. But to the extent that we talk this time next year, I expect that to be a bigger factor in the growth. So growth initiatives are all on track, different stages of maturity. I will put Snapshot higher. We've started to see agent acceptance. I talked about that last time when you asked the question. We started to see the more recent states with agent acceptance frankly close to double what they had been previously, so we're starting to see that move in the right direction. So Snapshot moving along very well. Platinum in the agency channel really is starting to get a grip, and we'll talk about that more on our October meeting. And as long as we're very diligent with the pricing, clearly, we see, and we release numbers for at least you to get a flavor for what's going to happen in April. We're still a few days away, of course, for closing out April and getting you the information 8, 10 business days, but we know that's not going to be a great month. So we'll take a look at our rating overall. And I would say that probably we're still in a mode where we can think in terms of 4 to 5 in terms of annualized rate increases, which is a nice place to be. We gave you some indications on trends. So that core should keep rolling and the initiatives are doing well. I did not see a question specifically in terms of percentages relative to growth and that is hard to do. We have some feel, but I'm not confident to sort of push that out to a greater audience at this point. Josh Stirling : That's really helpful, Glenn. I want to so might ask a bit more sort of a numbers question then. I think the market has been worried about frequency for a while, and I guess, it's been a bit more benign. I guess, one, sort of would you characterize this is mostly sort of a let up from sort of favorable weather, which seems to be sort of implied by your Q and maybe some other competitive commentary? Or do you think frequency trends have really peaked now and the industry can now start -- maybe talk about the possibility of rating severity, which I would love to get your commentary on as well? Glenn Renwick : Yes. Always tricky with the variation there, but I'm happy to comment on that. In fact, a little piece of the story will be even different in my comments last time around. Frequency is pretty benign. And certainly, when we look at the BI, which I tend to worry a little bit more about BI frequency than anything else, so we're really in pretty good shape there. So we're not seeing anything dramatically go away. I would tell you wait another conference call or 2 to get too concerned about commentary on PIP. We've got some issues in New Jersey that we think may be driving that number a little bit differently than the true read. I won't say true read, true long-term read. So severity really is the play, and for the most part, not too much of concern there with bodily injury. I think the interesting point for severity is really the collision. And I think it's a little bit too early to suggest that we've clearly put in our Q that frequency was moderated by winter weather this year in the Midwest and the Northern states. That's absolutely the case. We also discussed last time that based on our Snapshot measuring, we were not seeing fifth -- the last quarter of '15 was overlaying the last quarter of '14 more on miles driven -- vehicles miles driven. That's changed in the first quarter. So we're actually seeing an uptick now on vehicle miles driven in the first quarter of '16 relative to the first quarter of '15. So that's interesting and that tracks very much with the public gasoline demand as well. So while we all speculate on the effect of the increased miles, and I've always cautioned that you need to know what kinds of miles, and we are seeing the longer trip miles be the primary driver of that. We may see a little bit of a tick up in frequency, and we certainly need to watch that for what I'll call short- to mid-term pricing. But we may, we may, and please stress that. We may really be seeing a more structural long-term change and in lower frequency, as we know, cars are getting safer. We've always talked about that. That's very, very hard to sort of measure on a month or even quarterly basis. But it would not be surprising to me to see in the future that we'll see a long-term structural decline in frequency, and quite possibly, as history has shown us, a similar offset on the severity. So those would be my primarily issues there. Right now, frankly, given that there has never been a time in history there hasn't never been some puts and takes on frequency and severity. This is a reasonably predictable of mile time. The only outlier perhaps is a little bit of PIP severity for us right now and little bit of collision severity that we'll take a look at. But that's sort of from a pricing perspective is being offset by frequency. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : So Glenn, I'm just curious. You've owned ASI for about a year. Obviously, some high CAT loss activity in March. It sounds like in April there is also. Is it higher than you would've expected? And as a result, any thoughts about maybe changing the reinsurance program or something you can do to maybe mitigate some of that volatility? Glenn Renwick : I'll answer the first question now. No thoughts. That doesn't mean we won't ever have thoughts. We're always going to consider that, but I think about the percentage of the overall book of business that we have, we currently have a small quarter share percentage. We have a single attachment point of about $45 million for any single event, and we have an aggregate attachment of $175 million. Those feel very much in proportion to things that we're willing to handle. Do I like volatility? Of course not. No one does. You don't and I don't. But if this was sort of in the realm of understanding of what likely could happen when we did something like this, absolutely, it certainly also plays to the fact that we're writing an awful lot of homeowners, not necessarily with some of these results that we have to report in-house. So the partners that we have, they're all obviously having those problems. So it's a different dynamic when we have it in the place that we absolutely need it, and as I said in my letter, it hasn't even been a momentary thought to be of any concern whatsoever. And there's no pressure from my perspective to take any less reinsurance, but equally no more reinsurance. Brian Meredith : Great. And then just quickly, on the Commercial Auto business, the strong growth that you guys have been seeing, some of that, I know, comes from some new products that you have out there, but I imagine there's also some of this going on from the dislocations that we're seeing out in the marketplace, especially with some large Commercial Auto riders. How long do you think that continues for? Glenn Renwick : You're right in your summary. John, you've to look at this. Do you have any -- I don't have a really strong view because I can't know what the other competitors are doing, but do we have any other insight? John Sauerland : Sure. Yes, we have seen a lot of dislocation, and we think we were well ahead of the marketplace even as much as 2 to 3 years ago in seeing some trends that we took some material rate to address, and also added some significant underwriting efforts to a lot of the lines we right there to ensure we were writing business that was going to be profitable. So we're really well positioned now. And yes, we are seeing a big increase in corp volumes. So if you think about new business incoming is either a function of an increase in conversion or quotes and in Commercial Lines is predominantly in quotes, which it generally means competitors are raising rates or just not choosing to quote the business. As far as where that goes, we can't know with certainty for sure. We are confident on our rate level. In some of the areas, we might take rates up a bit, but, obviously, you see combined ratios there that are very good. And we expect we'll continue to be very good, so we're pretty bullish on growth moving forward for commercial. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Gary Ransom : I noticed you gave some attention to your new relationship with Uber in Texas, and it seems like there's a big increase in the potential for the data that you can collect and your understanding of driving behavior. It's not just individual drivers like you're doing with Snapshot, but it's tracking a network. Everyone of these drivers has a GPS, and you'll have your own app that you can combine with it. I'm just wondering if you could give us a little more color of how much of this might change your view? Or how you can look at driving patterns, driving behavior out there. Glenn Renwick : Gary, right now, I'm not dodging that question. I'm genuinely not, but the fact is your thesis is so on point. Just understand, that's sort of what we're all about. And when you get a situation like Uber where you can truly collect the data, there's a wealth of data, whether you incorporate Snapshot or whether we use the data that's otherwise available to us, this is truly an exciting situation because it just plays entirely into everything that we feel we're good at. And, hopefully, we're playing into one of Josh's comments earlier, just one more thing to have another arrow in the quiver of places to see growth coming later. But there's not a lot to report right now, and I'm simply not dodging your question. But the idea that this is just an insurance program, it's much more than that. And that's why I used the analogy of square peg, round hole. And I think we've really developed a program that makes a lot of sense. And hopefully, the way this is really successful is that we know what that vehicle is doing, where it's going, sort of route intensity, braking intensity. All sorts of things that we can know, not only at the fleet level, but we can know it at the driver level as well. So frankly, this is one that, if I was in person you'd see me smiling because I think this is sort of one of those opportunities that comes along relatively and frequently, and this just seemed like we had our name written all over. Gary Ransom : My imagination may not be enough to see other opportunities of a similar nature, but are there other opportunities out there where you can gather more informative data like that? Glenn Renwick : Yes, I think, you got to accept strategically that, that is the mind set you've got to have. You can take it all the way from the private passenger automobile, which we're doing slowly with Snapshot, but you'll see taxicabs being sort of more involved in this type of thing. There's a release today in The Wall Street Journal about GM working with Lyft. We have a relationship with Lyft. There's a lot more vehicle sharing. It's a minute part of the economy right now, but certainly one that if you are a betting person, you'll probably bet on seeing that being a lot bigger later. We want to make sure that we're designing contemporary style insurance programs for those kinds of options. And frankly, I think, we're extremely well-suited for it. We know others will have some interest, but we're doing an awful lot of groundwork right now, and we're very happy with that. So I think this is going to be something we're going to be talking about a lot more in the years to come. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer Shields : Glenn, you mentioned, I think in response to Josh, that you expect increases in severity to offset the frequency decreases that you can anticipate from improving cars. And that kind of surprised me because, I guess, I wouldn't have necessarily seen the historical connection persist, and I was hoping if you could talk a little bit more about that. Glenn Renwick : Well, we've actually shown in at least one IR meeting, I'm not quite sure whether it was 2 or 3 years ago, sort of what I would call, if not a perfect monotonic function over some reasonable period of time, a declining frequency. The fact is we made our cars safer in this country for the last 30 years. And there's is nothing on the immediate horizon that suggest that we're not going to make them continuously safer. Some of the things, even the federal mandate for emergency braking. Those sorts of things, it's impossible for me to think there isn't a real macro driver to yet make cars safer. So that's my primus for declining frequency. What's interesting is that over that time period, the market for private passenger auto has grown, and that is largely a severity offset to the, actually, it's even more than an offset, it's a gain, over the frequency decline. And those are interesting and accurate and observable facts. When you start to decompose it to try to sort of say exactly coverage by coverage what's driving it, that gets a little trickier. But I'm working, at least my mind set, is that a long-term strategic view is that we will see fewer accidents and more expensive accidents. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's fair enough. And a second sort of a detailed question. The jump in the Commercial Auto sales ratio in March, is it fair to tie that to the new Uber relationship? Glenn Renwick : No. I wouldn't tie that -- it might be $0.01 or $0.02 there for sure, but actually, there's probably 2 bigger drivers of that. We're working to put a great new system in for commercial, so some expense associated with that. But mostly is driven by advertising costs as we continue to grow our penetration and/or our attraction for direct operations. So that landscape is in small-business people who have needs that are not that dissimilar to private passenger auto and choose to operate or interact with us on a direct basis. We're building that out and that definitely seems like the demand is there, so we're doing more advertising to support that. That will be the biggest driver of the expense difference. Meyer Shields : Okay. And then, it sounds like it'll continue based on your comments on the environment. Glenn Renwick : Yes, it will be a little spiky from time to time based on seasonality, but yes, I expect that. But that doesn't mean there won't be some equal and opposite offsets, as we build out retention book indirect, so a lot of it is front-ended. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is coming from Ian Gutterman of Balyasny. Ian Gutterman : Glenn, I just want to talk real quick on the frequency comments in the Q sounding a little bit better and then your comments earlier about miles driven being up, which we can all see. Usually, though, those 2 seem to correlate a little bit more. It Seems like they went in opposite direction this quarter? Any thoughts on that? Glenn Renwick : Yes, I'd be careful to make a quarter-to-quarter comparison there. Let's take a look together sort of to next quarter, even next 6 months to see how the frequency is ultimately being reflected through. It should be a pretty close comparison, but I'm not always convinced that it gets one for one, so I'd wait just a quarter and see. Ian Gutterman : Got it. Okay. Great. And then a couple of things on the homeowners. One is just can you just tell us a little bit about how your reinsurance is structured? And I guess what I'm getting at is I'm guessing because a lot of others have done this. You probably have some aggregate recover. And just given the March events and the April events sort of how do you stand with the aggregate cover? What's the risk of essentially going through that if we have more events later in the year, especially a hurricane? Do you need to sort of by live cover for the rest of the year? And then just big picture on your home, just the one I could see in the market share, obviously, your 2 biggest states are Florida and Texas, which are heavy CAT states. As you rollout the Platinum, is it a specific goal to grow away from CAT areas? Or is this just sort of take it where you can get it if it's good customer, and you'll sort out the CAT mix later? Glenn Renwick : Well, we try not to do things later, we try to think about them ahead of time, but the fact is Florida and Texas, that's where people live. So we're going to be active there and we're comfortable with it. And the reinsurance that ASI has put together right from the beginning is obviously in a position to respect the fact that they have coastal exposure. So I could -- why don't you go through, John, the sort of the 3 layers. We're a long way from sort of overly any concerns that Ian has there, but why don't we at least talk about the 45 single event, the 175 bond, and Trevor is right here, so if we need additional help, we can get that. John Sauerland : So, obviously, we gave you some insights into ASI reinsurance program in the Q, Glenn has just covered them. The first layer is 45 million and the tower on the first event, we won't start quoting PMLs, but trust me that it is much higher than I would expect the average industry buys to. So going to the top, so to speak, is a highly unlikely event. Yes, we then have a pretest, pre-bond [ph] facility that is an aggregate of $175 million and that is for -- strong throughout calendar period. We have covered on second event similarly, not quite as high a tower, but we also prepurchase reinstatement on many of the layers. So now completely up the tower. But unlike many other players, once -- if we ever had to reinstate, those premiums are prepaid for much of the reinsurance. So ASI has an extremely robust reinsurance program. All of the players in that program are -- virtually all are A- rated or better. So we're very comfortable with the program. And that $45 million, they had targeted previously that retention to ensure that at any one event, less than 10% of their surplus was at risk. And, obviously, less than 10% of their surplus is a pretty small percentage of the combined entities, so a pretty robust reinsurance program. Trevor, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? Trevor Hillier : No, I think you nailed it pretty well, so. Ian Gutterman : That's great, very helpful. If I could just clarify, Glenn, on the Platinum part again. Just -- is there any restrictions at all? I mean, do you say we'd rather not grow Houston if we're not -- if we're going to grow Texas? Or we'd rather not grow Miami if we're going to grow Florida? And maybe just market it more aggressively in the Midwest or the Northeast or other places if we have a little bit less CAT risk? Glenn Renwick : ASI has historically sort of controlled the risk to a significant degree in Florida, only taking the amount of business they feel comfortable with. We're very conscious of the concentration layers. But as we roll out the rest of the country, obviously, that will become less dependent on any one state. So there's a yes, and a no answer in there. Yes, because of where we are today, but ultimately, we want to be a meaningful bundled option for consumers, and Florida is a big state. And we will, as you just heard, make sure that we have all the right reinsurance. We're not going to put -- we're not going to go crazy. We know our objective here is to try to get customers and have them with us for a long period of time. And if we are more than comfortable letting someone take the layers above that and, hopefully, they'll make profits on that over a reasonable period of time because we'll achieve our objectives as well. But don't assume that somehow we're going to only be marketing this in the sort of interior states or something like that. We're going to be as aggressive in states as we can be, but, hopefully, you would agree we will be very thoughtful about that and have the right level of risk sharing. That doesn't mean, and this is probably interesting, that we sort of got the layers that we have. We've got the results that we have. This may be sort of the pain point right now in terms of absorbing the results. And the real question is how do we feel about that volatility? I think we're getting, I wish it wasn't the case per se, but I think we're getting a sense of exactly what that volatility can mean to us. And my own encouragement -- just my encouragement, is given that we're monthly reporter, you're going to see that volatility just be a little bit more dramatic than you would over a longer periods of time. There's not an ounce of us rethinking strategy or doing anything differently at this point. I shouldn't make it flippant in that case. It doesn't mean we haven't thought a great deal about it. We're just coming back and confirming the positions that we have. John Sauerland : ASI did enter California in January, I believe you said where we started writing business, in February. And we expect to be in New York midyear May. So sort of naturally as they expand across the country, you'll see less concentration in those coastal states. But to date, yes, they've been pretty highly concentrated in the Southeast. But I think naturally, as they enter more states where other -- there's a large populace as well, you'll see that concentration decrease. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Markets. Mark Dwelle : I just wanted to get a little bit more information on the CAT losses that you've already reported for the second quarter. Were those primarily concentrated in the Texas market? Or was it a little bit more geographically dispersed than that? Glenn Renwick : Jump in guys. I think Texas is a big driver. You probably, even if you watch television, you'll see that Oklahoma has got something. There's a little in Kansas, but the real driver is Texas. Mark Dwelle : Is that more skewed towards the flood losses in Houston or the hail losses in San Antonio? Glenn Renwick : Well, let's breakout 2 lines apart. Frankly, for vehicle -- well, we have the same real issue. Hail and driving weather really have been the cause for both auto and home. Home is not really affected by the flood conditions in Houston. Some of our vehicles are, although that actually was a relatively manageable number. My memory tells me, about 450 losses directly related to the floods. So that's not a big driver of our results this month. So when you see that 135, the 85-50 split, think about the really nasty peril of hail. When hail gets to be the size that it is, it is warfare out there for roofs and for sheet metal and there's a lot of damage. That's just plain and simple. Hail is one of the most nasty perils that we come into, so comp is going to be dramatically affected by that. And as I said, we are -- we will take a couple of opportunities even though the numbers will be what they are. The first thing that we'll do is recognize that these are first-party claims. So in turn, we're going to have -- we're going to pay the loss, so we've got to turn that into a marketing expense. This is the time that we get with our customers and make their lives better after an upset, whether it's their roof or whether it's their windshield or whatever. So first thing the attitude we're taking right now is turn that into a marketing expense. We know how important retention is. We know the relationship when you give great service in claims and the future retentions, so that's the first thing. Second is take a look at our pricing, make sure that we're where we want to be. Certainly one spike of a month, we've seen that on numerous occasions. We're not at all concerned that we off-track for our commitments to shareholders, they are 96 or better. But we will reevaluate our CAT loss or CAT loads. And I would tell you if I was looking at the overall market, I see rate change in an overall basis, certainly some driven by big competitors. The last data point we have, February, around about a 4.5%, which is about 110 basis points stronger than earlier in the year. My suspicion based on knowing what's being filed, we will get more clarity on that from competitors for April and May. But we know there's been a lot of rate changes filed, so you could see that go a little higher. And I would say if I was giving you direction last call, I probably would've said think in the 4% range. Think about a point per quarter if you average it out. I'd say put another 25 to 40 basis points on that per quarter, as we look at the rest of the year. And we might be a little higher when you factor in CAT loss or CAT loads. But for the most part, I think this is all quite manageable for us. Mark Dwelle : That's really helpful. One last kind of nerd question. When events like these happen, do those tally into frequency and severity statistics? Or do -- is that like a different calculation for CAT or inflictees? Glenn Renwick : Well, they are mostly comp, at least on the vehicle side. So typically, when we give you numbers for frequency and severity, we don't put comp in there because it's kind of -- that just be a random walk in terms of your graph. So most of the frequency and severity numbers we give you are the more sustainable coverages like BIU [ph] and BIPD. But certainly, as we look at it, yes, it factors in. Operator : Our next question is coming from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Montgomery Scott. Robert Glasspiegel : Glenn, I'm going to push back a little bit on your sort of slight warning about miles driven potentially having an impact on frequency. I mean, gas prices are up 30% from sort of roughly the average level of where they were in the quarter. And we're going to soon be sort of lapping year-over-year impact of gas prices. If lower gas prices hasn't really driven a big impact on frequency to your book to date, why just -- in the future, should we be incrementally more nervous about it? Glenn Renwick : Well, I would -- I'm going to probably relieve myself here a little bit. The last quarter, we had our 2015 fourth quarter wasn't that much different than 2014 fourth quarter. As we start this first quarter of '16, we're starting to see be considerably above. That tracks with gasoline demand, that all makes reasonable sense. Now the question is, how high will it go? Well, people aren't going to drive infinite miles just because gas is cheaper, they're not going to drive to work more often. So this is more recreational and discretionary-type trips. And frankly, I think everybody can have a theory on that. I would just tell you that what has changed is in the first quarter, we are seeing miles driven as our Snapshot population, which is large enough to be credible, make the claim that it's different than the claim I made for the fourth quarter where we hadn't seen it be dramatic. In fact, it had flattened off. It is now showing increase. And we're going into what is really the high vehicle mile traveled part of the year. So it'll be interesting to see whether or not the discretionary usage continues to be higher or not. And this one, Bob, I think all I can do is report the news. We have incredible interest in this sort of thing because it makes a big difference. But whether I could say that we're seeing a dramatic change in frequency simply because of that, no, we take it as it comes. And there's indications that because those miles are more discretionary and longer distance trips that the effect on frequency is not quite as linear as you might expect. Robert Glasspiegel : Totally with you. I guess I was asking more a futuristic question. The data that you're looking at is when gas prices were down a whole lot year-over-year, and we've had a 30% spike in gas prices. And I'm just saying if you're looking at real-time data the last few weeks, I would think that you're not going to see the same year-over-year mileage increases that we saw in the first quarter where gas prices were down a whole lot versus a year ago. Glenn Renwick : I wouldn't bet against you on that one. I don't have the April numbers actually. As soon as I get off this call, I'm actually probably going to get more of the April numbers because -- that will be very interesting, yes. John Sauerland : While we can't model it perfectly, we think gas prices -- there's some step functions in there. Certainly back when we had $4, that was a ceiling that people retracted it a lot. But we think in some reasonable range, sort of the marginal change in driving is not that linear with gas prices. Robert Glasspiegel : Certainly economic. And trucks -- I mean, this is a very complicated, trucks versus trains can obviously impact it a lot. Glenn Renwick : Airline travel, too. Discretionary travel. Robert Glasspiegel : Right. Switching gears on... [indiscernible] Glenn Renwick : Yes. Unfortunately, we reported news more here, but we have our own theories, but I don't dismiss or suggest that yours is not an interesting one as well. April will tell a story because we're really going into April in May and June, which are the high travel vehicle miles travel months. Robert Glasspiegel : Right. It looks like you lengthened your maturities a little bit in the first quarter. You took your short term down. Anything material behind that? And anything on the investment side that we should be aware of that you're doing? Glenn Renwick : Bill, if you want to jump in on that? Bill Cody : Sure. Yes. Actually, we shortened the duration of the portfolio a little bit in the first quarter as rates sell. The short-term change or the big increase in short-term in the first quarter is really not so much a portfolio strategy change as it is a definitional change. What I tried to get through in this Q is that we had about $1.1 billion of short coupon treasuries that accounted in our Treasury portfolio that matured in the first quarter. And we rolled those into treasury bills, which were accounted in the short-term portfolio. So no real big change there other than a tenth [ph] of a year decline in the duration of the portfolio. The other changes that we had was we increased our corporates a little bit in the first quarter as we saw some more compelling opportunities when spreads were wider. And then we've made some little repositioning around the ARX portfolio where we took control of the management of that portfolio on January 1. So there has been some turnover in regards to that. But other than that, no material changes in the portfolio and certainly no changes in our overall strategy there. Julia Hornack : It would appear that, that was our last question. So that concludes our call today. Nicole, I will turn it back over to you for the closing script. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Progressive Corporation's Investor Relations Conference Call. An instant replay of the call will be available through Friday, May 20, by calling 1 (800) 253 1052 or can be accessed via the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year.",

[Operator Instructions] In addition, this conference is being recorded at the request of Progressive. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. The company will not make detailed comments in addition to those provided in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. And we'll use this conference call to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the call will be Julia Hornack.  At this time, I will turn the call over to Ms. Hornack. Julia Hornack : Good afternoon. Welcome to Progressive Conference Call. Answering your questions today will be Tricia Griffith, our CEO; John Sauerland, our CFO; and Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer. Additionally, Glenn Renwick, our CEO through the second quarter, now our Executive Chairman, has joined us for today's call.  The call is scheduled to last about an hour. As always, our discussions on this call may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during this call. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements relating to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the risks, uncertainties and other challenges we face. These documents can be found via the investors page of our website, progressive.com.  Dexter, we are now ready to take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Ryan Tunis of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ryan Tunis : So I guess my question is just on, I guess, the willingness in the short term to push through the 96 in terms of trying to grow some of the new business. I mean, is there a willingness to do that? Or should we think about 96 as the limit even if it's such -- even if it's at the expense of some short-term growth? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Ryan. Good question. We're not going to change our sort of moat around 96. We want to continue to have it be 96 every calendar year. Clearly, we're pushing closer to that based on our results, but we're quite happy with the growth, but we'll continue to try get a 96 aggregate calendar year. Ryan Tunis : So should we think about, I guess, as you approach that, as may be a leading indicator so -- of how we should think about, I guess, new business growth, of looking out over, call, it the next 6 months? Tricia Griffith : I think we can take other actions to keep that 96. I really am pleased with our new business growth. Yes, when we look at it from a target perspective, I want to look at the long-term growth of Progressive. So I think there's other actions we can take to not necessarily take anymore rate we feel like we are -- we have a good rate position for the next -- until the end of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Picking up on something you said in the letter, just kind of you saw picked up in growth within bundled customers towards the end of the quarter, I believe. Can you quantify kind of the policies that you're seeing bundling, or put some numbers around that? And I'm assuming that was in reference to the platinum product that you guys now have in the market? Tricia Griffith : Yes. There -- a couple of things. They have growth on both the platinum products and on our direct side. I'm not going to put a lot of numbers around it right now. I'm going to give you a little more color, or actually, Pat Callahan will give you a more color on that during our October Investor Relations Conference. I believe what Glenn was saying, and he can add in, was really what we're seeing the growth start to happen, the momentum start to happen. So first quarter -- I talked about this a couple of calls ago, first quarter, we really spent time integrating the ASI and the Progressive sales force, and now we're rolling out more Platinum state and more PHA states, where -- or ASI rights business. So we feel like there's a really good momentum, and good momentum on both the direct and the agency side for the bundled growth. A lot of it has to do with our product model, which we believe is doing well, both on unbundled and bundled business. Glenn, did you want to add anything? Glenn Renwick : [indiscernible] Tricia Griffith : No. Elyse Greenspan : And then just as a follow up to the prior question on the 96% combined ratio target? What about if you kind of get above that level, just driven by CAT as opposed to just to the new business penalty. CATs and weather are probably more unpredictable. Would you still, I guess, pull back on growth if you kind of come -- keep coming in above that 96%? Tricia Griffith : That's a good question. I think I'll take that month-to-month. We put CAT load in. Clearly, first couple of quarters, it's been a lot higher, I think, in the whole industry. So I'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. And I think I'll take actions appropriate to get as close to that 96% if something happens dramatically with CAT. I can't predict those so our goal doesn't change. It's still going to be 96% the aggregate calendar year. That said, as the months play out, if CATs continue, we'll have to make adjustments. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Tricia, congratulations on your new role. The first question is, like, one of your competitors just established a -- like a new business unit to deal with the connected cars. I just wanted your thoughts on the sort of industry trends. What's the potential impact from autonomous car in the shared mobility and your own initiatives? Tricia Griffith : Thank you. First of all. We have been, obviously, thinking through the impact of autonomous cars for quite some time. And clearly from our -- just our -- the -- our ability to be first and be a leader in the UBI space just to understand kind of the -- what's going on. We don't have specific unit. We have several areas of the company that think deeply about this. And as we continue to learn more about the changing technology, whether it's connected cars or just the sharing economy, we will continue to put the right amount of resources on to make sure that we think it through as a long term strategy. Kai Pan : Okay. My follow-up question is on the PLE improvements. What's driving that? And also for the new business you're adding, are they coming from these sort of, like, the area where you see most of the PLE improvements? Tricia Griffith : I'll start with the new business. So the new business that we're adding, we look at everything as far as targets. So we look at targets, new renewals, by channel, by segment, and we feel really good about the new business coming in the door. Our PLE is really based on how long we expect that business to stay, and we've been working really hard on a couple of things, both on the nature and nurture side. So our new business -- I mean, our PLE improvement is really coming from the mix of business that is coming into door, having a competitive product and competitive rates. You don't want to crank up rates. So getting ahead of that rate is really important because then people don't feel the need to shop. And we're seeing even some -- as we kind of look at our service, we're seeing some on the nurture side. We've been doing a lot in our customer service area to make sure we could give people the products they need when they need them, and the services they expect. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Paul Newsome : Congratulations on the new positions. I wanted to ask actually the ride share question. And whether or not you think that, that's having any impact on previous year severity losses? And I guess, as a follow-up to that, I'd like to know how you guys are approaching it? My understanding is when the app is on, there's a possible -- rider you can get, whether it's a person, a passenger in a car, there is sort of coverage from private passenger. And I'm wondering whether or not you're successfully or you think you're successfully catching those instances where people are trying to use Progressive Insurance instead of a Commercial Auto policy? Tricia Griffith : That's a good question. I think we were able to, through a series of questions, when someone first reports the loss, we're able to identify some of those. I'm sure there's some getting through. On the Personal Auto side, we have an endorsement that fills part of the gap between Personal Auto and Commercial. And then in quarter 2, we rolled out in Texas, a partnership with Uber for a commercial product. So early, so I don't have a lot of results. And the results that I do have are mere expectations. So we're pretty enthusiastic about working with ride-sharing companies overall. So I can tell you more about that, probably in October, have more data, but we're excited about our relationship right now with Uber in Texas on the Commercial side. Paul Newsome : Is there really an easy way to catch these folks if they are -- if they get into an accident with a passenger? You just have to kind of ask, or is there some sort of a process that allows you -- you and others to catch in a -- essentially when they are trying to get the coverage on the part of the passenger when they're not [indiscernible]. Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think there's not an easy way. I think it is really about having a well-trained claims organization from their first dose of loss all the way through the file owner, who's kind of quarterbacking the file. This is top-of-mind with everyone now because there's so many Uber and lift drivers. So we have to put processes in the place to ask the right questions and try to get at when they're in an Uber vehicle versus a personal auto. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber of William Blair. Adam Klauber : I have 2 quick questions. On direct, you've seen -- we've seen PIF really accelerate in the last 18 months. Would you attribute that more to dislocation in the market? Or more to more consumers buying digitally? Tricia Griffith : A couple of different things there. We got out ahead of trends. So I think we were -- we had a really good rate and took advantage of that. We also, last year, towards the second half of last year, saw some opportunity to invest more on the media side, specifically in digital auctions. And then we thought, we were able to buy some really efficient spend on that. So we've got some growth on that as well. So I think it was partly that. And what was the second part of your question? Adam Klauber : Are -- is the growth being driven by just consumers being more comfortably buying and shopping digitally versus calling an agent? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So we're also seeing that as well. So in an answer to your question, both of those things, a little dislocation, some actions on our part, and people being very comfortable buying online. Adam Klauber : Okay. Then the second question, you've been building up short-term cash. It's up over $5 billion. Or short-term investments, over $5 billion. I'm guessing -- I assumed that's because of the low rates. If rates stay relatively low, what are you going to do with that -- all that cash? Tricia Griffith : Bill? Bill Cody : Sure. Yes, I'd love to be able to redeploy that to some spread product at reasonable levels. The reason for the cash buildup is somewhat that categorization change. We had a fair bit of treasury securities, close to $1.5 billion, that were -- at the end of 2015 that were classified as treasuries, and they matured in the first half of this year, and those wound up in the short-term portfolio. So that's one of the reasons why our cash and treasuries are up, or our cash is up. If you look at cash and treasuries together, it's not up nearly as much as cash on its own as -- but yes, I'd love to be able to deploy that into some reasonable spread product. We had some opportunities to do that earlier in the year, but now it's gotten a little bit harder. Adam Klauber : If those opportunities don't come around, if rates stay lower, it can go lower, do -- using that cash towards buybacks or dividends, does that become an option? Bill Cody : Well, as far as the portfolio, if rates go lower, we'll -- we're only going to take risk if we get paid to take risk. We're going to take either duration risk or spread risk if we get paid. If we're not going to get paid -- if we're not being paid appropriately to take that risk, we're not going to do that. With regards to the capital, which is very different than the portfolio, John will answer that. John Sauerland : Sure. So our decisions around buybacks or dividends are independent of the mix of our portfolio. That is more a function of the total level of capital we hold. And we've described that to you in a number of different venues. But briefly, we have a regulatory layer. We have a layer above that, which we call extreme contingency. And above that, we are in position to deploy that capital again through dividends, buybacks or otherwise. And as we report, we have been above that extreme contingency layer, so we have enough capital to take actions that we see fit. You may have seen, we did some buybacks in the second quarter. We are out of the market for a little bit of time due to some information that's obviously now public with Patricia in the role. So the decisions around capital return, if you will, are independent of the portfolio mix. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel of Janney. Robert Glasspiegel : Congratulations, Tricia and Glenn, on your new assignments. In Glenn's letter, closing letter, he said that the fast growth, coupled with acceptable margins, is adding significantly intrinsic value to the enterprise. I was wondering what kind of math do you have behind that statement that you'd be willing to share with us? Warren Buffett, I guess -- Geico meeting -- Berkshire meeting, said that each new Geico policy is worth $1,500 in lifetime economics. What's the math between growth and enterprise value that you use? Glenn Renwick : I wasn't supposed to be answering questions. It's so unfair. I have done that math before on numerous occasions. I don't have any specific numbers for you, maybe John can think about that for the October meeting because it's quite simple. Although there are estimates, I'm not sure in this case whether it would be that much dramatically different than Geico. The bottom line and the implication there is a very serious one. Not only are we adding to the portfolio with a lot of new PIFs, but we're adding a mix that is taking us into longer PLE-type customers. And while we're not prepared to sort of lay out every detail of that, the intrinsic value to that to the long-term earnings of the company is very significant. John Sauerland : Bob, I'd add to that. It's a great question. At the previous Investor Meeting, we talked about the invisible balance sheet. And so we won't quantify that completely for you, but naturally, an in force direct policy has a future NPV, if you will, that is greater than an agency policy because they are acquisition economics. We continue to grow that direct book far faster. We would like to grow across all segments, all channels. But if you're thinking about the longer-term intrinsic value, I think that's an important consideration as the growth of the direct book with, as Glenn was pointing out, extending PLEs. And our Direct auto business is actually now at a peak in terms of historic PLEs, and in the right direction, as Tricia was pointing out. So we think we are building on that invisible balance sheet. Glenn Renwick : We do have, and Tricia can give it to you, a slightly updated number that I've given on -- several years back in terms of what the implication of 1 month of PLE extension is worth to us. Tricia Griffith : Yes. I actually just was doing that math a few days ago. And 1 month of extended PLE has a lifetime earned premium value of about $1.5 billion. Robert Glasspiegel : And Glenn, I enjoyed your letter, and did notice who won the basketball this year. If I could just squeeze in one more question. Your growth is fantastic across the company. The one area that's been disappointing to me is homeowners. I hate to pick on the one sort of negative. Maybe it's in line with the growth that you expected, but where is that acquisition as far as top line contribution relative to where you thought it would be? Tricia Griffith : It continues to evolve. Yes, it continues to -- I'll ask John to add in some stuff. It continues to evolve. We've had some -- few things happened that we weren't prepared for, but we are very positive and bullish about the bundled offering on the agency side. Again, when I spoke earlier, it's really about kind of getting that momentum and getting more Platinum states, more Platinum agents. We have slightly less than 1,000 Platinum agents. And I think as we gain more, as we enter into more states, that momentum will continue. So I think -- would I like it to be faster? Absolutely. And do I think we have the momentum to really start moving on more and more bundled business? Absolutely. So while I'd love it to be better, I think you'll see that what we have a -- we've put a lot of resources on making sure that we get that bundled products in both our agency and direct business. John Sauerland : The only thing that I would add to that, as we noted, there was a significant customer that ASI lost in the course of our taking a majority position. That is as it is. The new business impact of that is well behind us. The renewal business impact to that, I would characterize as a little more than half behind us. These are all annual policies or predominantly annual policies, I'll remind you. So we don't see that sort of drag continuing for long. The efforts that Tricia mentioned, we're confident, are going to grow ASI materially, and again, along the lines of the intent of the acquisition, which was with the bundled product. And while it's not unit growth, if you're working on your model, recognize as well that we terminated a quota share agreement at the beginning of June. There was a 10% quota share. So in terms of premium growth, at least over the next 12 months or 11 more months, we'll see the benefit of that as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer Shields : In terms of the short-term modeling that we have to do, do Platinum customers have a bigger new business penalty than sort of the legacy Progressive customers? Tricia Griffith : No. John Sauerland : To that -- the new business penalty, if you will, varies by channel a lot. So obviously, Platinum is agency, so there's less expense ratio differential between new and renewal for Platinum customers. But the other important thing we see is the difference between new and renewal varies by customer segment. So when our product managers are working to price business to that lifetime 96, as well as hitting the calendar year 96, that's all baked in so that we're confident by segment that when we're putting on new business, we're putting out the lifetime 96 or less. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's helpful. And then I don't know if this is for Glenn or for Tricia, but I had a hard time sort of understanding Glenn's comments about Commercial Lines in the second quarter. Is the expectation that you'll get back to sort of the really strong outperformance or we'll get back to 96? And maybe some color on what actually -- what questions were answered? Tricia Griffith : I'll start. And then if Glenn wants to add in because he wrote it. So I think you were just talking about Commericial Lines came in. There's some seasonality in June, and we expect to see that in June and July. But if you read the Q, we know that we've put on a lot of new business in the Commercial Lines organization and that put some pressure on calendar year combined ratio. And so we're addressing it with some rate adjustments. We saw some unfavorable development compared to 2015 on loss in LAE. And we have a little bit of a mix shift intentionally to for hire transportation, for hire speciality. So with that, we want to make rate adjustments to make sure we are ahead of the curve because we want to obviously bake in how those might play out and how those might develop. In addition, on the Commercial side, we've made a lot of investments that also put pressure on the expense ratio. So we've made some investments in the direct channel, in our brand, and more importantly, hiring in advance of needs, specifically on our CRM organization. So some of those things, we're seeing a little bit more pressure, but we feel good where we're at. We're taking a rate adjustment around 4% to 5% in the aggregate. Do you want to add anything, Glenn? Glenn Renwick : No. I think you've got all the primary details. I hope that when Tricia writes to you, and I certainly have hoped that we provide some degree of color as opposed to just reported the numbers. So in this case, here was a data point that if you look at the time series, it clearly jumped off the page. That's can happen from time to time in a monthly time series. But I just want you to know what we already are doing, and that, looking at whether there's really systemic reasons that when something is being missed in the past. That does not appear to be the case. And just know that there's a lot of attention to it. If I were an analyst in your position and I saw a sudden jump like that, I'd ask questions. So we were just calling out the fact that we have those questions and we're looking at them and comfortable. Tricia Griffith : Yes. If you look at the history of June, July-ish, the last -- I mean, 5 out of 6, you'll see we're a little bit higher combined ratios. I think Glenn said something in this letter about there's going to be a lot of eyes watching this fast-growing area. And clearly, we're really proud that we are now #1 for Commercial Auto. But the numbers that I will care about and John will care about, will really be profit and growth in that order. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : I was hoping -- could you give us a sense or help us quantify the year-over-year increase you're seeing in the loss ratio on the direct side? Ex the CAT, how much of that is attributable to the new business penalty? And then I have a quick follow-up. Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, I think there's definitely, you're going to see that new business. There's a little bit uptick in frequency and a little bit in severity. So I'd say those 3 things. Just more losses happen with new business and a little bit of an uptick in both frequency and severity. John Sauerland : Additionally, we do have some very modest unfavorable development for the year. And you're comparing that to last year when we had a little less than 2 points of favorable development. So that's what you're seeing as well. Tricia Griffith : Yes. Yes, I'm not too concerned. I think the unfavorable year-to-date, 0.3 points, on the CR is about $30 million. And that I consider adequate, with a little variation, which is our goal. Brian Meredith : Great. Could you just remind us the new business penalty you wanted to accept to the direct side versus the agency side? Just kind of give the economics of the business. Where are you kind of willing to let your combined ratio float up to on your agency business, net-to-gross? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think understand your question. So the new -- the way we bring new business is so different in both the channels. So the new business target in Direct is much higher because we front load all of our acquisition costs. So that's the big difference in terms of that versus a variable cost model on the agency side with commissions each time a policy renews. Does that answer your question? Brian Meredith : That's it. John Sauerland : You know what, I'm hearing an overriding tone of understanding how we think about new business growth versus that 96 calendar year target. That 96 calendar year target is a ceiling. And as Glenn, especially, has pointed previously, we have multiple segments to the business. We have different combined ratio targets for those segments. So when we do our pricing indications, we are dialing in different margins by segment and we're also cognitive -- cognizant, excuse me, of the lifetime combined ratios for business we're putting on the books. So there are times when you're growing really fast in a segment that you could be putting business on at a lifetime 96, but that will cause your calendar year to go above the 96. We balance that across our various segments and look at the market opportunity across those segments and say, where do we want to grow given the scenarios we're looking at to, again, ensure we're below that 96 calendar year? So it's bringing together a bunch of different segments, different geographies as well. And it's not that we're always targeting the exact same combined ratio by segment, we look at it before the year starts and target where we're going to have the growth, and again, ensure that calendar 96. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Amit Kumar : Maybe just going back, I guess, to the broader team. It seems all of us are discussing on the new growth on the personal side -- Personal Auto side. How soon does the new business translate, I guess, into renewal business and then translate into a discernible lower AUI [ph] LR? Tricia Griffith : On the Direct side, because I said before we, front-loaded all of the acquisition costs, the first-term renewal is much different to get to that 96 ongoing. And depending, obviously, on what we think, depending on the mix of the business, and the PLE of each of the segments. So it's different, but on the Direct side, it's very different from first term to second term. John Sauerland : And so you're trying to get beyond I think the expense ratio component of it and you're trying to get to the loss ratio component, and that is different by segment. So there's some segments that once you get to the first renewal, which, by the way, for the vast majority, I think 95-or-greater percent of our policies in force are 6-month policies in Personal Auto. We do have some annual policies. That's one of the benefits that we allow our agents with the Platinum program, but still, by far and away, our policy is a 6-month policy. So when we say renewal, you can generally think, for Personal Auto, the 6-month term. For Commercial Lines and for homeowners they are predominately annual terms. But when we look across segments, we see different levels of disparity between the new business loss ratio and the renewal business loss ratio. And again, we're trying the lifetime price to that 96 or less, so we're considering that when we are making those selects with the product structure by segment. Amit Kumar : I guess, what I was trying to ask is maybe there's too much of a focus on the short term in 96. And maybe the bigger story is how this actually will add to the consensus estimates in the medium term. I guess that's what I was trying to get to, where I think it's -- everyone is talking about look at the growth, look at the new business penalty. But perhaps as this business is renewed for a few cycles, maybe all of us need to go back and actually rethink our numbers. I guess, that's what I was trying to ask. Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, I think our goal is to continue to grow at the targets we've been able to grow at because we think that as long-term intrinsic value to the company. And if we aren't writing at, again, the state level, the channel level, the segment level, at our targets or below our targets, then we take action to make sure we do. So as you think about your models, I would think of -- that we're happy with the new business growth coming on the books. So we're trying to continue. Amit Kumar : Got it. The only other question I'll ask -- and this is -- I'll make this very quick. The only other question I had was, on your website, there are offerings for the small businesses, including professional liability, workers' comp, et cetera. Is that -- can you just -- is that more experimental? Did you talk about that previously and I missed it? I'm just trying to get a better sense on that piece. John Sauerland : So those products are being sold by third parties, technically. So in the commercial business right now, for direct customers, similar to what we set up on the Personal Line side, originally with Progressive Home Advantage and now, with many other products. We are working with third-party carriers to offer direct Commercial Lines customers other products that they may have a need for. So that's not first party. We're not the insurer in those cases. Amit Kumar : Got it. And -- sorry, go ahead. Tricia Griffith : No. I was just going to say, so yes, so we do offer, in some circumstances, business owner policies, GL, on the Progressive advantage side. We offer a lot of things, whether it's life or a mechanical breakdown, or travels, a lot of the Progressive advantage offerings. And we'll continue to do that because if our customers want it, we don't necessarily feel we have to manufacture every product. Amit Kumar : Okay. That's very helpful. I just want to be sure that you're not getting on to the long-tail side of things. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Dick Miller [ph] of NYCM. Unknown Analyst : I just noticed one of your priorities this year was retention. I was curious what your goal was in terms of retention? Tricia Griffith : Continue to lengthen PLE. So we have specific goals for each of our segments and its improvement. We haven't necessarily shared them in the past, nor will we -- will show you the percentage improvement. But for me, it's -- you get the right mix of business in and you have competitive and stable rates and the services people need, that's how you do it. So we're focused on continuing to get that preferred mix of business. But we target improvement retention in every one of our segments. Unknown Analyst : Okay. And then to follow along with that, I noticed one of the improvements you mentioned was enhancement to Snapshot. Does that include, like, mobile app? Or what kind of enhancements were you thinking about there? Tricia Griffith : Yes. We're going to roll out -- we have a plan to roll out on our mobile app in 2 states in December. And so we will monitor that, make sure that the data that we're getting meets our success criteria. And if that's the case, we'll roll out the rest of the 3.0 Snapshot states, just think of it second quarter. And then we -- I think we announced in January, a partnership with GM and their Smart Driver program. And we rolled that out in May, mid-May, and so we'll start to see some possible quotes in August because we need 90 days worth of data. So hopefully, we'll have a little bit of data by the October Investor Relations Conference. And I've asked John Sauerland to do an update, a thorough update on Snapshot and some of our other data and analytics. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman of Balyasny. Ian Gutterman : Tricia, can I get to clarify? Just -- I think it was the first question about -- Tricia, you talked about an aggregate 96. Was that aggregate including homeowners to commercial? Or was that just a Personal Auto comment? Tricia Griffith : The aggregate 96 was a Personal Auto. Actually, I shouldn't say that. Our -- the Progressive business, the special lines, Auto and Commercial. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. So excluding homeowners, you're saying? Tricia Griffith : Correct. Ian Gutterman : Okay. That's why I want to make sure. Okay, great. And then just to follow up on the investment income question from earlier. Obviously, you said you're building some of the short-term positions. Should we expect -- I think it was -- you've been doing that for a little while, and investment income held up pretty well until this quarter. It slipped sequentially. Is Q2 a better run rate than Q1 at this point, then? John Sauerland : Q2 was a better run rate than Q1 on per-deal basis. Ian Gutterman : Just dollars investment can -- usually, investment can kind of grow throughout the year, right, because you're building cash, or at least kind of stayed flat, and then it went down several millions. So... John Sauerland : Well, I would say, the new securities that we've put on the books in the second quarter were pretty much right on top of our book yield of the portfolio as a whole. And as I've said before, we don't manage to book yields. We try to manage total return. One of the nice things about the rate rise at the end of the year is we're now getting paid a little bit more on our cash than we were, which is I'd like to get paid more than that as well. But from a sequential basis going forward, we disclose as much as we can about the portfolio, what we own, and we try to maximize the total return, but we're not trying to focus on our book yield. Ian Gutterman : Got it. Okay. And just one more on the relationship between PIF growth and premium growth is always a little confounding for me. And it's obviously been very strong recently and sustainably, and I know part of that is pricing. But I assume there's a lot of other factors, some of which, we've talked about in the past. And obviously, PLE extending would help that relationship. Mix changes, whether it'd be more Robinsons or growth in high-risk-level premium states. So I don't know if there's any sort of short story you can give us to help us think about that better? Or maybe that's a topic for October, if it's a longer answer, but just any help you can give on how to better understand the relationship between those 2 would be helpful. Tricia Griffith : I mean, we have -- I think you hit a lot of the topics. So it is -- PIF growth, there's a lot of retention. So it's new business, as well as renewals. So are we able to retain that business? It's the mix. So it's the amount of average written premium for the customers. So that -- yes, that goes into premium, but I think you hit it. It's -- they all go together. And when we think of growth, we really think of it in terms of new business, extensions of PLE and average written premium. Ian Gutterman : Okay. I guess what I -- what will be helpful to me is sort of being able to separate the parts that are sort of, I guess, don't have an impact on the loss ratio versus those that do. And I guess, what I'm trying to say is, PLE extension, obviously, or pricing is obviously helpful, neutral to helpful to a loss ratios, where if it's mix to higher-growth states, let's say, we'll there's more losses that come with that so I shouldn't really drop that all down the same way, right? So it's just hard to sort of know when I see premium growth accelerating faster than PIF, how much of it is sort of good guys versus more neutral or little bad guys? John Sauerland : One way to normalize that, and for that, is if you look at the increase in loss cost, the pure premium as we call it, so the great news is that over the past couple of few years now, we have been in an environment where we've been able to raise rates, and the industry has been raising rates to cover increasing loss cost. There's been other periods where there was less inflation loss cost. And consequently, we didn't have the luxury of built-in inflation in premium simply due to the underlying loss cost. You're right. Those mix changes play a lot into what we see in terms of coverages, states, et cetera. You sort of hit on a number of ones that we look at. But you can take out at least the effect of loss cost trends to understand what portion is the mix that we don't give you all the background around and actually loss cost trends. So you -- we obviously report our frequency and severity. You can get that from the industry. You can get that from your competitors. And that's a way to understand sort of structurally if average premiums are growing or if it's a mix change. Ian Gutterman : Got it. Helpful. Tricia Griffith : Yes. A couple of things, too. Yes, I think we -- our goal is always to keep up with trends. And we base our growth -- really, our best unit of measurement is our units. So how many new policies. So I think that's an important piece of it. When I see -- when I first answered your question about the aggregate 96, I think of it in terms of the typical progressive policies. I think long term, we'll -- the 96 will be all of our products in the aggregate. Ian Gutterman : The reason I asked that upfront was just, I think of home should be lower than 96 just because of volatility side. I don't know if home to make up a number should be a 92, then that's sort of allowing Auto to go to 96.5 or whatever the math is, that's why I was asking. Tricia Griffith : Yes. I know you're correct on that in terms of when we say aggregate. They're not necessarily -- there may be differences in different pieces, but they will grow up to be the 96 calendar year. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt of JPMC. Sarah DeWitt : Congrats on the new role, Tricia and Glenn. Tricia, I'd be interested in getting your perspective as CEO now on what you think is going well at Progressive? What areas do you think need improvements? And what, if anything, do you plan to you do differently as CEO? Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Yes, I couldn't be more excited about where Progressive is headed. And clearly, Glenn and our whole executive team really focused on the strategy that we're in now. And so for me, the people that we've hired, our culture are things that are really important to really capitalize on this pivotal part of where we see the company going. So I'm very excited about that. And yes, I think we need to just continue to execute. And I have absolutely 0 concerns with that. I think our team is one of the best teams I've ever worked with. And I've worked here for almost 29 years. We all are -- have a very clear strategy where we want to go and how we want to make sure our investment in ASI and other investments that we've made come to fruition and more. So I've got to tell you, from being here a long time and seeing a lot of different things go on with the company, this is the most exciting time at Progressive I've ever been a part of. So I was a part of that strategy, developing what we talked about in terms of a destination era. And we've got to keep the pedal to the metal, and I'm thrilled. I don't know if you want to add anything, John, from your perspective? John Sauerland : You said it well. Tricia Griffith : I know. No, he's good. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ryan Tunis : Yes, I just have one follow-up on -- I guess, thinking about the new business drag on the expense ratio. I think Tricia was indicating it. That's probably a little bit more pronounced than direct. And it's -- that's the type of thing that I would think would normally be pretty easy to see. But the expense ratio, actually, I think, in both segments hasn't really come up that much over the last couple of quarters, if at all. So I -- just order of magnitude, how do we think about where the expense ratio would be if you weren't going through, I guess, this investment phase? Tricia Griffith : We try to keep our expenses as low as we possibly can while still growing the business. So I don't think we necessarily look at it differently from that perspective. We want to take advantage of the times where we have the right rates at the right time. And we know that it's really important to be -- in order to be competitive in the rates to have a competitive cost structure. So a lot of it comes with what you get out of things like advertising and other things. But from a spend perspective, we have our goals. But really, our goal is to grow as fast as we can at a 96. And if we see the ability to spend more on advertising, we have advertising expense that we get for our targeted advertising expense, that's what we'll do. John Sauerland : And just to add to that. So if you're growing year-over-year for Direct as an example, obviously, new business is pretty good last year as well. And I will point out that many of our competitors, or several at least, of our competitors were largely out of marketplace earlier in the year in terms of advertising. So the effectiveness of the same advertising dollar this year in the first half of the year, I think, was far higher. So we had that little wind behind our sales in terms of bringing prospects in with similar advertising spend. So I think if you're going year-over-year, you're not seeing as much drift up to some degree, as Tricia noted, because advertising has been really effective throughout this [indiscernible] Tricia Griffith : All right. Well, that would -- it would appear that there are no other questions at this time. Dexter, I will turn it back over to you for closing [indiscernible] Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation's Investor Relations Conference call. An instant replay of the call will be available through Friday, August 19, by calling 1 (888) 566-0614, or can be accessed via the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year.",

    "content": "\ufeff Susan Griffith : Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for those out-of-towners who came in, and welcome to Progressive's 2016 Investor Relations Day. We're glad to have you. I think you're all familiar with the Safe Harbor statements, and if not, there's also a copy in your materials as a reference guide.  So this particular investor relations meeting represents a really big change. For many, many years, Glenn Renwick was the host of these meetings. In fact, I think he started them. Last week, Glenn celebrated his 30th anniversary with Progressive, of which more than half of that he was our CEO and President. During his tenure as CEO, he tripled the company in size. So by most record books you would say that is phenomenal, and it is. But it's not just that. It's not just what Glenn did, it's how he did it : Always making sure to instill in us that desire to win, but doing it in the right way, always following our core values. He always would set the bar higher every year for all of us. And then he wouldn't walk away, he would help us get over, and that is really his legacy. So Glenn, on behalf of the 30,000 Progressive people, our shareholders and the customers we're privileged to serve, thank you for, well, being Progressive. Okay, enough about Glenn. I thought what I'd do to start off is just remind you of our segments. So we outlined these several years ago when we first started talking about our Destination Era strategy. So I'll just briefly go over those. The focus today will be on the Robinsons, and we're really excited to talk to you about what we have done since we last met you in May of 2015. So Sam. Sam is a segment we grew up with, and we call him inconsistently insured. He is who Progressive -- he put us on the map, and we call him nonstandard. He cares about rates, doesn't stay very long, but he could come back. We love Sam. We want to write all the Sams we can possibly write as long as it reaches our profitability goal.  Diane. Diane is a big part of the Destination Era. We've talked in the past about her being a future Robinson. Diane is an auto customer, and she rents. So she may have renters insurance with us, and what we hope is that as her needs evolve, when she buys a home, gets married, that we evolve with her. It's the notion of Diane graduating to be a Robinson. She's our largest customer base, so the opportunity there is immense.  The Wrights. The Wrights are unbundled auto and home. So they have Progressive home and someone else's auto. Again, we love the Wrights. We see them as future Robinsons because we hope that if they decide to shop their homeowners, they come with us and become a Robinson.  The Robinsons. That's really what today is all about and what the Destination Era is all about, the auto home bundle. The Robinsons are 40% of the market. So the opportunity here is really great, and we are really proud of how, the momentum we've had in the last 18 months in particular, in obtaining Robinsons.  Before we get started, what I thought I'd do as the new CEO is step back and just take stock of some objectives and some fundamentals that will stay the same during my tenure, but things that might evolve. And clearly, with Glenn's leadership, I was a part of the team that developed the strategy around the Destination Era. So to make a turn and do something differently wouldn't make sense. I believe in this model, the execution has been great and I'm excited about our future. But things do evolve as a team as we know more.  Let me start with our first and most important objective, profit. We want to make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit of every $1 of premium. 96 is central to our culture. You're actually sitting in an auditorium that is called Studio 96. So you know how integrated it is into everything we do. It continues to be our most important objective, and that won't change. There is, however, an added dimension with the auto home bundle. We're looking at how 2 independent margins can be optimized for that package. So while the 96 will stay the same, how it will be derived will absolutely evolve.  Growth. We want to grow as fast as we can with 2 constraints : one, the profit objective I just outlined; and two, our ability to service our customers. That second one is really important to us. So about 18 months ago, we had our 8.3 model on the streets, it was working, we were getting a lot more preferred customers. We also saw the opportunity, when some of our competition pulled back, to spend more on advertising, specifically, in the digital options. So we knew at that point we had a lot of opportunities to grow. We made a decision at that time to hire well in advance of need. So from the claims organization as well as our customer relationship management organizations, both on the auto side and the commercial side. And I'm so pleased that we did that, because we did get that growth. We got that preferred growth. And in addition, we had things that happened that we didn't necessarily plan for, in the form of catastrophes. So we've been able to service our customers, no matter if it was a CAT or a regular just increase in losses based on growth.  It is sort of a rule here at Progressive that whether you're on the claims side or the product side, if you think we're growing too fast, you absolutely have to raise your hand and say, \"No more growth. We can't do this.\" And we've had to do that in the past. I'm so delighted to say that this year we didn't have to do that because we prepared and hired in advance of need. So when I think about growth and profit and that balance, year-to-date, with August being the most recent time frame, we're at a 96.2 [Audio Gap] percent net written premium growth. If we ended the year today, this is a phenomenal year, especially with the business that we've been putting on the books. I'm extraordinarily happy. If we were at the same margin at 96.2 and had 4% growth with the same set of circumstances, I wouldn't be as happy. If we were at 88 with 0% growth, I wouldn't be happy. I'm very, very pleased with our growth. It really is sort of the perfect storm. So we had this new business, and we talked and talked at the conference calls about the sort of new business tax that you have, when our combined ratio is higher in that first term. And so we had that coming at us, and then we had CATs. This year, we have, on our CR, 3 points of our combined ratio are in the form of CATs, which is compared to this time last year, about 1.5%. In fact, last month, with the Louisiana storms, it was over 4 points of our CR. So you can't plan for CATs. Believe me, I'm watching Matthew closely, you can't plan for CATs. What you can plan for is how you react to those CATs. I am extraordinarily pleased with how we have reacted, specifically to the Louisiana [Audio Gap] So about 3 weeks ago, a group of us flew down and spent some time in Lafayette and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to make sure our employees were okay, our customers were okay, and I was just amazed. I was amazed that our CAT team, who went down there and just made sure, they took it upon themselves to get our customers back on their feet. We literally had employees who were laying in bed, and they found out their home was flooded when they put their foot in water. Yet they came to work that day to help our customers. In fact, as of yesterday, we have closed 96% of those flood claims, which is really amazing because they're complex claims, mostly total losses. So again, I'm so amazed that what we were able to do and what we're able to do. And you know what, we are ready, with whatever happens with Matthew. As of today, we have a plan, and we'll figure it out. That's what we do.  So for me, again, just to wrap up in that part, profit and growth, very happy, very proud, especially with how we've been increasing our preferred business, the Robinsons, and we're going to talk a lot about that today. I thought I'd take just a stab at some of the financial fundamentals. So it won't change. I think they work with our business plan. We want to continue to balance operating risk with the risk of investing in financing activities, in order to have sufficient capital to support our growth. So that's the overview. On the operating side, we want to maintain pricing and reserving discipline. So when we talk about our pricing, we talk about managing targets. We talk about targets at the lowest definition. So whether it's on the agency and direct side, product, state, we really segment our targets. And that's another reason why I'm so positive about this new business because we look at the new business coming in and say, \"Is it at or below targets? Great, that's going to run off profitably.\" So we're excited about that. We want to have premium to surplus at or below state minimum requirement. So on auto, that's a 3 :1 and about half of that for home. And on the loss reserving side, we want to make sure our loss reserves are adequate and developed with the minimal variance. Year-to-date, very proud of that. We are pretty close, but a little bit on the favorable side, which is the side you want to be on. On investing side, we want to maintain a liquid, diversified and high-quality portfolio. We manage our investments on a total return basis, which is very consistent with how we report our comprehensive income. And on the risk side, we want to manage interest rate, credit, prepayment, concentration and extension risk. Lastly, on the financing side, we want to maintain sufficient capital to support the insurance operations. That's measured by maintaining a debt below 30% of total capital of book value. So we're just slightly over 28% right now, and that's after issuing $500 million worth of debt in August. We want to neutralize dilution from equity-based compensation in the year of issuance, and we do that by repurchasing shares. And finally, we will invest in capital in expanding the business when it meets our objectives. A perfect example of this is our acquisition of ARX. We didn't necessarily feel like we had to have a homeowners company. What we felt is we had to have access to that addressable market. That is a $300 billion market with auto and home. We needed to have access, and it just so happened that we had been working with a company that we had a high amount of respect for, that had a very similar culture and so was a perfect relationship to start. So we're very pleased with our use of capital in acquiring ARX. Any use of underleveraged capital, we will buy back shares or issue dividends, whether special or variable. So let's get to the 96, since we are slightly over at this point, I want to walk you through kind of how we look at it. This is just a basic refresher. So everybody gets to a 96, all of our customers at some point get there, but sometimes in vastly different ways. On the direct side, you can see we run a much higher combined ratio in that first term. That's based on the fact that we have a little higher loss cost and some underwriting cost, but most of all, we front-load all of our acquisitions cost on the direct side in that first term. On the agent side, we have a little bit more losses, a little bit more underwriting, but it's a relatively fixed commission expense, so much lower in the first term. So let me take you through on the direct side, 2 ends of the spectrum. You have Sam and the Robinsons. So you can see the same dynamic. They both rendered a loss in the first term. But what is not evident in our monthly reporting or even our quarterly reporting is the fact that this very high-retaining business, the Robinsons, who stay 3x, actually, more than 3x longer than the Sams, are expanding our invisible balance sheet. So bringing on more of those Robinsons really build the intrinsic value of Progressive.  Here's a basic income statement, and it's directionally accurate. So if we look at again, the Sam and Robinsons, you look at revenue. Clearly, the Robinsons are higher, based on the fact that they stay longer and they have higher average written premium. If you look at the operating expenses, which, of course, are losses, LAE and expense ratio, you quickly notice that neither of these equal a 96. Those numbers represent the nominal value of the cash flow, so they're under a 96. Our lifetime target, 96 combined ratio. For our direct business, we discount the cash flows to recover our acquisition expenses. So that will be different in different segments depending on how long they stay. The difference between those, of course, is our underwriting income. And then there's other income that we have, both on the investment side for both Sam and Robinsons, and the commissions side for just the Robinsons. So whether it's affiliated partner, like ASI, or other unaffiliated homeowners carriers, we get commissions when we have those bundles. So as you can see, the value of a Robinson, a pretax value, is over 4x that of a Sam. Again, we love Sams as long as we can make money on them, but the value of a Robinson is extraordinary, and the fact that we have grown Robinsons substantially in the last 18 months really does grow the value, the intrinsic value, of Progressive. So for years, we have shared with you the invisible balance sheet. We talked last year about unearned lifetime earned premium. So when we think about business coming on board, we look at new apps, for example. So in this year, for Wrights and Robinsons, we've grown new apps 30% and 40%, respectively. That's pretty great. We look at average written premium. Our average written premium has come up across all segments. And then we look at PLE. This is kind of going to be a spoiler alert for Andrew's section, but we finally have made a breakthrough on retention and PLE. So to us, those 3 things are really exciting. So we thought we'd share with you one other metric that we look at internally, that we call ULUP, unearned lifetime underwriting profit. So you'll see that the colors represent a segment, so green for the Robinsons, pink for the Wrights, et cetera. On the Y axis, you see ULUP in millions, and on the X axis, you'll see the time frame with which we are looking out. So right when we started to grow, right around March of last year, to our most recent data point. As you can see, the majority of our segments are growing substantially in ULUP, which, again, is building that intrinsic value. In fact, the Robinsons are growing over 60%.  The chart underneath shows all of the segments' year-over-year growth in ULUP, and again, all are growing, but you can see the Robinsons are growing at a really quick clip. That's exciting for us.  I'm going to shift gears now and talk about how important understanding the Destination Era is to the 30,000 Progressive people that work on getting our customers in the door and making sure we nurture them along the way. We look at it in terms of different frameworks. This is a framework we use called our strategic pillars. So let me talk about the first one, our culture. Our culture is so important, and it's not something you can really adequately describe unless you've spent time at Progressive. It's not something you're going to see on a spreadsheet. But it is really special, and it's really different, and we know it's a competitive advantage. It's really at the root of what I started to talk about, and that is doing the right thing. And we want to win, but you always want to do the right thing, and it's really rooted in our core values. I have the privilege to speak at every new hire class, actually, it was that one Monday, with a couple hundred new claims reps, and my sole topic is our core values. I talk about 15 or 20 minutes, use some examples and then let them ask questions. It's so important to me for them on their first day or their first week or their second week to know what an important part that is of Progressive, our values. Earlier this year, many of us went out to celebrate a milestone at Progressive, $20 billion in earned premium. And we got out face-to-face with over half of our employees, over 15,000 people, just to celebrate and say thank you for all that you do, and then of course talk about the next milestone and the next milestone, and it was really rewarding, and that again is a big part of our culture.  Our brand. We want to be the brand people want. So whether it's awareness or preference or consideration, those things are important, but what we really want is to be able to, when people buy an insurance product from Progressive, that they feel confident that they've made a right decision and continue to feel confident as we service them and add more and more policies. We want to spend money on consumer marketing and customer marketing. We've talked often about how we want to have our customer marketing be as savvy as our consumer marketing. Andrew Quigg is going to talk a little bit about that today, but we continue to resource that, as it is an important part of nurturing our customers.  Competitive prices. In a business with small margins, this is very important to us, and it's really all around segmentation. You're going to hear a lot about that today. So John Sauerland is going to talk about our continued evolution with UBI and our segmentation, and how important that variable is. Pat Callahan is going to talk about segmentation and the product models that we continue to elevate as well as our bundled competitiveness. Andrew Quigg will talk about segmentation on the customer part and using data to get out in front of our customers to know what they need, when they need them. So this is a really important part of our -- really central to things that we do, is segmentation. We'll continue to hone in on that.  Another part about competitive prices is really having a competitive loss structure. So on the claim side, we continue to have -- try to have that near-perfect balance of cost and quality, so pushing down LAE, while pushing up accuracy, and we're doing a fantastic job. On the expense side, we look at what we call non-acquisition expense ratio. So we continue to try to push that down, be more efficient and then give that pricing advantage to our customers in the form of competitive prices. And the last pillar is meeting the broader needs of our customers : What products do they want, when do they want it, how do they want to shop. We want to make sure we can have personalized service and products for each of our customers. So if you want to buy through an agent, get service online or through a chat, we want to make sure if it fits your needs, we are there for you. We want to pick up the phone and say, \"Yes, we can do that, absolutely.\" And whether or not we do that through our own products or on affiliated products, we want to make sure we meet the needs of our customers.  We use this framework for how we're going to grow the business : Acquire, anchor, bundle and extend. We see growth in 3 ways : one, selling products to new customers; two, selling additional products to our current customers as the need arises; and three, keeping our customers longer. Let me start with acquire. Acquire is that initial relationship with us. So whether you come in through a special lines product or an auto product, we're just getting to know you. And in fact, we are pivoting the company and trying to be less about policies and more about customers and households. We're currently in 1 in 10 households in the United States, and we would like to double that in short order. And so we're doing that through acquiring more and more customers and understanding their needs and then evolving as their needs evolve.  Anchor. Our anchor products are our auto and our home. If you trust us with those assets, we believe that our relationship is much deeper. I started today talking about the opportunity, the $300 billion, almost $300 billion opportunity in auto and home. Now that we have access to that and have more and more customers coming in either at home or auto, we know we can deepen that relationship. It's such an important piece of future Robinsons.  Bundle, that's what we're going to talk about today. Our bundle are our Robinsons, our auto and home together, and just even a little bit of increased market share on the bundle part really has a big impact to the bottom line. Lastly, extend. We have been talking about retention for some time, and we have made a significant breakthrough. Last year, if you recall, I announced that I asked Andrew Quigg to lead a team of people to try to increase our retention by 50%. He's going to talk about that today, but we're extraordinarily happy with our results.  For me, extend isn't about talking any longer about customers who stay 1 month or even 1 year. It's about having customers for decades. In fact, 1 out of 6 of our customers after the first renewal are decade customers. So we're pretty pleased with that. About 1 month or so ago, some of us went out to observe some focus groups of our customers. So we listened to Dianes with renters, Dianes without renters to try to get some insight. We went out to Minneapolis and Dallas, and we listened to some decade customers. And they came because they love the brand and they love the price, so that made sense. They had stayed because over that decade or more that they'd been with us, they'd had some sort of service, whether they'd had a claim or they need to call in to change a vehicle or deductible, and they were extraordinarily happy with the service. But what we heard from both of the decade customer groups was something I think really insightful. People said, \"Why are you going to stay?\" \"Even if rates go up, will you stay?\" Yes, because I'm proud to be a Progressive customer.\" And that really hit us. And we heard that over and over again, and so we're working on bottling that feeling and having it happen earlier in someone's tenure, have them feel that pride year 3, year 4, so we can continue to extend that and increase our decade customers. And in fact, we're looking at different metrics. At some point, we'll continue to have policy life expectancies, but why wouldn't we have customer life expectancies? So that's where we'll evolve as our customers evolve.  Ultimately, our goal, our vision, is to become consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance. The next 4 speakers are going to talk about how we're going to do that on both the auto side, and John Barbagallo will talk about how he's going to do that on the commercial side. So now I'd like to start and invite our Personal Lines President, Pat Callahan, up to talk about agency growth, our product and our bundled competitiveness. Patrick Callahan : Thanks, Tricia. So last year, when we talked, I laid out 3 key strategic priorities for our Personal Lines business. And those are : Restoring growth in agency, increasing our bundled penetration and ultimately, and then advancing our product development cycle. I want to give you updates on all 3. And what we'll do is start with an overview of the market from an overall channel and market size perspective.  As Tricia mentioned, U.S. personal auto and home is rapidly approaching a $300 billion market. And when you look at the independent agency share of that, it's a little more than 1/3, or about $100 billion of home and auto premium. And despite the fact that technology adoption has been rapidly increasing the growth rate for direct distribution of Personal Lines products, the independent agency channel continues to grow premium. And that's due in part to broad distribution of their footprint, but also a great value proposition from a breadth of products offered and depth of carrier choice available. When you look more specifically at the homeowners market in the U.S., it's about a $90 billion market, and that's about 90% sold through agents, more than 40% through independent agents. And as the #1 writer of auto insurance through the independent agency channel, we believe we're incredibly well-positioned to leverage our strength in the channel, combined with ASI's property offerings, to become the #1 writer of auto and home insurance through the agency channel.  Last year, I told you that restoring growth in agency was a top priority for myself and lots of other folks within our Personal Lines organization. So today, I'm thrilled to show you some information that after our business shrunk slightly into 2014 and barely recovered into 2015, we've turned that agency business around from a size perspective. And at this point, our agency auto business, as well as ASI's homeowner business through independent agents, have both never before been larger. And if we zoom in on what's driving that auto improvement, we look primarily to start with at new business apps. New business growth is the lifeline or lifeblood of a growing organization like Progressive. And as you see on the screen, midway through 2015, we turned new business positive on a year-over-year basis within the agency channel. Our new business growth continues to be up in the double digits on a year-over-year basis ever since. New business growth originates from 2 primary metrics. The first is demand, so quoting. The second is conversion. And our improvements in the agency channel are driven just about by equal parts of both, which indicate to us : number one, we have a more competitive product in market; but number two, that more competitive product is inducing agents to come to us more frequently to meet the needs of their clients. An absolutely fantastic combination within the channel. But to understand how competitive we are overall in the channel, the best benchmark that we can use is how well we're converting on comparative raters. So last year, I shared with you that the majority of our agency quotes start on a comparative rating platform. And just to level-set, comparative rating software, desktop applications in agent's offices, that run a real-time, risk-by-risk auction amongst all the carriers that participate within that agent's office. And you'll notice that similar to what we saw from a new apps perspective, we're seeing increasing new business from a conversion perspective on comparative raters. Turned positive around the same time that we saw new business apps turn overall, and continues to be up solidly in the double digits. The exciting part about this for us, though, is competitive rates absolutely matter. But competitive rates are not sufficient to drive conversion in the agency channel. Because of the plethora of choices that agents have, you also have to have competitive service, competitive ease-of-use and ultimately, competitive compensation. So we believe comparative rater conversion is a fantastic benchmark for us to truly understand how competitive we are overall in the agency marketplace.  Last year at this time, I also shared that we had just introduced 8.3, our latest auto product model. And while the early results were encouraging, we were in a couple of states and we were seeing significant growth overall from the product model. At this point, about 18 months later, I'm thrilled to share that, that growth continues to come in at expected levels, but it's highly concentrated on the more preferred end of the spectrum. So our growth rates with Wrights and with Robinsons are significantly higher than they are in our other segments. These segments are absolutely foundational to how we win in the Destination Era, and our product design and product development is helping us get there.  But we all know that Progressive is known for new business acquisition. We do a great job. We probably do the best job in the industry. But the reality of it is, sustainable premium growth doesn't just come from acquiring new customers. We have to retain them. And I'm pleased to show that when we look at retention from the agency channel, we see after a dip in early 2015 through about the middle of the year, we've been increasing our agency policy life expectancy month-on-month ever since. And Andrew will talk a little bit more about more details around decomposing that, but the drivers of that are twofold : number one, it's mix, so our mix of new customers has improved. We refer to that as nature. But equal parts of improvement in our PLE are coming from experience improvements and relationships within our customer relationship management organization. Those investments are paying off, and Andrew will tell you a little bit more about that later.  What's particularly exciting to me though, when I look at our retention improvements, is to overlay our rate activity during the same period of time. So your orange bars are annualized rate change within the agency channel for each month during that same period. What you'll notice is during the period of time that our retention was improving, we were raising rates, somewhere between 2%, 2.5% to 4%. And we do that to keep up with trend and ensure we continue to deliver our target margins. But the combination of being able to improve retention while also increasing rates indicates to us 2 things : number one, market conditions are fantastic for growth in the agency channel and we are really, really well-positioned; but number two, given the plethora of choices that agents have to move business to, when rates go up, the fact that our rate increases are sticking indicates to us we've got stronger relationships that are forming in the agency channel, and that's a critical element of our long-term destination success.  Insurance is a trust-based business. And trust is a really difficult thing for us to measure, unlike many of our other metrics. But we look at actions as opposed to words to understand how we're performing from a trust perspective. Number one, are agents trusting us by placing their better customers with us? The answer is yes. Number two, are they trusting us to interact with those customers on a regular basis? The answer is yes. More agents are opting in to our joint marketing programs for additional protection, quote resolicitation, et cetera. And number three, in a recent survey of thousands of independent agents, they responded that increasingly, Progressive has all the products to meet the needs of their preferred customers and more of those agents responded that they're placing their preferred customers with us. The turnaround in the agency channel was driven by a combination of product and stronger relationship building. And we fully expect that the momentum we've established to date with this turnaround will carry into our second priority, which is bundled penetration.  Growing bundled penetration is the key performance indicator of our Destination Era. Making progress, selling both home and auto to our combined customers is essential to our long-term success. And the things you need to drive bundled penetration are : number one, available and competitive property insurance; number two, available and competitive preferred auto rates; and number three, the systems, tools and experiences that enable customers and agents to find, quote, buy and ultimately own a Progressive policy or a Progressive bundle. We'll stay with the agency channel for now and talk about where we're headed from a bundled penetration perspective.  Last year, I shared that we were in the process of deploying ASI's property product country-wide. Since we last talked, we've added 9 states, and by the end of this year, we'll be in 39 states, representing about 95% of U.S. homeowners, great coverage for where we are in the rollout. We go to market from an agency perspective with our property product through 2 tiers of agencies. Those 2 tiers of agencies are Progressive Advantage agencies, Progressive Home Advantage agencies and our Platinum agencies. The 2 tiers, Progressive Home Advantage a little more broadly distributed, they are our original property agencies. And Platinum is a much higher tier, more highly selective tier of agents and a much stronger partnership with us. I shared with you last year that Platinum is a brand-new program that we're introducing last summer that combined consumer benefits of annual policies, more competitive rates through multi-policy discounts and agent benefits, such as easier-to-use systems and higher compensation. We continue to deploy the Platinum program as well. Platinum, by the end of this year, will be in 34 states, which represent about 80% of U.S. homeowners. And because preferred auto and property availability are prereqs to the Platinum rollout, Platinum will always trail the rollout of our property product. But overall, we intend to continue pushing on a country-wide basis until we have full deployment of preferred auto, available property and Platinum on a national basis. But with Platinum, it's less about the states that we're in and much more about the agencies that we're in within those states. So over the last year, we've identified, selected and ultimately, onboarded more than 1,000 agencies into our Platinum program. Based on those agencies, access to preferred customers, their bundled quote and sale processes within the agency and their willingness to commit to placing a significant portion of their bundled volume with Progressive. But to be clear, Platinum rollout will be a metered rollout. Platinum has a scarcity and a scarcely distributed offering. So agents will be actively managed by our sales reps to ensure they're using the Platinum program and understand it and are using it for bundled business within their agency. So we will continue to grow Platinum, but we will grow Platinum as agents are using it effectively in market.  I also shared last year that because ease-of-use for bundled quoting is a key element of our Platinum offering, we were starting to build a new Platinum quoting program. And earlier this year, we launched Platinum quoting which brings to the agent's desktop for the first time, bundled quoting of Progressive's auto and ASI's home, which enables the agent to ultimately save time, share data entry screens and external data fill and have more competitive messaging around the bundled economics available to the agent and making it easier for them to message those bundled savings to the customer. Now to be clear, this is a pilot. It's in 3 states today. We've learned a bunch to date, we'll continue to learn from the pilot, and ultimately, we'll build those enhancements into our quoting systems over time.  But the billion-dollar question on all of our minds, and likely all of your minds is, is Platinum working? We've attacked the preferred market in agency a few times before, and we've learned from those attacks. We've learned from those opportunities that ultimately, for us to introduce a brand-new preferred offering into some of the best agencies in an incredibly competitive independent agency channel, we would have to change agent behavior, which we all know isn't simple, and frankly, it sometimes takes time. So to understand whether Platinum is working, we look at the 2015 cohort of Platinum agents, those that were appointed as Platinum agents during 2015. Think of it as the Class of 2015, if you will. And we look at 2 key performance metrics for that group of agencies relative to the rest of our property insurance agencies. What you'll see on your screen is 2 lines, the blue line is our Platinum agencies, the orange line is our PHA agencies. And the metric here is preferred auto production. What you'll notice between those lines is, number one, the blue line starts above the orange line. Not surprisingly, more productive agencies were selected to be Platinum in the first place. But you'll notice that after the vertical red line, there's an increasing separation from a production perspective between our Platinum agencies and our non-Platinum other property agencies.  This continues into our second key performance metric, and that's new business home and auto bundles, where you'll see exactly the same pattern. Blue, Platinum agents, started above our PHA agencies, and the gap continues to widen. As our sales reps message the benefits of Platinum, our agents better understand the benefits of Platinum and for their customers, they start to experience some of the benefits that come from buying through a Platinum agency. The gap between that blue and orange line is what we refer to as the Platinum difference. And that Platinum difference is not just present with the agents we appointed during 2015. If you look at the entire network of more than 1,000 Platinum agencies compared to our non-Platinum property agencies, you'll see that our Platinum agency plant is responsible for creating more than 3x the number of bundles per agent, per week than our non-Platinum agencies, which absolutely tells us that Platinum is working.  What you'll also notice on this graph, though, is the trend is upward, meaning we're improving over time. Numbers bounce around from month-to-month, but we are on an upward trend. And the guideline on the screen indicates where we expect the program to be ultimately from a success perspective. You'll notice we're not there. And that gap exists, but we know what we're going to do to close that gap. The primary driver of it is our bundled competitiveness.  Well, not surprisingly, when we were launching our program, we started collecting data from the market as to where we were competitive and were not competitive. And the great thing is with 1,000 agencies, using their quoting systems to quote ASI property and Progressive auto, we are getting a ton of data on where we are and where we are not competitive. We use conversion as our primary metric, and when you look at states that represent about 1/3 of our premium, we are highly competitive on the monoline auto, the monoline home and on the bundle for an individual risk. In those agencies, our focus is to sell what the customer is looking for. If they're looking for home, sell them home; if they're looking for auto, sell them auto, or try to sell them the bundle, because we are highly competitive.  However, in about 2/3 of the country right now, we are highly competitive on monoline home or monoline auto, but not yet as competitive on the bundle for individual risks. This shouldn't come as much surprise given we had a highly successful monoline auto business that we combined with a highly successful monoline home business. And the overlap between the 2 isn't quite where we need it to be. But the bottom line is we know exactly what needs to be done, and we're collecting a ton of data that enables us to map out how to integrate our products more closely to make sure that we're more competitive at the individual risk on a country-wide basis.  So for us, the momentum that we saw as we were bringing our agency turnaround ultimately into bundled competitiveness, combined with the infrastructure investments we continue to make in the agency channel and early success of what we're seeing from a Platinum perspective, gives us a ton of confidence that we are absolutely on the right track from a bundled penetration perspective and very, very well-positioned to attack that $100 billion independent agency home and auto opportunity.  With that said, we have another highly successful auto distribution channel and that's direct. So I want to update you on where we are from a bundled competitiveness perspective within the direct channel. To be a direct customer's destination for auto and other insurance, we not only have to have all the products they need throughout their lifetime, but they have to be aware of them and understand that we have them available before they have a life event that triggers demand for that product. So they come to us first as opposed to shopping in market. We generate awareness for our products with our direct customers 3 primary ways : Mass media advertising, it reaches not only our current customers but also reaches future customers; point-of-sale messaging, and this is both in our sale systems as well as our servicing systems, so both current customers and potential customers who visit to get a quote understand the breadth of products available and the economic benefits of buying through us; and finally, targeted marketing. We have a ton of monoline customers that we are now offering the bundled package and the complementary product through messaging the savings and ease-of-use benefits of bringing more of those products to Progressive over time. These awareness investments, coupled with a general shift in consumer buying trends towards direct and some internal messaging that gets our employees thinking holistically about protecting our customers' household needs, continues to drive up demand for direct property insurance, both online, on the phones, with current customers and with future customers. But great demand and increase in demand for our direct property products creates no value unless we can meet that demand with adequate supply. And frankly, in early 2015, our ability to meet the demand for direct property was less than we wanted it to be.  Only about 4 in 5 customers coming to us for direct property could even get a quote. Part of that is just endemic with the property insurance business. Unlike Progressive, there's virtually no property writers who have similar broad acceptability. Property writers have a relatively niche focus and some may not accept 20%, 30%, 40% of available risks.  That's an unacceptable outcome for our direct customers. So what we've done over time is worked, number one, with our carrier partners to expand acceptability and improve routing of traffic online and through our partner call centers to improve availability of direct quoting. But what's particularly exciting on this chart is the yellow line. The yellow line represents our Progressive Advantage Agency, which is our in-house agency that sells multiple products from a property perspective across multiple property partners.  Over the last 1.5 years, we've made significant investments to expand the footprint of that agency by adding 14 states and adding more than 100 state and carrier combinations in order to drive up availability of this, of our property products. At this point, we can meet the needs of about 95% of current or future customers who contact our agency. And we believe that agency model is a superior shopping experience for anyone shopping direct-to-consumer property insurance, because it combines the technology enabled ease-of-use of a direct writer with the breadth and depth of an independent agency. We believe strongly in that model and we continue to invest to expand capabilities within our Progressive Advantage Agency. In the last 18 months, we more than doubled staffing and when calls come in, we route an increased percentage of those to the agency, to the point that at this point, we've more than tripled the sales over the last 18 months through the agency. We will continue to invest in that space and continue to use this superior business model to delight our direct customers from a bundled penetration perspective. But for us, bundling is not just about home and auto. It's also about home -- renters and auto. So in our world, we enjoy an advantaged position with younger, simpler needs, auto insurance customers, many of whom don't yet own a home. So having renters insurance available for those customers enables us, number one, to establish a property insurance relationship with customers and to be able to meet a broader need of those customers earlier in their insurance shopping journey. Renters insurance will never be a massive business for us. It's only about a $4 billion market. But for us, it is a strategic investment, because renters insurance is absolutely a gateway property product towards becoming a bundled home and auto customer with us. We have evidence that those who bundle renters and auto with us are significantly more likely to keep their auto with us and convert that renters to a homeowners policy if and when they eventually buy a home. So from a graduating Diane perspective, this is a strategic play for us and one we continue to invest in over time.  We are absolutely thrilled with the acceleration of our penetration from a bundling perspective within our direct book of business. Today, more than 1 million direct customers trust us to provide property protection. And the key performance metrics for our direct property business, increasing quote starts, bundled new apps and bundled PIFs, are all up more than 20% on a year-over-year basis. And with the investments we continue to make to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we have every confidence we will continue to accelerate bundled penetration within the direct book of business. The third priority that I shared with you last year was to continue to advance our science of risk segmentation. Customer segmentation, matching rate to risk and pricing accuracy are in our DNA and absolutely a key source of competitive advantage for Progressive. It's been that way for decades and one of the things that truly differentiates and distinguishes our offering. As we look to invest in rate accuracy and pricing segmentation, we recognize that the value it creates, through more competitive new business pricing, which lowers our customer acquisition costs on a fixed advertising base, it increases our retention even if customers shop, they can't replace similar coverage at a similar or lower price and it creates adverse selection within the marketplace, a fantastic trifecta of opportunity for Progressive. So when we think about the product development space, we focus on 3 areas, the first is rate accuracy, the second is coverages and the third is improving customer experience to drive policy life expectancy. We build bundles of these enhancements in the product model and deploy them like building blocks, stacked on top of all of the segmentation that existed in the prior model.  Our pipeline from a road map perspective is absolutely robust from a product development standpoint. We're currently on 8.3 in the majority of our states. 8.3 was designed to be more competitive on preferred households and multiproduct customers. You've already heard how that's performing in market. We are thrilled with how it's working.  84 is deploying currently. Tomorrow morning, it'll be our seventh state elevating for 84 and 84 brings with it more stable rates for our renewal customers as well as advanced segmentation based on billing, claims experience and vehicle history. 845 is 84 with some additional protection for transportation network company drivers, Progressive customers who happen to work for an Uber or Lyft. And finally, 85, which is under development right now and will launch in early 2018, will bring with it much more competitive rates for households with usefuls as well as -- well, I'm not going to tell you what else is in 85, you're going to have to come back next year to learn more about that. But rest assured, we are not taking our foot off the accelerator from the product development perspective and intend to continue to lead from the segmentation perspective. But the best segmentation in the world creates no value if we can't get it to market quickly. And while we've always been known for our nimbleness and ability to deploy our products to market quickly, we recognize from a core value perspective that excellence is doing things better today than we did yesterday and we continue to invest to advance our speed to market. So in the last 24 months, there's been a joint research and development and IT team, reengineering our process of product development and product deployment. And since we last talked in May, they've been able to double the annualized rate with which we can deploy our product innovation into the marketplace. So what that means is when we talked in May, we had 3 states on 8.3. Today, we have 32 states. As of tomorrow, we'll have 7 states on 84. When we talk next year, we'll have 38 states on 84 and 85 will be spun up just about to hit the market. This lethal combination of product innovation and speed to market enables us to widen our lead over the competition. And when we look to assess how well we're doing relative to the competition, we start by looking at some industry data. The industry data you're seeing on the screen is loss in LAE for PCI, essentially about 2/3 of the market, 9 of the Top 10 carriers in the orange line, and then Progressive in the blue line. What you'll notice is that environmental activities, be it economic recovery, gas prices, severity on low price in the cars due to safety equipment, trend in the industry has been climbing since the middle of 2012. But you'll also notice that the blue line, the progressive loss in LAE, we've been competing in that exact same environment, and the reality of it is our results have been rock solid. The difference between these 2 lines is product segmentation. It's our ability to better understand what risks we're insuring and better sort out which ones are high cost from low cost. What that means in the marketplace is those in the orange line, the rest of the market, as their loss costs are climbing and they don't know which risks are driving those loss costs up, they raise base rates. And when they raise base rates, the best customers in their book of business shop and they can often find a lower price with companies like us that are better segmented. Run this cycle over and over enough times and they're left with residual risks that they're still underpriced on and priced dramatically higher than the market on any of the better risks that we insure. What it also means, though, for us is today, we enjoy about a 10-point gap in loss in LAE relative to the market and when you combine that with our technology-enabled expense gap, specifically in the agency channel, what it enables us to do is combine incredibly competitive pricing in market, which drives the growth of the business, with wider underwriting profit margins than the overall industry, delivering on our profit targets. A great combination for an insurance business.  Now I also told you last year that emerging data sources were an opportunity as opposed to a threat for Progressive. And since making our majority investments in ASI or ARX, we've been building a massive data set of home and auto risk characteristics and home and auto loss characteristics. What this has enabled us to do is improve model accuracy, identify new segmentation and reduce our rating costs. An early example of how we're leveraging this data set was an auto rating variable that was highly predictive of home loss frequency, to the tune of about a 30% difference in pure premium. As we identified that, ASI quickly jumped on it and deployed it to market. So it's providing a segmentation list as a bundled household that they wouldn't normally have had absent the joining of this data. And to be frank, we are just getting started digging into this massive data set and fully expect that the joint R&D team between ASI and Progressive will leverage this treasure trove of information to identify new ways to assess and ultimately price and improve rate accuracy for our household bundled pricing.  So last year, I shared with you some fairly aggressive goals for our overall business. With the turnaround in our agency business as well as great performance from our direct business, coupled with the investments we're making to increase bundled penetration across both our direct and our agency business, our robust product development pipeline of future segmentation enhancements and the faster speed to market on top of already leading the industry, I am absolutely confident that we are incredibly well-positioned to become consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance. With that, I'll bring John Sauerland on to talk about Snapshot and data management. John Sauerland : Thank you, Pat. Good afternoon. It's been a while since we gave you a deep dive on Snapshot, our usage-based rating program. We have a new model in the marketplace, I'll share results around that, but also share more holistically why Snapshot is so powerful for Progressive. Later this year, we will roll out a new delivery mechanism to experience for Snapshot and that is via mobile. I'll share the rollout plans there, we're very excited by that, but I'll also share what our expected benefits from that rollout are. But overarching all of this is something that I think is even more powerful than Snapshot, sort of an ancillary benefit from Snapshot, if you will, and that is the big data management and analysis capabilities that we've developed around Snapshot that are now paying dividends across the organization and I believe can be a source of competitive advantage going forward.  If you're familiar with Progressive, you know that we have a history of innovation. I would say that Snapshot is as a result of that history of innovation. We started out many years ago installing this football-size device in the trunks of some cars in Texas, proved out the concept a little bit. We enjoyed the benefits of Moore's law, shrinking of technology. I mean, we're able to get the technology into a device that could plug into an OBD port on a vehicle. Unfortunately, back then, connectivity was an issue. We mailed this device to our customers, along with a cord that we asked them to go find. Six months after plugging the device in their car, plug that cord in the device, into their desktop, more than likely back then, by the way, and more than likely try and upload via their dial-up modem. Obviously, not a big hit. What was a big hit was when we were able to get the technology and especially the cell chip small enough and the cell transmission costs low enough so that we had virtually real-time transmission of the data. In today's world, we sort of call that the Internet of Things. Back then, it was just via cell towers. Soon, we're going to be moving to mobile. I will talk more about that in a bit, so I won't spend time here now. The ultimate model for Snapshot is not via device, not via your phone, it's directly from the vehicle. Really happy to say we're actually in market today with that model with General Motors. General Motors is the only car manufacturer, to my knowledge, with that capability today. As you all know, technology takes a long time to move into the fleet. This won't be a broad-based model soon. But nevertheless, we're excited to be in partnership with GM, in market, and I'll share a bit more about that in a moment.  If Moore's law allows you to shrink technology, I believe, there's got to be a corollary to Moore's law that says that data coming out of that technology doubles every 2 years or even every 1 year. We now have 2.2 trillion records in our database from Snapshot, 2.2 trillion records. If you think about those records as rows on a spreadsheet, those rows are widening. The blue area on the chart here is GPS data. While we don't today rate on GPS, we are collecting it for research purposes and it widens the data field, if you will. When we introduce mobile, we'll be collecting even more information. Mobile will take that width of that record 20-fold from where it is today. The data explosion here is incredible. It's been a challenge, it's also a huge opportunity. We'll talk more about that in a moment.  But let me take a step back first and make sure I have everyone grounded in Snapshot. We have 2 models in the marketplace today. We're not great with naming, it was the 2.0 model and the 3.0 model. The 3.0 model has rolled out with 8.3. So in the majority of the country today, as Pat Callahan just mentioned to you, in the 2.0 model, we didn't give you a discount when you opted into Snapshot. You came to Progressive or an agent, agreed to the Snapshot program, 30 days later, we give you a discount based on your 30 days of driving behavior. Drive for 5 months more, we lock you in for the rest of your tenure with Progressive. 3.0, we offer a participation discount. It varies by customer segment, we'll talk about that in a moment, then you drive for 6 months. Here again, we lock you in to your discount or a surcharge. So that's a big change with the 3.0 model. With 2.0, we're very concerned about establishing consumer acceptance for the concept because we have been the leader in UBI. We've gotten consumer acceptance, we're in a place now where consumers are willing to opt-in to the program, as you'll see, even if there's a chance for a surcharge. So in the 2.0 model, we had up to a 30% discount, 0% surcharge. In the 3.0 model, we have up to a 20% discount and up to a 10% surcharge. So similar range, very different model. In 2.0, about 60% of our customers who partook, got a discount. In 3.0, about 75% of our customers get a discount and in 3.0, more than half of our customers received more than a 10% discount, which is pretty material in the auto insurance space. So giving you perspective on the different models, keep that in mind as we talk about results. And I'll also give you a little bit more perspective on the distribution of our customers' driving behavior. The results. They're good. New apps are up, I can't attribute all of this to Snapshot, however. As I mentioned, the 3.0 model rolled out at the same time as 8.3, we made a lot of changes here, we can't tease it out completely. But new apps are up, and this is just Snapshot apps on the graph in front of you. One of the things I hope you will notice is that agency apps are up more. We've been challenged around agency adoption of Snapshot for many years now, frankly. The inclusion of an upfront discount, a participation discount, helps us a lot in the agency channel. As Pat told you, it's largely driven by comparative raters, somewhat of an auction environment, the more we can get a more competitive rate up there at new business, the better chance we have of getting customers into Snapshot.  I mentioned those discounts, the participation discounts vary by customer set. Ranges from about 2 percentage for Sams, up to about 6-ish percent for Robinsons. We define that participation discount not based solely on the customer marketing target there, but that's the average of the discount for each respective segment. Not surprisingly, conversion is up more on the preferred end of the spectrum. Even with 2.0, Snapshot customers converted at a higher rate than non-Snapshot customers. So being interested in Snapshot improves your conversion rate, all else equal. And in 3.0, we obviously see that continuing, but we also see a greater disparity, not surprisingly, on the more preferred end of the spectrum, where the participation discounts are higher. When we look at new apps by customer segment, here again, the mix skews a bit towards the preferred end. But what I hope you also notice is that the slope, if you will, of that relationship in the agency business is higher, it's steeper. We're getting more Robinsons into this business, into the Snapshot program. Pat and Tricia told you, the Robinson segment is the largest segment available to us in the Personal Lines space and it's our lowest market share. So to the extent we can get more customers in here, that's fantastic.  Something not necessarily specific to 3.0, but I think representative of where we're at today when it comes to usage-based rating, is the fact that it is broadly acceptable. And I'm just sharing you one example here and this is age. So when you look by customer segment, the percentage of folks 18- to 22-year-old who opt-in to Snapshot is about the same as the percentage of folks who are 55 and above. Not 100% acceptable in the marketplace for sure, but broadly acceptable.  So hopefully, I've convinced you that Snapshot is helping us on preferred, it's helping us grow. I often get the question, and even got it in the lobby before this, is that can you tell me how is it helping? Put numbers to that for me. Some facts. The most powerful rating variable we have ever seen and with 3.0, even more powerful than 2.0. So our analysts are working hard on improving those algorithms. 3.0 even more predictive of losses than 2.0, and 2.0 was way more predictive than any other rating variable we've seen. Another fact. We provided more than a $0.5 billion of discounts to customers with Snapshot inception to-date. More than $0.5 billion worth of discounts. Those folks think, well, that seems to be a benefit for a customer, how is that a benefit for Progressive? To help answer that, I'm going to take you back to a chart that we showed you actually in 2012. This chart shows the loss ratio and the retention rate across discount buckets, if you will, for Snapshot customers. So we have 0% to 30% discount along the horizontal there, and to the left of that 0, we have non-Snapshot customers. So think of those as your base case. So the majority of our customers don't opt-in to Snapshot, so that's a robust base case. And what do we see? This is again 2.0. When a customer got a 0% discount from us, they will actually do a surcharge. But again, we didn't do that for consumer acceptance reasons. The highest loss ratio is for customers with 0 discount. As you see, the loss ratio improves markedly as you go to the right. It's important to look at the scale on this graph. That loss ratio is much better for the best drivers who are receiving the biggest discounts.  When you look at the retention line, the consumers who expected to receive a discount and did not, the 0 percentage, lowest retention. Those customers leave way more frequently and when they leave, where do they go? They go to our competitors. By and large, our competitors are not priced for this. So those customers are going for more than likely a lower rate than we're offering them, so we believe they materially miss price at the competitor.  You go out on the right, not surprisingly, retention improves a lot as you give people bigger discounts, but the big 2 points I want you to take away here is the least profitable customers, and frequently, the unprofitable customers, leave most frequently. The most profitable customers are way more inclined to stay. In auto insurance, I would tell you, in any business model, if you have a program where your best, most profitable customers are most inclined to stay, and your least profitable or even unprofitable customers find their way to your competitor, that's a great program. Pat Callahan showed you the industry loss ratio graph, Progressive was here, right, the industry on a pretty decent slope up. This isn't the only reason, but this is the kind of segmentation that we believe drives that disparity in the marketplace. So let's look at 3.0. Here, you can see we are not surcharging those customers who are on the worse end. So our loss ratio for those customers goes down. Customers out on the -- more -- better driver end of the spectrum, higher discounts. Again, better loss ratio, not quite as low as with 2.0, but still exceptional. You look at that scale. And when you look at retention, because we're surcharging customers, they leave even more frequently than they did in the previous model, and not surprisingly, consumers we're offering the discount to continue to stay at a much higher rate. So Snapshot is getting us more preferred customers. It is helping rating segmentation, adverse selection a lot. Hope you got those points.  Our next step for Snapshot is mobile. We've been very deliberate in coming to market with mobile. If you think about the challenges in measuring driving behavior with a phone, there are obviously many, right? Some of you take the train, some of you take the bus, you commute with a friend, you leave your phone at home, what have you, a lot of challenges and we wanted to make sure we got this right. We've done a ton of testing. And just to give you an appreciation of those challenges, what you're looking at here is an example of a real test case, so an individual with the app and the device in the car. This is about 2 months of driving, each row represents a day, 24 hours across the horizontal axis of a day, not surprising, and what do we see? So if the blocks are purple, that means the device and your phone are showing a trip, they're matching up. If the block is blue, that means the device is just showing a trip, not the phone. Red the opposite. Red is the phone showing the trip, not the device. So if you stare at this, you say, okay, it looks like we have a commute pattern, right? Five days a week, we drive to work and we drive home. And we take our phones to work and they're on. We don't see that on a commute, right? What else do you see? Well, there's some blue sections, those blue sections look to me like they're more on the weekend, maybe a spouse is driving the car, maybe a kid is driving the car. The red dots in the middle are very intriguing to me. My conclusion, I don't know this test case, is that this person has a regular scheduled Monday lunch date and the buddy drives, to lunch then back, interesting things. But the point is how do we account for this and still have really accurate driving data to rate on. We worked with a ton of app developers, the technology is amazing. The app is able to learn the driver's fingerprint, if you will. And it learns it pretty quickly, I have an app, and I can tell when my child is driving the car, when my spouse is driving the car, it excludes those trips. Thankfully, for my own personal rate. You get the point. How about this, we can look after a trip starts, back to see if the driver got in the left side of the car or the right side of the car. Technology in phones is amazing now. We worked really hard to make sure this is right. Let me give you a picture of the rating reason behind why we've worked so hard to make sure this is right. We worked with a number of different companies developing apps. Hard brakes are our most important rating data field for UBI. So you want your phone to reflect a brake about the same time as you want your device to reflect a brake, right? The graph on the right shows pretty tight relationship, graph on the left not so much. I'm really happy to tell you that we chose the app on the right. And I'm almost as happy to tell you that we're pretty confident a competitor was using the app on the left. Really important that we got it right. We think we have it right, we'll have 2 states out before the end of the year. We expect to have the rest of the country rolled out in the first half of next year. We think it's a great rating tool. We also know it's going to be a better consumer experience. Today, we mail a lot of devices to customers, not all of them come back, but the customer has to take it, unbox it, put it in their car, extract it from the vehicle, mail it back to us. It's a logistical challenge and it's costly. We've previously told you the technology expenses with our current model is about a point on the P&L. Mobile will completely eliminate technology expenses for sure, but it will materially reduce those costs. As I mentioned to you, the long-term model, we believe, is data right from the vehicle. Again, this won't be a broad-based model anytime soon because of the pace of technology penetrating the fleet. But it's a fantastic model, it's working really well, it's small so far, admittedly. General Motors customers' model year 2015 and greater have this capability, all voluntary. They can opt-in to sharing 90 days of driving behavior with Progressive. If it looks like we'll give that customer a discount, we'll offer them a quote. If it looks like they wouldn't be due a discount, we won't offer them a quote. Think back on that loss ratio curve. The customers we are selling to here have a very high average discount. What was true about the most -- the highest average discount customers in our programs, they're the most profitable, right? So we've got a model here where we can just sell to the most profitable drivers with our current algorithms. It will evolve, we'll probably tailor to the various methods of measurement, but today, it's a great model, we're really excited to be in market with General Motors and we're excited to talk to you more about that in the future.  I told you that the data explosion has been rapid. I told you that it's been a challenge for us, frankly. This graph shifts to terabytes as opposed to trillions of records. Back in 2013, our analysts were struggling because it was taking them almost a month to process the Snapshot data set, almost a month. We literally had analysts trying to create mini server farms in the closets near their workspaces. We got smart, we brought in the right technology, we developed the talent internally, our processing time dropped dramatically, going up a little bit as the data set grows further, but the better news here is that we are now using this technology across other parts of the company. When we were together last year, Pat Callahan told you we were starting to look at claims fraud using big data techniques. We now have that fully rolled out. Every night, we are looking at hundreds of data elements through our claims file, through our policy files and looking for the potential for fraud. We don't identify fraud with this model, we refer it to an individual who does the further investigation and does the right thing handling the claim. We're using traditional data, but we're also using what's called unstructured data, which in this case means text. So claims adjusters are typing in notes into our systems, this mines the text and joins that with other data to look for potential fraud. What you're looking at on the screen here is a network of claims that we had previously identified as fraudulent, run it through the system overnight, the claim in blue pops out, suspect claim. Our adjuster does more investigation : 3 vehicle accident, 6 injuries claimed in this accident. Further investigation revealed the damage on the vehicles did not match the facts as reported by the injured parties, we are able to deny the claim. Previously, our model here has been if it looks suspect, the adjuster refers to an expert. I can't tell you we would have missed this one, but I can tell you, I bet we would have missed this one. And I can tell you, we're looking at a lot more claims much more with a zero in target [ph] sort of approach today than we previously did. One more example in that arena. We previously had identified a suspect claim, run through the system overnight and we find 1 data element common with 166 other policies in our database. What we had identified here upon further investigation is what we call a street broker. In urban areas, where auto insurance is very expensive, there are enterprising individuals who use our systems to take your information and create an ID card and sell you that ID card for a couple of hundred bucks cash. They generally are using a stolen credit card or another means to buy the policy or immediately cancel the policy. So what we had here was 166 people who were probably not in the right state with their auto insurance, we were able to reach out to those customers and do the right thing and get them into the right place.  Another quick example, you probably know that big data has been in play in the e-marketing, online marketing space for a long time and we've actually enjoyed the benefits of vendor or third-party solutions, optimizing advertising networks online with banner ads, that kind of thing. We are now using this processing power to design the experience. In our direct business, we pay a lot to get a prospect in the door. We do a lot to make sure we streamline that funnel, if you will, get them the quote, get them into the buy process. Historically, we've done really well with that, but we've done it somewhat painstakingly, frankly, because we do A/B tests. We want -- try the orange button versus the blue button, the button over here versus the button over here. But we've done it really, really well. And historically, we did something in this case that we call the coverage packaging tool. We used 7 variables to optimize the experience with the customer and we were able to improve the funnel, the yield, by about 4%. And if 4% doesn't feel like a lot to you, we have a lot of direct prospects. That's about $0.5 billion of lifetime premium. Today, we're using what we call real-time decisioning. We're looking at more than 3x as many variables as we used to. We've been able to improve the yield another 4% and growing and we've been able to do it in about 1/5 of the time. Tons of opportunities, I could go on with examples. I hope you get the picture. The data space is booming. Even with Snapshot, due to GPS, due to mobile, this curve is going to get steeper. Layer on top of that, that unstructured data we just talked about, the text. In our call centers, we've been translating voice to text for many years now. We're able to mine that as well. Andrew Quigg will talk about that in a moment. We're now starting to ingest images, photos and video. That will soon be, not today yet for us, that will soon be data we mesh with all the other data in our systems as well. We have been a leader in using data and analysis for segmentation, for experience design, to our competitive advantage. I believe the opportunity to do that and differentiate ourselves versus the competition is only going to grow and we expect to lead.  Now I'm going to hand the floor over to Andrew Quigg to talk customer relationship management. And here again, I think you will see similar themes through Andrew's talk. Andrew Quigg : Thank you, John. I have the pleasure of speaking to you today on 2 topics. The first half of the section will be on retention, and I'm going to tell you about the improving momentum we see with our retention. And then in the second half of the section, I'll provide an overview of our customer marketing initiative and I'll describe the advanced analytics we're applying to this problem, as John Sauerland alluded to.  So first off, I want to just reiterate our preferred retention measure, which is Policy Life Expectancy or PLE. PLE is the average length of time we expect a new policy to stay with Progressive. We calculate PLE by first calculating our retention decay curve, and then we take the area under this curve to get our PLE statistic. That retention decay curve can be calculated multiple ways depending on the trade-off in responsiveness versus stability that we see. Our standard measure is to use 12 months for each point along that curve. That is our trailing 12 PLE that we've always reported out. We also calculate a trailing 3 PLE starting in 2014. That trailing 3 PLE uses 3, the most recent 3 months along that retention decay curve. So it's more responsive to more recent observations. Just some notes on the PLE calculation. The first 60 months represent actual data that we've recently observed and between months 60 and 300, we use an extrapolation. And we've seen all policies end after 300 months, which is a conservative assumption. We think the PLE statistic is accurate for a number of reasons and I'll highlight one of those today. We think it removes any tenure bias. So if we use simple retention rates, as our book of business ages, all else being equal, we think we'd see higher retention rates and that would be although that retention curve didn't shift. So using the PLE calculation removes any tenure bias from our statistics.  So with that background, I wanted to give you an update on the current progress with trailing 12 PLE. I'm happy to report that we've seen very positive PLE growth in 2016. We are up 6% year-over-year. 6% year-over-year, there we go. This is the largest increase since 2009 and as Tricia said on our last quarterly conference call, for every one month of PLE, we see $1.5 billion in additional lifetime earned premium for the company. We're also pleased that we're seeing similar percentage increases within our agency channel and in our direct channel and direct is at an all-time high. While we're really pleased with the overall momentum we see, we're even more pleased with what we see with our Robinsons in the Destination Era. For our Robinsons, PLE is up 17% over the past 3 years. And the past 12 months, we're up 9%. So just great momentum that we're seeing with the Robinsons. As Tricia alluded to earlier, the Robinsons are now 3x greater and yearly 3.5x greater than our Sams for PLE. We'll also be adjusting the PLE calculation in the coming months. We haven't updated that extrapolation for a while, and we're seeing better retention in that tail of the PLE curve than we've seen historically. And so when we update the PLE calculation, overall PLEs will go up by more than -- by about 2%. And for our Robinsons, it will be even higher. Our Robinsons are disproportionately represented in the tail of the PLE curve. This means that we'll have even more opportunity with our Robinsons. We'll be able to acquire them more aggressively, and we'll be able to bundle our current customers more aggressively. So far, I've spoken inclusively about the trailing 12 PLE, but I want to go back to the trailing 3 that I talked about in the opening. If we think about the difference between the trailing 3 and the trailing 12 PLE is the unrealized momentum in our PLE data. And we're very pleased with what we see here. For total auto, the trading 3 PLE is up 8% year-over-year. For the trailing 12 PLE, it's up 6%. So we think we have about 2 points of unrealized momentum within our PLE. As you can see across all of our segments, the trailing 3 PLE is higher year-over-year than the trailing 12, so we feel like we have a lot of momentum. But the highest difference is for our Robinsons. For Robinsons, we think we have about 4 points of momentum that we haven't yet realized. I want to stop here and just talk about the goal that Tricia outlined for us in 2015. Tricia has challenged us to increase retention by 50%. We think we can achieve this in 3 ways. First, we believe we can change our mix. In the Destination Era, we think we can change our mix to more preferred customers and new business. Pat outlined some of the strategies we have there. In addition to changing mix, we think we can improve our price competitiveness relative to the competition. Pat showed the slide where we have increasing agency PLE while overall rates are being increased. And third, we believe we can improve the customer experience. We think we can nurture our customers to stay with Progressive longer, and I'll spend some time on that in the next section. We think this path to a 50% increase runs through our more preferred segments. We see more opportunities with our more preferred segments to increase retention. And then as the mix of our business changes, we believe we'll hit that overall goal of increasing retention by 50%. I want to switch gears here and start talking about the nurture side of things. But I want to pause and just talk about data for a minute and specifically, how we're using data for customer experience. We see a virtuous cycle in our pricing. I started off in product management, this was a big part of our roles. In pricing, we see that when we acquire customers, we are paying their data. And with that data, we can derive segmentation and insights and improve our pricing, which allows us to acquire more customers, which gives us more data, which gives us better segmentation, a virtuous cycle exists within our pricing. We think the same virtuous cycle exists with our customers in customer experience, specifically with our customers, we gain customers and then we interact with them. Those interactions generate data and that data provides insights and ideas in segmentation. That allows us to increase retention, which allows us to have more customers. And more customers provides more interactions and more data and we get a virtuous cycle here within customer experience as well. And in the Destination Era, as we gain more products, we think that cycle spins even faster, more products means more interactions, which means more data. So as we invest in the Destination Era, we think we'll have even more predictive data to use with our customers. We give you that background because leveraging data is part of a larger initiative that we're working on here at Progressive. In the 2015 investor relations meeting, Glenn said that we need to be as good at customer marketing as we are at consumer marketing. And so we've put a joint team together from our customer relationship management organization and corporate marketing, and that team is working on this customer marketing initiative. There are 4 pillars that we talk about with the customer marketing initiatives. The first is that we want to improve our customer knowledge. We want to assemble as much predictive data as we can for our customers, so that we know the experiences that they're going through. After that, we want to improve our customer engagement. There's 2 parts to this. We want to improve the processes that they go through, and we want to segment those customers better. The third pillar is interfaces. As we've come up with segmentation and processes, we need flexible interfaces to deliver those to our customers. And then finally, we want to brand those interfaces for our customers. Jeff Charney talked about this last year and so I won't spend time on it this year, but we want to have the branding that resonates with our customers as they interact with us. So with that said, let me walk through some of these pillars in particular, and I'll start with knowledge. As an initial example, I'll talk about small data that we are -- have been working on for our customers. Over the past 18 months, we've looked for internal and external data elements that are highly predictive for our customers. I have a smattering of those data elements on the screen. On the X axis here is the volume of data. You can think of this as the number of customers described by the data. And then on the Y axis, I have a general lift associated with that data. You can think of that lift as a lift in retention or a lift in graduation to become a Robinson or a lift in endorsements. No matter which of those 3 we're talking about with the data, it's highly profitable for Progressive to know. If we know that there will be a change with that customer, we can act on it in a profitable way. So let me give you some examples. Example #1 is an internal data element. It came from our digital servicing environment, it's a digital servicing action that we see our customers take. It wasn't within the structured data warehouse, but we had it in-house. And when we dug into it, we saw there's a 14-point difference in retention if we saw this data element. To give you another example that I can get a little bit more transparent about, example 2 is an external data element from a data vendor, we call it the newlywed variable. It comes from wedding invitations, bridal registries, courthouse records, things associated with getting married. And when we see that data element on one of our customers. In the next 6 months, there's more than a 200% lift in whether they change their marital status. And when a customer changes their marital status, it changes the retention rates, it changes the number of vehicles and drivers in the household and sometimes it adds additional products like a property policy. Now beyond small data, we've also started to think more about the big data available to us in customer relationship management. A leading technology company said that 80% of the world's data is unstructured, and we think that's true within CRM as well. I'm going to describe one area today, although there are others that we are working on as well. The area I'm going to describe today is the action that we're taking to put together an unstructured database of our customer words, the words that we hear from our customers. So let me give you some examples of some sources of this data. The first area is from our survey responses. Annually, we receive more than 80,000 survey responses from our customers. In addition, we have more than 1 million chat transcripts with our customers. When they go to our digital servicing environment, they can chat with a Progressive consultant. But as John  Sauerland alluded to, the largest and most significant source of words is from our calls with our customers. We received 36 million Personal Lines calls per year, and we've been transcribing those calls, and we have -- using advanced analytics, and we have all those calls in text form that we can put into a data warehouse. In total, Progressive has more than 10 billion words annually from our customers. So what can do we do with this? Well, I'll give you a few small examples today. One thing we've done is just search all this text for 3-word combinations, we call these trigrams. And there are some trigrams that are very predictive of, say, defection. I have 3 of those on the screen. I can tell you, for example, that trigram #3 is, 'I never received.' I never received my ID card. I never received that document that I requested. But I never received. And when a customer says that to Progressive, they are 1.4x more likely to defect from Progressive in the next 6 months. Another thing we've looked at is metadata. You can think of metadata as something other than the words that are present on those phone calls. For example, metadata #2 here is the amount of silence time on a phone call. As that silence time increases, the future defection chance increases as well, so there's about a 1.1x relativity on the amount of silence time on a phone call. There's even some significant words, some single words that if spoken or written or shared are a good predictor of future defection from Progressive. I won't share those today, but we've parsed through the text to look for those single words. So I'd like to move beyond knowledge now and talk about our engagement. And as a reminder here, I'm going to talk about the segmentation side of the engagements. In Progressive, we've certainly built traditional models. We use generalized linear models in a number of situations. These are tried and true models that are used throughout insurance and throughout business. And here, I want to tell you about the probability of Robinson graduation. This was a traditional modeling exercise that we went through in CRM. So we gave a team, I'll call them team #1, some of that small data that I talked about in the knowledge section. And we asked them to predict which customers may become a Robinson in the future, and they did a good job with this. They built a model. And the model in the top decile had a 4x greater chance of becoming a Robinson than the least responsive decile. But then we took that same data and we gave it to a separate team, one that did not work with the first team. And the separate -- second team did an even better job. In the second team, we found that the team came up with a model that was 7x greater. But the best result was if we combine models. And when we combined models, we found that the best tranche had a 9x greater likelihood. So even in the situation where we're building traditional models, we try to put the models together and combine them in ways to create the best outcome for Progressive. Now the world has moved beyond just generalized linear models, given the vast amount of data and the computing power that's available. It's moved to things like random forest or gradient boosting machines or neural networks, some of these advanced predictive models that are now available to us. We've invested in an advanced analytics team within CRM to take advantage of these models. The first assignment for this advanced analytics team was to build a defection model, to try to predict who might leave Progressive. And the best models were the gradient boosting machines and neural networks are being built. Because of the power of these models, I want to spend a little time just walking through the first generation neural network with you today. On the screen, I have the basic structure of a neural network, and I want to explain it to you. The first layer of a neural network is known as the feature layer. Features are like the independent variables that you would've seen in our regression historically. They are the attributes to the policy. Here on the screen, we have 2 features. F1 is a categorical variable of whether or not the policy is on EFT payments or automatic payments with Progressive. F2 is the percentage change in premium that, that policy will see in its upcoming renewal. We're going to have 2 predictors in this small snippet of a model. I can tell you in our first generation neural network, we had more than 900 predictors, and that was before we had access to all those billions of words that I described previously. From the feature layer, data passes along synapses to an output layer. Synapses are weights between negative 1 and 1 that are multiplied by the data. And then the data reaches this hidden layer. At the hidden layer, there's functions that are set there, common functions that are used in neural networks that transform the data. From the hidden layer, it travels along another set of synapses to the output layer. Again, the synapses multiply it by a number between negative 1 and 1 and then in the output layer, there's another function that transforms the data. And out of that output layer comes a predictor of defection or retention with Progressive between 0% and 100%. With that set up, let me walk you through a training of this neural network. On the screen are 8 policies from a training data set. These are 8 policies where we both know the predictors, the features of those policies, and what happened with them. So we have some policies that renewed with Progressive and some policies that defected from Progressive. What we do is we run these policies through the neural network. This is called forward propagation. Each of these policies passes through the network and is calculated the retention of it. So the features enter that feature layer, they're multiplied by that number between negative 1 and 1 in the synapse layer, they hit the hidden layer where they're transformed by a function. Another weight hits it and finally, it's transformed by a final function and a predictor of retention comes out. You can see here in this first iteration that the neural network is almost random. All those policies are clumped around the middle of the scale for predicting retention and the overall model accuracy as well. But what happens next is 1 of the 2 reasons why a neural network works. What happens next is a self-correcting mechanism exists within a neural network. It's called backward propagation. During backward propagation, each of those synapse weights are recalculated. It's calculated based on an iteration method called stochastic gradient descent. Stochastic gradient descent helps the model move towards the maximum accuracy. So as those weights change, this model is changing itself to become more accurate. After this backward propagation, we train the model again. We take these 8 policies and we pass them again through the model. Each of the policies enters the feature layer, hits the hidden layer and goes through the output layer. And you can see this time, the policies that renew with Progressive are starting to go higher on the renewal probability scale and those that defect are starting to go lower and the model accuracy improves, and then we backward propagate again, again adjusting the model. In actuality, we do this tens of thousands of times. Here in the room, I'm going to do it 10x quickly, just so you can see what happens. And this is the second reason why a neural network works. It's because of the brute force computing power that's available to us in this day and age. At the end of this, the model is trained. You can see after 10 iterations that the model accuracy has improved, and we have a model that's now ready for production. I do want to note here when we do this in actual practice, we keep a hold-out data set to make sure that we don't over fit the model. So what happens now? Well, we want to use this model in production. So I brought in 2 policies that we don't know the outcome for. They may be coming up for renewal with Progressive, Policy 9 and Policy 10. What we do is we take the features of these policies, and we pass them through the neural network. And here we can see that Policy 9 will retain with Progressive likely, and Policy 10 might defect from Progressive. We started to discriminate between policies that will stay and those that might leave. Now I hope you take 2 things away from this. First takeaway is that this is an incredibly intensive calculation process. For this first generation neural network, it took us 7 full days to run. We were using our local infrastructure but still it took an incredibly long time. And that was before we had tens of billions of words. That was before we tried adding on more hidden layers to move towards cognitive computing. It's just a very large and complex process. And it's because we have an impressive analytical infrastructure that we built through the Snapshot program that we can start tackling problems like this. The second thing I hope you take away is that this is an incredibly accurate model as well. Now we showed overall model accuracy on the screen. Truth be told, that's not what we're interested in. We're actually interested in the tail of the model, if we can predict those policies that are very unlikely to renew. We want to have good tail accuracy. And from the data that we used to build this neural network, we also built a traditional model, a GLM model. And when we did that, the neural network was twice as predictive as the generalized linear model. We're using the same data, but using more predictive advanced analytics techniques, we can be much more accurate in what we're doing, which has larger benefits to Progressive. Let me walk through interfaces to tell you a little bit more about how we take these models and use them for business benefit. I want to start by talking about proactive outbound communication. This is us reaching out to our customers. On the screen, I have a couple of examples of digital ads. These are digital ads we put in front of our current customers when we want them to graduate to become Robinsons. We target these digital ads based on that traditional model that I talked about previously. When we combine those models, we're focusing the most responsive deciles, we show them these digital ads. And when we've done that, along with some other activities like this, we've increased the number of Robinsons we have by tens of thousands, adding millions of dollars in lifetime underwriting profit to Progressive. We're able to do this because of all that acumen we built in advertising to consumers. We use those same patterns in advertising to our customers. Just another example is Policy 10 from that neural network example. We know that Policy 10 may not stay with Progressive, and so we started campaigns to reach out to folks like Policy 10 and invite them to call in to talk about their policy. And when we've done things like that, and we've got a few in practice now, the run rate is that annually, we'll save tens of thousands of customers, worth tens of millions of dollars in lifetime underwriting profit to Progressive. Beyond proactive outbound communication, there's also proactive inbound communication. We have built a tool that our phone consultants can use when someone calls Progressive. We call this tool the customer relationship assistant. It's a user interface for our phone consultants. It took us about 2 months to build, and the beauty of this tool is that it houses all that data and all those models I spoke about previously. So when Policy 10 calls, the consultant on the phone knows to talk to that customer about their policy and about staying with Progressive. It's really personalized, right? We can tailor all these interactions and make sure we have the right treatments that fire when that customer calls in. It's very flexible. If we want to add new treatments, we can program them in about 2 hours. And earlier results from this are very impressive. We've seen an increase in products added, a reduction in future calls and a lift in retention. Let me recap what I talked about today. In 2015, in the investor relations meeting, Glenn said that retention was our Holy Grail. And Tricia challenged us to increase retention by 50%. I'll underscore the progress that you heard today. PLE is up 6% with momentum higher. Direct is at an all-time high, and we're making the most progress with our Robinsons as our mix in that business shifts towards the Robinsons. In customer marketing, as a direct carrier and a servicing independent agent carrier, we have access to billions and billions of pieces of customer data. We have a historical strength in mining that data, driving insights to segmentation and quickly moving to market. We believe we can do that with our current customers. Feed that virtuous cycle of data and extend policy life expectancies. And with that, I'll welcome up John Barbagallo to talk about Commercial Lines. John Barbagallo : Thanks, Andrew. Hello. Good afternoon. I'm going to share a little bit about what we're seeing in the Commercial Auto insurance marketplace. I'm going to touch on our most recent results and share a little bit about our near-term action plans. And then I'm going to shift to talk about 2 disruptive trends that are coming to you, small business insurance and non-fleet Commercial Auto insurance. And these are trends that we have not only been monitoring, but we've actually been making investments around them over the last several years, and we think we're very favorably positioned to take advantage of them. But first, let's start talking about the marketplace. I'm going to start with a little history. This is a chart that I've shared with this audience in the past. It's now been updated through 2015. And what it shows is Progressive's relative performance relative to the industry on 2 measures : combined ratio and growth in direct written premium. And 2 things you can take from this graph. One is that over this time period, Progressive, by being intensely focused on Commercial Auto as a specific line of business, has been able to consistently outperform the industry on combined ratio, usually by a margin of 10 to 15 points. And for the last few calendar years, it's actually been by 20 points. Now some of that is from our expense ratio. We have a very cost competitive expense ratio. We believe we are the low cost provider in Commercial Auto, but a lot of that is loss ratio. And by being focused in the way we are, we believe we see things sooner and react faster than most of the rest in the industry and that contributes to this advantage. The other thing you can take from this chart is perhaps a little more subtle, is that we will and have consistently slowed our growth in the business when we were at risk of exceeding our underwriting target. And we will keep that commitment to those underwriting margin targets. Even with that approach, over time, we have been able to grow our market share consistently to the point where 2015, Progressive became the #1 Commercial Auto writer in the United States. All right, let's jump into 2016. This is a view, again, same 2 measures, combined ratio and direct written premium, Progressive versus the industry, we've added a few of our key competitors, as of the first quarter of 2016. You can see Progressive up in the upper right, cruising along with really good growth and a combined ratio in the high 80s at that point. And the industry had about 6% growth and a combined ratio of 102, which actually isn't too bad when you consider how it ended in 2015, that would appear to be improvement. But if you update through the second quarter, you see general degradation of combined ratios across the board, including our own. In fact, for the industry, the change in loss ratio, if you take the loss ratio for the 3 months comprising the second quarter, it is fully 8 points higher than the first quarter loss ratio. Now there's some seasonality at play there, but that is a huge, huge change. Now I'm sure you've noticed in our last 2 or 3 monthly earnings releases that our combined ratio has been elevated, certainly above historic norms. There's a little bit of prior year development in there. For the 3 months period, it's about 1 point, 1.25 points. But the real driver of that is actually frequency. What we have on the screen now is our bodily injury reported frequency for the last couple of years. Now the blue line is the monthly frequency. As you can see, that's pretty volatile, it jumps around a lot. We don't tend to pay too much attention to that. Even though those kind of last 2, last couple high watermarks there, they're high, but certainly not beyond anything we've seen in our history. If you look at the orange line, that is the trailing 6 BI frequency, and that's a much more stable measure, but it's still -- it is relatively reactive to changes in the environment. And there you're seeing what appears to be an inflection point starting in May, maybe as early as April. We believe that is real, at least it's real enough to me that we are reacting to that. We also believe it is largely environmental. Pat talked earlier about general a rise in frequency for auto, there's theories around that, distracted driving, low fuel prices. But in Commercial Auto specifically, particularly the verticals where we tend to compete, we are seeing positive movement in a number of the macroeconomic factors that we track that generally correlate with frequency. Things like home sales, construction spending, trade tonnage, aggregate deliveries, all moving in a positive direction, which suggests to us higher levels of economic activity, also contributing to higher frequency. So we believe this is real and we are reacting to it. Primarily, we're reacting with rate. Now I've talked to this audience before about our rate revision infrastructure at Progressive, our ability to change rates across the broad portfolio relatively quickly, and we have kicked that into gear. What this graph shows is our anticipated rate change for 2016, which will come in at about 9% year-over-year change in rates, most of that in the second half of the year. We were actually holding rates flat through the first 4 months of the year, as we were operating in the high 80s. So we've responded decisively and we've responded quickly, and those rate changes will certainly help the combined ratio. But it will take time. About 90% of our policies are written on an annual basis, so we have to get through a renewal cycle to get the full effect of it. It will certainly help with new business as soon as we can get those rates in place. But in the interim, and I said, we will slow down growth to ensure we make our margins. In the interim, we're also restricting some high-frequency segments of our business for new business. We're going to stop taking it until we can get those rates in place. Now those segments have always been high frequency, they will always be high frequency, and we're perfectly comfortable writing that business at the right rate, we're just not there yet. So that's what we see going on. Again, by being focused, we think we are seeing this before much of our competition, and we're reacting before they do. And when that's happened historically, that has typically set up very favorable market conditions for us down the road. So we'll see what happens. All right. Now I want to shift to those disruptive trends. The first of which is what I believe will be an inevitable shift to small business owners accessing direct channels for the purchasing and servicing of their small business insurance policies. Consumers across a range of industries have demonstrated not only acceptance of direct channels, but in many cases, preference for those channels. And we don't expect small business owners to be any different, especially as digital continues to close the information gap between the buyer and the seller. And we're starting to see investment. Investment by people other than Progressive. And these are companies that are well-known. They are well-funded, and they have experienced management. And they are putting the assets in place. Underwriting companies, product filings, technology platforms, all to go after the direct channel for small business owners. And they're starting to spend some money. Not a lot on the marketing front, and actually, it's happening slower than we would've anticipated. We still are the largest spender in the category, but they're starting to spend some money as well. So we're seeing investments. We're also starting to see some growth. This is a view provided by the Boston Consulting Group of the U.S. small business insurance market. Now this is all lines of business, it's all lines of business for small business insurance, and they peg that at about a $65 billion to $70 billion marketplace. And as of right about now, they're saying direct channels have 8% share. Probably more interesting on this chart is what they project to be the growth rate of the channels. So a pretty aggressive growth rate for digital channels in small business insurance. In fact if you buy into this view, it suggests that traditional channels will begin to decline in absolute dollars as early as 2019. We'll see. When it comes to Commercial Auto, where we have some pretty good data, we're seeing a somewhat similar pattern. Now again, the direct channel for Commercial Auto is still small, less than 2%, but the growth rate relative to the industry growth rate is 2x to 3x. Now full disclosure, on this particular graph, that orange line is largely driven by Progressive. We're just about half of the direct commercial auto market right now, and we actually can affect the slope of that line simply in terms of how much we choose to spend. And that's reflected in 2014, we pulled back in our spending, and you see that little dip there. But again, you have a channel where there's lots of investment lining up, and you're starting to see signs of growth in the channel. So the question then becomes who is going to be able to most cost effectively drive demand and control the top of that sales funnel. And this is where we start to feel really good. Because while the others are just getting started, we have actually been at this since 2008. Now we've been selling direct commercial for more than a decade, but it was really in 2008 that we began investing in developing a business insurance brand. In 2008, we started -- we embarked, really, on a 5-year plan, and it was a 5-year plan to prove to ourselves that we could make the economics of direct marketing commercial insurance work. And it was a very auto-centric approach, targeting specific verticals where we tend to do well. We concluded that 5-year plan successfully in 4 years. That gave us the confidence in 2012 to begin broadening our marketing. And by broadening, I mean, both broadening the media we would access and broadening our message to be much less auto-centric and really built around insuring and protecting the business. And that has now evolved to our current campaign, which we just launched, which could really celebrate the small business owner. So we've been investing here for a long time. Has that investment been worth it? We would say it definitely has been. One of the key measures of brand health is awareness, and as you can see on these 2 charts, in terms of total awareness and top-of-mind awareness, Progressive is the leading small business insurance brand. Again, this gets back to who is going to control the top of that sales funnel as this channel begins to grow.  How fast might this all happen? I don't really know, but maybe we can look to private passenger auto as a guide, because this has happened. The chart on the left shows the shift in channel for private passenger auto over a 20-year period. Now keep in mind, that orange line for the direct channel developed concurrently with the development and acceptance of digital channels for consumers. So the Internet, gradually migrating over to mobile. We believe those consumer preferences are already in place. And I'll offer an opinion that small business owners, at least a percentage of them, their expectations currently exceed the industry's ability to deliver really good digital experiences. The chart on the right is the effect of that channel shift on Progressive's business. So over roughly the same time period, Progressive's direct auto business grew from being about 12 -- 11%, 12% of our total business to where it is today, half our business. Now it's not that our agency business didn't grow during this time. It did grow. You heard earlier from Pat that it is at an all-time high. It's just that the direct business grew that much faster, creating lots of value for Progressive and for our shareholders. We've modeled this out. We've done a number of different scenarios around how quickly the direct channel may grow for small business insurance, based on different spend levels by us, spend levels by other. And when we surround what we think are the most likely outcomes, it all leads to significant growth for Progressive Commercial Lines.  So we continue to invest in our capabilities. We are in the midst of a major systems upgrade for commercial. One of the benefits of that will be the ability to deliver better digital experiences, and perhaps more importantly, deliver them to market faster and enhance them more quickly. And we continue to invest in and build our in-house business insurance agency. The map on the left shows our footprint for being able to offer non-affiliated partner company BOP and general liability policies to prospects and our customers. We also sell workers' comp and professional liability, but the primary coverages they're seeking are BOP and GL. And today, we have -- in virtually every state, we can offer between 5 and 8 products, covering a range of underwriting profiles. And as you can see on the graph on the right, we are growing the agency. And there again, the shape of that growth curve can largely be determined by how much we choose to spend at a given time. And we are growing the agency, and we are having success bundling these small business customers with Progressive Auto, be it Commercial Auto or Personal Auto, and that's an important point. We are creating a lot of bundles with a BOP or GL policy and a Progressive Personal Auto policy, which is just fine. First of all, it helps the agency's economics because those customers are much stickier. Second, it is entirely consistent with the strategy Tricia laid out earlier in terms of acquire, anchor, bundle, extend. This may be how we acquire customers. Certainly, could be how we bundle customers. And also, we're finding that the need for commercial auto in a  small business oftentimes emerges late or later in the life cycle of that business, and business insurance is very situational, unlike personal lines. Usually the first purchase of a personal lines product, typically auto, is driven by a state law, state requirement to have insurance or a bank. In small business insurance, that is not usually the case.  So to try to give some context to this slide, I'm going to tell you a story. And it's a story about a real-life, thriving business right here in Northeast Ohio. So a work colleague of mine has a friend, and she's starting a business in her home, in her kitchen actually, cooking bone broth. And she sold this bone broth out of her kitchen to friends and neighbors. Now she didn't have insurance, so we told her she needed insurance. You can argue she probably should have had insurance, but she was flying below the radar, which a lot of small businesses do, particularly in their early stages. The sales went well. She got a lot of positive feedback, and she was encouraged to take her product to one of the local farmers' markets. So she decided to give that a try. She applied. She was accepted, but the farmers' market told her, if you want to come on-premise, you have to have a vendor's liability policy and you have to have a general liability policy. So where previously, she was in that first circle of not really caring about insurance, she now found herself in that second circle of, well, at least temporarily, I have to care about insurance if I want to go to this farmers' market. Not sure if I have a real business yet, but I'll buy the insurance. Farmers' market went well. Again, a lot of positive feedback, again, getting inquiries from local restaurants who wanted her to supply them with bone broth. She even got a contract with a local grocery store chain, and the business is starting to take off. In fact, taking off to the point that she outgrew her kitchen, and she had to lease commercial space, and she had to hire 2 employees to set up more of a regular production cycle for the bone broth. And now she needs a BOP policy for her premises, and she needs workers' compensation for her employees. I would say now she's in that third circle of, I definitely really have to care about insurance. She still hasn't had a commercial auto policy, but that's about to change. She had been hiring a third party to make her deliveries. She now buys her first delivery vehicle, she needs a commercial auto policy.  I understand from my colleague that she is now thinking of expanding her business regionally, maybe nationally. She realizes she has a real asset here, an asset she wants to preserve, protect, maybe pass on to the next generation. I would argue she's moving into that fourth circle of, I genuinely care about buying insurance. The point here is for small business owners, it is a journey of one, and they are all different, and they are not necessarily linear like the real-life example I just gave you. People move back and forth. Some small business owners never move out of that second circle. They're kind of the Sams of small business ownership. And to deal with that, we have developed a series of customer journey maps, by business type and by business stage. And do what these journey maps allow us to do? It maps our creative and our messaging and our media buying with those key trigger events to deliver the right message at the right time to that business. So this a trend that is clearly coming. You've been reading a lot about it. It's been a little slow to gain traction. We think it's about to take hold, and we feel we are really, really well-positioned to capitalize on that.  The other trend I want to talk to you about is the application of telematics to non-fleet commercial auto insurance. I'm not sure if this is a trend yet, but I do believe it's coming. So telematics have been broadly applied in fleet situations. But even there, there has never been a really strong insurance tie-in. That's been more about asset management and logistics than insurance. But we think that's about to change, particularly in the trucking sector. Now John Sauerland has already talked to you about Progressive's leadership position in terms of usage-based insurance pricing science. He's talked to you, and Andrew's reinforced, the big data capabilities Progressive can bring to bear. Those are absolutely assets we can leverage in Commercial Lines. But we have taken a slightly different path in Commercial than they have in Personal with respect to UBI, and we have focused on the transportation industry, the over-the-road truckers. Two reasons for that. One, we feel a version of the Snapshot product will work perfectly well for a lot of our business auto contractor-type customers. And now as the agency adoption rate of Snapshot is starting to go up, it may be the time for us to introduce that to commercial. The other reason that we focused on transportation is we were anticipating a federal mandate, which is now law, that will require federal motor carriers to have an electronic logging device in their vehicle and operational by December 2017. And these electronic logging devices will be fully telematics-enabled, if you will. They'll have all the data you could possibly want. So we have, for the last few years, been working directly with the vendors, the  manufacturers of these ELDs to put in place data sharing agreement and cooperative marketing agreements so we can go to market together with our products as the demand increases, leading up to the compliance date in December '17 and we've also been collecting our own UBI data for the last several years. Today, we probably have about 600 of our insured trucks on the road being monitored. We've collected over 41 million miles of data, and those data are beginning to reveal some really, really interesting things.  Perhaps the most interesting is that we find with commercial operators the degree of variance in their behavior is far, far greater than Personal Lines customers in terms of how, how much and where they drive. To the extent those behaviors correlate with losses, and they do, that's very exciting, because that allows for greater rate segmentation. And John's already talked to you about the power of rate segmentation. He's told you that in Personal Lines, Snapshot is the most predictive, most powerful rating variable we have. We believe, for trucking risks, it will be even more powerful than that. So we're very excited.  Let me give you just a little sampling of some of the things we're seeing. All these examples relate to the same 3 insured vehicles. One of the things you rate on in Commercial Auto is something called radius of operation, which is basically how far do you go from your principal garaging address, how far do you go. It's a rating variable we use. ISO uses it. A lot of our competitors use it. A problem with radius of operations as a rating variable, it could be hard to verify and it changes over time. Truckers go where the work -- I think that's true of all commercial vehicles, they go where the work is. But we all use it. Well now, with electronic logging devices, we actually know where they go. And in this sample, we've got 3 insured vehicles that were all rated based on the same radius of operation, 500 miles, which was pretty good for Vehicle C. We're probably overcharging Vehicle A and Vehicle B. Well, more important than how far you drive is where you drive. Now that we have geolocation data, we can actually score different routes and different roads in terms of relative safety or risk. From there, we can overlay time of day, so you incorporate things like rush hour and potentially things like seasonal weather pattern. You begin to see where this can go. But even with a relatively simplistic model for scoring, which is what we have here, you see pretty significant differences in distribution, which we believe are actionable and ratable. One more, this is how much you drive, and this is really the whole impetus behind the federal mandate. Better regulation of hours of operation, hours of service. Driver fatigue is a major, major safety issue for over-the-road truckers. The graphs on the bottom reflects hours per day of driving. So each bar on the graph is a day. And the white line going across is the federal limit of 11 hours per day. So you can see pretty significant differences in these distributions. Vehicle B -- and remember, this is the guy that goes the furthest from home by far, seems to be doing a better job of managing his hours per day. Vehicle C actually had some 20 and 22-hour days in there. Now what that probably means is we have team driving, 2 drivers taking shifts. And still, that's really important and valuable information and represents a different risk. So this is just a few samples of the types of data we are beginning to develop, that we think will be very, very actionable.  I'm going to conclude with one more chart, just because I love the data, and this is another comparison between Personal Auto, and in this case, some long-haul trucking customers. So the bottom graph was taken from a sample of Snapshot customers, Personal Auto Snapshot customers. And all it does is it shows kind of where their cars are during different parts of the day. And what you see by and large is most of the time, those cars are at home, in the driveway, in the garage. And during the daytime hours, that's where you see the driving. Not so much driving in the wee morning hours. Not surprising. The graph on the top is a sample of Progressive-insured long-haul trucks. And what you see there is lots of driving, not surprising, not unusual, 100,000, 120,000 miles a year for a trucker. But when they're not driving, they're typically away from home, sleeping in their truck, showering at a truck stop, using a, I don't know, Cracker Barrel. It could be a pretty hard life for a trucker, and this is where I really start to get excited about these data, because this is where I think we can go beyond just straight rate segmentation and start to develop value-added services by using risk management services to hopefully make these truckers a little bit healthier and a little bit safer while they're on the road. So again, another trend, we think, is coming to small business insurance, in this case, non-fleet auto insurance, that we feel we're very, very well-positioned to capitalize on. With that, I'm going to bring up Tricia Griffith for some closing remarks. Susan Griffith : Thank you. We hope it's evident how bullish we feel about the future. Clearly, last year, Pat stood up here and said his primary goal, our primary goal, is to restore business in the agency channel. We didn't just restore it, it's at the highest level ever. We continue with our segmentation of more and more product models and having deeper segmentation at the quickest amount of time ever. So we really think that's a competitive advantage. And our bundled PIFs have grown 20% to 30% across channels. John  Sauerland talked about our most important variable, our UBI or usage-based insurance, so Snapshot, and how we're continuing on that evolution and how with that work we've actually had even more data capabilities across the enterprise that we believe will be a winning strategy for Progressive. Andrew Quigg talked about PLE. We finally made that breakthrough in PLE, especially in the Robinsons segment. Andrew talked about the massive amount of customer data that we have and how we're going to use that data to understand the moves of our customers and be out in front of that, give them a reason to stay.  John Barbagallo talked about the fact that we're outperforming our peers relative to profit and growth, so that's extraordinary. Bottom line is though, we have to respond quickly to our frequency trend, and we're doing that with rate. John has his own era coming up in terms of the direct business with small business owners as well as technology and data-driven technology in the commercial space. I hope you're thrilled as our team is about what we've executed upon and what we're going to be doing in the future. And I want to thank you for your interest in Progressive. So with that, I will ask John Sauerland to join me for some Q&A. Elyse Greenspan : Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. So my first question is in terms of the 96% margin target. The way you spoke about it today, seems like a company-wide goal. From the last conference call, you kind of spoke as the homeowners focus not necessarily included in that 96% target for now. So if you could just kind of clarify that. When you look at the 96% goal versus the 96.2% year-to-date, is that company-wide goal? Or I thought for the time being, you were excluding the homeowners portion of the business. Susan Griffith : Yes, Ian asked that question during the conference call. I corrected myself. I was thinking from a gain share perspective. It is a 96% across all products, including homeowners. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then so, I guess, combined with that target as well is that we have this storm approaching Florida. So as we, I guess, double-part question, think about both your retention and exposure to the loss, and we do see it kind of contained to your retention, how are you thinking about your exposure, just in terms of the hours clauses in your contracts, given that the storm might end up impacting Florida twice? And then how do you just think about exposure there in terms of still hitting that 96% target for the full year? Susan Griffith : Well, when you mean exposure, reinsurance? In terms of that, I'll let you answer that part of that. But obviously, we can't predict the amount of the storm and the loss cost that will come from that. We have a CAT load that we put in each year. This seems to be something extraordinary. So right now we're at a 96.2%. Depending on what happens, clearly, you can kind of get to the outcome of that. We feel good about where we're at with reinsurance, and I'll let John talk a little bit about that. John Sauerland : And my bet was that was going to be the first question, so thank you for it, because I'm sure it was on all of your minds. ASI has maintained the reinsurance philosophy they had before we acquired a majority stake in the company. We haven't disclosed the complete reinsurance program, but I'll give you some quick highlights. So $50 million of retention for a main storm. The first storm has a tower that is up to what -- the average model, I'll say, equates to about a 1 in 300 years storm, so that's pretty high up relative to what we believe other carriers have. We have a second event that also has a $50 million retention on it. But we're -- I think ASI has done a great thing in that it's only typical in the marketplace, in that they prepay reinstatement for about 70% of that tower. That tower is not quite as tall as the first tower, but it's about a 1 in 100-year event, and about 70% of that has reinstatement premiums prepaid. And Trevor Hillier and John Auer -- Trevor Hillier, CFO of ARX, and John Auer, the CEO, are both here. So if I misstate or I need corrections, please feel free to chime in. So $50 million on an ASI book, it's material for sure. $50 million on the Progressive book, you can do the math. We can absolutely sustain that and still hit our calendar year 96% targets. Unknown Attendee : That's homeowner only? John Sauerland : That is property only, yes. So we also have boats sit on the coast of Florida. Thank you for reminding us of that. That exposure, we're pretty confident we have a pretty good feel for it as well, and our expected, our modeled exposure for Matthew is lower than that $50 million. It's probably like half. Now will that be -- it's a model. We all get that reinsurance models are not accurate. So the ultimate losses won't be known until they're known. But we think again, with even -- and auto on top of that, we'll have flood losses for sure, but we would still expect to hit a calendar year 96%, even with the storm. Amit Kumar : Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Two questions, both broader. First of all, just going back to the target of 50% increase in PLE. Last year, obviously, when we were here, you sort of sounded a bit disappointed in terms of trying to get to that number. Based on what we have seen today, do you think that 50% is a time-bound target or is it an aspiration target? And I guess linked to that is based on the numbers which we saw in the slide, is the improvement from here more linear or is it more exponential? That's my first question. Susan Griffith : Okay, great question. I -- from the PLE, I believe that it is, it will continue. It's not -- we haven't time-bound it. And we look differently at our PLEs across segments. So when we look at Sam, Sam stays about the same amount of time. So we often look at our PLE in, excluding Sam, and then all else. So Dianes, Wrights and the Robinsons. I believe we have just gotten started. So when we think about PLE, we think of nature and nurture. So as we continue with our new product models for those preferred customers, and we understand what Pat talked about, having 2 competitive products in the -- both home and auto available, I can only see that continuing to improve. And then what Andrew talked about in the nurture side is we're learning so much about our customers, so I think those 2 together, I believe, the possibilities are extraordinary. Amit Kumar : Got you. That's helpful. And the second question is, maybe switching gears, going back to Snapshot mobile. Doesn't that product skew the customer base away from the preferred customer? Wouldn't Snapshot model, I guess, attract a younger driver or is this much more, I guess, non-standard-ish? Or am I thinking of that in the wrong manner? In terms of the customer base, who will use that product? Susan Griffith : Well, I can start, and John went over -- no, I think though the chart he showed actually talked about consumer acceptance at any age. John Sauerland : Yes. And so we haven't marketed the app yet for Snapshot. Smartphone adoption is pretty broad now. I don't know the exact numbers across ages, but it's a very high penetration. Might adoption be younger? Perhaps. We wouldn't expect it to skew towards Sam, so to speak, for any reason. Snapshot, generally speaking, as you saw, is more relatable and preferred by preferred customers. So we'll see how the app distribution goes, but we're not going into it expecting it to skew any differently than our current Snapshot market. Amit Kumar : But does that mean -- following up on the loss cost trends, based on all the data you have initially, the loss cost trends are similar, is what you're saying? John Sauerland : So we have -- Snapshot app is in pilot stage today. We don't have it broadly, so we don't have enough data to tell you that it's exactly like Snapshot, but we are confident that our algorithm will react the same as the device or similar to the device, so we're confident that the rates that we apply will be accurate. Susan Griffith : We'll know a lot more next year. We're rolling out in 2 states later this year and the rest in the first half, so probably later part of next year we'll have more data. Charles Peters : Greg Peters with Raymond James. I just wanted to follow up real quick on the Snapshot product. Some of your peers, I think, have observed that their product stays on continuously even past that -- your pricing period. And I'm curious if you have a perspective on that as it relates to what you're doing. And then I have a different question, sort of in the same area. Susan Griffith : Yes, I think that we believe that we obtained enough data to properly rate that, that person with other variables. And we feel like we did not need to pass that time frame. Charles Peters : So in the data collection process, do you feel like you're missing out on data because you're not continuously tracking while they are customers, especially as you move towards the Robinsons, who are going to be with you longer, don't you think that data would be more valuable if you continue to collect it? Susan Griffith : We felt -- we thought that we had enough data to accurately price for those exposures. John Sauerland : We tested multiple models years ago, actually, with Snapshot. So we actually tested a continuous model, to use your words, meaning the device remained in the car past 6 months. And we concluded we were good with 6 months. Charles Peters : Okay. And then I just want to get back -- I was fascinated with Andrew's presentation. Thank you for offering us the opportunity to listen to that. And I'm just curious, from your perspective, can you tell us a little bit about the amount of money that he's invested in all of these different models and initiatives in marketing and maybe how it's changed this year versus last year? Because maybe you're spending less in advertising, more on modeling, quantitative analytics, et cetera. Just give us some color behind that, that would be very helpful. Susan Griffith : Yes, I mean, Andrew was the perfect person to put in the new role that we put him in last year, because we really wanted to understand deeply about our customer and how to get out in front of those things. And we just didn't have a lot of modeling done. We've been hiring across the company for data analysts. But I wouldn't say it's had any effect on what we pay for advertising. So that, those are 2 different things. We pay for advertising based on trying to get -- use an efficient amount of money to get customers in the door. So I would say this is -- we're spending the right amount -- I don't know the exact amount, I don't know that Andrew does either -- with just understanding data and then getting out in front of understanding how to proactively approach our customers when they think they need us and make sure they nurture right. This, to me, is worth it because how it should play out is our customers should stay longer and it should pay for itself by far. John Sauerland : I would agree. It will pay for itself many times over. I think the biggest investment is people. And we are moving some of our best data modelers in the company into the CRM group, which we previously hadn't done. And we think it will pay big dividends. Kai Pan : Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. I have 2 questions. Number one is on the combined ratio. It's increased about 3.5 points compared with last year. You mentioned that CATs contributed to 1.5 points of that. Is the rest of the 2 points mostly because the new business have higher loss ratio? And do you expect that you were slowing down the new business to improve the 96% combined ratio currently? Susan Griffith : Actually, the CATs for 2016 have contributed 3 points. Kai Pan : Yes, but relative to last year, it was 1.5. So it increased 1.5. Susan Griffith : Yes, so the increase is 1.5. We don't intend to slow down our new growth. We want as much new growth as we can. We anticipated the new growth tax that came into play. I think as the next 4 months play out, we'll clearly take action, but rational action, to get closer to that 92. So yes, the new business has been a huge part of that process, especially on the direct side, where we front-load all those acquisition costs. So yes, we prepare to have that new business tax for that growth. John Sauerland : I might point out one difference, if you go on year-on-year, last year, we had about 2 points of favorable development at this point in the year. Right now, we have 0.1 point of favorable development. Again, I want to be as accurate as possible, but if you're doing the year-over-year, some of last year's calendar year result was prior year favorable development. Susan Griffith : And just to add on to that, we started out this year with some unfavorable development from December losses from 2015. So there's a couple of different things in play there that account for it. Kai Pan : Okay. And the second question is sort of larger picture. If you look at the adoption technology in the car -- safer car as well as driving behavior change like using shared mobility, using Uber, how do you think this would impact your business over the long term as well as in the next 3 to 5 years? Susan Griffith : Well, we've showed several times on how frequency over the last 50 years has continued downward. And of course, it's been offset by a lot of severity trends. We know that continuous safety models, and ultimately, at some point, we think that will be in the far future, autonomous cars will happen. So that's obviously a big threat to the insurance industry. And we're thinking about that. We have a group we call a runaway team that every day thinks about what could we do to monetize different things, what could we do to have new innovations? And so normally, we've been on the cadence of discussing the technology around vehicles about every other year. As our -- we did it last year, we'll update you this year -- the next year, I should say, on what we're doing with that. But we don't think -- we don't believe frequency trends are going to reverse, and we have to prepare for that. Meyer Shields : Meyer Shields, KBW. John, I have to ask, just because I couldn't hear, were you saying that the model retention was 5-0 or 1-5 on the catastrophe? John Sauerland : What's the question? Meyer Shields : On the catastrophe model, catastrophe loss, I just couldn't tell if it was... John Sauerland : 5-0 retention. Meyer Shields : Okay. Real question, I'm trying to understand why, when we had sort of an industry-wide uptick in frequency, the Personal Auto performance was actually pretty robust and held up through that. In other words, you didn't see margins deteriorate rapidly or beyond expectations. On the commercial side, it seems to have been very sudden, and I',  wondering if that's an internal issue or the nature of the external variables. Susan Griffith : Well, John, you can add more to that. We -- it did creep up pretty aggressively. We added a lot of new business in, and we saw that -- the first few months when we saw the frequency trend go up, we weren't too shocked by it, because relative to those months, it was a little bit higher, but -- to the months compared to last year, it was a little bit higher, but nothing too detrimental. And then when we saw that third month, we dug in deeply and reacted quickly. John Barbagallo : I guess I need to get on camera. Susan Griffith : Okay, fine. John Barbagallo : I think and I tried to add this color, in Commercial Lines, we're also seeing increased levels of economic activity. And we know when we see that, frequency follows. So that, when you put it all together, I think there's a general rise in frequency, which we see across all auto. But when you look at the verticals where we participate, a lot of construction, a lot of aggregate haulers, over-the-road trucking, so freight transport, definitely positive movement in all those indicators. So higher levels of economic activity is driving that as well, we believe. Susan Griffith : You want to stay up here? Because Jay Cohen from Bank of America has a question. Like homeowners, will you feel the need to manufacture your own commercial policies ex auto, such as BOP and GL? John Barbagallo : Well, my comments today were mostly focused on the direct channel. And there, we feel very comfortable that we can develop a very robust platform for direct small business customers using non-affiliated partner products. We've already done that, and we think we will continue to enhance that capability. I think a solution for the agency channel is more challenging. We found that with homeowners. And the bundling dynamic for commercial is also different. I tried to share that today, so when does Commercial Auto even get introduced into the equation. It tends to be these other coverages that drive the relationship. And I would just say we are exploring a number of different alternatives for the agency channel, but we have not necessarily settled on a particular strategy. Susan Griffith : Thanks, John. Brian Meredith : Yes. Brian Meredith, UBS. A couple questions here. I'm just curious, how are the agents reacting to 3.0? Given the surcharge, I would think that might be something that they may not like, having to go back to a customer and say, \"Listen, you're getting a higher rate,\" and that could potentially hurt your relationship. Susan Griffith : Actually, the agents have reacted favorably to 3.0 because of the discount. So it's easy for them to talk about what is involved in the UBI approach. So it's actually improved -- the take rate has improved in the agency channel. Brian Meredith : Okay, great. Second question, I'm wondering with the -- on the Commercial Auto side, has any change in mix maybe caused any more seasonality to loss ratios and those types of things in the business? Susan Griffith : You're digging into it more than them. I think you've seen some seasonality. And I think because we've had a lot of new business growth as well, we're learning some things. John Barbagallo : Yes, we've always had seasonality in the business. I mean, a lot of it is tied to construction-related trades. We have seen a shift in our mix of business a little bit toward more of the transportation, which arguably is less seasonal. But in terms of a direct response to your question, I don't know that seasonality has become any more or less of a factor in what we're seeing. John Sauerland : And I think it's fair to say that we've seen that BI frequency uptick across segments in the Commercial Lines space. Brian Meredith : Right. And then I guess my last question, and kind of to what Kai was asking, with respect to this new business tax that you all talk about, is there anything that you can help us out with in trying to figure out exactly what that new business tax is right now on your underwriting results? How should we think about it? And as policies in-force growth starts to moderate, is the new business tax higher on direct versus agency? Can you give us some color? Because that's something a lot of us are asking ourselves right now. Susan Griffith : I tried to do that with showing both the agency and direct. So clearly, it's higher on the direct model because of the acquisition cost. So those acquisition costs are all front-loaded versus a relatively fixed commission. And I tried to talk about that in terms of the ULUP as well as how we think that's going to earn in. I mean, I can't predict exactly how it will earn in, because there are a lot of inputs. But we feel positive about it because of the influx of the type of new business we're bringing in, the average written premium and how we believe they'll run off in terms of ULUP. I'm not sure if I'm answering your question. I mean, we, I... Brian Meredith : What about the loss ratios? You generally have the new business tax on loss ratios. Susan Griffith : Higher [ph]. Brian Meredith : Yes. Exactly. How to think about that? Susan Griffith : Well, I think it's a shorter-term thing. And as those customers stay longer, especially the Robinsons and the Wrights, with that PLE, you're well below that 96. So that's why we feel good. So you've got that new loss -- and I figure, are you saying is it coming in, the new -- the next new tranche of new business. Brian Meredith : Yes. Susan Griffith : Yes, I mean, I think.... Brian Meredith : Each new tranche that comes in, it's got a higher loss ratio. As it runs down, obviously, the loss ratio improves. But how do we think about the math and how that kind of comes down? Susan Griffith : I think we think about the math in terms of targets. And so we know in each segment, new and renewal, agency, direct, Robinsons, Sam, at the very lowest level, we have specific targets that we believe will run off profitably. And we know when we're writing at or below targets, we feel that business is good. And so that's how we think of it. John Sauerland : I might add, just for -- and we won't give you the complete math. But know that we are hitting -- the calendar year 96 for the aggregate of the business remains. So regardless of which channel is growing, which segment is growing or not, we are committed to hitting that calendar year 96 regardless of there's a storm. We also work to price segments to lifetime cohort targets, as we call it. So we would take a direct auto segment and say over the life of that policy, we want to hit that 96. And that's why Tricia was showing the economics very differently in a calendar year period than a lifetime period. So we're trying to manage through the lifetime targets as well as the calendar target. And we can switch a lot of levers to ensure that we hit the calendar year target, which may or may not have implications on the longer-term lifetime targets. But more recently, if anything, it has had the effect of having the lifetime profitability, the ULUP, if you will, of that business, even better. James Naklicki : James Naklicki with Citi. Two questions. So first, you talked about 1 point on the P&L from technology spending from 2.0, that I guess it goes down under 3.0 because of the mobile device. So can you talk about would that flow through to bottom line or will it be factored into pricing? And my second question was, it appeared to me that loss trends were elevated in the second quarter relative to what they usually are historically. So -- and I think that was Personal Auto. What was driving that? Susan Griffith : Do you want to take the first one, and I'll take the second one? John Sauerland : Sure. So as we were just saying, whenever we find opportunity to price stuff differently or if we improve our cost structure, we plow that back into the pricing. So we will continue to price the Snapshot business to those similar lifetime targets of 96. So if we can take 1 point out of the expense ratio, we'll plow it back into the rates, be it through the non-acquisition expense ratio efforts that Tricia mentioned earlier, technology expense, what have you, so that goes back into the rates. Susan Griffith : Yes. Loss trend, we talked about that for new business, as well as frequency was relatively flat, severity was up about 4 points. John Sauerland : And second quarter was a little higher than first quarter, but I wouldn't interpret that as a trend. And 0% frequency and 4% severity is very consistent with historical trend that we've seen. Unknown Attendee : On Commercial Auto, how does the new business penalty work through and stopping new business applications? I mean, how many points does that bring the combined ratio down, put another way? Susan Griffith : I'm not sure how much. I mean, it has an impact on it. Again, most of our commercial business is written through the agency channel. So you're not going to see that same new business tax because we're not using the direct, so it's commission-based. I think it's also slightly higher on both underwriting and loss cost, so... John Barbagallo : And the new business restrictions will affect about less than 10% of our normal new business mix. So that will significantly affect the short-term combined ratio. Susan Griffith : With the underwriting that you're putting in place. John Barbagallo : Yes. Susan Griffith : Yes. Unknown Attendee : So slowing down growth does not impact the run rate in the combined ratio by itself? Is that your answer? John Barbagallo : No, it does. Not in the short term. So those actions are really designed to make sure 2017 is where we want it to be. And those restrictions will stay in place until the new rates are in place. Unknown Attendee : I guess, I didn't follow. What is the 10% that you're -- your new business that you're not writing in Commercial Auto? John Barbagallo : Sure. It's some high-frequency segments. Logging operations, new venture trucking operations, things that always have a high frequency. And until we get our rates where we want them, we're just going to not take that business for a while. Unknown Attendee : So it's the most volatile segment in the business, in theory? John Barbagallo : The highest frequency, and yes, typically high limit segments. John Sauerland : So I'll take it to a little -- maybe a little higher level. We can get more profitable by raising rates or we can underwrite out segments at new business or at renewal that we think are the cause of the problem until we have rates in that segment high enough where we are then comfortable letting new customers back in. So in Commercial Lines, they've identified segments of new customers that they believe will be the least profitable. And they're working upfront to underwrite that. In Commercial Lines, they have a lot of ability as well to underwrite a renewal with credits, debits. And they've done a lot of that over time and have targeted that, of course, as well. In Personal Lines, we're actually employing a lot of underwriting these days as well. It hasn't been what we've been -- it hasn't been our forte historically. But probably 4 or 5 years ago, we started getting a little more conservative around ensuring that we were bringing in business that was intent it was to insure and not otherwise. And I think that's helped us a lot. But higher level, you can improve profitability through raising rates or underwriting segments. And Commercial Lines has been very fast to react in turning on the underwriting where necessary, and they're now reacting very quickly in getting rates up and expect to have those rates up about 9% by the end of the year. Susan Griffith : Great. If that's all there is, there's none from here. Again, we want to thank you for your interest in Progressive. We hope that this is informative. Normally -- we'll have the Q out probably in the next couple of weeks. So normally, we would have a conference call in November. We're not going to because of the recency of this meeting. So we will talk to you soon after that. Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] In addition, this conference is being recorded at the request of Progressive. If you have any objection, you may disconnect at this time. The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the Letter to Shareholders, which have been posted to the company\u2019s website. And we\u2019ll use this conference call to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the call will be Julia Hornack. At this time, I will turn the call over to Ms. Hornack. Julia Hornack : Thank you, Marcia. Good morning. Welcome to Progressive\u2019s conference call. Joining us on today\u2019s call are our CEO, Tricia Griffith; our CFO, John Sauerland and our Chief Investment Officer, Bill Cody. The call is scheduled to last an hour. As always, our discussions on this call may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during this call. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions on the risks, uncertainties and other challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investors page of our website, progressive.com. Before we open the call to questions, I would like to turn the call over to Tricia? Tricia Griffith : Thank you, Julia. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the first quarter call. First of all, I\u2019m very pleased with our results for the first quarter and we look forward to answering your questions. Before that, I\u2019d like to outline some changes we are making starting with the second quarter call that is currently scheduled for the first week of August. We will be moving away from the Q&A format that we\u2019ve been doing for quite some time. In place of solely questions-and-answers on the call, we will have a webcast each quarter. The webcast will begin with a presentation on a specific topic that either you have previously expressed interest in or one that we believe that is relevant to this audience, while at the same time providing exposure to other leaders of Progressive. Following the presentation, we will answer your questions about both the presented topic and quarterly results. To accommodate this agenda, we will lengthen the event to 90 minutes. Our first topic will be what we call our runway project, and it will be presented by John Curtis. He is the leader of our Personal Auto Product Development Group within our R&D Department. We know that there\u2019s a great deal of interest in the opportunities and challenges that evolving vehicle technology present. John plans to discuss the industry trends, including long-term frequency and severity. In addition, he\u2019ll outline what information we are collecting, both internally and through the third parties, regarding vehicle technology trends and how that data might influence our future product design. We truly hope this format will provide you with more current information on the topics that interest you rather than a once-a-year Annual Investor Relations Meeting. Details on how to access that webcast and conference call lines will be provided during July. At this time, Marcia, we\u2019re ready to take our first question. Operator : [Operating Instructions] The first question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Good morning. My first question is just about your accident year ex-cat loss ratio. As the new business that you guys rolled last year\u2019s seasons and loss cost just for the industry appeared to be moderating, as we think about the balance of the year from here, do you expect to see continued improvement in your underlying ex-cat accident year loss ratio? Tricia Griffith : Well, a lot of it has to do with the business that we\u2019re bringing on the books and that will be reflected in our loss ratio. We are bringing on, as noted in the Q as well as my letter, a much more - a higher percentage of preferred customers, which frequently calls for less losses. So while we can\u2019t predict what will happen from a loss perspective, we are working continually and diligently to bring on more of our preferred customers from both how we align our product and of course, our auto and home bundles. Trevor Hillier : I\u2019d add to that that we have raised rates, a good deal in 2016 and that is in the process of what we could call earnings into the book, took about 5.5 points of rate in our auto programs, about 9.5 points in our Commercial Lines program and we\u2019ve continued to raise rates at a bit slower clip, but still materially raise rates through the first quarter. So that obviously helps the loss ratio throughout the rest of the year as well. Elyse Greenspan : Great. And then my second question in terms of following up on the bundling concept. Can you provide some disclosure or numbers on how have you seen a pickup in terms of your customers that are purchasing both the auto and home products? And information just on the penetration of that Platinum product? And then also just where the bundling stands today within your book compared to when you announced that ASI acquisition and the potential additional bundling from here? Tricia Griffith : Absolutely, Elyse. So first and foremost, we call our bundled customers with auto and home Robinsons, we refer to that internally, and I think a lot of you are familiar with that. Our new business Robinsons quarter-over-quarter are up 50%, our PIPs are up 25% year-over-year. And as noted, and really very exciting to us, is the retention on the Robinson cohort is up over 25%. So we build Robinsons in three different areas. Let me focus first on Platinum and the Agency brands. So initially, when we rolled out Platinum, it really was about integrating the sales force from ASI and making sure we could really accommodate the changing needs of this product and help our agents make sure that they knew both our auto and our home to bundle that. So we continue to move forward. And I think I said in a couple earlier calls that it was moving a little bit slower and the integration took longer, we\u2019ve gotten over that hurdle and we feel really positive about our ability to continue to roll out the Platinum products. ASI were in 41 states, 35 of those we have Platinum agents. We plan to double Platinum agents this year as well. So we feel very positive about the momentum and the relationships that we have with these agents and really their commitment to quarterly results, and we know when they don\u2019t meet those results that we talk about that wisdom, change course, determine what they need. John Sauerland has talked about, in the October meeting, how we\u2019re really focusing on whether it would be in each area, each state, I should say, is the auto product competitive, is the home product competitive and where we find that they\u2019re not, we make accommodations to possibly broaden coverage and to be able to sell a great bundled product. So while we\u2019re not sharing specific results in terms of percentages, the momentum continues as planned, and I\u2019m really excited about that. On the direct side, we have what we call our Progressive Advantage Agency. And they have been really doing an incredible job. Now of course, we write more than ASI in the direct channels, so these are customers that have our auto and they call in as our inside agency, they call in and we fit them with the product that best suits their home. So it could be with ASI and we have nine other unaffiliated partners. We have grown our Advantage Agency, our in-house agency by several hundred in the last couple of years. So that\u2019s gained a lot of momentum and we feel very positive about that continuing. Just recently, we rolled out what we call [ph] home quote explorer (09:36) and that is consistent with our customers wanting to buy where, when and how philosophy. And this is a very slick online process where you can get a quote and we\u2019ll match you up with the company that is best for you with your home and then currently you make a call at the end of that process online to buying in our in-house agency. That is just up and running. We have eight states and we continue to learn from that and our plan is to roll out many more states throughout the year. So we certainly have the trifecta of Platinum is really going well in the Agency brand and we\u2019re seeing that momentum really gain speed. The Progressive Advantage Agency has done actually even above what we had kind of planned and we\u2019re excited about that and now we have the online version. So while we don\u2019t share right now the percentage, but we\u2019ll get to that at some point when we believe it\u2019s meaningful. And I imagine at some point, the overall home products and Robinson will be a topic for this quarterly webcast because that\u2019s I think of interest to all of you, so possibly a future topic to go into a little bit more detail on the metric. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you very much. Tricia Griffith : Thank you, Elyse. Julia Hornack : We\u2019ll take the next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kai Pan : Thank you, and good morning, and also thank you for your flexibility, moving the time of the call. The first question on catastrophe losses that we have seen rising frequency or severity of the weather events and I just wonder how are you thinking about managing the volatility as well as your cost of capital, specifically, is that 2.4 points cat load in 2016 a new normal for you guys given the business mix change towards property lines? Tricia Griffith : Well, clearly, we watch the weather and we look at a 10-year look back and then obviously, we continue to look at that more frequently to see what type of cat load we put in. Cats were not unexpected in first quarter and are not too dissimilar to first quarter of 2016, even a little bit less. So we put that load in. And obviously, we watch for it. And when we think of, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with weather, so we do our best to make sure that one, we are ahead of pricing when we need to take great actions and that we\u2019re, more importantly, ready to handle those claims when they happen. So although cats can be very - we can\u2019t plan them, we can\u2019t plan how we react to them. On the home front, as you know, we have purchased an aggregate stop-loss on coverage from the cats. Home is much more obviously volatile and expensive when cats happen than autos and I can have Trevor Hillier talk a little bit more about that or John Sauerland because they were involved in this. But for the most part, we were really trying to cap our losses when we went into this aggregate stop-loss agreement. So we decided to do this after our [ph] data re (13:02) bond had expired. And what we really wanted to do was to limit our downside. So we already have the name storms taken care of, but we wanted to have additional protection with perils such as winter storm, which of course happened this first quarter, earthquakes, fires, things like that. And that agreement caps our loss and LAE, non-name storms and liability to a 63% combined ratio. So we feel really - I\u2019m sorry, loss ratio. So we really think that was a good play for us to make sure, especially as we diversify throughout the company, to more and more states to cap our exposure on the home side. Trevor, do you want to add anything on that? Trevor Hillier : No, I think you summed it up well. But the aggregate stop-loss, it helps quite a bit, just as Tricia mentioned. The [ph] Gata Re aggregate contraction (13:57) was limited to just severe thunderstorms. So it does add those perils that we\u2019re seeing, especially as we expand our footprint across the country and as we did it - we\u2019re looking at it as a percentage of our premium in terms of reinsurance costs, we can get a very reasonable deal for the additional coverage that we\u2019re getting. Kai Pan : Great. Thank you. A follow-up is on your PIP growth in the direct channel, been slowing sort of like decelerating, like since mid of 2016. And recently, in your report, in your letter, Tricia you mentioned increasing media spending. Are we going to see acceleration of like a PIP growth and will that becoming sort of like a drag on the other hand on the so-called new business penalty? Tricia Griffith : The slowdown in fourth quarter of advertising was very deliberate. So we make a commitment to our shareholders that we will try to reach the 96, we will reach the 96 and grow as fast as we can. And when we had a really heavy cat year last year, we were taking measures to make sure that we reach that 96. And so we did purposefully reduce our advertising in the fourth quarter. So the reduction in new apps on the direct side was very deliberate and it\u2019s exactly what we planned. We are in a different position, coming into 2017. We\u2019ve increased our spend with increase in spend, normally that will increase prospects for sales and ultimately the big test conversion. We are seeing that starting to happen, and I can\u2019t tell you exactly how that will turn out, but we feel confident and comfortable in our spend in advertising and that it will have a positive impact on our business in direct growing in terms of new business apps and ultimately PIP. As far as media spend, like I said, we are back in [indiscernible] (16:05) and we look at media spend really, what we call, targeted acquisition costs and we want to make sure that our targeted acquisition cost is and our cost per sale are in alignment and as long as we feel like we are spending money and getting the sales at the right cost, we\u2019ll continue to spend and do it as inefficiently as we can - as efficiently as we can, sorry. Kai Pan : Do you worry about the increasing new business penalty? Tricia Griffith : I don\u2019t because we - when we bring new business on, we look at our new business targets and we know that those flow through. And if we\u2019re over our new business targets, then we slow down or we take action in terms of either ratings or underwriting actions. But we believe if we can bring our new business at/or below targets, then they play out. I talked about this in the October IR meeting. It\u2019s really about the economics of bringing in new business, it\u2019s very different. So to answer that question, it\u2019s dependent and how we look at the economics is very dependent on channels and segments. And if you recall, bringing in new business on the direct side is very expensive in the first term, because we front-load all those acquisition costs, but if we\u2019re bringing that right business and they say that second term is substantially down and we ultimately get to our both calendar year and lifetime 96, a little bit different on the Agency side. And then of course, the next tranche would be it\u2019s very different on the direct side if you\u2019re looking at a Sam or a Robinsons. So we calculate what the sort of a new business drag should be and when that will fall off and it\u2019s really all about getting the right business in at/or below our target. Kai Pan : That\u2019s great. Thank you so much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Kai. Julia Hornack : We\u2019ll take the next question please, Marcia? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney. Your line is open. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning, Progressive, I\u2019m excited about your new format and hope you can dodge the [indiscernible] (18:29) with the 90-minute call, which will be much appreciated. My questions are on the commercial auto side of the ledger. Tricia, you seem to have a bounce in your step and in your letter commenting that you\u2019re now positioned to grow that business again, it came in under a 90 combined in the first quarter with March having a weather impact, I suspect. Where are you in commercial auto cycle relative to your competitors? They need to take price, presumably other people are seeing pressures that you saw earlier. Are you in a position to get back to double-digit growth in that business with where - the rates that you\u2019ve taken? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Bob. We are excited about our Commercial growth. So as you know, and we were part of that third quarter, last year, we saw frequency increase substantially. We took a step back and took some rate action in September, about 9% in aggregate. Now across the book, it was very different depending on our business marketing tier to get what we needed. So that is still earning in, because clearly you do a rate revision per each day and we also have annual policies. So we believe we have the right rate and we\u2019re going to keep ahead of trend. So that was very exciting. And then the second thing we did, just to understand and get more enhanced in our segmentation in each of those segments in Commercial is we had some underwriting restrictions for that time period until the end of March. About mid-March, we made the decision at the end of March to lift many of those underwriting restrictions because we really believe we have the right rates and the right segmentation to bring on that business at or below our targets. So we are positive about our growth. We saw pretty immediately and we believe we have the right rate, once we lifted those underwriting restrictions, new app growth start up again. The great thing about Progressive is that we do react to rate need very quickly. So even in a channel that takes a little bit longer to earn in than our auto as a majority [indiscernible] (20:58) policies, we feel very positive that we got out ahead of trend quickly as we saw those frequency trends increase. So we\u2019re seeing a very hard market. We obviously watch the competition closely and people are getting a lot of rate. We feel very good, very positive about our growth in Commercial. Bob Glasspiegel : I think you averaged under 90 over the last decade in that segment and have a dominant market share along with Trevor\u2019s. How do you think about what your goals are in this segment because it doesn\u2019t seem like it operates with the same 96 parameter that your auto - your Personal Auto business does? Tricia Griffith : Yes, definitely, Commercial can be more volatile and especially, when you have annual policies, if you don\u2019t react quickly, you can get caught behind rapidly. So we\u2019re number one in Commercial Auto and we\u2019re very proud of that. We also know that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity out there. So we\u2019re creating a business auto policy to be able to really delve deeply into the Commercial part of the company as much as we have on the Auto. So think of how we outlined several years ago our Destination Era on the auto part. We\u2019re doing very similar things on the Commercial part. So we\u2019re really thinking about that small business owners and their needs. And so John Barbagallo and his team are working on the addressable market to have not just the auto, but other products, whether we manufacture them or not, we\u2019ll be manufacturing the [indiscernible] (22:42) product, but to enhance that, what you\u2019d almost consider the Commercial Auto Destination Era. It\u2019s a $300 billion opportunity, and along with the $300 billion opportunity on the Auto and Home, we feel like we\u2019re really positioned across the company for a long runway and a lot of growth. So we\u2019re going to continue to try to be number 1 in Commercial Auto because we\u2019re proud of that but we know we need to do more for our customers that expect more. So again, we\u2019re going to have the products and services they need, not unlike what we rolled out in Auto a few years ago. Bob Glasspiegel : Can I squeeze in one more or might be a lot, [ph] let me know (23:22)? Tricia Griffith : Go ahead. Julia Hornack : \u2026one more. Q - Bob Glasspiegel : Okay. Does this fit into Uber and Carpool strategy as well to have this business segment? Tricia Griffith : Yes. But let me talk about how I think about Progressive in the future in terms of that. So what I just described right now, I think about it in horizon, three horizons. So what I just described in both the Auto and Commercial segments are really surgically executing on things we know we can do well right now, so picture now in the next four or five years. I want our focus to really be on our ability to capitalize on having great rate, great service, improved retention and the products and services our customers need. When I think of Uber and the sharing economy and other things, we\u2019re clearly working on those right now for that next horizon, think maybe 4 to 8 or 4 to 10 years. And we just recently renewed our Uber contract actually in April with our Commercial business in Texas. And so we\u2019re enthusiastic to continue to learn more and work with Uber. In addition, on the Personal Auto side, we continue to add endorsements in many, many states to cover Uber drivers during the time that they\u2019re working. So I see Uber, sharing economy, think of all that type of things, [indiscernible] (24:52) some knowns and some unknowns that we should be working on now in the R&D portion of the company to roll things out probably more aggressively in that horizon 2. And then horizon 3 which we touched on a little bit during the August webcast is really about autonomous. So whether it\u2019s autonomous vehicles, autonomous commercial vehicles, autonomous P&C vehicles, how we think about that, how we\u2019re working with third parties to gather data and understand how we need to continue to set up the company to be an enduring business. Bob Glasspiegel : Thank you. Look forward to hearing about that. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Bob. Julia Hornack : All right, thanks, Bob. Marcia, we\u2019ll take the next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is open. Adam Klauber : Thanks. Good morning. A couple questions around bundling. One, you mentioned that bundling capability is up and running in 35 states today. What was that roughly a year ago? Tricia Griffith : I\u2019d have to check on that. Trevor Hillier : And to be clear, that was in the 8 independent - direct channel versus the countrywide... Tricia Griffith : Yes, direct channel, we\u2019ve been doing for a while and that was, we\u2019re in 41 states, the Platinum was in the 35. So we actually do have Auto and Home with ASI in the Agency channel in 41 states. I would check on that number because I hate to guess, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have that readily available and I can let you know that. Adam Klauber : Okay. Thank you. And as far as Snapshot, around how much of your, I guess, policy in force or your policy base [ph] hazards current (26:43) using Snapshot today versus a year or two years ago? Tricia Griffith : It\u2019s different in the direct channel and the agency channel, much higher in the direct channel. I think John, correct me [indiscernible] (26:54), I think it\u2019s up 35% or maybe 33% in direct. So a fair amount. From the Snapshot perspective, I wrote in my letter that we rolled out our Snapshot mobile. And so we did that in four states in December. And then as of today, this morning, we rolled out in another 22 states. So we are excited about mobile for a couple of reasons. One, because it just fits with the changing technology environment. Two, it\u2019s much less expense on our side, and three, we believe and I\u2019m not in the position right now to talk too much because it\u2019s still early on, but talk too much about segmentation enhancements that we believe we will garner from the mobile as a device. So in terms of talking on the phone, handheld, whether you\u2019re on a phone or on an application, so we believe that we\u2019re going to get and we\u2019re seeing already some interesting data on the mobile as a device. So we are excited about that. Adam, to answer your first question, we were in 16 states with Platinum a year ago. Adam Klauber : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then also back to the bundling, not asking for an exact number, but you\u2019re clearly growing a lot in the Robinsons, you\u2019ve given us some good statistics. Is that more in the agency channel than the direct channel? Tricia Griffith : No, it\u2019s actually in both channels. And I think our approach was really to be available when, where and how. And so the agency channel, I would sort of say, last year, had not gained the momentum that we\u2019re starting to see now. And our direct channel was a little bit easier because our customers already have auto with us and they were interested in home, so we were able to have ASI and many other carriers help them, whereas in the agency channel, it\u2019s a little bit different because it may be a customer that doesn\u2019t have a Progressive or an ASI product they were coming in. And so it\u2019s new to some of these agents and the whole process is new. So I would say we\u2019re happy about both channels as well as our ability to roll out the online version. Adam Klauber : Okay. And just one more follow-up. So online, you mentioned you\u2019re quoting homeowners now. You put up that new system. Are you actually quoting a bundle online or is that being quoted separately? Tricia Griffith : You\u2019re able to do that at the end. So yes, that\u2019s the whole theory is to be able to be in one place at one time. The only caveat is that you don\u2019t - you\u2019re not able to [ph] buy into (29:38) the home part online and so you talk to our agents in the Progressive Advantage Agency currently. Adam Klauber : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Julia Hornack : Thank you. Marcia, we\u2019ll take the next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. I just had a couple of follow-ups and then a broader question, but I guess on the last question about Snapshot and this may have been something you guys have touched on in the past, but is there a meaningful difference in frequency between a driver who isn\u2019t on Snapshot and then goes to Snapshot? Tricia Griffith : A very little. Ryan Tunis : So there\u2019s not like a someone\u2019s watching me in the backseat type of thing that would make someone a more careful driver? Tricia Griffith : We have - we do have the ability to alert you to let you know when you\u2019re doing things like hard braking and things like that that can influence us, so you know what we\u2019re looking at. Ultimately, there\u2019s sort of your DNA as a driver and usually and we believe that we\u2019re able to gather the type of driver you are and ultimately how that will lead to a loss cost pretty early on just with what we\u2019ve looked at in terms of time of day, hard braking, et cetera. Ryan Tunis : Okay. And then just following on Kai\u2019s question on the media spend. Is there a way we can think about, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s year-over-year in terms of the expense ratio [indiscernible] (13:13) that you\u2019re thinking the higher media spend will have or perhaps just a percent increase that you kind of have in your mind in terms of what you\u2019re thinking you might spend on media over the entire year? Tricia Griffith : We always do. We don\u2019t necessarily share this. We do a budget at the beginning based on all of our models of how we believe the year and several years will roll out. And what we look at from our expense ratio is, we look at it, we bifurcate it. We look at our overall expense ratio and then we look at our non-acquisition expense ratio. And so that way, we can firm up activities that we do on the efficiency side as well as advertising spend. We truly look at advertising with the caveat that we do have a stated goal for our shareholders to grow at a 96 or less, and so we look at advertising as - if we can get it efficiently and our targeted acquisition cost, our cost per sale is less than our targeted acquisition cost, then we will increase our spend. And so we buy a majority of our media in-house and we are very in tune with how much to spend, when we think the incremental spend is worth it and actually we\u2019re working on more recently just the lifetime value of different customers coming in the door and how much we think we should spend on each of those customers and getting much more detailed on that. So the short answer is, we\u2019ll spend as much as we can with the right amount, knowing that we have promises that we made to our shareholders in terms of profitability. And it\u2019s all about getting things at or below the targets that we set. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then, I guess, my last one was just on the competitive environment in general today versus 6 or 12 months ago, because I think we\u2019ve seen some competitors that have, I guess, started to lean in on rate more recently, others that had been doing it every 24 months ago that seem to be coming back to the marketplace. Would you say it\u2019s more competitive today than it was 6 or 12 months ago or are you still benefiting from either a new business or retention standpoint from a lot of competitors taking rate? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : From our competitive intelligence, we are seeing a pretty hard market. So we\u2019re seeing people take a fair amount of rate. Like Johnson, we took about 5.5 points last year, this quarter, we took a little bit over 1 point. But we are seeing shopping. So we do believe that we\u2019re benefiting from, one, having a competitive product, a competitive price and more consumer shopping. Julia Hornack : All right, I think that we\u2019ll take the next question, please. Marcia? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Thanks. Tricia, I wanted to follow up on your response to Kai, because if I understood you correctly, what you were saying is that you pulled back advertising spend and whatever sort of long-term value creation was associated with that because of sort of short-term capacity losses, which seems a little bit [indiscernible] (34:37). Am I thinking about that the wrong way? Tricia Griffith : No. We, sometimes, because we have that commitment to a 96, we sometimes take a short-term, not be able to take advantage of something very short-term to get to our long-term goal. We make that commitment. We\u2019re very public about that. For me, it\u2019s about making sure that we care as much about the bottom line as the top line. So yes, it was very deliberate when we pulled back advertising. We knew that that might - we might have some mid-short-term opportunities, but we really take our commitment to shareholders very seriously and we did what we could to make sure we got to that 96. So there\u2019s a couple ways you can do that. We felt like we had the right rate and we\u2019ve made so much movement on retention that we didn\u2019t want to just raise rates and have people leave because of that. We felt like we were in a good position, pulled back a little bit, obviously, we care a lot internally about expenses as well, so we made some changes internally on the expense ratio side and the loss adjustment ratio side. But yeah, we knew that we might have some short-term opportunities missed, but it is very much in keeping with our philosophy of making at least $0.04 of underwriting profit. Meyer Shields : No, I completely get it. How would I put it, I trust you enough to say maybe the commitment should be changed, not that you\u2019re doing anything inconsistent with what you said. Second question, completely unrelated. Does the current sort of freefall in used car pricing, is that something that can affect underwriting results in the near term? Tricia Griffith : I don\u2019t know if I could be able to speculate on that. I think it\u2019s really dependent on really [indiscernible] (36:30) losses, and I guess, in terms of severity on the [indiscernible] (36:35) PD side. We\u2019ll start to see that and we\u2019ll react to that when we see it. I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate it, but we obviously are keeping our eyes on both new car sales as well as used cars prices and [ph] salvage (36:44) prices. Meyer Shields : Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much. Julia Hornack : Thanks. All right, we\u2019ll take the next question please, Marcia? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yeah. Thank you. Just couple quick questions for you. First, just to follow-up on that, the severity increases you saw in the quarter, BI severity up 6%, PD up 7%. Anything to read into that. I believe the BI was just versus a pretty tough comp? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. And I think we\u2019re seeing things not unlike what the industry thinks. So - and I will say we\u2019re seeing little bit [indiscernible] (37:22) time of loss. So we know that will equate to possibly higher payments and we\u2019re baking that into our pricing indications. On PD as well, everyone I think is looking at paying the right amount. So when we talk about share liability, we\u2019re seeing that a little bit on the PD side. But again, we have put that into our pricing indications. And Gary, do you want to add anything on that? This is Gary Traicoff, our Chief Actuarial... Gary Traicoff : Sure. Hi, Brian. I think to your point, when we look at BI severity, in the last quarter, we were about 6%. Our paid severity is a little bit lower than that. So we know it\u2019s lagging a little bit, to Tricia\u2019s point, about the [ph] attorney wrapped (38:11) inventory going up a little bit. When we still look at our overall severity on a trailing 12-month calendar basis over the prior 12 months, we were up about 4% on BI. And to Tricia\u2019s point, we\u2019ve built that into our pricing and reserving overall, so we feel pretty comfortable where we\u2019re at with that as well. On the PD side, we were up this last quarter, part of that was just some closures and some inventory shifting. On an accident period basis, we see PD more in the 5% range and that\u2019s pretty close to what you see [ph] riding (38:45) on the long-term calendar period as well. Brian Meredith : Great. And then just I\u2019ve got a quick question, on the mobile app with Snapshot. Is the difference in cost, one, the difference in cost significant enough that we would see it actually in your expense ratio over time here? And then I\u2019m also just curious, on that, the mobile app, can you detect distracted driving and will that give you some better insight into distracted driving? Tricia Griffith : Great questions, Brian. Yes, that\u2019s one of the reasons why years ago, we knew after a certain period, say 60 days, that we were able to identity driving trends of our [ph] EBI (39:27) drivers. So that was a big difference in terms of the dongle devices, and as we go to mobile, it\u2019s even less expensive and ultimately we\u2019ll get that data from the cars. So yes, we will see that as part of our expense ratio. As far as distracted driving, yes, when you [indiscernible] (39:51) as I\u2019m driving, I\u2019ll see someone, I\u2019m like what are they doing [indiscernible] (39:54), see them on the phone or on an app and it\u2019s frustrating, but we really like to make sure we have the data to confirm things. So anecdotally we all think that, but the mobile device will give us much more insight into actual distraction. And whether I\u2019m talking on the phone hands-free or I\u2019m holding my phone or there\u2019s an app open, we\u2019ll be able to at some point correlate that to loss cost. So we believe that distracted driving more than likely has influencing on losses, but we want to be able to have that data to confirm it. So we\u2019re excited about gathering that data. It will take some time, but as we gather more and we feel more confident in that, we\u2019ll let all of you know what we find. Brian Meredith : Does the mobile app collect the same data that you collect with the dongles. Like I know there was like three or four things that you collected that kind of determine the rate or is there more stuff that you\u2019ll be collecting to determine the rate? Tricia Griffith : It collects the same thing, the hard braking, the time of day, miles driven. And we do have and we put this in a while ago, we also collect and this is only for research and development at this point, we collect GPS. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Brian. Julia Hornack : Thanks Marshall. We\u2019ll take the next question please. Operator :  [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Your line is open. Gary Ransom : Good morning. I\u2019d like to ask about frequency. If I look back at all your frequency disclosures, you did see a little bit of a bump in frequency increases back in 2015 and maybe into early 2016, which seems to have at least leveled off or become more moderate. What are you thinking about frequency going forward? Are we at a new normal level, are you building in continued increase into your pricing? What do you see right now? Tricia Griffith : Well, the last quarter, we actually saw a 4% decrease in frequency. And I - we\u2019re not going to react to one quarter because there\u2019s so many inputs that go into frequency, whether it\u2019s mix of business or macroeconomic data. On a trailing 12, we\u2019re about half a point [ph] out (42:16). And so we obviously collect things like miles driven, gas prices, macroeconomic data to understand long-term frequency trends. And we also internally create hypotheses to try to understand why our frequency goes up or down. So just recently, with the downtick in frequency, we have couple of hypotheses that we\u2019re thinking about : one, we don\u2019t believe it actually is influenced by the weather. We do believe, as we bring on a more preferred mix of business that those customers will typically result in lower frequency. We\u2019re also seeing higher miles driven with our UBI customers and a greater mix of trips that are longer trips that we define as over 15 miles. In addition to that, and the data is very thin, but it\u2019s interesting. We\u2019re seeing less hard brakes per participant. So our theory is that some of our UBI customers or our UBI customers in the aggregate are driving more highway longer trips, which could result in lower frequency versus a congestion in sort of the city. Again, that\u2019s a hypothesis. We\u2019ll continue to gather data on that. Obviously, the last several years with our products, models, we have a much more enhanced segmentation and with our underwriting as well, and we believe that allows us to put business on the book that aligns with our ability to reach our profit goal. So we have some facts about frequency and some series and hypotheses that we\u2019ll continue to watch the data. Again, frequency, we can react to it, I don\u2019t want to predict it because there are so many things that can come into play at any given time. Gary Ransom : Okay, well, that\u2019s helpful. Another question on the catastrophe reinsurance, the stop-loss. Is the way the accounting works, I just want to be sure I have it right, that as long as you\u2019re in this band and barring all the things that are not included, the name storms liability. The loss ratio will basically be 63 or thereabout until as long as you\u2019re inside the band of coverage, is that true for every month going forward? Tricia Griffith : Correct. I think, yeah, on a calendar year. Gary Ransom : Okay. And then on last year\u2019s [indiscernible] (44:46), some of the press is saying that all the $35 million has been returned and I wondered - and yet those losses have developed beyond that. I wondered if you could give us any insight as to what was going on there. Tricia Griffith : Yeah, I\u2019ll let Trevor take that one. Trevor Hillier : Yeah, all $35 million hasn\u2019t been collected yet, but we have let investors know that the loss is above that number. It\u2019s slightly above that number. Really the development is we\u2019re seeing a lot more late reports than we had seen in our previous history and continue to see them and which has caused a little bit of adverse development there, but it\u2019s not a turnover, the $35 million. Gary Ransom : Is that - does the fact that that can happen or you may not actually collect as much as you\u2019re supposedly due, does that make you shy away from cat bonds at all in the future? A - Trevor Hillier : Gary Ransom : Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Gary. Julia Hornack : All right. We will take the next call, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Amit Kumar of McMurray. Your line is open. Amit Kumar : Hi, thanks and good morning and thanks for putting me in. Two, again, two quick follow-ups. So one is going back to Meyer\u2019s question on new cars and used cars declining, if I were to ask this another way, has the average age of the automobile you ensure, has that changed over, let\u2019s say, the 5 years or has it remained somewhat static at, let\u2019s say, 11 or 12 years of age? Tricia Griffith : I would say not much. We look at our fleet every year and I would say it has not changed dramatically. Amit Kumar : And is that number like 11, 12 or is that different from that? Tricia Griffith : I\u2019m sorry? Amit Kumar : Is that the number the average age is 11 years or something like that? Tricia Griffith : It\u2019s like 11.5. Yeah. Amit Kumar : Okay, got it. The other question, going back to the discussion on the mobile app, in the letter, you talked about the penetration, I think it\u2019s in four states right now. Have you talked about some sort of timeline as to how we should think about the expansion and is this sort of concurrent with the dongle or does it at some point replace the dongle? That timeline would be very helpful. Thanks. Tricia Griffith : This is for - these are for new business. And so we\u2019ve rolled out four states in December. We rolled out 22 states today. So we\u2019re in 27 states and we intend to roll out the mobile device for new business throughout the country in 2017. So pretty aggressive timeline for that. We - our customers that have the dongle, we recycle those fairly quickly, so at some point, the majority of our customers will have mobile or we will have had the information on their loss characteristics or the driving characteristics, I should say, from the Snapshot device. Trevor Hillier : And just to be clear, today, the mobile device is an option for consumers, they can also opt into the dongle, but additionally, in the future, we would expect more and more of this data to come directly from the vehicles. And as you noted, our October presentation, we talked about an effort with GM and vehicles - GM vehicles I believe model year 2016 and newer have the ability to send the data that we collect similar to the data we collect with the dongle or the mobile device to us directly from the vehicle. So we have been running a pilot whereby GM customers opt into sharing their data with us, and we calculate a rate based on the data they share with us, and then we\u2019ll sell them a new policy with that discount incorporated at inception. It\u2019s been in pilot mode, and actually this month, we\u2019ll sort of flip over to more active mode. So we think the volume in that area is going to increase, albeit it\u2019s just vehicles, 2016 or newer, but the longer term model there, we see migrating actually to vehicles delivering the data. Amit Kumar : Yeah, that is very helpful. If I could just sneak a follow-up to that. Do you have plans to talk to other auto manufacturers or are you in advanced stages in terms of rolling out this sort of pilot program with them too or is this an one-off thing? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : We\u2019re always interested in talking to the OEs about opportunities that we wouldn\u2019t be able to talk about any that would be in place. But yeah, we\u2019re always interested in learning more and being a part of advancing what we think is really a great pricing algorithm in a variable floor pricing. So, yeah. Amit Kumar : I will stop here. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future. Tricia Griffith : Gary, I had one correction. I said calendar year 63 for the aggregate stop-loss, I meant to say accident year. Julia Hornack : And we actually have no other questions at this time. So that concludes our call. I\u2019ll turn it back over to you Marcia, for the closing script. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation\u2019s Investor Relations Conference Call. An instant replay of the call will be available through Friday, May 19 by calling 1800-964-3773 or it can be accessed via the Investor Relations section of Progressive\u2019s website for the next year.",

[Operator Instructions] In addition this conference is being recorded at the request of Progressive. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Acting as moderator for the event will be Julia Hornack. At this time, I will turn the event over to Ms. Hornack. Julia Hornack : Thank you, Leanne, and welcome all to our second quarter remote investor event. As we announced in May, our quarterly investor events will now begin with a 30-minute presentation and be broadcast via live webcast. Today\u2019s presentation topic is vehicle technology and shared mobility\u2019s influence on the auto insurance industry. The presentation will last approximately 30 minutes and be followed by Q&A with our CEO, Tricia Griffith; our CFO, John Sauerland; our guest speaker today, John Curtiss, our Personal Auto Product Development Leader; and Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer will also be joining us by phone. The event is scheduled to last 90 minutes. As always discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during the event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the risks, uncertainties and other challenges we face. These documents can be found via the investor page of our website, progressive.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce to you all our CEO, Tricia Griffith. Tricia Griffith : Good morning and welcome again. We made the changes to this quarterly webcast for a couple of reasons. One, to give you some deeper insights into topics that we think are of interest to you, and two, to highlight talent within Progressive that you\u2019ll get to see more often, on a more frequent occasion than once a year as prior. We welcome feedback and we hope you enjoy the webcast. Let me set the stage a little bit. Four years ago in 2013, John Curtiss gave a deep dive into what was going on in the industry, from a trend perspective, a vehicle technology perspective, and we believe now is the right time to do another deep dive, and more importantly how we think about our opportunities as this dynamic environment continues to change. So John is going to give a deep dive into that. We will focus today primarily on auto. And the question that we ask at Progressive, really almost on a daily basis, is are we able to profitably grow in the industry? What does the market look like? And what is our opportunity? And we believe the answer to all of those are yes, and great, we feel very comfortable and excited about our opportunities to grow within this industry. On the charts today that you see, the trend line shows a 30 year trend for the long-term view. And with inside each of the charts, you\u2019ll see the short-term view, which will be based on the last time we spoke, so the last four years. So you\u2019ll see the difference in the long term and short term trend in all four of the charts. Let\u2019s start with the top left-hand chart, and that\u2019s really the revenue opportunity in the private passenger auto market. And as you can see from both a long-term trend and a short-term trend, there continues to be opportunities. Specifically in the short term trend, you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s been an increase in the private passenger auto market of over 4% in the last four years. So that acceleration has really allowed us to continue and accelerate our growth at Progressive. Of course there\u2019s a lot of inputs to why the market grows. So if you go to the top right hand chart, you\u2019ll see the number of vehicles in the United States. And as you can see, on both the short and long term, that trend continues to go up. And of course, it fluctuates based on what\u2019s happening in the economy and took a little bit of a dive after the financial crisis, but then has continued to increase. And we follow those trends but clearly it continues to go up, a little bit over 1%, both long and short term. The charts below are what we think about every day, and that is severity and frequency. The severity has continued to go up again, both long term and short term. You\u2019ll see in the short-term box in the last four years, severity has gone up about 0.5 points higher than the long-term. And we see that based on cars having more technology and the cost of repairs and also medical costs are growing at a rate much higher than inflation. So we\u2019re able to price those severity trends into our indication. Frequency, on a 30 year basis, has gradually declined. And you can see that continues about 0.7% per year in the last 30 years. If I took that chart back another 20 years, you would see the same thing, frequency just gradually declining. Oddly enough, in the last four years, frequency has popped up. And those trends are largely based on macroeconomic information, and we don\u2019t usually price those into our indications but we watch those and react to those. So that\u2019s sort of setting the stage of where we\u2019re at. We believe that at Progressive we have a huge opportunity for more growth, and the fact that the market has continued to grow is even better in terms of our ability to grow. What you see here is our combined ratio compared to the industries in our market share. Let\u2019s start with the orange line, which is our statutory combined ratio for the last 20 years. As you know, one of our objective is to make sure that we make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit of every dollar that comes in. As you can see, we take that very seriously. So over the last 20 years, only one year, the year 2000 did we go over 100. There was a few years we went over 96, but we take it very seriously, our commitment to try to make at least $0.04. So the majority of those 20 years, we have been under 96 combined ratio. The dotted line is the industry, and you can see the industry tracks our results, but in every year there has been a gap. And in fact, in the last several years, the gap has widened. So we\u2019re excited about that. The blue line is our market share. That\u2019s the other half of the formula, grow as fast as you can at a 96 calendar year combined ratio. As you can see, we\u2019ve taken advantage of our position in the market in the last several years and have continued to increase our market share. So we\u2019re very pleased with our discipline around our number one objective to grow as fast as we can at a 96 combined ratio. This chart gives you an overview of the entire property casualty industry. So the pies, the white pies are the revenue opportunities within each one of those segments. And the blue is the Progressive sliver of market share. For today, like I said, we\u2019re going to focus the majority of our time on private passenger auto. So if you follow the pie out to personal lines and then to auto, you\u2019ll see we\u2019ll talk about that $250 billion opportunity, of which we have less than 10%. So again our position is great but we have so much more runway. And we feel that way for a couple of reasons. One, the fact that we are able to now bundle our auto with home, which we know and has been proven, that extends our auto PLE. We have a great brand, a great product on the street. So we feel very positive in our ability to continue to gain more pieces of each of those pies. I\u2019ll come back to this chart at the end and talk a little bit about the other areas, specifically home and commercial. During the quarterly conference call, the last quarterly conference call, I talked very briefly about how me and my team look at investing over the short and long term. And I referred to those as Horizons. And it\u2019s a construct that McKinsey developed many years ago, and we\u2019re using that to figure out and place bets on investments, short, medium and long term. So let\u2019s start with the here and now, and that is what we call our Execute Horizon. This is really about surgically executing on the plan we\u2019ve put into place in the last couple of years. You\u2019ve heard us talk about it with the Destination Era, with bundling auto and home. And it really aligns with our vision to become consumers\u2019 number one choice and destination for auto and other insurance. So when we think about big investments we\u2019ve made to make sure that we continue to grow, on the agency side, clearly the acquisition of ASI was huge. It gave us access to those agency customers that we did not have access to before. Also we\u2019re investing in agents, not just on the technology side, but also on the commission side. So we\u2019ve just rolled out a new commission structure we call Paths to Partnership. And we are giving agents that give us more of their preferred business, their longer retaining business more compensation. So we\u2019re excited about that, and the agents are excited about that as well. On the direct side, I stood here probably 4 years ago and talked about our in-house agency. We call it the Progressive Advantage Agency. At that time, we had 25 consultants in the agency and they would help our current auto customers with home products, whether it was ASI or one of our many other unaffiliated partners. Well, we had to invest more in that area. Now we sit at almost 400 consultants, and we are so glad that we invested in that in-house agency because we believe there\u2019s a lot more opportunities to sell even more products and to be able to service those customers. As I wrote about in the annual -- in the letter to shareholders, we just invested in what we called HomeQuote Explorer. And this really aligns with our ability to provide service and coverage where, when and how our customers need. Many customers want to be able to shop for home online or on their mobile device, and we make this easy. And if you go through the process, it can be really clunky and there\u2019s a lot of data that people might not know, we are able to purchase publicly verified data, put it into the system, have a really slick quoting machine. So really, we are able to invest across the board on how customers want to shop for home and then of course, align that with bundling with the auto. So we\u2019re excited about where we are with the Execute plan. We believe that we have a lot of runway for the next many years, 5, 10 years. But with that, we need to continue to invest in the future. The second horizon we call Expand. And that is really focusing on our core competencies. So think of segmentation, of service, our brand, our cost structure. And we\u2019ll start to invest in adjacent products. So think of what John Barbagallo talked about in the October Investor Relations conference with our business owner\u2019s policy. So that bought coverage for that small business commercial person. So we plan to invest on that on both the agency and the direct side. But we\u2019re going to be looking at this horizon to -- much more deeply to see what are other areas where we can use our core skills and really leverage them. And the last horizon is Explore, and that is really longer term, but we know we need to invest now because we\u2019ll have learnings and technology will evolve, and needs of our customers will evolve. So that to us is a really important place that a lot of times, people don\u2019t take or companies don\u2019t take the time to invest and we\u2019re going to do that. These will be based on increasing the products and services that we have, maybe in a slightly different way, or possibly having products and services that don\u2019t even exist today. And to me this is really an important part of our investing strategy. We need to invest in all three Horizons concurrently. And that\u2019s how you continue to have an enduring business. And we\u2019re excited about our plans in each one of these Horizons. The best way to show you how we think about it is through one of our own products, and that is Snapshot. I\u2019m going to talk through the evolution of Snapshot and I\u2019ll be using different nomenclature because as Snapshot evolved and technology evolved, how we branded evolved as well. So 20 years ago in 1997, we rolled out Autograph to 600 customers in Houston. As you can see, this is in the trunk of a car; it was clunky, it was big, it was expensive. Whenever I look at this photo, I think of my 8-track cassette player in my AMC Pacer, which was my car when I was 16, and I was actually way before \u201897. But what we learned here, even though it wasn\u2019t a commercially viable product, we learned that individuals\u2019 driving behavior varies significantly. So we saw something on usage-based insurance 20 years ago, way before the technology was there. Tested a lot more and fast forward to 2004. We rolled out TripSense, a much better solution. So we had the dongle that you would plug into your on-board diagnostic port. What we would do is we would send you the dongle in a box with the cord. And we\u2019d ask you to plug that in, in your OBD port, and then 6 months later, try to find the box, hopefully you found the cord, plug it in and upload that data to Progressive. While that was much better than Autograph, it still wasn\u2019t easy for customers. Sometimes they lost the box, sometimes they forgot to plug it in, sometimes they lost the cord. But again, we didn\u2019t want to kill this idea because we knew there was something in this. So we continued to learn. In 2008 we rolled out something we called MyRate. And this was so much easier, because you can plug the device into the OBD port and we can wirelessly transmit the data to Progressive to learn about your individual driving behavior. So we knew we had something here. During this stage, we continued to test things like do we give a discount or a surcharge? And we learned a lot more. And in 2010, we felt great about having a commercially viable product. And so we repackaged it, renamed it to Snapshot and in 2011, we were able to advertise and market our Snapshot model. And over 20 billion miles later, we\u2019re very happy that we invested all along the way. In December of last year, and I\u2019ve talked about this a lot of recently, we rolled out what we call our mobile as a device unit. So you have the option to have the Snapshot dongle or have the mobile app on your phone. We have a mobile app in 26 states on the direct side and five states in the agency side, with many more planned actually during August. Again, we continue to learn as we evolve and technology evolves, and we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re learning from the mobile app. And there will be more to come on that, but I can tell you it varies wildly, depending on how people use their phone from no usage at all to great usage. And we\u2019re learning about how people use their phones, handheld apps, handheld phone, hands-free. So all of that will again further our expertise in our segmentation. As of June month end, we had nearly 30 million miles of data and nearly 3 million trips. So we\u2019re learning a lot and learning it quickly. Ultimately, you want to be able to have the cars talk to us directly. And we\u2019ve talked about this in the past and we have a relationship with GM and their OnStar program to be able to acquire customers directly from GM based on their experience and the OnStar app uploading it to us and being able to provide them a quote. So we\u2019re excited about that continued relationship and we continue to learn. This is a great example of us investing a long time ago and continuing to iterate because we saw something in it. Will everything work that we now are thinking about investing and are investing in horizon 3? No, but we knew then we have something special. And that is really the point about making sure you can currently invest in every horizon because our goal is to make sure Progressive is an enduring business for 20, 40, 80 years to come. And so we\u2019re excited about that. But now to the main part of the show, and I want John Curtiss to come up here and give you some deeper insights into what\u2019s going on in the industry since we last met. John? John Curtiss : Thank you. Thank you for having me today. So I plan to share our point of view on the growth outlook for the private passenger auto insurance market over the next 10 to 15 years. As you may recall, we stated back in 2015 that we fully expect to see real modest growth over the longer term in what was then approaching a $200 billion marketplace. In 2016, the industry was up to $215 billion in terms of direct written premium and we\u2019re off to a good start in terms of growth this year. So the question is what do we think that the next 10 to 15 years has in store for our business. And when we look at our models and when we have internal conversations, we continue to forecast modest levels of growth in real terms for the industry over this time period. So today I\u2019m going to share a little bit more about the 3 growth factors that Tricia discussed earlier, the fleet size, frequency and severity, and also how we\u2019re thinking about key trends such as vehicle technology and shared mobility. But before I talk about the future, I want to talk a little bit about the past and take a quick trip down memory lane. Because as Tricia pointed out, I presented on a similar topic back in 2013. And at that point in time, I shared our framework for how we were thinking about the effect that vehicle technology could have on accident frequency. And at that time and what you can see on the screen is headlines were full of pretty aggressive claims around the timing of self-driving cars. Google was predicting them within five years for ordinary consumers, and some auto manufacturers were making similar claims. So while these predictions have not yet come into fruition, our goal was to take really an analytical approach to the problem and try to figure out how to best respond. As Tricia pointed out, when you look at frequency, there is a long history of negative trend, and this is likely driven by factors such as having safer cars, you think about the introduction of the seatbelt, antilock brakes, electronic stability control, safer roads, safer infrastructure, tighter enforcement of drunk driving, graduated licensing programs and likely many others. So based on what at that time, what we were seeing in history as well as our understanding of these new technologies, their effectiveness and the fleet penetration rates, we were actually forecasting a continued decline in frequency in the future. But reality has been really different, and our models at that point were too conservative. Whether it\u2019s been from consumers driving more due to lower gas prices or an improved economy, or increases in distracted driving, frequency is actually increased over the last few years. So our models certainly aren\u2019t perfect, and I guarantee you the next time we give the update, they\u2019ll have changed again. But they are really helpful in that they guide our thinking. And I think what\u2019s really important is that we continue to take a very disciplined view of the key trends that will shape our industry going forward. The growth and the increased investment in vehicle technology and shared mobility models, personal transportation could evolve in a variety of directions. And we are thinking about the opportunities and considerations these various segments will create for Progressive. So let\u2019s talk about a few of the segments and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll expand over time with future updates. But we continue to focus pretty heavily on the lower left-hand quadrant, those are personally owned driver driven vehicles. So all of the cars that we own today. It\u2019s the majority of the fleet and as Tricia pointed out, our personal auto business is growing quickly and with less than 10% market share we feel really good about our growth prospects. We\u2019re also starting to make investments in the lower right-hand quadrant, we\u2019re referring to this as shared usage or shared ownership and driver driven. So the primary example here would be ride share. And while we estimate that this is still a pretty small segment of the overall vehicle mix, we do believe that it will continue to grow. And as you know, on the commercial line side, we do have a relationship with Uber and a pilot underway in the state of Texas, and on the personal line side, we\u2019re modifying our policy contract to include an endorsement to be able to insure the drivers of those vehicles. The autonomous segments you see in the upper row are currently a Horizon three focus for us. And we will continue to think about how to best attack these opportunities as we learn more. So next, let me talk about these key trends from a personal auto perspective in a little bit more detail and the impact that we think it will have on the fleet size, our frequency and our severity trends. Let\u2019s talk about the fleet size first. As Tricia pointed out, it\u2019s been growing at about 1.3% per year over the long-term and actually a little bit more quickly in recent years. If we break that down, we do see a steady increase in the number of licensed drivers in the United States and we believe that this will continue to grow as our population expands. We\u2019re also seeing a gradual increase in the number of registered vehicles per driver. And this is good news, not only in terms of growing the fleet size, but it also gives us indication that consumers are not giving up vehicle ownership. When we look at this from a generational perspective, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion around whether Millennials and future generations will have a different attitude towards car ownership. But a recent report by J.D. Power indicated that Millennials are now one of the fastest growing car buying segments in the United States, and a second report by Kelly Blue Book and Auto Trader indicated that within Generation Z, the future drivers of America, 92% indicated that they plan to own a vehicle. So as a result, we generally feel good that the vehicle fleet will continue to grow at a similar rate to historical levels. But we also acknowledge that some suggest that people will forgo vehicle ownership and move more toward shared mobility models. So we are tracking some indicators to see what changes are emerging. The first metric we\u2019ve been looking at is household vehicle ownership rate. This represents the percentage of households in the United States that indicate that they own at least 1 vehicle. This data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. And what it shows when we compare 2009 to 2015, which is the most recent year that we have data, that ownership -- that the ownership rate at the national level is unchanged at 91.1%. We also looked at the statistic for major metropolitan areas, because this is where we believe shared mobility is most viable. And what we do see is that in some metro areas, the ownership rate is higher, while in other metropolitan areas, it\u2019s slightly down. At this point, we\u2019re not seeing a consistent pattern and we\u2019re not seeing any dramatic decreases. If we do see an impact, we think it will be in the most urban areas of the United States, where the cost of vehicle ownership tends to be higher. But also keep in mind that in these areas, the aggregate vehicle ownership rate tends to be a little bit lower. So the overall impact to the entire fleet should be relatively small. We\u2019re also looking to see if there are changes in how consumers use their vehicles. The Census Bureau also tracks how people commute. And what the graph shows is that commuting patterns are largely unchanged during this time period. And in fact, the percentage of commuters driving alone in their own vehicles has actually slightly increased across all age groups. So our general view on shared mobility at this time is that the majority of consumers will use ride share and other types of services as a supplement to owning a vehicle but not necessarily as a substitute. But we do think that ride share and these new services will continue to grow and they will continue to compete with taxis, car rentals and other forms of public transportation. Taxi medallion prices have decreased by as much as 50% in certain cities. And in others, there\u2019s more Uber and Lyft drivers today than taxi drivers. Recent articles have also suggested that the growth in ride share is making it harder for some of the traditional car rental companies to grow. So who will ultimately win? We don\u2019t know. But for now, these vehicles will need to be insured and therefore do create new opportunities for us, primarily in the commercial side but also in our private passenger auto business. And as I mentioned earlier, we do have a relationship with Uber and a pilot underway in Texas, and we are making some changes to our product to be able to insure these drivers. So next, let me give a quick update on vehicle technology and the potential impact on claims frequency and severity. Probably similar to all of you, I receive many alerts on this topic every day, and the headlines have a wide range of predictions on how the future could unfold. I think some believe that with the continued advancement in technology, self-driving cars are right around the corner. While others believe it\u2019s going to be a long time to program a car to effectively drive in all the conditions and all the situations that are a reality on our roadways today. But one thing we know for certain is that investment levels are significantly growing, and whether or not we get to full autonomy, we will see more vehicles equipped with these safety technologies and it is really important for us to understand the implications on our business. From a product design perspective, from a pricing perspective and from a claims handling perspective. So let me give a quick update on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the evolution of these technologies, their effectiveness and fleet penetration. I\u2019ll start with the evolution. So the chart on the screen represents the standard format for how we think about levels of automation. They range from Level 0, which is no automation, all the way up to Level 5, and that would be your fully self-driving car. So let me touch briefly on what we\u2019re seeing at each level. Today we estimate that the vast majority, more than 95% of cars on our roads, are still at level 0. And what we are beginning to see is a gradual shift to Levels 1 and 2. Level 1 are your Driver Assist technologies. Examples of this would be auto braking or lane keeping technologies. These were first introduced back in 2006, and we estimate currently represent less than 5% of the fleet, probably closer to 1% to 2%. We do expect the mix of these vehicles to increase as auto manufacturers have agreed to make technologies like auto braking standard on new vehicles by 2022, and we\u2019ll talk a little bit about that in the coming slides. In terms of Level 2, this is Partial Automation, and this is also beginning to emerge. This was first introduced back in 2014, with Tesla and their Autopilot. And currently represents just a really small mix of the fleet, but we\u2019re paying close attention. We do know that General Motors is planning to introduce Super Cruise, which is a similar technology and that will be available likely later this fall on the Prestige package of their Cadillac CT6. What\u2019s common at these levels is the driver is always responsible for operating the vehicle and monitoring the environment, so really the key requirements for success are to have really good technology, and consumer demand or consumer willingness to pay. And what research does show is that consumers are getting more comfortable with these technologies, but they will turn them off if they find them distracting. So we\u2019re learning a lot more or want to learn a lot more around how consumers do interact with these technologies. But as you move to Level 3, Level 4, Level 5, the equation gets a lot more complex, as the driving system itself becomes responsible for monitoring the environment and operating the car. So with these levels, the deployment or the availability of these vehicles is going to be more than just about technology or consumer demand. It\u2019s also going to require changes to our regulations, our legal code and even how we think about insurance. As algorithms become more responsible for the operation of the vehicle, need to ensure that there\u2019s mechanisms in place to ensure data privacy and security. And some of these levels could require capabilities, like vehicle to vehicle or vehicle to infrastructure, which would be a significant investment. So today, what we\u2019re primarily seeing here is the testing of these vehicles. And I think we\u2019ll continue to see more testing over time, but they are not yet available for commercial sale. So just quickly at Level 3, this is Conditional Automation. Audi has recently announced plans on their A8 model to introduce a product called Traffic Jam Assist. And the way a technology like this would work is under 60 kilometers per hour on a divided highway, the vehicle could operate in autonomous mode. But outside of that mode, the driver has to be ready to take over and ensure the safe operation of the vehicle. So really the challenge at this level is how do we keep the driver engaged and how do auto manufacturers make sure that there\u2019s an effective handoff between driver and vehicle. And I think what we\u2019ll see at this level from what we\u2019ve been reading about is that some auto manufacturers will pursue this level, while others might get straight to Level 4 because of some of the risks inherent with that driver vehicle handoff. So Level 4, this is High Automation. So an example of this would be the ability to drive autonomously in highway mode. And what we do here is that auto manufacturers like Honda, Toyota, Volvo, are working to be able to introduce this type of technology in the early 2020s, maybe even earlier according to Tesla. And then Level 5 finally, is the Fully Autonomous vehicle, and I don\u2019t have specific dates on this level. Given the cost and the complexity of the technology, our current point of view is that the first applications of these types of vehicles might be in commercial settings, or maybe in ride share or self-driving taxis where the vehicles are confined to specific geofenced locations. So next, let me turn to effectiveness, and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about frequency first. The information on this chart is from the Highway Loss Data Institute, also known as HLDI. And basically what it shows is the change in frequency for four of these new technologies. And what we\u2019re seeing and this is very similar to our last update is that certain technologies such as auto braking and even blind spot warning do show really good evidence for reducing frequency. But one of the things that you\u2019ll notice is that the impact does vary by coverage. For example, the decrease in frequency is more significant in property damage than a coverage like collision. And I\u2019m showing these two coverages because this is where the industry tends to have the most credible information. But I do think you could also argue that we\u2019re going to see a more significant reduction in an injury coverage, like bodily injury than a coverage like comprehensive. So still a lot to learn about the effect these technologies will have on the coverages that we write for insurers. Why is that? And why do we think that it could be different? And let me take auto brake as an example. This technology was designed to prevent largely rear-end accidents. And so when you look at a coverage like property damage, so this would be the vehicle that would actually be hit in an accident, a high percentage of the claims involve damage to the rear end or the side of the vehicle. And these are the exact type of accidents that this technology was designed to prevent. When you look at a coverage like collision, which would be the vehicle causing the accident, while a good percentage of the damage to those vehicles involves the front of the vehicle, it also includes scenarios such as backing into a pole or sliding off the road because of ice. And in these types of situations, the technology will not be as effective in preventing the accident. So therefore the impact might be lower. The other thing that I would just highlight is these technologies are often sold in packages. And so one of the challenges is to understand the effectiveness of each individual technology. And they might not be additive because they might be helping to avoid the same types of accidents. So we\u2019re working really hard not only with our own data, information from HLDI, but we\u2019re also working with third-party data to really try to understand the specific technologies that are on vehicles and which ones show the most promise in reducing frequency so we can incorporate them into our pricing. So next, let me talk a little bit about severity. And before I get into the details, I do want to highlight that some of this data is not credible and those cells have been marked with an asterisk. But where the data is credible, what we generally see is that severity is slightly higher on the damage coverages. And I think that makes sense. We would expect a higher cost to repair due to the additional technologies placed on the vehicle. When we look at some of the claims data, we are starting to observe above average inflation rates for replacement cameras, sensors and headlights. And we do think that more OEMs may actually begin to start to require scans to certify that these replacement parts are working properly. And that can add $200 to $300 for a claim. The other question that\u2019s out there is whether accidents will be less severe with vehicles equipped with these technologies, both on the damage side and on the injury side. And to be honest we don\u2019t have a good answer to that yet, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to have to further understand as we get more experience with writing and handling claims for these types of vehicles. So what are we doing? So today, we\u2019re making some pricing adjustments for certain technologies, like auto braking where we can confirm that the technology is on the vehicle. And we do have plans to implement a new product feature in future model releases that will allow us to expand our ability to segment for more technologies over time, as we get more data and we get more comfortable with the results of the data. So last, let me talk a little bit about penetration. And similar to our last update, we continue to see slower penetration for technologies such as Ford Collision Avoidance. When we compare them to prior technologies like electronic stability control or antilock brakes or even side impact airbags. I think when you compare these new technologies to the prior ones, they tend to be more complex because you\u2019re actually trying to design something that is going to steer a vehicle or potentially stop or accelerate a vehicle, therefore they are a little bit higher risk and more expensive. So therefore, they typically start out as optional features on luxury models or higher end trims. And it\u2019s actually taken well over 10 years for auto manufacturers to agree to make a technology like auto braking standard on new vehicles. And so as a result, the penetration curve starts out slowly, but in this case, will start to increase pretty rapidly as the technology does become standard on more cars. But it will still be quite some time until we get to a point where the fleet penetration rate is at 50%, much less full penetration. So how does that affect our frequency trend, because that\u2019s really the key input that goes into how we think about pricing. And so if these technologies continue to penetrate at historic rates, the impact on our annual frequency trend will be relatively gradual. And so let me give you a hypothetical example. Let\u2019s assume there\u2019s a technology that can ultimately reduce frequency by 15% when fully deployed. And based on our experience with prior technologies, it might penetrate the fleet by less than 5% in the first 10 years. Then ramp up close to 50% within 20 years, and ultimately approach 100%, let\u2019s say in 35, 40 or 45 years. So based on these assumptions, the impact to our annual trend would be relatively small, maybe 0.5% per year. And it would clearly vary based on where we are in the curve. So we spend a lot of time trying to understand not only the effectiveness of the technology but also the penetration rates. So a big question is, is what\u2019s going to happen in the future? And will future technologies penetrate the fleet more or less quickly? And there are really many considerations here. The first thing we have to look at is the fleet turnover rate in general. So the average age of the vehicle on the roads today is up to 11.6 years. And this is two years higher than the average back in 2002. So that will be one force at play, another one would be the pace of technological advancement, how quickly can auto manufacturers get either new technologies on cars, or find better ways to use the existing technologies in their fleet. Also the cost of the technology and consumer demand will continue to be very critical. I was reading an article the other day from a CEO for one of the auto manufacturers, that indicated that autonomous highway mode might initially start out as like a $10,000 enhancement. And so that could be a really good solution in the luxury car market. As an auto insurer, what we really track is how quickly will these types of technologies not only be available on these luxury models but also start to be available on the models where there\u2019s kind of the highest demand or represents the largest percentage of the fleet. So monitoring how quickly these technologies go from optional to standard is also a really significant consideration. And then lastly, as we talked about before is, as we move to Level 3 and Levels 4 and Levels 5, and the driving system starts to take over, there are all the issues around legal, regulations, how we approach insurance, data security and privacy, which will all be also considerations that we\u2019ll need to think about in terms of how quickly these technologies penetrate the fleet. So as we pull all this together, there are clearly many possible scenarios, and the level of certainty around our forecast decreases as we look farther into the future. And I also want to acknowledge that there have been periods of time, such as after 2006 when we went through the recession, where the industry did not grow in real terms. And this could happen again. Our models don\u2019t necessarily take into account hard markets and soft markets and changes in macroeconomic conditions. But based on the information that we discuss today and our internal discussions, we do see modest growth potential in real terms for the industry over the next 10 to 15 years. In terms of the fleet, our guess right now is we expect to continue to see slow growth with minimal impact from shared mobility except for maybe in the most urban areas of the United States. In terms of frequency, even though my predictions last time were off, I do think that these technologies will continue to gradually penetrate the fleet and put downward pressure on frequency trend over time. And generally with respect to severity, our current thinking is that trends will continue to outpace inflation. So the graph represents the range of outcomes as we look at scenarios, and we feel more comfortable with the dark shaded area than the light shaded area on the cone that you see in that graph. So in summary, I\u2019d also like to re-highlight some of the actions that we\u2019re taking in our personal auto business to address these trends. And in terms of pricing, we do continue to roll out our product and underwriting models and we\u2019re seeing good results. We\u2019ve begun taking some pricing actions for certain safety technologies. And as I mentioned earlier, we plan to introduce new product features that will allow us to expand our segmentation over time. We\u2019re also working a lot with external data, so we can try to collect more detailed information on vehicles, so we can better identify the specific technologies that are the most effective in terms of affecting our loss costs. We want to continue to lead in the UBI space. As Tricia mentioned, we\u2019re in the process of expanding our mobile product to more states. We are doing some work on distracted driving to see if there are new variables that we can include in our scoring algorithm. We\u2019re also testing ways to potentially provide better feedback to consumers, to help them become safer drivers. And we\u2019re evaluating ways to identify more third-party data opportunities so we can expand the footprint of our Snapshot product, because we understand how important that segmentation is to our results. We continue to roll out our endorsement to support the drivers who work for transportation network companies and perhaps most importantly, we want to be able to continue to stay nimble and agile so we can respond to opportunities as they arise. So that\u2019s all that I have for today. Thank you very much for your time. And now I will hand it back over to Tricia. Tricia Griffith : I\u2019m going to bring you back to this slide that we started with and that is really the opportunities in the overall P&C market. If you go to the pie underneath the $215 billion auto opportunity, we have about a $91 billion home opportunity, which of course is where we\u2019ve made a lot of our investments. And that auto home bundle is really important to our customers and the retention of those customers. So we\u2019re excited about the homeowners opportunity. It\u2019s $91 billion, as I said. From the captive agency, independent agency and direct, if you go just primarily to the areas where we have the most access, the independent agent and the direct channel, that\u2019s a $63 billion opportunity. So a lot of opportunity, we only have 1% of the property market. So together with that over $300 billion opportunity in the personal lines, we believe that we are very well situated to continue to grow. During the November session, the deep dive, we will talk to you about all things property so look forward to that. Underneath the Personal Lines, you see there\u2019s a lot of opportunity, actually another $300 billion opportunity on the commercial side. We are already the number 1 writer of commercial auto and that we have less than 8%. So again, we still have a lot of room for growth in that area. And as I talked about before, there are other opportunities on the commercial side that we will be investing in and talking about at a future date that we are really excited about for that small business commercial owner. So overall, when you step back and you look at the entire P&C industry, it\u2019s over a $0.5 trillion opportunity and we believe that we have the ability to really increase our share of the pie in every single one of those pie charts. And what we know from today and from what John talked about is that our industry is dynamic, it is going to continue to change. And that excites us. We love change and I think the companies that win are the companies that are nimble, that continue to tweak their models as things change and the companies that skate to where the puck is going. So we\u2019re excited about what we can bring to the growth and what we can bring to the long-term growth and enduring business of Progressive.  So thank you for today. And we\u2019re going to set up for Q&A, so just give us a few minutes. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Tricia Griffith : Thank you Leanne. We will begin with the questions submitted by webcast participants to give folks on the phone the opportunity to dial in and talk to the operator. The first question from the webcast is can you help us understand what\u2019s driving growth in the agency channel? Is it Platinum and The Robinsons? Or something else? Platinum is definitely a part of it. So we continue to increase our mix of preferred business. And Platinum although still a small part of it, but growing as I outlined in my letter is becoming a bigger part of it and we believe will continue to become a bigger part of it.  And that\u2019s the short answer. Really the longer answer when you step back is, during 2016 when rates were increasing and we had to increase rates as well. We didn\u2019t have to as much as our competition. So there was a lot of shopping in the agency channel. And so we saw stronger quoting and conversion from our agents. We also have a preferred product that we put on the street several years ago, we called it 8.3, we\u2019re now into our 8.4 model and we\u2019re seeing even better results from that. So continuing to understand that preferred customer and making sure we have the right rates for that customer. In addition, and we don\u2019t talk about this as often and I do with agents, agents really appreciate our ability to service our customers, both on the policy side and the claims side. And having that local presence is important to our agents. And they often refer to that when they talk to me about, well, when we think about the ultimate product, which of course is a claim, Progressive really has our mutual customers covered. So it\u2019s really a whole package of all of the things that kind of came together at one time to really position ourselves so well in the agency channel. And again if you want to, John, you are the king of 8.4 in the products, you want to kind of tell us a little bit about 8.4, which is on the street today? John Curtiss : Yes, we\u2019re feeling really good about our model results in both 8.3 and 8.4. In terms -- our loss ratios are looking really good. We\u2019re happy with the mix of business we\u2019re writing, and we are finding ways to develop our models quickly and get them deployed more quickly. So getting new segmentation to market has been a big initiative for us. And I think it\u2019s something that we\u2019re doing really well today. Tricia Griffith : Leanne, can you please introduce our first participant from the conference call line? Operator : Your first question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : My first question was just looking at your recent margins, so in June was the first time that you saw sequential improvement, meaning June versus May, in over 10 years and also the year-over-year improvement in your underlying loss.. [Technical Difficulty] Tricia Griffith : Elyse, we lost you after the year-over-year improvement. Elyse Greenspan : I\u2019m sorry. Yes, so the question was just tying back, you saw pretty strong year-over-year improvement in the underlying loss ratio, strongest of any month this year in June. Just about to get a little bit more color there, is it favorable loss trends, and how\u2019s the seasoning of the business that you wrote last year coming on? Tricia Griffith : It\u2019s definitely we\u2019re changing our mix. So that is something that we\u2019ve noticed and will continue, we believe as we write more and more preferred business. We also have some underwriting in terms of making sure that we get the right rate for each of our customers. Frequency, I talked about frequency during my presentation and that it has actually risen in the most recent timeframe. We\u2019ve actually seen a little bit of a decrease in frequency in the last couple of quarters. And so we believe that is part of the reason for our expanded margins as well. Elyse Greenspan : And then in terms of a couple questions on the homeowner\u2019s side. You provided on the slide that obviously shows, you guys have pretty low share at this time. Is there a market share goal as you expand on the homeowner side that you guys have in mind? And just secondly, tied to the homeowner side, if you can just give us an update on your property catastrophe reinsurance coverage and if there were any significant changes made this year versus last year? Tricia Griffith : Yes, and I\u2019ll ask Trevor to come up a little bit to talk more deeply about the reinsurance side. So we want to do the same thing in home as we do in auto, grow as fast as we can with our target margin. So the first thing we had to do was get our sales force intact. So I talked about that about a year ago that we were aligning our sales force from ASI and Progressive to make sure we service those agents that have both home and auto, or monoline auto. And that has been resolved, it\u2019s really got a great momentum so we\u2019re excited about that. The other part was really expanding into many states. So we\u2019re in 41 states now with ASI or Progressive Home, and we\u2019ll continue obviously to have more offering in that -- in many states and with many more agents. So our goal is to again, grow as fast as we can on the home side, as long as we make our target margins. We obviously want to have that bundle customer because we know they last longer. And that\u2019s really important to us. And we\u2019re excited and we work hand-in-glove with the product folks at ASI to make sure that we have the right products on the street as well as the right rate for the individual risks that we see. In terms of reinsurance, we did change \u2013 or added to, I should say, our reinsurance plan in 2017 with our aggregate stop-loss agreement. And that is really $200 million worth of coverage, when our loss plus LE on a accident year ratio goes over 63 and that doesn\u2019t include liability or name storm. So that is something that is working as planned this year so far with our CATs. Trevor, you want to come up and talk a little bit more about the reinsurance plan? Trevor Hillier : Yes. So catastrophe program that we have outside of the aggregate stop-loss is very similar to previous years. We\u2019ve always liked to buy a program that can protect us for at least two one-in-a-hundred-year events in a given year, and this year is no different. We have multi-event structure, providing the coverage isn\u2019t exhausted in the first couple of events. We actually have coverage beyond just the first two. So our property CAT coverage is very similar to how it\u2019s been in years past. Julia Hornack : Thanks, Trevor. Leanne, I\u2019m going to take a question now from the webcast. Given the continued contribution growth from homeowners, which presumably operates with a lower target combined ratio, will the company gradually move towards accepting a higher level of target combined ratio within the residual personal auto book? Tricia Griffith : We\u2019ve been very clear about both our calendar year combined ratio goals as well as our lifetime combined ratio goals of 96. So we look at all of our products as an amalgam of how we want to be priced. So we will try to write as much business as we can. And we will write at -- not one is necessarily 96, we\u2019ll write at different coverages as long as we are writing at or below our targets that we know to reach our goals. So obviously, we don\u2019t make those public, but we will try to get the more preferred bundle long-term customers. But again, we won\u2019t do that if we compromise our target margins. Leanne, can we take the next caller from the conference line please. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : A couple of questions here. First, just quickly on the commercial auto side. What is loss trend looking like there? You mentioned that you still have about 9% rate to come through. Is that well in excess of where trend is going right now? Tricia Griffith : Loss rate has been favorable. Again that\u2019s a much more volatile coverage. And so as we saw last year, especially in the summer, that can be more volatile. So we believe we have the right amount of rates still to earn in, but we\u2019re feeling good about the margins that we have now. And again, we like that because it really is more of a volatile business. But we feel good about our position right now. Brian Meredith : Right. So does that mean that there could be more margin expansion to come? Tricia Griffith : I can\u2019t predict the future. And again it\u2019s a volatile business. We think we have the right rates earning in and of course that earns in a little bit slower than our auto book because it\u2019s a yearly basis. But we feel good. Again, we\u2019re always cautious because it is more of a volatile business. Brian Meredith : Got you. And then wondering if you can just explain a little bit the severity that you\u2019re seeing on the auto property damage. And I know you mentioned it\u2019s because of claims clovers in the inventory and the pace. What\u2019s happening there that causes that increased severity? And does it also have an impact on your loss ratios? Or is it just a paid number? Tricia Griffith : It has an impact, we\u2019re just seeing severity go up. And we believe overall, and then Gary I can have you come up and give some deeper insights because you study this on a daily basis. But yes, we\u2019re seeing severity on the property damage side. And we do believe it is because of higher cost in terms of the technology in vehicles. And we continue to watch that. And especially the fleet is different than our average fleet has been historically as well. Do you want to mention anything on severity, specifically? Brian Meredith : [Indiscernible] but it popped up in the second, in the first half it\u2019s popped up a fair amount. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking. Gary Traicoff : This is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. To your point, in the first half of the year, PD severity is up about 6% to 6.5%, and on a trailing 12-month basis, were more around a 5%. To Tricia\u2019s point, we are seeing an increase with the technology, and on an accident year basis, we\u2019re probably closer to that 4% to 5%. The reason it booked up a little bit more, is we had a little bit of backlog on some closures related to what we would call inbound segregation. And those claims tend to settle at a little bit higher amount. So probably 1 point to 1.5 points is because of that closure catch-up. And we would say the long term rate is probably more around a 4% to 5%. Tricia Griffith : Leanne, can we take another call from the conference call line please? Operator : Your next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : I have one big question and one small one. I guess, Tricia, when we look at the market share numbers that you have, and here I\u2019m thinking mostly of the non-auto lines, is the target there for Progressive to be the underwriter of the complement of your market share? Or would you be comfortable serving that through Progressive\u2019s Agency -- I\u2019m sorry, the Progressive Advantage Agency? Tricia Griffith : We\u2019re -- it depends, is the answer. So there is a big opportunity in those charts I showed in the Commercial Lines area. So John Barbagallo and I talk frequently about what\u2019s the right thing to do for Progressive and our customers. And the odds are we\u2019ll do a little bit of both. But when we feel like it can benefit and help with retention for our commercial auto customers, we won\u2019t necessarily have to underwrite it. So we might do things differently, maybe not unlike we did on the auto side. So on the auto side, we have ASI and our agency brand and it\u2019s the only home product we write and we underwrite that. And on our Direct Side we have 9 or 10 brands that we work with. The majority of them are unaffiliated and then we have under -- ASI as one of them. We will likely do the same and have been doing a little bit of that on the commercial side. So think of it almost as the commercial destination. So what makes most sense for us on the long term and when we feel like it\u2019s more important for us to underwrite it, we absolutely will. But we also are very intrigued with working with more and more partners. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then a question for John if I can. I\u2019m just curious about whether the people that are likely to be the earliest adopters of more capable cars, is their current accident propensity different from the driving population at large? John Curtiss : That\u2019s a really good question. And at this point we don\u2019t have enough data to distill what\u2019s being driven by the technology versus the people that are electing to drive those cars. So I think as we get more data and we try to control for all the various variables that we have in our products, we\u2019ll have a good insight into that. But I think it\u2019s a great question. But we have not been able to fully answer that, but it\u2019s something that we need to continue to think about. Julia Hornack : All right. We\u2019re going to take another question from the webcast. This next one is, year-to-date results have been very favorable relative to the 96 target and growth has been great. Do you have any desire to lower pricing and/or increase marketing spend dramatically to get back to a 96? Tricia Griffith : We have been increasing our marketing spend. We want to do that carefully because we want to make sure a couple of things. One, is it incremental? So when you increase marketing, you don\u2019t want to just increase it to increase, you want to have incremental sales. So, we look very closely at that when we increase our marketing spend. We have -- we did that in first quarter, we continue to increase our marketing spend in the second quarter. And we will continue that if we believe that it will produce incremental sales. And we look at that from, we have an acquisition cost we want for each customer, and as long as that cost per sale is lower than acquisition cost, and it\u2019s incremental, we will increase our marketing, again as long as we\u2019re under that 96. And we look for prices, we look at pricing across states, across DMA, et cetera and we lower prices when we believe it will bring in business and it follows the trend. Julia Hornack : Leanne, can you take the next caller please? Operator : Your next question is from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kai Pan : First question is when you\u2019re talking about these trends, do you see a difference between the 2 main channel, like independent agency as well as through your direct channel? Tricia Griffith : Yes, Kai, we see -- it would be in the aggregate level, we see differences between state mix, channel mix, customer mix. And that\u2019s how we really figure out how to set our targets for both new and renewal. So yes, we see differences. John Curtiss : Was the question around technology trends or... Kai Pan : Yes, more on the technology side. Tricia Griffith : Okay, got it. You know how to answer that? John Curtiss : I do not. I would say that the mix of the vehicles equipped with these technologies, as I said, is relatively small and it\u2019s starting to ramp up. So I do not know off the top of my head whether what we see in terms of differences between underwriting these vehicles by channel, that is not something we have spent a lot of time with yet. Tricia Griffith : Well, remember and John said this, the amount of vehicles with this technology in the fleet is a very, very small percentage. So we watch this closely but you want to have enough data to be able to really understand it. And so we follow that data all the time. And as soon as we can correlate that with loss costs, we\u2019ll be able to do that in both the channels and really every segment. But it\u2019s still a pretty small part of the fleet. Kai Pan : Great. And my follow-up question is about your sort of relationship with some of your partners, in terms of technology companies, or rather sort of like a shared mobility companies, do you feel them as long-term as a partner or as a competitor? Because some of them, especially car manufacturers as you said they might be collecting data themselves. I don\u2019t know in the future how do you see Progressive positioned? Tricia Griffith : I\u2019ll let you add to that with what \u2013 with the relationships you have, but I\u2019ll start with the answer. Kai, we see these as partnerships. And some might be long term, some might be short term. But we\u2019re working really well with a lot of the OEMs. And obviously the shared mobility. Just to understand the loss behavior, and it\u2019s very different from an Uber driver to getting the data from OnStar.  So that to us is just something that we\u2019ll continue to invest in. We know insurance and we know segmentation and we know pricing. And that is really something that we\u2019ve had as part of our signature talent for 80 years. And so we really bring a lot to the table for all the partners as they do with us. So we see that we\u2019ll continue to form more partnerships and more relationships as the technology continues to evolve. Julia Hornack : I think that\u2019s a good answer. John, do you have anything else to add? John Curtiss : I think that\u2019s good. Julia Hornack : Leanne, we\u2019ll take the next caller from the conference line please. Operator : Your next question is from [Josh Smith with TIA]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : My question is in regards to the long-standing 96 goal. Over the years you\u2019ve had many changes, you\u2019ve gone through an industry period where investment returns have gone down. You\u2019ve had talk of tax reform, which can move taxes. You\u2019ve had a massive product shift moving into more commercial lines and homeowners. And yet still we\u2019re with the 96. I\u2019m just wondering why are we still beholden to that number, what\u2019s the magic in the 96? Because where I look at it, you\u2019ve had tremendous growth this year coming in -- growth in EPS per share, earnings per share, and the stock has reacted very favorably. And it\u2019s just more bang for the buck from having a lower combined versus higher growth. So I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit to that. Tricia Griffith : You\u2019d have the perfect formula if you knew exactly where things would fall. If you had a crystal ball it might be differently. This is really something that is part of Progressive\u2019s culture. And so where there\u2019s no specific magic to a 96, it has been part of our objective for as long as I can remember from when Peter was CEO all the way through Glenn, and I don\u2019t intend to change it. Partly it\u2019s a discipline that we have to make sure that we stay true to our commitment to our owners, so we\u2019re going to make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit. And if we want to make more that\u2019s great, if we can make more where it\u2019s in the system. But we also want to grow, so it\u2019s always that balance. So for me if we wrote at a 94, but weren\u2019t able to grow as much or vice versa, that would be different. That\u2019s kind of the constant that we use to sort of anchor all of the other things that we do. And it really is something that everyone here understands and we\u2019re committed to. And it\u2019s part of really how we think about the opportunity. Obviously during times now where frequency is lower and/or changing mix, we were able to make at least $0.04 or more. I remember that is the actual objective is to make at least $0.04. So we\u2019re okay with making more but we don\u2019t want to limit our growth. Did you want to add anything on that? John Sauerland : I\u2019d just offer that it is about that discipline, for sure, but it has also resulted in really impressive ROEs over a really long time period. And yes, certainly interest rate environments change over time, and we haven\u2019t changed that underwriting margin. But I think the formula\u2019s worked really well in terms of pretty consistent performance in terms of ROE, and also ensured that we have had adequate capital to continue to grow. When you\u2019re growing at a $3 billion clip and you\u2019re pricing leased auto to sort of a three-to-one premium to surplus rate, then you need pretty adequate incremental capital for subsequent years, so it\u2019s been a formula that\u2019s worked really, really well. And as Tricia said, there\u2019s no intent to change it. Operator : Your next question is from [Connie Debover with Boston and Company]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Just going back to one of the slides where you pointed out the combined ratio gap continued to widen between you and your industry peers, how much of that is driven by the fact that you were ahead in terms of your pricing expectations versus peers versus the management actions, whether it be on the underwriting/pricing side or points. Tricia Griffith : Great question, I think it\u2019s a little bit of everything. But we have talked for years about always trying to get ahead of trend. And we refer to it as small bites of the apple, just making sure we have the right increase on the streets because we know when you have to raise rates quickly to get profitable, that causes shopping, and it\u2019s happened to us. But last year was a perfect example of us getting ahead of it. We raised rates because we had to, but we didn\u2019t have to raise them at the same rate that our competition. And that\u2019s where you start to get a lot of shopping behavior and if you\u2019re positioned well, you\u2019re able to grow and grow profitably. We also do have a different model and going back to Josh\u2019s question in terms of that 96, we do want to make a bottom line underwriting profit and that\u2019s important to us as part of our objectives. And if you look across the industry, even with 2016 statutory results, you\u2019ll see that companies were able to grow, some companies were able to make money, but very few, Progressive being one of them, were able to grow and grow profitably. And so that part I think is really important because we always intend to be able to have that combined ratio under 96. So I think we look at our expense ratio, our cost structure\u2019s really important both on the expense ratio side as well as the loss adjustment side. So we want to continue to look at ways to be more efficient to be able to keep our rates competitive and grow. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And then my second question is if you can just remind me, excuse my ignorance. When you talk about the target margin for the homeowner side, what is the target? Tricia Griffith : We actually don\u2019t publicize our specific target margins per product. So like we said, it\u2019s an amalgam, our 96 is an amalgam of every product, every state, every mix and then of course we have different targets for new and renewal business, based on the fact that we have acquisition costs that are different in each channel. John Sauerland : And we will vary those targets by product set over time, given what we think the market opportunity is. But again going into every year, we\u2019re projecting our growth formula renewal by product and ensuring that, we believe at least, we\u2019ll be hitting that calendar year 96 in the coming year. Julia Hornack : I\u2019m going to take another question from the webcast. When you say the severity of claims has gone up long-term, how does that break out in terms of injury, medical versus the auto repair? Could we get more color on how these subcomponents drive severity? And I have a feeling I\u2019m going to be stepping aside for Gary. Tricia Griffith : That\u2019s a complicated question. Gary, if you want to talk about long-term trends you\u2019ve seen from severity, that would be great. So a deeper dive into what I gave in terms of medical trends. Gary Traicoff : Sure. So Gary Traicoff again. In terms of, let\u2019s say short-term, like in the last year or so, both injury and property severity have been very similar, both around that 4% to 5% range. Medical, depending on the state, some have been a little bit more than that and some a little bit less. Over the long term, if we\u2019re talking more over 10, 20, 30 years, I think some of the stuff John showed, where trends are going up around there. Property for the most part has been more consistent. You\u2019ll generally see a little bit more volatility on the injury side. I think part of that comes into play when we have claims handling situations, et cetera. We know that medical costs are going up. But we don\u2019t necessarily see our trends mirror exactly where we see medical inflation at the same level. Tricia Griffith : And in this year and this quarter and year-to-date, one of the drivers of our severity has also been Michigan Peb. Gary Traicoff : That\u2019s correct. Tricia Griffith : That\u2019s been a bigger driver on that. Which is -- there\u2019s a lot of volatility in there just because of the nuances of Michigan. Julia Hornack : Leanne, we\u2019ll take a caller from the conference call line, please. Operator : Your next question is from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney. Bob Glasspiegel : I got a capital question here, debt to capital is at 27.3. It went up with the bond issue and so then came down with the retirement. And remind me where you want to be there, and where you want to be on a premiums to surplus basis and what your sort of excess capital position is today? Tricia Griffith : So we want to be less than 30% debt to capital, so we knew that would go up when we issued the $850 million bond, but we also knew the timing of -- to pay off the 6.7% bond that we had, the hybrid bond, so we knew that would pop up, we wanted to be less than 30%. From a capital perspective -- or you said premium surplus, premium surplus, 3:1 on Auto and about half of that amount for Home. On a capital basis, John alluded to this a little bit, but we have been really trying to use our capital to make sure that we continue to capitalize on our ability to grow in this environment. So the last 3 years, we\u2019ve really focused on making sure that we grow the business and that\u2019s our usage of capital. As we\u2019ve stated in the past, any under leverage capital we would use buy back shares or have a special dividend. Right now, we feel that we\u2019re putting our shareholders\u2019 money to the best use and that is growing the long-term business. So we\u2019re excited about that. Bob Glasspiegel : So I thought that a special dividend was unlikely for 2 years, post the Homeowners acquisition. We\u2019re sort of through that period. But the special dividend would not be likely just because you think there\u2019s better opportunities to grow the business, is that what you\u2019re saying? Tricia Griffith : At this point in time, we are focusing on using our capital to grow the business. And obviously, you know we have a variable dividend that year-to-date is fairly robust and it syncs up with our internal gain share program. And so we believe that shareholders, if it continues, will be very happy with that variable dividend. And right now, we believe we have the ability to continue to grow properly and that\u2019s the best use of our capital. Julia Hornack : I\u2019m going to take another question from the webcast. Does Progressive have a view on the ability/cost of retrofitting cars for safety-enhancing technologies such as auto braking or lane departure warning? Might the growth of retrofitting cars currently on the road change the pace at which these technologies penetrate the fleet and accelerate the downward trend of claims? And finally might Progressive or insurers encourage retrofitting via premium cost reductions? So we\u2019re really talking about accelerating penetration rates potentially. Tricia Griffith : I think that\u2019s really more of an answer to consumers. We have not seen many consumers take that option. And so for us, we will rate according to loss costs. We\u2019re a cost based business. And so for us that\u2019s an easy answer. We have not seen very rapid penetration for most consumers. And I think John sort of alluded to that when he talked about there\u2019s a very big difference in having a $10,000 package when you already have a luxury vehicle, versus the majority of the population who might already have a 5, 6, 7-year loan on their car are not necessarily going to purchase that. And you haven\u2019t seen much movement in that, have you? John Curtiss : We have not seen a lot of movement in aftermarket. It\u2019s probably more viable when we\u2019re trying to give warnings to the driver. When you start trying to do an aftermarket solution where you\u2019re trying to be able to operate the vehicle, to accelerate it or brake it. I think that what we\u2019re seeing is those types of aftermarket solutions will be held to the same standards, the same safety standards that the government is going to require for newer models. So from that perspective we have not seen a lot of movement there, and that\u2019s not something we\u2019ve been talking about offering to consumers. Tricia Griffith : Not at this juncture. Julia Hornack : All right. I\u2019ll take another question from the webcast. [Operator Instructions] The question is, can you give more details on Paths to Partnership commission program? How much more commissions do agents get and how is the annual bonus structured? Tricia Griffith : I don\u2019t have all the specific details, but basically how we look at it is more of a zero sum game in terms of the commission we\u2019ve been paying overall. But we\u2019re giving higher commission to those agents who want to put their longer-retaining preferred business with us. And you have an option as well if you don\u2019t have a lot of customers but you want to work with Progressive, you have an option to have enough growth in those segments to get into the different levels of Paths to Partnership. We\u2019ll give you some details on that, likely in a future meeting, but it\u2019s pretty structured in terms of how much you write and the bonuses kind of fall into that, not unlike the Platinum Program. John Sauerland : And if the follow-on question is about overall impact on cost structure, I would expect it to be, obviously self-fulfilling, the more successful it is the higher commissions we\u2019ll pay, but in the near term it would have a very small impact on our expense ratio. And at the same time we\u2019ve been working to reduce our non-acquisition expense ratio which excludes both commission as well as advertising costs. So net, I think we would expect our expense ratio to continue to be extremely competitive in the marketplace even with this enhanced commission program. Tricia Griffith : And we just started rolling this out and it\u2019ll take throughout this year to continue to roll it out to all of our agents. Julia Hornack : Another one from the webcast. Can you please comment on competition versus mutual insurers? They have a lower profit goal, it seems, and often write at an underwriting loss. As interest rates increase and net investment income improves do you believe they\u2019ll get more competitive? And finally -- I\u2019ll let you do that first and then I\u2019ll ask the follow up. Tricia Griffith : I mean I think obviously everybody has their own operating objectives. And so we really try to surgically focus on our objective to grow as fast as we can at a 96 as long as we can serve our customers. And so we\u2019re obviously a little bit more conservative on the investment side because we want to make sure that we take care of our customers on the underwriting side. And that\u2019s worked for us. It\u2019s worked for us for a long time frame. And although some of our competition fall through in the mutual company, how they decide to operate is really in a very different structure. So we tried to focus really surgically on how to best profitably grow Progressive. Julia Hornack : I lost my question, sorry. Finally, and you may have answered that, how much of an expense ratio and pricing advantage does Progressive need to have versus mutual insurers to remain competitive? Tricia Griffith : I mean for us, we always try to figure out ways to be more efficient, period. And we look at that on the expense ratio that John just talked about, less advertising costs and commission cost, and so we look at what we call non-acquisition expense ratio, so think a lot of the call centers where we sell and service, and we always try to figure out how can we be more efficient, how can we continue to serve the customers. We monitor why customers are calling in. Can we be more communicative so they get the answers they want to? On the Claims side, loss adjustment expense is hugely important and we have in the past 10 years continued to decline in LAE based on becoming more and more efficient. And Mike Sieger and his team continue to look at ways to become more efficient in the claims organization. So both of those things are really important. We believe the key to the companies that grow and grow profitably and are able to do both have a competitive cost structure, because then you can take that cost structure and have it into your competitive prices and naturally, those are really the players that win on a long-term basis. John Sauerland : To that I would offer that cost structure and expected margin is one component of the whole. Certainly brand and experience, when, where and how customers want to work with their insurance company, matter a lot as well. So yes, the price which is driven by everything you mentioned is important, but that\u2019s a part of the formula and we think our brand and experience are pretty powerful in the marketplace and are a big part of the formula as well. Tricia Griffith : And what I talked about during my portion of the presentation, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to invest. So we see those as being mutually exclusive. To not being -- so to us, it\u2019s really about you have to be making investments in the future as well, and we understand that. And we think we have a really good balance there. Julia Hornack : I have one more question from the webcast. The question is, I\u2019m going to reword it a little bit because I\u2019ve had a moment to think about it. So the question is, where are you in penetration of preferred agents for homeowners, number today, opportunity over the next three years? I think what they are really getting at is the appointment of Platinum agents, how many we\u2019ve actually appointed compared to maybe the potential number of preferred agents out in the market. Tricia Griffith : We have about 2,000 Platinum agents. And think of our overall independent agent channel, we have about 35,000. So we continue to grow as we broadened our coverage across the country. Remember, our Platinum agents, we want to be number one or number two when they think of the preferred customers that come into their shop. So not every one of our independent agents necessarily have customers that have a home to insure. So that limits it. We\u2019ve also very specifically rolled out the Platinum model, more of a scarcity model to have it with fewer agents, because it is more complicated and it is something that is special to have, both those Auto and Home product. We also have what we call PHA Agents, Progressive Home Advantage agents, so they\u2019re not necessarily Platinum but they have our ASI Home product as well. It continues to grow. And I think that\u2019s the most exciting part when I think about the Destination Era and I think about that over $300 billion opportunity on the personal lines side, we\u2019ve really just touched the surface with Progressive and ASI in terms of Home. And so those are where we really made the big investments that I talked about, on the commission schedule, acquisition of ASI, our in-house agency as well as our HomeQuote Explorer. So we feel like this is like the precipice of really gaining more and more market share in homeowners. And with that we will absolutely be appointing many more agents. Julia Hornack : And along those same lines, actually from the webcast, we have a question about the Robinsons. A lot of Robinsons are with insurers in the captive agency channel, namely State Farm and Allstate. Is there a differentiated strategy to go after that sub-segment versus the independent agency channel Robinsons? Tricia Griffith : I talked about the $91 billion opportunity in that home market and $63 billion of it being in places where we already have access, so direct to NAI. That\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t get plenty of people that shop from the captive agencies. And that\u2019s really one of the reasons why we did invest in this. So while we don\u2019t necessarily go out to those people particularly, we believe because of our brand and because we are available where, when and how people want to shop, we will ultimately get a lot of customers from the captive agency as well. So while it\u2019s not a strategy, we want every customer we can. And we believe they\u2019ll be shopping because we\u2019ve made it easier. John Sauerland : And I would add, in this environment where rates and some lines have been inadequate and preferred companies are raising rates fairly aggressively, we\u2019re seeing more preferred shoppers coming into marketplace across channels. So captive IAs as well as direct. Julia Hornack : Great. Well, that would appear to have been our final question. So we look forward to seeing you all in November. And that concludes our event today. I\u2019m going to hand it back over to Leanne for the closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation\u2019s Second Quarter Investor Event. An instant replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive\u2019s website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you, Brian and welcome to our Third Quarter Investor Event. Today we will begin with an update on our efforts to penetrate the home auto bundle market. Our presentation will last approximately 40 minutes and will be followed by a Q&A session with our CEO, Tricia Griffith; our CFO, John Sauerland; and our guest speaker today, Heather Day, Preferred Marketing Process Leader. For Q&A, Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer will join us by phone. As always discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during the event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the investors page of our website, progressive.com. And with that it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith. Tricia Griffith : Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's Third Quarter Webcast. Before we get started at the topic at hand, I wanted to reflect a little bit about the last quarter, specifically with Harvey and Irma, two names I think all of us are very familiar with based on this very, very active hurricane season. As you know from my letter, several of us went down to both Florida and Texas just to get some insights into how our employees are doing, do they have the right resources to help our customers and get some insights into our customers and what they need from us. This year, at this CAT season, we took down one of our internal videographers just to capture some of the moments and really to have everyone at the company understand not only what happens in a CAT but how we react, which is so important and so critical to our customers. So we captured this a couple of minute video, mostly internally because although we had our CAT team available in both of those states and almost 1,300 reservists from around the country, not everybody at Progressive gets the insight of how we really handle CATs and to us, that is really something we find very important, both for our employees and customers. So I'd like to share that around two-minute video with you for you to get some insight into our culture and the importance of making sure we take care of our customers in their greatest time of need. [Presentation] As always, I'm very impressed with our response, both on the Progressive and the ASI side. And we know customers want us to be out there quickly, and we're known for our speed and that's why we take so much time to really understand all the customers, all what they need during a catastrophe. And more importantly, they want to make sure that they are taken care of and that their claims are resolved quickly and accurately. And as you can tell from our closure rate, and a very impressive closure rate, we were able to do that. When we take care of our customers during this time of need, they end up rewarding us with staying and we are starting to see that with our retention results. So again, I am so proud of all the employees at both ASI and Progressive of how they have handled both those of these and I know whatever is to come, we will be able to handle that in an exemplary fashion. Let's get to the topic at hand. So last time we met, we talked about the addressable market and specifically the first component, the private passenger auto section of the personal lines market. We talked about the fact that there's a $215 billion opportunity, of which we have less than 10%. And when John Curtiss outlined what we call our runway project, we talked about the fleet size as well as frequency and severity trends and how that really excited us to understand the opportunity in the auto market. So we're not going to talk a lot about that today, but we're thrilled with our opportunity in the auto platform in terms of our product, our service on both the claims and CRM side, our retention and our brand. So putting all those components together, we feel very positive that we have a lot of opportunity on the auto side. Today our focus is going to be on the over $90 billion opportunity on the property side, the homeowner side, and that will really be the deep dive that Heather goes into. Again, we think having that bundle is really important, but that property piece and especially our relationship with ASI, continues to evolve, and that's what we're really excited about. So really the spoiler alert for the rest of the 30 minutes that we're going to talk is that we continue to be extraordinarily pleased with our acquisition of ASI. We originally went in with the acquisition to be able to get access to the preferred customers on the agency side. But as it has evolved, and we are working hand in glove with ASI, it has proven to be positive on both the agency side and the direct side. So Heather Day, our preferred marketing leader is going to come up and talk about what we've done to-date, the momentum we're building and how we're going to capitalize and capture more of that preferred customer. But before that, John Sauerland, our CFO is going to talk about the size of the opportunity, why we continue to be very pleased with the acquisition of ASI and how we structure our reinsurance in order to mitigate risk. And as you can see from the first quarter, that served us well with Irma. And then the three of us will come up for any questions you may have. So let's get started. John? John Sauerland : Thank you, Tricia. Good morning, everyone. The size of the opportunity for Progressive in the personal line space remains very large. We're very excited by the fact that we can now attract and retain virtually all personal lines customers, executing on our destination strategy. Most of you are familiar with how we segment the personal line space, but for those of you who aren't, let me spend a minute to review. We have four primary segments within personal lines, those are represented by the personas of Sam, Diane, the Wrights and the Robinsons. Sam isn't consistently insured, you can think of Sam on the nonstandard end of the spectrum. Diane, a renter, who is more consistent with her insurance consumption. The Wrights, homeowners, who don't bundle home and auto, and the Robinsons, who bundle home and auto. You can see on this slide, we've delineated the personalized market space across those four segments as well as the primary distribution channels in which they currently consume their insurance. As you can see, the Robinsons are over half of the personal lines marketplace. We've had some success penetrating the Robinsons segment, our growth year-on-year in terms of policies in force for households is 30%. We think we now have slightly less than 2% of Robinsons countrywide or around 0.75 million households. The predominance of the Robinsons in our current customer set, we have developed or as we say graduated. Meaning they started as a Sam, a Diane, or a Wright, and we have evolved them through their life to be a Robinson, bundling home and auto. Now today the new business, the new Robinsons coming into Progressive are a little more equal, 50-50, and that's driven predominantly by independent agents who are moving existing Robinsons to Progressive, but by and large our book is still made up of customers that we've graduated into that segment. I thought a real life example would be great to give you a perspective on how this journey evolves and the financial gains that this strategy brings. When I was Personal Lines President, thank you cards would go out to our customers under our name. On occasion I would get a response and I saved one because I thought it was a great example of a customer who was in a state, very young, who we could be their insurer for life. If our strategy was working, we could be their insurer for life. The customer's name is Adrian and the letter to me he sent to me is short enough that I will read it to you. \"My name is Adrian and I recently received a thank you card from you. I just wanted to write back and say that I really appreciated it, and the personal touch that Progressive puts on all that it does. I've had Progressive as my insurance provider since I purchased my first motorcycle as a teenager. Now 'all grown up' as they say, Progressive protects my car and their affiliates protect my apartment. I come from a marketing background so I understand the challenges involved with a big company trying to convey a personal touch. So again, I just wanted to let you know I appreciate it.\" Adrian was 25 years old when he sent me that letter in 2012. I looked into Adrian's situation with Progressive at that time, and Adrian did indeed purchase a motorcycle policy with us as his first policy with Progressive. Our records show he was actually 21 when he did so. He paid $142 for an annual motorcycle with Progressive, so less than $12 a month. What Adrian didn't share in his letter that he was that he was apparently living with his girlfriend Kathy at the time he sent the letter. Kathy also had an auto insurance policy through Progressive separate from Adrian's, at the same address and apartment number. She was also listed on that renters policy. So Adrian was clearly starting to grow up and finding some stability in life. Perhaps not coincidentally, Adrian also sold his motorcycle just around the time he and Kathy moved in together. Adrian and Kathy got married in 2013, so I've obviously follow through to see every couple of years where Adrian and Kathy stand. They have moved from one state to another, back to their original state. They have had multiple different vehicles, from a Ford Focus to a Lexus. And just in September this year, they purchased a home, went down to one vehicle and they insured that home through Progressive Advantage Agency, our in-house agency. The key perspective I wanted to bring here is that while Adrian started with us with a policy that cost him less than $12 a month, he and Kathy have now sent Progressive and our affiliates almost $20,000 cumulatively in premium over the past decade. If we didn't have renters insurance, would we have lost Adrian and Kathy at that point? If we didn't offer homeowners insurance, would we have lost them just a couple of months ago? My expectation is yes. We now have the products to keep Adrian and Kathy for life. My hope is that the next time I check in on the household there is a new addition. Maybe they are considering life insurance, maybe they have even already purchased life insurance through Progressive. We can be Adrian and Kathy's insurance company for life for the next multiple decades and that means a ton of premium for Progressive. So I hope that gives you perspective on the strategy and the benefits. Adrian and Kathy are direct customers with us. We've had a lot of success with Robinsons in the direct channel. What I'm sharing with you now is the share we believe we have within each distribution channel, here direct and independent agents. We think we have around 8.5% now of Robinsons who shop direct for their insurance. That's fantastic. We had 0, 10 years ago. We have had the luxury of working with multiple homeowners carriers, third parties, to meet the needs with our direct customers. In the independent agent channel, we haven't had that same level of success. We have a little less than 2% of Robinsons today in the independent agent channel. If you recall an earlier slide, the Robinsons within independent agents is a more than $50 billion segment. Direct is a little more than $20 billion. While we had an affiliate relationship that we use to bundle home and auto within the independent agent channel a number of years ago, that relationship did not work out in that channel. That carrier remains a key part of our direct efforts but it didn't work out for independent agents. We were very clear at that time that in order to penetrate that more than $50 billion segment, we needed a preferably monoline homeowner carrier focused on independent agents, one that had a great management team in place and one that was consistently profitable. I personally believed at that point in time, it might have been only one company that fit that bill and that was ASI. Monoline home carrier expanding across the country, focused on independent agents, great leadership team and a track record of very consistent and very robust profitability, combined ratios that on their own are impressive and relative to the industry, even more impressive. Now a key part of ASI strategy in terms of ensuring consistent profitability is a robust reinsurance program. We haven't talked a lot about that with you yet, so I'm going to take a little time on this slide to share the current aggregate stop-loss as well as named storm programs. For named storms, the ASI tower for our first event that hit Florida is about $1.6 billion. Now models will tell you different things around what the probability of a storm of that size impacting ASI's book to that level, I think it reasonable to think of that top of that tower as a 1 in 300-year event. The layers in this tower are not shown, do drop down in case of exhaustion of the layers below them, and the majority of the lower portion of this tower is reinstatable. Further, the reinstatement premiums on those layers are prepaid. So layers can drop-down and the majority of the lower layers here are reinstatable and the premium is prepaid. Retention, $50 million. As you know in September, Irma was more than $300 million incurred for our property business, we retained $50 million. The second tower here for a Florida event assumes a $1 billion event for the first event. The FHCF Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund is not reinstatable, so that would be not available for a second event, even given that fact, we have $1.2 billion available in the event of a second event and our retention is $50 million. This tower would also be reflective of a first event in a non-Florida State. There is yet coverage after the second event for a third event, and in this case we assume a $700 billion Florida event for the second event. You can see we have almost $700 million in coverage for that storm as well and we retained only $25 million in that case. Robust program for named storms. As the company has expanded across the country, we've recognized a need for aggregate coverage. Hailstorms can be very expensive for home carriers. Previously, the company employed a cash rebound with a $175 million annual aggregate retention, with $200 million above that. Starting in 2017, we employed an aggregate stop-loss agreement that has $200 million of coverage above a 63 loss plus ALA ratio excluding named storms and excluding liability claims. Today we have a little less than $100 million as recoverable on that ASL. That does not settle until year-end, so we will hopefully end up in a better place by year-end. But the point is the company has a very robust reinsurance program in place for both named storms and aggregate losses. We've gotten a question since we became a majority of ASI - majority owner in ASI, whether we will increase the retentions here. This kind of risk profile in terms of a reinsurance program is very similar to what the company had when we acquired them or the majority interest. The short answer to that question is today there's no plan to do so. We have three reasons behind that. First, our commitment to our calendar year 96 or better. The second is that when we look at the return on capital in the reinsurance space, we see levels of return that are below P&C in general and materially below Progressive's performance. Thirdly, when we look at the reinsurance pricing today, while we don't contend to know if it's accurate or adequate, we do recognize that today the pricing is half or less than what it was just 10 years ago. So it seems if we wanted to bring on more risk, retain more risk, this probably isn't the best time. Now we recognize that even with a robust reinsurance program, capital needs in property are higher than for auto. We've shared this perspective with you actually two years ago, when we acquired the majority interest. And this is simply to say even at premium to surplus levels, half of auto for property, if you target a lower combined ratio, you can hit great returns on capital, and that's what we do. Now this begs the question, if you're going to target a lower return for - a lower combined ratio for property, will you lower that 96 calendar year target or will you raise the target for your other business lines? Response to that question, I first offer the fact that property today is 4% to 5% of our premium. I also point out that when we set combined ratio targets by business unit, we do so at the new and renewal business level, we do so on a lifetime basis, we do so considering the returns on capital by line, and our expectations around growth for the coming year. What I'm sharing with you here is our current targets for our 5 major business units, as well as the standard deviation, plus or minus the standard deviation, one standard deviation range around that target. You can see all the targets are below the 96 and I will quickly admit that the deviation around the performance relative to the targets has a performance bias in it. We are consistently but not always below that target and that is intended. That is the construct that helps ensure that we are at or below that 96 calendar year every year. Now I understand that return on capital here is not the same thing as saying that our return on the investment in ASI has been robust, but I will say that we are diligent in reviewing our assumptions around the acquisition and the price we pay. So to-date, growth has been below our expectations, but I will quickly add to that, the growth to-date is far exceeding our expectations. The inception to date number is highly influenced by the fact that we lost a large client, early on, solely because Progressive took a majority interest. But as Heather will share with you in a moment, growth is robust, so we think we are getting the momentum in the growth here. When we look at our combined ratio versus our assumptions, we're slightly higher. But recognizing the period we're looking at, we have had three storm seasons and the past two in terms of hail, have been based on our vehicle experience, some of the most active hail seasons we've ever seen. And of course, we've now had two named storms hit the continental United States in 2017. We're comparing that against less than a three-year premium period, again our combined ratio inception to date is not hitting the target. It is not that far off and we're confident in the underlying profitability of the business. I hope you're getting the fact that we are very excited by the fact that we have ASI as part of our destination strategy now. Heather is going to share more about our momentum, but my hope is the next time I talk to you about Robinsons, I will share an Adrian and Kathy's story, along with one of our partner independent agents. So with that, Heather Day. Heather Day : Thank you, John. So as John highlighted, there is significant market opportunity for Progressive in the Robinsons segment. In 2014, we laid out our vision for the Destination Era and plans for growing that book of Robinsons. Subsequent investments in ASI, but also in processes and systems across channels, have laid the foundation for that growth. In year-to-date, we are experiencing steadily increasing velocity in creating Robinson bundles. We are now accelerating away from the historical slope in both direct and agency channels, with about equal parts coming from our existing auto customers that are transitioning to bundled homeowners with us, and from new business Robinsons that are adding an - that are buying an agent - an auto policy as they bundle with us. So property is considered an anchor product in the Destination Era and we have extended our core distribution strategy to include property. As with auto, property insurance is now available how, where and when customers to choose to interact with us and that requires thinking about property comprehensively. It has been woven into how we go to market and throughout our funnel, from our branded messaging, across all of our channels for purchasing and servicing a policy and through engagement with our existing auto customers as they become homeowners. As part of that strategy, Progressive is well positioned to connect with the highest potential segment for home insurance shopping. The top graph here shows the overall U.S. population by age, the bottom graph shows the Progressive auto distribution by age. Merging the two, the orange line highlights Progressive's market share by age relative to the overall U.S. population. Progressive has an advantage position with the younger population. And homebuyers skew younger. Overall, 62% are under the age of 44. Not surprisingly, the skew is even greater for first-time homebuyers. Looking at first-time homebuyers by age group, 80% are under the age of 44, peaking in the age range of 25 to 34, again, aligning nicely with Progressive's auto distribution. And while these millennials are shopping for homes later than in prior generations, as they age further into adulthood, the trend to home buying continues. Now Progressive has a legacy of building demand, with strong response from younger customers. We seek to be first in wallet with auto insurance. But as we saw with John's story of Adrian, our customers are not static. They are constantly evolving in their needs. That first home purchase is a seminal event that fundamentally changes the insurance needs of our customers and it can prompt shopping. So our investments reinforce our relationship up to that point and increase the likelihood that we will be first in line as an option for our customers during that critical transition. We are making steady gains in bundling these customers. We're also able to leverage strong brand consideration in that younger population, which extends here to the Robinsons consumer segment. Here we see the Robinsons insurance consideration by age, with the solid blue line representing the top two box consideration for Progressive, and the solid orange line representing the top two box consideration for a large captive carrier. The dotted lines represent the same consideration levels for 2016. Again, Progressive's favorite position with younger markets comes through. These consumers have grown up with Progressive as an insurance brand. To reinforce awareness and consideration of Progressive with these Robinsons, we are essentially extending the Progressive brand. Value and ease are core established brand attributes, and these carry over into home and bundling. However, we recognize that Robinsons are motivated not only by rate but also by peace of mind. We are able to tap into the power of the Progressive network of ads, leveraging familiar assets to layer on new messages around bundling and protection. In an earlier ad, with a jar for bundle jokes, there was a simple message, bundle and save. This next ad was called \"Flo-tection\", in which Flo is ever present in her efforts to protect the family's home and auto, from a neighbor's barbecue to a pesky pigeon. In a recent ad, Flo and Jamie struggle to get into the Progressive labs to see the new HomeQuote Explorer, which echoes yet another brand attribute of comparison shopping. Finally, a set of ads that are funny twists on that moment of realization that one is actually grown up, or perhaps morphing into one's parents, and that owning a home changes everything. There is an ecosystem of content that wraps around these ads and reinforces the messaging online, connecting with people dreaming about and researching homes. Home and bundle ads like the one that I just described are strong performers in our overall marketing line up. Looking at the ads from the last two years on a 2 x 2 matrix of ad effectiveness, ads featuring home and bundled messages here are highlighted in blue. And as we can see by the cluster of home ads up in the top right, ads with these messages generally outperform on two of our key measures. The net is that we are able to effectively layer home and bundle messages onto existing assets and leverage that brand equity. The strong performance of these messages enables very efficient spending relative to what might normally be expected in generating response for new product line. In line with that efficiency, we have increased mass media spending for homeowners and bundle messaging. And with a more fragmented homeowners market, that spend is echoed by increased share of voice, which reinforces awareness and consideration. Now the power of our content carries into earned media online. Organic search results reflect the strength and relevance of our content and our measure of online authority. Progressive has held a leading position in organic search results during most of 2017 and all of the peak homeowners shopping season. Top placement translates into traffic, which brings us to the direct acquisition funnel. While the volume of online home quotes is still small relative to auto, Progressive has established an early lead. Looking at online quotes submitted during the first half of 2017, Progressive is the clear number one. And those quotes are dropping into a new and improved funnel. As Tricia has noted in her 2017 quarterly updates, earlier this year we launched the HomeQuote Explorer. Based on initial results, we accelerated the rollout and the platform is now available countrywide on both desktop and mobile. Building on our years of online expertise and tapping into publicly available data, the HomeQuote Explorer provides a simple and comprehensive home insurance quote experience. The enhanced platform also supports our in-house Progressive Advantage agency, so there's continuity between the online and phones experience. One of our in-house agents can pick up a customer's quote, consult over the phone and take it through to conclusion. Now the HomeQuote Explorer is an important foundational element for growing share in the direct Robinsons market. Progressive serves a wide range of direct customers, and whereas progressive alone can offer an auto rate for just about every risk, homeowners carriers are more limited. By extending our multicarrier platform, we have become more efficient at matching our customer needs to an offer that works. Now previously we've highlighted the improved acceptability we saw with the multicarrier platform over the phones, with acceptability as the percentage of time we can present a customer with a homeowner's rate, and we are now experiencing those same acceptability gains across our multicarrier channels, desktop, mobile and phones. So as we look back at acceptability over the last 12 months, we see some month-to-month variability due to customer mix and carrier appetite, but a clear trend emerges after the HomeQuote Explorer elevates. Those acceptability improvements are combined with gains and conversions and other funnel enhancements, so that as we see a similar pattern of improved year-over-year yield. So to summarize on the direct side, our message is resonating with the target segment. We've established an early lead in driving online quotes and the funnel is notably more efficient. However, even as we are enthusiastic about those direct successes, we know that most Robinsons continue to buy through agents. As John showed earlier, local agents write more than 85% of bundle business. As the number one writer of auto insurance through the independent agent channel, we believe we are reasonably well positioned to leverage our strength to become the number one writer of auto and home insurance through the channel. And in agency, we have an equally comprehensive approach to growth, partnering with agents ready to write bundles, providing them with a competitive offering, making it easy for them to do business and building confidence in our ability to serve the customers. So these elements come together in the Platinum program. It is the foundation for bundled growth in agency. Progressive offers our auto and special lines products through a broad set of independent agents, over 35,000. This is not true for Progressive home. Only 12% of agents have access to the Progressive Home product, and just 5% are invited into the Platinum program. Now the number of Progressive home and Platinum agents will expand to meet our growth objectives. In fact, we have almost doubled the number of Platinum agents over the last 12 months, but it will remain small relative to the overall agent footprint. Platinum in particular, will remain exclusive. It will be available only to those agents that have strong potential to write preferred bundled business and that demonstrate strong commitment to placing that business with Progressive and Platinum is working. I'd like to revisit graph that Pat Callahan shared during last year's Investor Relations meeting. This graph compares two cohorts of agents, both of which were offering Progressive home at the start of 2015. One group was selected for Platinum and the other group remained in the non-Platinum standard Progressive home program. Now of course if we go back to the start of 2015, the more productive agents were ultimately invited to join the Platinum program, so we do see an initial delta. However, after the launch of Platinum, that gap widens. Momentum was initially slow as we integrated the Progressive and ASI sales teams and built out the Platinum program infrastructure, but we're now seeing the multiplier effect of initiatives coming together. Looking at the solid orange line for Platinum agents versus the solid blue line for Progressive home agents, Platinum agents are now five times more likely to bundle home and auto. And then if I add preferred auto growth, these are the dash lines, you'll notice that both sets of agents are increasing preferred auto volume over time, but Platinum agents are now three times more likely to write preferred auto for agency. The gaps between these Platinum and Progressive home lines on the graph, this is the Platinum difference, and that gap is continuing to widen. Now, of course, there is more work ahead, and one of the advantages of the Platinum model is the opportunity for deeper engagement with our agents. As we seek to continuously improving our offering, listening to agents is key. So we know that a competitive bundle rate is just the starting point also essential is bundle alignment across our auto and home products. Progressive and ASI teams, both product and sales, work closely to make good use of agent feedback on product features and underwriting. The deepening integration of these teams has enabled faster learning and speed-to-market on a range of enhancements, such as new underwriting guidelines for older homes, Platinum endorsement of premium coverages for the home product, and continued progress in preferred segmentation on auto. That said, winning in the agent's office goes beyond product. Agents have long recognized Progressive for our ease-of-use and we are investing to extend that value proposition into bundling with the next generation quoting platform. Now despite the growing prominence of comparative raters, the efficiency of the proprietary portal remains a differentiator. About 75% of bundled quotes start on raters, but agents still bridge into multiple platforms to complete the quote and to compare final rates. So once again, we have talked to agents extensively and we have piloted some of these bundled quote features. But we also took a step back to look beyond the industry. We've benchmarked against best-in-class consumer shopping experiences to streamline the quote and to make it easy to offer multiple products through an integrated interface and we are on schedule to start rolling out this enhanced experience in early 2018. And of course, compensation matters. Enhanced compensation for bundled business remains a core element of Platinum, and we are also element - we are also implementing a unified bonus program that recognizes Platinum agents for the quality and volume of business they write with us across all lines of business. Finally, there are elements that are hard to quantify, such as agent confidence in Progressive Home. And we recognize that takes time. We know ASI's record of excellent claims service even in the most trying circumstances, like following a catastrophe. But we need to build that same level of awareness and confidence with our agents. So these many elements come together and they form the base for deepening our relationship with Platinum agents. In close, Robinsons are growing as a relative share of our overall book. Of course, this is an expansion strategy. It is not a replacement strategy. While Robinsons are growing as a share of the book, we have more Sams in force today than we did in 2014. Further, the expectation that Robinsons would result in extended policy life holds. Using our Sam policy life expectancy as a base, our Robinsons policy life is now over three and a half times greater. And finally, we are growing Robinsons from a solid foundation, based on those same attributes that drives Progressive's overall success, weaving property into our culture and thinking, extending the brand, putting forward a competitive bundle offer and ultimately meeting the broader needs of our customers. This is the Destination Era in effect, and we are building from here. And with that, we will take your questions if you give us just a minute to get set up. Operator : A - Julia Hornack : [Operator Instructions] I'm going to start with a question that I've gotten frequently, which is how has the hard market contributed to the success of Platinum in the Agency channel? Tricia Griffith : I'll start with that, and Heather, if you could elaborate a little bit, specifically with Platinum. Overall, the hard market is really about being in the consideration set, especially on the Agency side. So when we think of that, we think of course our brand, your trusted brand. We think of service, especially times like this when you have catastrophes agents get feedback on exemplary service and service that needs work, so make sure you always service your customers. But more importantly, when the customers come in that agency, do you have the right product at the right price? And that's really the key to being successful in a hard market, to be able to have a great product and we are very happy with our [indiscernible] product at a very competitive rate. And to me, that's the overall picture of how you really win a hard market. Specific to Platinum, Heather, why don't you elaborate a little bit? Heather Day : Yes, I think you're right. It is about being in the right position to take advantage of market opportunity. If I look back a couple of years, we would not have been in a position to grow, whether it is a hard or soft market. So it is really the work that has happened to reinforce our bundled product, to deepen those relationships with agents, that during this time where we've got the opportunity to grow, we're in a position with the right product, the right relationships at the right time. Tricia Griffith : And the agents really do talk about that. So I do a lot of big agency events, and you can tell just that in the last year as we've come together, especially with the agent representatives that go in, the agents really respect and honor that relationship and you can tell it's adding to our results. Julia Hornack : Thank you. So Brian, can we please take the first question from the telephone participants please? Operator : Of course, our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi good morning. My first question, I guess, first as I think about the bundled customers versus non-bundled customers, do you assume a lower loss ratio on the bundled side, just because there generally have been more affluent customers or can you kind of just walk us through how you're kind of thinking through the margin profiles of the two different segments of the business? Tricia Griffith : Yes. We do assume \u2013 we'd look at all of our customers with segmentation and subsegmentation. So generally, we believe that bundled customers will be more competitive and so we bake in, obviously, loss ratio-expense ratio differences in those customers and we know that they stay longer, which also influences that. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then something that's a bit more topical over the past has obviously been the prospects of tax reform. Given that you guys could be a pretty big beneficiary on the tax side, would you look to keep any potential benefit or do you think that, that - would that be passed through to potentially lower pricing? Tricia Griffith : Yes well, the devil will be in the details. Generally speaking for Progressive, we believe that if it comes to a 20%, we don't know what the outcome will be, that we will benefit from that. I think what I'd like to do is to have John talk about how we look at that from an operational side and then Bill Cody is on the phone, and he can talk about how we've been looking at that from an investment side. We talk about this all the time, at least in the last year or so, and model out what those changes would be. So John, why don't you start on the operational side? John Sauerland : Sure, obviously, a timely question. I'm sure most of you spent a lot yesterday reading a lot on potential tax code changes. Generally, it is our bias that we would allow benefits of tax change, federal tax change to fall to the bottom line. That said, we are - we would be considering the competitive environment in which we operate as we decide whether we would change that 96 target or not, our initial expectation is that we would not. We would also obviously try to understand the likelihood of permanence in any change. But I also would like to note when it comes to taxes that we actually pay as much tax above the line in an average year as we do below the line, so to speak. So for insurance, we have a state premium tax, generally not a state income tax, and that state premium tax is about $0.5 billion for Progressive, and that's included in our expense ratio. We do a lot to try to optimize our premium tax rates, meaning multiple legal entities. We work on getting tax credits as well. And more recently below the line for federal taxes, we have been working to be more proactive in managing our federal tax rate through the use of renewable energy credits. So generally, we will expect to allow it to fall to the bottom line unless the competitive environment changed a lot. And I think Bill would - can comment on the potential implications for our investment portfolio. William Cody : Sure, Elyse. The biggest implication or the direct implication would be in the muni portfolio, which is now, let's say, 8.7% of our total portfolio, which is down about 2% from last year, the end of last year. So that comes to a little bit less than $2.4 billion. About $900 million of that or roughly 40% is in housing bonds which - most of which, we would still find attractive at a 20% tax rate. A similar amount we hold for premium tax abatement purposes, which is something that John had mentioned and I would say the vast majority of that would still be attractive at lower tax rates as well. The balance, there are some special situations which will be also attractive. And then others that we would sell, given valuations and tax rates because we look at munis on a fully taxable equivalent basis compared to other products. And to the degree they're not competitive on that basis, we will sell them. We generally expect munis to do well under the proposed tax plan because individual demand should hold up pretty well, given the top tax rate remaining at the 39.6% and the elimination of state and local in the income tax deduction. And as well as the fact that we will see some supply-demand - supply drop, given the elimination of advanced refundings and private activity with bonds.  Through the rest of the portfolio, corporate bonds should do better as cash flow is increased and leverage is reduced. We should also see some less issuance in that space as well. We also expect rates should move a bit higher on the boost to growth and some possible F1 series bonds [ph]. And we also think our equity portfolio should do well. Obviously, it's a big winner of reduced corporate taxes. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks bill Julia Hornack : Thanks Elyse. Brian, can we take the next question from the conference call line please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Mr. Glasspiegel your line is now open. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning, Progressive. A question on the - on how we should think about the option execution. Is there anything magical about getting into a 100%? I mean if things are like they are, do you anticipate that you're going to want to get to 100%? John Sauerland : Yes, so Bob, I'll take that one. In April of 2018, we have the option to get to 80% or more and I expect we will take that option. We have the option to get to 100% at the end - or in April of 2021 and it is our expectation that we would take that option as well. The owners of those shares also have the option to put their shares to us at the same time at those two different dates. This is obviously intended to ensure that the key leadership team that I talked about remains to continue to build the business and be very engaged, which they continue to be. On that note I will, however, mention that we have also recently had a senior person from Progressive join the ASI team. So Dave Pratt, who most previously ran our Snapshot business and has a long history, probably 27 years or so with Progressive, is now in direct report of John Auer, the CEO of ASI. So working to get further integration, but yes, we would expect that we would be at, at least 80% come April of '18, and get to 100% in '21. Tricia Griffith : Sorry, Bob, I didn't know you were referring to ASI. I was like, options? We don't have that options anymore. Sorry. Bob Glasspiegel : A question on where the sort of current run rate is in homeowners. If we sort of take out amortization and investment for growth and sort of unusual CATs, where should we think of this sort of current year-to-date run rate? Tricia Griffith : You can talk a little bit more about that. I think taking out the amortization expense and the current CATs, we feel much more positively about the run rate. And of course, as we expand across the country, we learn more and more about - we have more development and we understand a little bit more of each state and the nuances. But we also believe that that's a great strategy because being across the country and not having so much concentration in the states we have now will actually be beneficial to us. Bob Glasspiegel : So just to understand your answer, you are earning your targeted return underlying? Or you need more scale to get there? John Sauerland : Yes, I can answer that, Bob. So as I mentioned, when we modeled the value of ASI, we obviously assumed a margin, operating margin and we are slightly above that inception-to-date. Actually, in 2017, if you take out that amortization, we're at a 101 year-to-date, and that is not where the model assumed we would be on an inception-to-date basis. But of course, homeowners is spikier, consequently the need for reinsurance, consequently need for greater capital levels. But on an inception-to-date basis, given the fact that we've had a high degree of hail as well as the named storms, we feel great. So we have a target combined ratio, as I showed you on that slide. For the property business, it is well below 96, reflecting the additional need for capital. And we think our underlying profitability is solid. Homeowners is a line in which we have been taking rates up some. We expect to take those rates up more throughout the rest of the year and into 2018 as well. So we are seeing loss cost trends in homeowners accelerate a bit, and the folks at ASI are responding. Bob Glasspiegel : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Bob. Julia Hornack : Brian can we take the next question from the conference call line please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Mr. Pan, your line is now open. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. The first question is on the reinsurance side. If the reinsurance rates are going up, would that impact your reinsurance strategy and would you be able to pass on some of the increasing cost to your Home customers? Tricia Griffith : We don't know for sure if reinsurance will go up. That'll be dependent after everything. It's true in different companies. We believe that we have a great strategy in terms of having multiple policies that are staggered in different years. So we will - we always take a look to try to minimize our downside and we'll take action depending on what the reinsurance market does and what we feel like we need. But we want to obviously protect that spike in homeowners. So John just talked about that. And having two of the biggest storms in history in two of our biggest states for Home, we realized how important - not that we didn't before - how important to homeowners reinsurance is and we'll do, what we need to do to protect that downside. John Sauerland : If I might interject, I may have misspoken in my response to Bob. Inception-to-date, our combined ratio for homeowners is a little higher than we modeled. I think I shared that in my comments. But in case that was a misstatement on my part in Bob's response, I apologize. We are slightly above inception-to-date. Tricia Griffith : Kai did that answer your question? Kai Pan : Yes. My followup question is on the auto sort of loss frequency and we have seen pretty sort of like a lot of improvements so far this year. I just wonder, could you give a little bit color on the sort of what's like the puts and takes in there and how sustainable is that going forward? Tricia Griffith : I will start with the sustainable piece, Kai. It's really hard to understand necessarily frequency because a lot of macroeconomic trends can change with frequency. What we do see internally that we believe is favorable on that side is the fact that we have a much more preferred mix of customers and so we know that that's what lowered the frequency. We have some upfront underwriting we've put in, in the last several years that we believe is making a difference and when we look at our snapshot data, we have longer miles. So think of longer trips. So think of trips over 15 miles. And we're seeing that, and we believe that the Snapshot population kind of mirrors the rest of our Population. So when we think about that and create hypotheses around frequency, those are normally what we talk about. And we always have other underlying hypotheses that we continue to try to quantify. But we wouldn't want to try to predict frequency we react to it. Kai Pan : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Kai. Julia Hornack : All right, I'm going to take a question from the webcast at this time. So the question is from Austin Boaz from Principal Global Investors. Austin Boaz : Do you think there would be better acceptance by independent agents of homeowners insurance if ASI was rebranded as, say, Progressive Home, for example? Why keep ASI as its own brand name? So a two-part question. Tricia Griffith : Great question Austin. Yes, and thank you, we're going to be doing that. So yes, we - so let's move back up. So we purchased ASI because in the states they were in, they were known as the preferred brand and agency channel. And for years because of our heritage of being a nonstandard auto, we knew that was a good marriage. So we've learned from - as the last couple of years have gone through, not just from agents but from ASI as a team, we knew there'd be a right time when we decide to name the product Progressive Home. So over the last year or so, all of us have had lots of conversations with agents. And these are agents in some of the agencies where they have been an ASI agent for a long time and they said, \"You know what? It's time to leverage the Progressive brand and have it be Progressive Home and Progressive Auto.\" And so we've decided to do this. It will take some time, because of just systems and different things. But Heather's actually - will be running that project, and you can add in any more if you want, but yes, we think it's the time. We now are known as an auto home bundler. We have the right brand for that. It's a preferred product on both the auto and home side, and it's perfectly the right time, so great advice, Austin. Do you want to add anything? Heather Day : I would just echo what Tricia just said. We tread very carefully here, knowing the legacy that ASI had built with agents in its existing states and how well recognized they were by those agents. As we expand it again, it was one of those, we've got those deep agent relationships through the Platinum program. We listened carefully and understood that as we are beginning to build out the Progressive Home brand generally, this was really the right time to make the switch, so yes, under way. Tricia Griffith : And I would tell you, the first person that would say we absolutely have to do this is John Auer, the CEO of ASI, and he's leading the way as well. Julia Hornack : All right, Brian can we take the next question from the conference call line please? Operator : Of course. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Campbell from KBW. Mr. Campbell, your line is now open. Christopher Campbell : Yes, hi good morning. Tricia Griffith : Good morning. Christopher Campbell : The question on auto, do you think the reinsurance on your auto line would be useful given there is probably a benefit if you did a multiproduct treaty now does Progressive approach that type of question? Tricia Griffith : That's a great question. We've been talking about that for the last couple of years as we've integrated with ASI. We have it on some of our commercial auto. So the higher limit Commercial Auto, over $1 million, we have reinsurance. I think as we think about continuing to expand, we always consider and protect the downside and weigh that with the cost. So it's something we talk about often to determine does that makes sense, does it make sense especially like you said with the multi treaty. We haven't gone there yet, but it is - it's just something we discussed. Christopher Campbell : Okay, great. That's very helpful. And just the followup is how would you categorize the relative sophistication between your auto and homeowners pricing right now? Tricia Griffith : So from Auto, we have had years and years of segmentation, and a lot of variables go into our auto pricing and then recently, of course, we've added the upfront underwriting. On the home side, there's been a lot more underwriting in terms of acceptable risks. So coming in the door, knowing right away what we would accept and what we wouldn't. Now we're really starting to share data and best practices with both companies to really get the best of both worlds. So sharing the underwriting sophistication from ASI as well as our pricing and segmentation sophistication and we've been doing a lot more of our business reviews collectively together. That's one of the reasons why we had Dave Pratt come down to work with the ASI folks. And we work back and forth to really share the best of both worlds. So I would say each company has different levels of sophistication. So together, I believe we're going to have a really optimal approach to even understanding segmentation at a more granular level. Christopher Campbell : Well, thanks for all the answers. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Julia Hornack : Brian the next question from the conference call line please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber from William Blair. Mr. Klauber, your line is now open. Adam Klauber : Thanks. On Platinum, I think you mentioned 5% of the agencies are currently Platinum and also you're being selective. But as we think about a couple of years down the line, will that be multiples of the 5%? Tricia Griffith : Yes, we will obviously select more Platinum agents as we grow and expand and we really have always positioned it as a scarcity model. And we want to make sure these agents, when customers come into their agency, we're their first or second choice. And some agents actually won't have access to the customers that want to have a home and bundled package or maybe don't own a home. So we will expand when we believe it will increase our Robinsons population, our auto home bundle. We'll be expanding for sure in the next couple of years just because of our geographic expansion. And then we'll likely step back and say, \"Are there opportunities in different geographic locations to increase our Platinum agency population?\". Adam Klauber : Okay, thanks. And then could you talk a bit more, I think you said in '18 that you're rolling out for Platinum a better interface and also better bonus program. Could you just talk about those a bit more? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I'll have Heather talk specifically about the bonus program. I brought up the overall commission schedule that we talked about during the last webcast, so we call it Paths to Partnership, and we are investing a lot overall in our agency platform with IT, just to make things smooth and easy for agents to be able to have that auto and home and bundle online in the same system. Do you want to give any specifics on that? Heather Day : Well, I would - I think underlying this question is a sense of what kind of levels of investment are we looking at in terms of Platinum and how does that line up in terms of our cost structure. Let me know if I'm off-base on that. I think we feel very good that we are coming into the Platinum program with a very competitive cost structure in the agency channel. And as I think about the investments we are making in terms of ease-of-use with the overall platform as well as thinking about how we are going to compensate agents for both their bundled business and for other lines of business that they're writing with us, we are really rethinking about both the quality and the volume of the business we're getting, the kind of retention we expect to see with this bundled business. So overall, these investments should align us - should position us very well for growth, but we do not expect upward pressure on the combined ratio. We will keep that very same target in place. Adam Klauber : Okay, thank you. And also the last on bundled, you showed the Robinsons population is growing pretty aggressively in bundled. Is that coming - is that growth coming more from the captive or independent agency channel or both? Tricia Griffith : I would say the majority of the Robinson bundle is coming from the independent agents channel. That's not to say that it's captive, Robinsons aren't shopping as well. And of course, the other part of the Robinsons bundle, not with Platinum but on - in our in-house agency on the direct side, really comes from the overall population in terms of what John had talked about with a lot of graduations of our Dianes and other people in our segmentation, so it's really across the board. But if I had to stay on the agency side, the majority of our growth is coming directly from the independent agent channel. Adam Klauber : Okay, great, thanks a lot. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Julia Hornack : Brian, can we please take the next question from the conference call line please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Mr. Meredith your line is now open. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Hi Trish. Tricia Griffith : Hi Brian. Brian Meredith : A couple of questions, first, back on the frequency. I'm wondering, do you see any benefit, or in any of your data, see any benefit when you do have some major hurricanes or catastrophic events like this did you see a decline in frequency? Tricia Griffith : Yes, we talk about that. We can't surgically say absolutely yes. Right after Harvey, I walked into John's office and asked him the same question. Let's look at this. So I wouldn't be able to say concretely absolutely. We look at that, try to address that, but it's really specifically an unknown. I think the philosophy and probably what you're getting at, Brian, is - so if you leave, is there less frequency in BI et cetera. We look at that. We can't exactly point to yes, that, that equates to frequency because again that is a couple of states and we have the whole country to contend with when we look at overall frequency. Brian Meredith : Great. And also just on that topic, if you quantify or can you give us a sense of what benefits you're seeing on frequency from kind of mix shift to more preferred? And kind of what do you expect kind of going forward? Tricia Griffith : I can't give you very - specifics in terms of that, but we know when we have the more preferred customer that - and the ones that stay longer, so we're going to be making more money over a long period of time that we benefit from that mix of customer. And I think the exciting part about this is that as we talked about, we have so much momentum going on and so much more to capture and we're seeing this now. So we believe that if it continues, hopefully, we'll have those low pure premium customers that will benefit us, so we won't be able to tell. It's not something we can predict. We don't put it into our pricing, we watch for it. But having a more preferred customer, we believe, will benefit us. Brian Meredith : Great. And just one last question, could you provide us with kind of what the competitive landscape looks like right now in the direct agency distribution segment? Tricia Griffith : Heather, if you want to add the agency part, you can. I think, overall, every or most companies increased rates a fair amount in 2016. Our philosophy has been for a long time and we tried to do it; we can't always do is take small bites of the apple and continue to stay ahead of trend. We are seeing a couple competitors raising rates higher than we are. And so we believe that the hard market will continue to persist, I think especially after the hurricanes, so I won't speak of specific competitors. We obviously watch that from a competitive landscape, but there's a couple of companies that clearly need some rate in the system, and we believe that will have the hard market continue. Competitors from the agency side, do you have any? Heather Day : So as we think about the competitive landscape on the agency side, it clearly varies across the country in terms of which competitors are relatively well positioned in different regions. We actually even think about it at the agent level. So as we are thinking through where our opportunities lie, understanding the competitive set within particular agencies is how we are getting a sense of where we have upsides. So it's a state-by-state, are we - is the market hardening across both the auto and home and what opportunities do we have in that particular agency and that's where our state-based field and sales model is really beneficial. Brian Meredith : Great, thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Brian. Julia Hornack : All right, I am going to take a few questions from the webcast. The first question is from Mark Lane from William Blair. I'm going to do my best to rephrase this just a little bit. Mark Lane : Can you make money on providing third-party insurance on homeowners? Julia Hornack : And I'll let you answer that first, and then I'll ask the second piece. Tricia Griffith : Okay. Yes. We - with our third-party insurance carriers, we receive a commission when we sell homeowners. And remember, what we really - the intent of having multiple unaffiliated carriers and ASI on the direct side was really to extend the auto PLE, so when we've talked about that for years, being able to say that bundled customers, whether or not we write it on our own paper, really the goal is to extend the PLE of the auto. Julia Hornack : Right, and then the second piece of the question is\u2026 Mark Lane : Including the homeowners policies that we sell through our third-party insurers, our unaffiliated carriers, how would we think about estimating our market share in homeowners? Tricia Griffith : We don't really publicize that. We've put the income in our service revenue and - but we have - we don't share that data. Julia Hornack : Okay. All right. Thank you. So the next question is from Matthew Goetzinger from Fiduciary Management. Matthew Goetzinger : So the question is essentially, as Robinsons grow as a contributor to the company, the assumption would be that Robinsons have comprehensive on their auto insurance policies today. So therefore, as comprehensive - as comprehensive grows as a percentage of the coverage that our customers choose, would that change our reinsurance philosophy on auto insurance for the long term? Tricia Griffith : Yes, we'll always look at our reinsurance. I wouldn't necessarily say all Robinsons would have comp coverage, I mean some would, especially if there's a lien. But we watch the line coverage codes across our insurers. And if we felt that, that was necessary to protect the downside, we would absolutely consider it. John Sauerland : I might add to that. Recognize that within our pricing in states where -- that are more prone to storms, there are what we consider catastrophe loads in the pricing. So we are looking back over history to understand what we think, over a reasonable period of time, is necessary to cover storm losses. So while it's not reinsurance, it is built into those comprehensive rates. And we think we're adequately priced in comprehensive. Julia Hornack : All right. Brian can we take a question from the conference call line please? Operator : Of course. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Mr. Gutterman, your line is now open. Ian Gutterman : Hi, thank you. I had a quick question on Harvey and then I had a question on the agency growth. Tricia, can you walk through a little bit sort of how you came up with your Harvey auto estimate? And I guess what I'm looking at is - I think you even said it in your video - about 500,000 cars damaged in Houston and your market share appears to be about 10% in Texas. Now maybe it's different in the Houston area, but that would imply close to 50,000 cars and your 200-something million implies only 5,000 severity, which seems very low to me. So were you underweighted in Houston or can you give us a sense of what kind of severity you're using per car? Tricia Griffith : I don't know that we've shared severity. We look at - we model it out. Every storm, we model it out and we look at the share of market within certain areas. And Harvey was a little bit unusual because there were areas that were completely flooded, and we may or may not have had a higher or lower market share in those certain areas; and some were force flooded and some people left. So we literally modeled that one out prior to it happening and ongoing, and the severity was a little bit higher because most of those cars were totaled. But I will tell you, we feel that we have been very adequate in our reserving for both Harvey and Irma. Ian Gutterman : Is your market share in Houston similar to your market share in the State of Texas? Tricia Griffith : Yes. Ian Gutterman : Okay. Fair enough. So on the agency side, obviously the growth has been very impressive and I just want to understand, obviously, some of it is the initiatives you've talked about on the call, but I was hoping maybe you had some data you can share on sort of where customers are coming from? Is most of the priors coming from other agency carriers that ask for too much rate and they're coming to you or do you feel it's sort of the captive guys are moving into the agency? Just anything you can share on that? Tricia Griffith : Yes. What I would say overall is that it really has to do with the agents shopping for a great product at a great rate. And so when you talk about that, when you think about that hard market, most of those customers are coming - that are within their agency are likely to come to independent agents. I wouldn't say necessarily from captive. I don't know that, but anecdotally I would say people usually go to the captive or go to independent agents, so it's really about us having a different product in the market. So a couple of years ago, when we put out really our first preferred auto product, 83 and now it's evolved to 84, that has really been the shift in our ability to get more customers and having that right price. So we feel like we've got - we were in a good position in 2015, we've continued to benefit from having better product models with better segmentation at a good rate, at a great rate, because we're able to get ahead of that trend. And that's really been so important to us not to rate shock our customers because that ends up upsetting the agents and then they shop around. And that's really where we've been seeing the growth. Ian Gutterman : Well, that actually kind of led into what I wanted to ask, was I assume - so part of this especially in the - again, I understand the direct is a different environment, but in the agency environment where it seems like we've gotten so used to the, whatever you want to call it, the power of the rater and low man win sort of thing, it feels like some of that business that other people won maybe from you maybe a few years ago ended up being bad business for them. So now it comes back out, they're asking for more rate. You're maybe lower than what they're asking for, but how comfortable are you or how much analytics do you have to sort of see how the performance of that book was for someone else. I guess I'm worried a little bit just that the rate of growth - if someone else was getting it at a 110, and couldn't get the rate they want to renew it and the agency put it back in the rater, can you really get it to a 96 right away or do you have to bring it on with a heavy new business penalty and assume it takes two or three renewals to get into the 96? Tricia Griffith : Yes, that's a really good question. We have very specific targets in the agency channel per state, new and renewal. So we - when we're looking at this and why I've bee, I think, elated with the 84 model is the fact that we're writing at or sometimes below target for those - that new business. So we do feel good about that. If we didn't, we wouldn't - we would slow down growth. And you've seen us do that because you don't want to have that come back. If someone leaves after six months, that's not a good business model. So we feel very good and very adequate with our rate in the agency side. Ian Gutterman : Great, thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Julia Hornack : [Operator Instructions] We have a few more questions from the webcast. The first one is again from Mark Lane at William Blair. Mark Lane : It's essentially around the purchase price for the ASI minority shareholders. Has that already been a negotiated deal and how is that valuation structured? John Sauerland : Yes, I'll take that. Yes, that was part of the original purchase agreement and the price at which we will purchase shares, either next year or in 2021, is a function of the change in the tangible book value of the company, plus the original price per share. There's also a multiplier that is applied to that change in tangible book value that is determined by a matrix of growth and profitability. It can vary from 1 up to a total - a high of two. So in addition to the base share price that we paid back in 2015, you add the change in book value times that multiple from one to two, and that's how the price we pay is derived. Julia Hornack : All right. The next question again is from the webcast from Matthew Goetzinger at Fiduciary Management. Matthew Goetzinger : The question is really two parts and the first is regarding the launch of UBI in the Commercial Lines market, so using ELD for truck drivers, how aggressive do you anticipate being on premium discounts given the small initial base of existing statistical loss data? Tricia Griffith : So how we're going to work discounts in the ELD is if a current customer has at least three months of driving data, you will get - you could get anywhere up to 18% discount, because we already have some knowledge of your driving data. If we don't have any knowledge of it, you'll get a 3% participation discount, and then after that three months of data, you could get upwards of an additional 15% for a maximum of 18%. So I'm sure things will change as we know more, but we believe we've gotten out ahead of it, working with some of the vendors. But that's our current structure as we head into 2018. Julia Hornack : Great. Brian, can we take another question from the conference call line please? Operator : Of course. Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] Asset Management. Joe, your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Just a kind of a 30,000-foot question, when you guys acquired ASI, I think Glenn Renwick was very clear in saying the only way a success of the deal would be measured is if you're selling more car insurance through agents. Can you talk about whether that measuring stick has changed or morphed at all at this point? Tricia Griffith : Yes well, you know having worked with Glenn for so many years, I'm sure that was a statement. But it was really - the acquisition of ASI was getting access to those agents who wrote those preferred homes and to be able to bundle the homes. So we've talked a lot about extending auto PLEs. So I think with any good business model, especially as we integrated and have such a good partnership and relationship with ASI, we always want to evolve. But ultimately we want to be able to have as many preferred Robinsons auto home bundled in the agency channel as possible while reaching our target goals - our target margins. So yes, it's evolved, but I think it's evolved with what Glenn would have had in mind as well. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Julia Hornack : It would appear that we have no further questions, and so that concludes our event today.",

Today, we will begin with a presentation about efficient marketing to maintain a leading brand. Our presentation will last approximately 45 minutes and be followed by Q&A with our CEO, Tricia Griffith; our CFO, John Sauerland; and our guest speakers, Dan Witalec and Cat Kolodij. Our Chief Investment Officer, Bill Cody, will also join us by phone for Q&A. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during the event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2017 annual report on Form 10-K, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investors page of our website, Progressive.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Julia, and welcome to Progressive's Fourth Quarter Webcast. During the last few webcasts, we talked a lot about top line growth as far as revenue. We really outlined on the addressable market on both the auto and home side. It's almost $300 billion of which we have about $30 billion, so a lot of runway, and we're very excited to continue to execute on that plan and continue to gain market share. For today and the next webcast, we're going to talk a little bit more about bottom line growth, specifically efficiency. Today, we will be on brand efficiency and in creative. But before I go into that, I want to talk about how we think about winning at Progressive and winning in the right way. And we use what we call our four cornerstones : our core values, who we are; our purpose statement, why we're here; our vision, where we're headed; and our strategy, how we're going to get there. Let me start with our core values. Our core values were penned by Peter Lewis back in 1986. And although the words have been tweaked a little bit along the years, they are really special to Progressive and really special to our culture. They are not just posted on the wall. We really try to bring them to life all the time. In fact, I think I've mentioned before, I attempt to do every new hire class across the Company. And believe me, that's been a lot in the last couple of years because of our growth. And I do so, obviously, to welcome the new hires, but to be able to talk about our core values and how important they are and make sure that they know that they need to nurture our culture, and it starts with our core values : integrity, golden rule, excellence, objectives, process, all of them woven together to create a really special culture. Our purpose, so our purpose statement is relatively new. I wrote a little bit about it in my annual letter. Our mission statement was an amalgam of some from Peter, a little bit from Glenn, a little bit from me, and it really became what we do. And for us, that's second nature. So we wanted our purpose statement to be who we are. And so we went to the Company, and this statement was influenced by many different areas of the Company, and we ended up putting it out to a company-wide vote. And the chosen statement, which is ours, is true to our name, Progressive. What that means to me is really the first eight letters of Progressive : Progress, moving forward, doing better today than yesterday, our rich history of innovation and transparency and always thinking how to be better for our shareholders, for each other and the customers we're privileged to serve. Our vision, our vision is to become consumer's number one choice and destination for auto and other insurance. We've had this vision for some time. We added destination and other when full force into the Destination Era. Clearly, becoming consumers' number one choice is a big challenge, but as we continue to gain share and as we continue to have customers choose us and then choose to stay with us, we get closer and closer to that vision. Our strategy which is what we're going to talk about today has four pillars. Let me talk a little bit about those. Our first one is our people, our people and our culture we believe is a true competitive advantage, and we're going to be able to prove that on spreadsheets all of you, probably not, but I will tell you. Over 30 years ago, I walked into the Indianapolis Claims Office. My intention was not to work for an auto insurance company in Cleveland for 30 years, my intention was to pay off my school debt so I could get my MBA and go back into debt. So what I did was I got claims rep training, I went to the claims office, learned how to estimate cars, learned how to talk to talk to attorneys about injuries. I would tell you about eight month then I fell in love. I fell in love with the people, the culture, the values and every day coming to work and learning something new. In fact, my team of 12 we have a cumulative tenure of 305 years, so is the place where you want to stay. This is something really important to us. The second pillar is meeting the broader needs of our customers. We like to think of this as where when and how customers want to shop. In our last webcast Heather Day talked about our HomeQuote Explorer, you will hear us call us 82x, just an easy streamline way to have a HomeQuote online to our new digital device. And we will continue to reiterate that to make it easier and easier for our customers. Our latest innovation in terms of where, when and how customers want to shop is our Flobot, our Chatbot through Facebook messenger to get auto insurance quotes. We will continue to innovate because this is really important for us to serve any sort of customer demographics. Our third pillar is offering competitive prices. We do this by having leading segmentation in the industry. We do this by having Great Plains accuracy, which is most of any dollar premium that comes in and most importantly being very efficient. The efficiency part will be the subject of our next webcast. We're going to talk about our LAE efficiency and what we call NAR, non-acquisition expense ratio and we'll talk about how important that is. When you look at the companies that grow and grow profitably they're very efficient. And today we're going to talk about brand. We're going to look at it from two aspects, I'm going to have Dan Witalec, our Leader of Acquisition come up and talk about the metrics around brand. How we use our money wisely? We have a very big budget and we want to make sure that every incremental dollar is gone to great use. Cat Kolodij, who is our Leader of Marketing Strategy, will be on the other side talking about that creative that works with what Dan is buying. The two worked together hand in glove to make sure we are really proud of our brand. So we're very excited to tell that story, really about the science and art around our brands, acquiring customers and keeping customers. But before I invite Dan up, we thought we would step back and say, what questions would you have you would want us to answer in these next 40 minutes while they talked. And here are the five we came up with. Are you being smart and efficient with your spend? What are you getting for the actual spend. The media landscape is changing, are you on top of those shifts. Has progress evolved this messaging as our business mile has evolved? And lastly, we say look at the lesser flow, what are the results of the new creative? We hope to answer all five of those questions and maybe more, but again after they speak we'll be able to answer any other questions you have. So, Dan, why don\u2019t you come up and talk about the science around acquisitions. Dan Witalec : Thank you, Tricia. So why are we talking about marketing spend today, as you likely know, we have seen a real explosion in industry, insurance industry, advertising spend over the last two decades. This chart shows U.S. P&C insurance advertising from 1996 through 2016, the last few that we had, industry spend available. And you can see, there\u2019s been about an 11% average annual increase in advertising spend and the insurance industry. When you compare that to overall advertising spend in the U.S. only going up about 2% or 3% per year, you can really see why insurance has become one of the most heavily advertised industries across the entire country. The rest of it\u2019s certainly been a big part of that, and increase it's spend along the way actually slightly outpacing industry spend during this time. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re here with all of this spend going on, we want to make the case if you\u2019re spending it efficiently. And we will do that by hitting on these four different topics. So I am going to talk a little bit about the discipline controls that we have around our media spending, then I am also going to talk about our media mix, and then I am going to turn it over to Cat Kolodij to talk about some of our efforts beyond auto and our creative network. So let\u2019s start on discipline, the natural question is, are we getting a good return for all of that spend that we have going on? So one simple way to look at that is, are we getting incremental sales as we spend more? Here is a chart that shows a scatter-plot that has media spend on the horizontal axis and direct auto unit sales on the vertical axis  Each dot here is a year, 2001 is in the lower left hand corner, 2017 in the upper right hand corner. So the great news for us here is that in general we see a linear relationship. We have seen and we continue to see generally a linear relationship between spend and sales. So as we spend more, we are getting incremental sales. And in fact, if you look at 2017 in particular we had a large increase in our media, but we\u2019ve got those incremental sales to go along with it, even slightly above the line here. So we generally feel great about that incremental benefit we\u2019re getting. So what are some of the controls that we have to ensure that we are spending efficiently? So at a high level, our most important single control on our spending is looking at our cost per sale and ensuring that that is less than or equal to our target acquisition cost. Let me explain each of those. Our cost per sale is simply our total acquisition cost which is mostly media, but also includes other items like the cost to generate new creative, and we divide that by the direct auto unit sales in a given time period. So, we want our cost per sale again to be less than or equal our target acquisition cost. I think about our target acquisition cost simply as our maximum allowable spent we have to acquire a new customer. It\u2019s also how much we recover for acquisition expenses over the life of a policy. So it is fundamentally tied to how we price and that is obviously very important for us, but this all fits into our overall pricing and economics. Now I am going to show some data at a high level in aggregate for our business on cost per sale versus target acquisition costs. But note that we actually have the data and make decisions at a very refined segment level. So for example, a auto and home bundled customer and a high premium state is going to have a very different cost per sale and target acquisition cost than a auto insurance customer who rent in a low premium state So let\u2019s look at some data on cost per sale. So this is our cost per sale from 2010 through 2017. You can see it\u2019s actually been pretty flat over that time period despite some pretty significant increases in spend. This is actually one chart of my presentation I don\u2019t want to rock it up until the right. We are actually pretty excited that we've been able to keep cost per sale relatively flat over this time period. Perhaps the bigger story here is that we've actually seen a nice increase in our target acquisition cost over the last several years. Now remember, we generally want our cost per sale to be less than or equal to our target acquisition cost, so we actually feel great about that gap. And I think it's really a testament to many of the Destination Era strategies we've been talking about, playing out. So what's driving up that target acquisition cost? Probably, most notably, our retention has been increasing significantly. This has long been a goal of ours, and we are really seeing some nice benefits over the last several years. In fact, our retention is up about 15% relative to 2013. When you have customers stay with you longer, their lifetime profit increases. And so you can spend more to acquire new customers, and that is certainly what we're seeing with retention increasing. On a related note, we are also seeing a nice shift towards longer-retaining customers. So at the last investor call, Heather Day talked a little bit about our Robinsons segment. That is our home and auto bundlers. Now they are our smallest segment right now, but they are growing the fastest, and that's a segment that retains the longest. So you can see on this chart that Robinsons segment is growing really quickly. They retain longer as they become a bigger portion of our book. That is certainly contributing to our retention as well. So another way to look at our marketing spend efficiency is to look at our total acquisition expenses in a given year and compare that to the projected lifetime premium of a new cohort of customers coming in, in that given year. If you look at that over time, it's actually been coming down for us. So again, we feel great about this, a nice testament to the fact that our Destination Era strategies are really paying off for us. While cost per sale relative to target acquisition cost is our single most important control. We look at several other things that could potentially constrain our spending. So first of all, we need to make sure that our direct auto lifetime combined ratio is at or below a 96%. So cost per sale and target acquisition cost refers to our acquisition expenses, but we also want to make sure our other parts of the combined ratio still all fit together to be at a 96% or less. And we feel great about that. We also need to be able to service our customers well. It's rare, but there have been times where we're growing so quickly in a state that we don't feel good about the staffing levels. And we have to pull back on our growth by pulling back on media spending. This hasn't been the case recently, but we always put customers first, so we are willing to do that if we need to. And then the final constraint here is we need to make sure, as you well know, we have an aggregate, company-wide, calendar year combined ratio at 96% or less. In 2016 in particular, we were worried about our calendar year 96%, and so we did pull back on media spend that year because of that. So those are 3 key constraints. I also want to talk about a fourth one and that is really thinking about our incremental cost per sale and ensuring that, that's sufficient. When I talk about incremental cost per sale, I'm really thinking about the last dollar we spend, making sure that, that is a good use of funds relative to alternative uses of those funds. This is a harder thing to measure, but really critical for us to ensure that we are being efficient overall. So as I talk about incremental cost per sale, that's a natural, segue into our media mix. So media mix is simply of our total marketing spend, which particular media types are we spending those dollars on. Is it TV, digital, direct-mail, or other media types. So any presentation on media mix has to start with this quote attributed to John Wanamaker, many-many years ago half the money I spend on advertising is wasted. The trouble is I don't know which half. Our goal really is to try to understand every dollar and make sure we have little to no wasted media spend. So how do we accomplish that? Our main tactic in trying to really understand our incremental cost for sale and making sure that we're efficient is focusing on randomized controlled tasks or AB test. So what's that AB test in the media space? It simply means that we will have a group of consumers call them the test group or the B group that will receive one of our ads and we'll compare the results of the effect of that ad to a control group -- the A group that doesn't receive that ad. So the difference between those is the lift of that ad. Now AB testing is not new as long as we've had Progressive.com or auto quoting funnel, we've been doing AB testing and we continue to do them heavily to this day. In media however it's traditionally been quite a bit harder to actually do AB testing robustly, especially in our some of our off-line media. So I'm going to talk about that in a bit, but let me first just give you an example of why we think AB testing and incrementality is important for us. So here is a fictional car shopping site where you can see a Progressive ad in the lower right-hand corner. So traditionally how we measure the effectiveness of that digital ad, we can actually see when or customer or when a consumer goes to the site and sees our ad and then comes to Progressive.com and actually buys an auto insurance policy from us. So when we measured in that way in the past, we actually felt really great about these car shopping sites and they're effective at digital ad because we saw a lot of sales after somebody visited a car shopping site and saw our ad. However, several years ago as we thought more about incrementality, we added a new layer to this test. We had a holdout group or a control group that saw a public service announcement ad had, like this ad here for the American Red Cross, and that group we looked at how often they actually bought Progressive insurance from Progressive.com when they saw this public service announcement ad, and we found that there actually wasn't that much of a difference in terms of sales for people who saw the Progressive ad on that site, versus those that saw a public service announcement ad. So this was a great insight for us, it led us to advertise that much less on these car shopping sites because we saw that we didn't get true incremental sales from that advertising. Now the main point of this isn't specifically for this example, I think this example is unique to Progressive's particular situation and the power of our brand and our other advertising, the fact that a lot of these people who came to the car shopping site, came to Progressive.com, regardless of whether we had a digital ad. The bigger point here is that having that system in place is the best way for us to really understand the effectiveness of our ads. So I guess the other thing I'll say on here, you've likely heard various news articles over the last several years about how problems in digital media reporting, so there\u2019s some thought or other reporting issues that may cause wild miscounts of impressions or clips. This is a big problem in the digital advertising industry. We are less vulnerable to those types of issues because we are measuring incremental sales directly and we get that data on incremental sales without having to depend as much on our partners\u2019 site, so just another reason why incremental media is really important for us and incremental sales are really important for us. So let me now turn to TV, so like you've also heard a lot about TV and various things going on there. Here\u2019s some data that we look at on what\u2019s going on with TV. So if you look -- this data shows total hours per week of viewing, a traditional TV in the blue line versus non-traditional TV in the orange line. And for non-traditional TV, think of, Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. If you add those two lines up, you see that total viewing has actually been relatively constant over this timeframe, from 2002 to 2017. But we are seeing a clear shift from traditional TV to non-traditional TV. Now as an advertiser the issue with that is that non-traditional TV and again think Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, in particular generally has less advertising available than traditional TV. So that means that there are fewer impressions available in the marketplace, the supply is down. Demand for this content is actually up or at least constant which means that the cost of this media is going up and we may see that typically in CPMs or cost per thousand impressions. That\u2019s a difficult situation to be in as an advertiser. If the cost of your media is fundamentally going up and in some cases pretty significantly, but we still have to hit our three year cost per sale targets. So how do we deal with that? We have really responded by trying to be smarter about how we buy TV and building a dataset to help us to do that. So let me take you through the dataset that we are building out and how we are approaching this problem. So we have always known which Progressive ads are on which shows. Obviously we buy the media directly so we have a good view of that. The new dataset that we have is from set-top box data or think of digital video recording devices DVRs from your cable companies, they enable us, they have data that enables us to see which individual household are watching which shows. Now we\u2019ve always known that in aggregate across the population but we haven\u2019t known it previously at a household level. So if you combine those two datasets, you actually know which households are seeing which Progressive ads. We also have a great view of which households are buying Progressive policies. So if you combine that Progressive sales data with the other data I talked about through a third-party matching service. So we actually don\u2019t see any of the individual household data, that\u2019s all anonymous to us, but we are able to wending, which Progressive ads are linked to actual Progressive sales. That may seem like a pretty simple thing and honestly in the digital space we\u2019ve had this for a while but in TV this is a real step forward for us. This type of data allows us to do things like look at a frequency versus response rate curve in TV and frequency -- and let me just explain real quick, that\u2019s not how many accidents you get into in a given year, in this context it is how many Progressive TV impressions, TV ad impressions based household sees in a given week. So you can see, as they see more Progressive ads, the good news is they're more likely to buy a Progressive policy. But there is a diminishing returns nature to that curve. So that first Progressive TV ad impression is worth a lot more to us. It's much more likely to get a boost in Progressive sales than the 9th or 10th ad that a viewer may see in a given week. So the fact that that's the diminishing returns curve isn't new news, but having the specific quantification of it is very valuable for us. We also can now see for individual programs, a frequency histogram. So we know what percentage of viewers are seeing their first Progressive ad on that TV show in a given week versus their second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth. Let me share a quick example of how we actually use this to make decisions. So let's take a given program that we're advertising on with a particular Progressive creative. Let's say it has 1 million impressions, a cost of $15,000. So, it CPM is $15. We've always had that information. The new information is we now have a good view of the frequency histogram for that particular show. So we know how many viewers are seeing that ad for the first time in a week versus the 10th time. And then based on the frequency response curve I shared on the prior slide, you can actually calculate the incremental sales from that TV ad and then the incremental cost per sale as well. So let's compare that program A to a different program. So consider it maybe a high-profile award show or something like that, that might be a little bit more expensive. So this case -- in this case, program B has a CPM of $18, so more expensive than program A. But the frequency histogram is very different in this example. You have a lot more viewers who are seeing their first or second Progressive ad of the week on that program and remember. Those first impressions are so much more valuable to us. So we're actually able to put a value on those and actually generate more incremental sales from this program than program A and, actually, despite the higher cost, have a lower incremental cost per sale from program B relative to program A. So this is a really powerful data set for us and really shows how we're able to tie some great external data to our Progressive internal data and knowing our economics to make the right business call not just on cost of impressions, but really cost of incremental sales. We actually buy a lot of our media in-house. And having this type of data available to our buyers is hugely important. In many cases, as the buyers are negotiating with networks, it may mean that they simply walk away from deals if we can't hit our incremental cost per sale target. In other cases, it means we're able to negotiate harder knowing exactly what we need in terms of a price to be able to hit our goals, and it's been a really powerful benefit for us. So that's a TV example. To be clear, digital is really important to us as well and, in fact, has been growing quickly as a part of our overall media mix. In fact, digital is our single largest media spend category right now, and there are several kind of established platforms that we're on. We're also constantly testing at newer platforms. So video, we referenced before, certainly, YouTube, Hulu, others. We are advertising on and continuing to test there. Mobile is a huge portion of the new quotes that we get. Actually start on at mobile device, and so we are advertising heavily on mobile. Social is certainly another big category especially as we go into homeowners insurance. We found some new social networks that are particularly interesting to us in that arena. Games are not just for teenage boys anymore especially in kind of the mobile social era, games are huge we advertise within games but we've also created several gains from Flo or Superstore that our customers can play and are natural advertising tool for us. And then certainly voice as that really explodes recently we are testing with voice assistance and in podcast and other areas so a lot going on for us in the digital arena. So in my portion of the presentation I really focus on incremental cost per sale or the acquisition economics to bring in new customers. What's was really exciting for us as we look forward though we have new data sources a new information to make some of our media and marketing decisions. We for example, now can often understand not only the impact of an individual media type on acquiring new customers, but also its impact on retaining existing customers. I shared earlier the importance of retention in terms of driving our overall budget and our allowable target acquisition costs. Obviously, if you have an ad that can increase retention it becomes that much more valuable to us. In addition, increasingly in some media we're able to tie a specific media type to individual customers that that media type is bringing in so we can then look at the profitability of those specific customers by media type and really factor that in along with retention and the acquisition economics to a unified lifetime value model that helps us make smarter decisions in media. So for example, we may have had a media type previously that had a great low incremental cost per sale, but then we may have found the customers that we were bringing in from that media type at a high loss ratio or low retention which certainly would make us feel very differently about how much we're going to spend for that media. Where we're really going is expanding the lead that we've always had on the pricing side of our business and segmentation and really applying that to the marketing arena. I started at Progressive as a state product manager and segmentation the importance of segmentation was drilled into my head you know I think we have a ton of opportunity to really take those learnings on the pricing side of our business into marketing and ultimately get to the right message for the right person at the right time. That's not an easy task and we're not completely there yet, but we have the right team in the right systems in place to really get there over the next several years. I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Now the marketing and media engine that I talked about wouldn't work for us if we didn't have really effective creative that resonate with our target consumers. So I'm going to turn it over Cat Kolodij to talk about that. Cat Kolodij : Well, thank you, Dan, I think we've made it pretty clear line why marketing loves to work with acquisition, in fact Dan did a really job of explaining how we measure and distribute our marketing message is critical in today's highly competitive environment, now we're proud to be able to do so efficiently and effectively because of this disciplined approach to media planning and buying. As we flex our marketing agent for the Destination Era, what we say and how we say it is going to become as important as where we say it. I am thrilled to be able to take some time with you today in order to talk about how we are expanding the brand so that we are known for more than just auto, and also, how we are evolving our creative platform so that we really can manage our network just more likely to connect with more types of people. Now with everything that progresses, we\u2019ve taken disciplined approach to both message development and creative management in order to generate growth. Let\u2019s talk a bit about how. Let\u2019s begin actually by talking about how we are efficiently expanding our brand beyond being known as an auto insurer. Now a moment ago, Dan talked about the importance of driving shift in our customer mix. In order to attract additional customers segments, we actually need to improve how we talk about our products and the kinds of services that we provide in order to meet the new and emerging needs of these segments and specifically, meeting these as they evolve over their lifetime. This means we need to expand what our brand is known for, which means we have to begin with the customer segmentation. Now as a reminder, you\u2019ve probably seen us before, if you've actually been participating some of our webcasts, but we have four major consumer segments. The first two Sam and Diane have simple insurance needs. Sam is our frequent auto insurance shopper. There often driven by price. Diane are our biggest customer segment. They also are interested in price but for very different reason. Because Dianes are trying to save money in order to fund major life events. So both Sam and Diane are interesting in our price base message but for very different reasons. And both Sam and Diane will always be our core audiences. They remain vital to our growth and in fact most of our broad-based marketing is targeted to their needs. Now emerging segments are our homeowner segments, Robinsons who bundle their home and their auto together with a single insurance company and Wrights who are auto owners but they actually have insurance for their homes with a different carrier. Now homeowners as a group tend to really not want to shop a whole lot. So they are really great for our customer attention but not really good for our customer acquisition, cooperated broadcast. We\u2019ve actually talked a lot about our strategy to focus on the younger segments and we continue to do so today. Because of the inert nature of homeowners we focus on acquisition efforts on a group that we call Future Robinsons. With a more favorable opinion of Progressive and a more active shopping behavior we actually think that this segment is perfect for us and shows a great promise. Now our strategy is to attract them and retain them so that as their needs change, we actually congratulate our Future Robinsons into Robinsons. But to do this we have to first understand who are they and what do they need and in particular what are the Robinsons need? So who are the Robinsons? Representing 41% of the auto and owner households in America and 7% of our customers, now that\u2019s the percentage of households that we have, not necessarily the percentage of premiums, the Robinsons segment bundles their auto and home insurance as a single provider. Now savings do remain important to them and is a key driver of bundling. Savings is not the only they bundle. In fact many of Robinsons bundle because they do have complex insurance needs. And by keeping all of their insurance with one insurer, it actually just makes things a whole lot easier. What is interesting is many Robinsons need to insure much more than just their auto or their home. In fact, our research indicates that up to 16% of Robinsons have other things in their garage, other things that belong in our special lines product portfolio, like motorcycles or boats or RVs. The thing is that, given our leadership position in special lines, we feel really good about our ability to cover all of their needs, whether it's auto, home or even more. Now as you might imagine, it's going to take a little bit of time for us to build our reputation among the more mature Robinsons. However, the same isn't true for their younger generations. In fact, if you take a look at the future Robinsons, their needs are much more aligned to what we can offer today. Let's take a look at the chart on the right. If you take a look at the red dots with the dark outlines, those are the Robinsons. You can see their needs diverge greatly from that of the other segments. Now if you take a look at the red dot with the hash, that's actually our future Robinsons. Their needs are much more closely aligned to the other segments that we've always been very successful with. And we think because of that, we're going to be building on a solid foundation with our future Robinsons. Actually, let's take a closer look. You probably already understand that Progressive has always been known as a value brand. This is a position that we really do want to maintain in the future years. Historically we've actually put a lot of money into our savings or price-based messaging in order to build up this value reputation. But the thing about value is that it actually has two parts. Price is very important, but so too is quality. Now we know our reputation as a quality provider will be increasingly important to us as we grow. After all, I just got through telling you that quality is actually quite important for our Robinsons. Here, you'll see a chart illustrating the degree to which people believe that Progressive is actually a quality brand. Here, quality is a 10 attribute number that include statements like : cares about customer, gives me confidence, resolves problems quickly or is a company I can trust, just to name a few. Now as you can see here, we actually do fairly well across all the segments. After Sams though, future Robinsons have the second-highest perception of our quality. And after that, it's Diane's. So building on our quality perception is actually increasingly important for us as we expand beyond our Sam and Diane cores. Now to be clear, this is going to be a balance. Let me talk a little bit in what way. You also probably have seen this before. We actually measure our position in the marketplace on a 2 by 2, where savings perceptions are actually on the vertical axis and quality perceptions are on the horizontal axis. As you can see, the top 10 national carriers all cluster in the lower left quadrant with Progressive leading the pack. Now unlike Dan's caution that we don't want to see the cost per sale rocket up and to the right, we'll be okay with this perception rocketing up into the right. So let's take a closer look. Zooming in, you will see that Progressive is leading the top 4 auto carriers in price perception and is slightly lagging another major carrier in quality perception. Now to be honest, we actually do like our position here, but we do think it could get just a little bit better. So we will begin to change our messages so that we have more quality messages. And the truth is we think we have a lot of quality stories to tell, whether it's about our product or our service. However we will always be value brand. This means we will maintain what we internally call a price plus position. We will seek to improve perceptions of quality while maintaining our price perception. Now one way to do both at the same time is to consider looking at -- sorry to focus on looking at consideration. Let me talk about how. When we look at consideration across our segments, like many insurance companies we're actually doing very well with our customers. As you can see here future Robinson customers have the highest consideration of all our segments, this is a strong indication that we're going to do well as these segment graduates to Robinsons over time. Now the story actually changes just a little bit when you take a look at prospective customers. Prospective customers' consideration is significantly lagging that of our customers, now as I mentioned this is not unique to Progressive. In fact, many major carriers have a very similar picture. This is because people tend to trust their insurance carrier more than the rest of the entire industry. But if you take a look at our claims satisfaction ratings and our long customer retention among Robinsons it's really clear that our customers know and understand us far more than prospects do. In marketing it\u2019s our job to tell the story of how we take care of those customers more broadly, so we can shape the opinions of both our customers and prospective customers at the same time. Now doing so with discipline is going to be extremely important, I want to take a few minutes to talk about how we might do just that. What you can see here is a chart with the five major attributes that actually are most correlated with consideration. In other words these are the things that people believe are true about a carrier that they would consider for their insurance needs. Let's take the first attribute. Our model shows, that if you believe Progressive is for people like me then you are many, many times more likely to consider us for your insurance needs. So how we and other insurers doing against these five drivers of consideration, well, the answer is just okay. If you take a look at the chart you'll see that between 20% and 30% of people believe that these attributes are true of any of the major carriers with only one carrier doing well against is for people like me. So what does this mean for us, first there's a big opportunity here to focus on messages and our stories on things that are more likely to help people believe that we're this kind of company. In fact we've recently done just that, we've increased the number of messages that we are delivering in mass media so that they are more aligned with homeowner insurance. Why do we do this, it's because the easiest way to show that we are for people like me is to talk more about the products that people like me need and for many of those that\u2019s home. It's one of the reasons that we actually increased that message to the almost 40% of the market with a target of 40% by the end of the year. Second, we think we have an opportunity to focus innovations to solve for these needs so that in the future we'll have more stories accounts that are more likely to drive up consideration. Now don't get me wrong, we actually do believe and are beginning to tell stories about our products and services today that we think will do just that. But believe me when I say it, Dan and I are very excited about the possibility of the new stories that we will be telling about our innovations in the years to come. Now I am going to shift gears for a second, talk about how quality is important, not just in our consumer marketing but also with the relationships that we have with our agent partners. Now you heard Dan talk a lot about our direct marketing business and that\u2019s clearly important for us as a company. But it\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s important for our growth. Agents have always played a critical role in everything at Progressive. After all we do know the preferred customers, do tend to trust and like the advice and counsel that their agents give them. Now we feel fortunate that we are actually the most advertised brand in the independent agent channel and we know that from speaking with agents, this goes a really long way. We know that because agents feel like we have a brand that people can trust and because they believe that our brand is getting better over the years, they have greater confidence recommending Progressive to their customers. But today as good partner, our brand reputation is not just enough. We have to be a supportive business partner too. And it\u2019s for this reason that we will continue to be investing in the things that we know are agents\u2019 need, like more advancements in technology, building stronger business relationships with our agent partners and improving customer service. To transform our agency channel was actually just recently launched another brand campaign to help tell a different kind of story of the power of the partnership with Progressive. Let me show you just a couple of examples. This campaign is called Agents Of and it actually turns the camera from focusing on us to focusing on our agents. And we think it does a really nice job of telling the story from an agent\u2019s perspective while occasionally talking about the benefits of partnering with Progressive. We think this partnership is going to be critical in our future and we will continue to do everything we can to improve it. One of the things we have been doing to improve it, is by doing optimization to drive referral traffic from Progressive.com to our independent agents. In fact, we have seen since 2016 a 52% increase in finding agent activity on our website. We are really happy to see this and hope that this growth will continue overtime because we know that our agents play a very important role in preferred customer\u2019s life and we will make sure to do everything we can to support it. So I hope that from the first part of my presentation you understand that we are doing everything that we can to expand our message so that we tell stories about the things, the products and services that these new and emerging segments need notes from us. I am going to shift gears a little bit and talk about our campaign management. Now for anyone that has ever heard any of our broadcast before when we talked about marketing you know that we manage our brand like a network, and we will continue to do so overtime. And as most of you know the centerpiece of our network has always historically been Flo. Over the past 10 years, Flo has played an important role in establishing our brands and making it recognizable in households across America. She has always been a representation of our employees and a reflection of our culture as being approachable, open and honest. We\u2019re very grateful that Flo has helped us to tell the story that's been allowed us to differentiate our brand and what is obviously a highly competitive category. The thing is, is that Flo is both a strength and a weakness. She is highly recognizable, and in fact, she triggers a memory of what everyone already knows us to be. That means they often think about how we make it easy to shop and save for insurance, specifically auto insurance. Now while that's a really great thing, it makes it very hard to deliver other kinds of messages in a way that will get attention. What you're going to hear today is a story of how we're managing our network by broadening the campaigns that we have in order to have different kinds of campaigns that might be more relevant to different people at different points in their lives so that we can make sure to build the core, but also expand to meet the needs of our emerging segments. To do so, we actually have three campaigns that we orchestrate together. Now most people when they think of our brand, they think of Superstore. In fact though, we have three campaigns. Yes, Superstore is definitely one of them. And when we talk about Superstore, we mean it's a campaign that you usually recognize from us. It usually has Flo or other shop assistants and/or The Box. We will continue to have this campaign in markets because it will continue to be our shopping campaign. We will continue to deliver stories about how we make it easy to shop and save for your auto insurance because that's important to our core. But what's equally important is telling a different kind of story for the different kinds of audiences. So let me talk about the two campaigns that we're managing alongside Superstore. The first is something that we call \"Funny Because It's True\". This is a platform that we consider a relevancy platform. It's designed to help people take a second look at Progressive so they maybe wonder, do I really know all that they can have to offer. The third campaign is one that we're calling Extend. Now the Extend platform is our service platform. It's designed to help people see themselves, staying at Progressive. These are three platforms, three strategies all designed to expand the brands for the Destination Era and each playing its unique role. I'd like to take a few minutes to do a deeper dive into each, starting with the Superstore. Now the Superstore, as I mentioned before, is the world of Flo. It's comprised of a store, characters and icons. Now as I mentioned, this campaign will continue to be important to us as long as it continues to perform well and contributes to our business growth. Celebrating 10 years this year, marketing will continue to evolve this campaign to ensure that it continues to be relevant. Now, here couple of ways that we're doing so. You've recently seen greater integrations with pop culture, to make sure that we are continuing to have a relevant conversation and maybe introduce something that's me, more me, me worthy. You've also seen us introduce other characters, characters that might look a little bit more like the kinds of customers that we're hoping to acquire. We've increasingly been creating new situations like Superworld where somebody in a man cave is turning white just like it's turning into a Superstore, or lab, where we launched our HQX or HomeQuote Explorer platform. We think lab is a great platform for us to talk about future innovations. And finally, we have spinoffs. These are ads that are driven by characters that originated with Flo but have gone on to be the future or the star of a different creative execution, good examples of this are our Rivals or The Box. By changing how we tell our Superstore stories, we keep the concept fresh. By treating Flo like more than a character, we think we can have the brand live on for even longer. Let's discuss how. What you can see here is something that we call the Mark of Flo. This was actually introduced a few years ago internally, but actually has become much more important for us over the years because the Mark of Flo is helping us transition Flo from a character on television to an icon that can move into perpetuity. Though it has only appeared in a couple of spots, people are already recognizing the Mark of Flo as belonging to us, in fact in recent research 61% of people aged 18 or older recognize the Mark of Flo as belonging to Progressive or as being Flo. This is really good considering that these numbers are rivaling back of icons that have been in the market for years or even decades longer. So we feel really good about the promise that the Mark of Flo represents for us as a brand. What even more powerful is the kinds of attributes that people associate with the Company that might have a mark just like this. In fact asking the same people what they would think about a company that has a Mark like Flo, they say, well I will believe it has friendly personnel and accessible service or that it would care for customers or is it for people like me remember an important driver of consideration or even as an industry leader. Now over the next few years marketing will continue to build equity in our mark so that Flo will withstand the test of time. Now with every, as with everything else that we do we're' going to do this with discipline. The Mark of Flo will be a symbol of our promise to customers appearing as the Flotection badge, reminding customers that we will protect them and the things that they hold dear. She will also fulfill her ultimate destiny to be an assistant appearing in all the channels that are emerging where people are going for service and for help. In fact Tricia already mentioned an early example of this with our Flo Chatbot app in the messenger app. Now this was built on an AI platform and is a highly branded virtual assistant that answers questions you might have about insurance. What is Flo's favorite color or even start a quote. What we love most about it, is that Flo's personality her approachability and her spirit will continue to live on even if it's in the virtual channels where people are increasingly going for help. Now the service brand that we've been talking back for years is our Extend platform. Now we know that our customer brand will become increasingly important as we look to retain more and more of our customer base. And we will continue to optimize our Extend program in order to do that. Take for example the email that you see here. These are our renewal emails and they were launched in order to help customers see the value of the relationship that they have with us and to build confidence that even as their needs change, we will have what it takes to make them happy so that may stay. Now this brand this platform was actually launched in creative communications and focused on the areas where people were either the most confused, felt the most frustrated or in fact were defecting with us from us the most. This means that we are focusing Extend on boarding renewal and talking more about our loyalty program. We feel really good about the partnership between marketing and the customer experience group in building a new branded experience that today has shown great promise and an ability to extend relationships and extend PLE, but what's even more exciting are the places where we're brining Extend. Because of their service brand, it should not just be reserved for customer marketing. In fact, with the launch of Progressive Answers, we brought the -- sorry Progressive Answers, let me explain what that is, is a website that actually allows for people to ask question they might have about insurance and we will give them simple answers ones that they can actually understand. We think that there\u2019s a great opportunity to bring the Extend platform into the broader perspective consumer space, so that we can show people just like to be taken care of as a customer of Progressive. Now finally, I want to talk about the third campaign. It\u2019s dubbed Funny Because It\u2019s True. This platform was actually meant to encourage people to take a second look at Progressive, using humor to talk about a human truth that is highly recognizable. This campaign is meant to be a bridge from the humor and not taking ourselves too seriously aspect that people have come to love about the Superstore and Progressive brand overall. Our Funny Because It\u2019s True campaign launched with an online video quite a few years ago. Today, it has successfully helped gem homeowners to quite take another look at Progressive, so that they might see that they really haven\u2019t outgrown us even if their insurance needs have become a little bit more complicated. Focused on moments when they are experiencing some kind of light transitions, these moments that we call grown up moments, this campaign is helping to position Progressive as being there and helping them navigate change over their life. Now recently our campaign has focused on the moment that you first become a homeowner. With the launch Parentamorphosis, this campaign takes a human truth that when you start to realize the responsibilities of owning a home, you start to become a little bit like your parents. With the success of this campaign, we actually continue to evolve it with a launch of Prized Possessions. This campaign was driven by the insight that you have a couple of things in your household that are really precious to you and maybe nobody else understands it, but we believe that it\u2019s important to you finish it be protective and we assure to help you with that. You can expect to be a lot more of these campaigns in the future, particularly with an expansion into a campaign for the small business owners. Now Tricia had mentioned that we often get questions about well, I have seen a bit less the Flo, how are these campaigns without Flo doing? I am really happy to stand here telling you that Parentamorphosis, which was launched across both digital and broadcast channels is among our highest performing campaigns in terms of both auto and home quotes. And as a result, we are actually graduating the Parentamorphosis campaign into our Anchor campaign. Let me talk quickly about how we are doing just this. When we think about our campaign and we\u2019re managing it like a network, we have our Anchor campaign valued Superstore both Extend and Funny Because It\u2019s True are Pilots. As the pilots continually show performance, we will graduate these to the status of Anchor which is exactly what we did with Parentamorphosis. And as this graduation happens, we will actually be able to test into new and emerging campaigns to fill their spots. So Dan told you about the complexities of managing both media and message across a complex ecosystem. Let me quickly step you through an example of that for Future Robinsons. We launched heavy strong stories in awareness channels, develop content to drive up consideration and digital channels for people go to seek for information. And finally, make sure that we had quoting creative in channels where they go for shopping. We think by orchestrating our message and our campaign across the different channels that people are naturally going to for information; we're going to be able to expand our brand efficiently over time. So in summary, as we increase media spend to drive new business growth by diversifying message and launching more relevant creative, we will drive up demand and shift the customer mix to higher retaining customers, which, in turn, will help increase our customer retention, allowing for a more efficient growth in our book of business, which, in turn increases our efficiency so we can invest more in media. It's something we like to call the virtuous cycle, and something we're very proud of and will continue to nurture over time. So thank you for your time, please give us a few minutes as we set up for Q&A. Julia Hornack : [Operator Instructions] Before taking our first participant from the conference call line, Tricia and John would like to answer a question that is likely on the top of many minds. Tricia Griffith : So John and I are were talking a couple of weeks ago and considering a lot of the questions we're seeing around the Tax and Jobs Act of 2017, so we thought we'd get out in front of it and how we think about it really from all three constituencies, which all we are both aware both customers, employees and stockholders. So we're going to answer sort of a high level. If you have other questions, we can answer them. We also have our resident expert, Jim Cruzman in the audience, if you want a deep dive into anything tax-related. So let's think about investors. So as a growing company, we need more capital for more growth and to satisfy our regulators. So any profits will help with that. It's always our first choice to reinvest in the Company. In addition, our annual variable dividend considers the tax rate. So all things equal, we'll be about 21% higher. So that's really how we think about it from an investor perspective, growing the Company and our annual dividend. When we think about customers, we sort of put customers and communities together. So we have a Progressive foundation. It's been in force for over 15 years, and our employees really like it because they're able to give and get a match up to $3,000. In fact, the average amount we paid out of the foundation over the last five years has been $4 million a year, and they can give us as long as it's a not for profit of 501(c)(3) to either national or local communities, a lot of people love giving to the local communities, which, of course, where our customers are, to churches, to schools. And so, we continue to fund the foundation. And because it's based on underwriting income it will, also all things equal, increase about 21%. In addition, it is the Tax and Jobs Act. And so since the beginning of 2016 to today, we have hired over 13,000 new external hires. So having those jobs, and they're not just in Cleveland, they're around the country, specifically in the claims organization and the CRM organization, having those robust jobs, we believe, really help the communities that we serve. And lastly our employees, so we are market-based for both compensation and benefits and will continue to be market based. As the market changes, we will shift and we'll watch any inflationary trends. We'll look for key indicators like high turnover in an area of people not accepting our jobs. We no longer ask for your prior compensation, but people might give us anecdotal information, so we are prepared to shift as the market shifts. In addition and this is related to the tax plan, but how Progressive has always thought about employees is really to our gain share plan. So, I know a lot of companies gave one-time bonuses which I think is great. We've had a gain share plan for over 25 years and in fact last year the gain share of 1.79 our medium bonus was $8,100. So our philosophy has always been when we gain we share with our employees and our shareholders. So that gives you a kind of an overview of how we've been thinking about the tax changes and now if you want to open it up for other questions that would be great. Julia Hornack : Great, Latoya, we will now take our first question from the conference call lines. Operator : The first question comes from Ian Gutterman of Balyasny. Mr. Gutterman, your line is now is now open. Ian Gutterman : So I guess first just to follow up on what you're talking about on the employee growth. I think there was a newspaper article around you and they suggested, you were hiring 7,500 new people, which is I guess a 20 plus percent growth rate and given there's quite a little bit of wage in there too. Should I -- does that put pressure on expense ratio or I'm reading too much into that? Is that a gross number, not a net number? There's attrition that offsets that just how should I think about that? Tricia Griffith : Yes, Ian, there will some attrition to offset that. What we've been trying to do is grow in customer facing organizations, we've been trying to keep our non-servicing headcount fairly flat and add when we need to. But again as we grow the ratio of our premium, so as we've grown and added people, it\u2019s worked out. So it hasn't put the pressure you would think on our expense ratio or LAE. Ian Gutterman : So then just one other topic real quick is on capital, I think there was some language in the K about essentially the strain from some growth, and you mentioned maybe having to raise some debt. I guess I was hoping you could give a little more detail on that. I guess as I was -- I was just taking sort of consensus numbers just as a proxy and it looks like, if I look at where premium growth in street models that requires adding near 3 to 1, as much as a 1.5 billion capital for growth, which is greater than your dividend capacity. So when I look through that, it seems that I shouldn't expect much of a stack dividend this year. Is that the right way to think about it that essentially earnings growth is going to fund the growth and this have to be all the kind of small and the debt will pay the corporate dividend, the debt raise? Tricia Griffith : Here's how I would think of it, and John you can weigh in. Earnings are material source of our capital and when that's not enough than you can expect that we'd go to the capital markets for more. So we do have a lot of earnings coming in, but that's how we think of it. And literally John and I, and Bill Cody from our Capital Management, and Katherine Brennan our treasurer, we talk about capital all the time in terms of how we can continue our growth knowing the regulatory and constraints you put on the 3 to 1 on the auto. And so, we think about that all the time, but earnings will be a material source of our growth. But again, we can expect to go to the capital markets, if in fact we needed more. John Sauerland : And to that, you mentioned our dividend, our dividend is an annual variable dividend and is tied to our gain share score, which is a function of growth and profit across our business lines, multiplied times a third of after-tax abstract underwriting income. So, we have established that dividend program for the year, and we would use any capital beyond that obviously as efficiently as possible and today that means reinvesting in the business. Operator : The next question will come from of Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Mr. Ransom, your line is now open. Gary Ransom : I had a question on the announcement that came across recently about Uber and your relationship with Uber, this has expanded. I know you went into Texas a couple of years ago, but you haven\u2019t talked about it recently and it seems like it\u2019s an important source of additional data that can be used in commercial lines and may be there\u2019s some overlap with what you\u2019ve learned in Snapshot with that. And I wondered if you could just update on, how you are looking at that program? What it might mean for your data analytics in your long run? And any other thoughts you have on that program? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Gary. Yes, so we started with Uber in Texas in 2015 when it was a pilot on the commercial side, and we\u2019ve been learning a lot and of course this moved from pilot last year to full board and that was added on as of today Arizona, Colorado and Florida. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s necessarily related to an UBI, I would kind of bifurcate though. But I would say that we\u2019re learning a lot about the transportation industry and the T&C industry. And so, we are really excited to continue to work with Uber and add on three more states. Again because it\u2019s new to us, we are going to take a measured approach. And I think we are really excited about that. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily correlate it to our usage-based insurance. Gary Ransom : Maybe you could talk about a little bit -- then about the usage-based. Is there anything that you\u2019ve learned or discovered, just update of how powerful you think your Snapshot program has become? Tricia Griffith : Yes, what I would say is we are really happy about the mobile device specifically on the direct side and the take rate on the mobile device. And so, we are learning more and more and I would say we are learning more and more about distracted driving. We are not ready to use that data in ringing but we are learning a lot, so more to come on that. It\u2019s going to take a while before you gather in and our customers still have the option to have the dongle or the mobile. But we are finding, we are gathering a lot of data on the mobile, and we are learning I would say very interesting segmentation things around distracted driving. Julia Hornack : Right, Latoya, I am actually going to take a question from the webcast now. The next question is frequency versus surprising benefit in 2017, and one that you probably didn\u2019t plan for in fact I think we\u2019ve said we didn\u2019t plan for. How do you view giving back some of -- the possibility of giving back some of that critical \"excess\" profit to further accelerate growth? Tricia Griffith : Yes, so when we think about -- yes, one, it\u2019s really hard to understand and predict frequency and in fact -- so over the last trailing 12, we have been -- we had a frequency much more negative than the competition. Third quarter 2017, the rest of the industry kind of changed a little bit as we saw compete fair results. So we are seeing as an industry. Again, we don\u2019t necessarily bake that into our rate. We don\u2019t see where we are at as of the end of 2017 or even January in excess profits. We think about it as continuing to invest in the business. And again, this is very capital intensive when you think of the regulatory capital we have to have. But in addition, I might see differently if we weren\u2019t growing. So we have that balance of growth and profit. And so I believe when you\u2019re in a really sweet spot and able to roll really fast and make at least $0.04, remember it\u2019s at least $0.04, we want to do both. And if either one of those change, as you know from 2016, we will monitor that and react to that. But we're going to need capital to grow. Julia Hornack : Thank you. Latoya, if we could take the next caller from the line please? Operator : Yes, the next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith at UBS. Mr. Meredith, your line is now open. Brian Meredith : Tricia, I'm just curious, as I look at your loss ratios and loss ratios going forward. Are you seeing a benefit from the Robinsons to on your loss ratios kind of increasing the mix? And is that perhaps maybe mitigating some of the kind 10-year effect that you typically see with the growth you're putting on? Tricia Griffith : We would say that our Robinsons are considered lower pure premium, in that they're less likely to get into a loss. The hard part is we look at everything so granularly in terms of states, channels, the products, and I think you would see -- what you'll see probably more movement on, when you think about ratios, would be more on the LAE or NAER side. Do you want to add anything to that? John Sauerland : Yes, I think you start hitting on the fact that we priced all segments to a common combined ratio target. And the preferred segment, we look at both the loss side as well as the expense side, so both of those are considered in the pricing. There are some segments that drive higher expenses. We build that into the prices as well. So you will find segments for our business that have actually lower loss ratios, higher expense ratios than perhaps the Robinsons in aggregate. But the point is, is that we are looking very granularly at each segment and making sure that we're pricing to the same lifetime combined ratio target. Brian Meredith : And then my second question, I'm just curious, going back to the tax stuff, and thanks for the -- your answers there on that one. But my question is more from a regulatory perspective. How do you deal with regulatory potential pushback? Do you expect it, particularly when you make rate filings? You've obviously got very attractive margins and returns right now. Are we going to see pushback? And how do you respond to that? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I haven't -- it's too soon to tell would be the answer. I haven't really seen -- we have good relationships in the 51 jurisdictions that we're in. Really, a regulator's job is to make sure that we are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. And if they look at that and they -- we have actuarial justification that should really be the job of the regulator. And so again, it's too soon to tell, but we have not had any pushback at this juncture. Julia Hornack : Latoya, can we take the next caller please? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Kinar, your line is open. YaronKinar: I had a couple of questions. First, on the Snapshot mobile device, Tricia, it sounds like one of the aspects of the device or the app -- sorry, may give you access to is distracted driving behavior. Are there any other real significant differences between the data collected on the mobile app as opposed to the dongle? Tricia Griffith : I would say it likes it's same as the dongle, and then we're able to see if you are -- if it's handheld, a call or an app and hands-free. So we're able to see that, and not sort of using that for rating but just understanding that, as well as location. So those are the things. Again, we're not rating that. We're just gathering data to kind of understand if it correlates to different losses depending on what we see. YaronKinar: And then the other question I had was more on the agency side. So I think you had added about 1,500 new agencies in 2017. Can you maybe talk about, what the main drivers for that were? And then is there any difference in the profile of these agencies. Tricia Griffith : No, I wouldn't say so, I mean we have a very broad distribution of agents and if we believe they follow our values and they will sell our products then we will likely have them be a part of the Progressive family. So they're kind of straight across the country 35,000 so, some come and go but I wouldn't say they have anything necessary. The different agents that we talked about in the past really around are platinum agents which we give a different commission base to and access to annual policies on the auto side as well as the home and the ability to earn more depending on how many Robinsons that they get. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Mr. Shields your line is open. Meyer Shields : John, I want to sneak in a little bit to one of your early responses where you talked about pricing to lifetime profits. Does that imply a bigger initial I'm going to call it new business penalty on the Robinsons because they're expected to stick around for a longer time? John Sauerland : Great question, it depends on the channel, it depends on the segments. Certainly in the direct channel, we have a material \"new business penalty.\" We don't think of it as a penalty we think of that as the cost of acquiring customers that we're going to keep for a long time. And we again are pricing in the target acquisition costs that Dan was talking about across the life of that policy holders. So even though we will run well above a 100 combined ratio for a new direct customer we are going to recoup that over the life of the customer. So, the Robinsons into that spectrum certainly is generally speaking a longer retaining end of the spectrum, so we have longer to recoup those costs. We've normally then would be able to have a smaller load if you will on each policy term, but again the new business combined ratio for direct is going to be far higher, in agency channel there's far less disparity across expenses for new and renewal customers and in the Robinson the spectrum is actually less disparity on the lost performance as well. Relative to sort of the same end of the spectrum so there's certainly a new business penalty for growing we think the lifetime combines for all those customers are well within our targets so we're very excited to be growing at the pace we are and delivering the calendar year combined ratio results we have as well. Meyer Shields : Okay and I guess, that's very helpful, second question is. Are there any calendar year constraints that you're enduring right now? John Sauerland : Right now calendar, our calendar year constraint is the same it\u2019s always been, it's 96 calendar year growth fast as we can as long as we can service our customers. So when we were in a similar position a couple years ago with being able to get out in front of hiring and make sure that we could service our customers and we we're had this competitive price and a great product our 8 to 4 product on the street. We really wanted to make sure to capture as much of the market as we could. Of course, you remember in the fall of 2016, we pulled back on advertising because of the CAT losses and that's always our constraint. Every calendar year, our constraints are going to be 96 that is a constant its part of our culture, it's not a sale for, and so that will obviously be a constraint. Clearly, right now, one month in its results. We are not seeing that as a constraint. But again we\u2019ve got one month of results in. It\u2019s a long year. We don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to happen with another nature. I wouldn\u2019t have thought the 2017 would have been a more difficult CAT year than 2016, but of course it was. So that\u2019s really our biggest constraint is our profit goal and making sure we can take care of our customers. And we have been very, very happy. I wrote in my letter of -- what I call our recruiting machine. Not just the amount of people we have been able to hire but the caliber of people.  When I am ended doing hire classes, I am amazed. And one of the ways we look at that especially in the claims organization is how their accuracy is going. So that\u2019s a large part of what we pay out in loss cause and our accuracy continues to be at record level. So that\u2019s really what excites us about having few constraints right now. It\u2019s a good time here. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Mr. Zaremski, your line is open. Michael Zaremski : I had a follow-up to the earlier ride-share question but along different lines. So specifically what\u2019s in the personal auto segment, are you able to comment on whether you feel ride-share services are impacting the loss cause? And I guess one of the reasons I\u2019d ask is because an increasing number of insured drivers are making ride-share services a part of their lifestyle, and I\u2019m also pretty sure your client base is relatively more tech savvy than many peers as well? Tricia Griffith : Yes, we have a personal auto endorsement in 22 of our states. So we always offer them and ask when we are getting navigation as well as a loss if you\u2019re an Uber or Lyft driver. And so we do strive to flush out, and it helps to understand if we need to charge them differently, add an endorsement that is covered. It\u2019s really hard to understand fraud that could happen to people on it, it\u2019s actually why we are offering endorsement. And so I think we believe you\u2019re asking the right questions to the right people at the right time. John Sauerland : It\u2019s very hard I think to tease out what you are getting at. We do generally younger clientele than some of our competitors certainly on the direct side of business. We think we skew more towards urban areas where we would expect there would be higher penetration of T&C users. But it\u2019s very hard to definitively understand, if and to what degree people using Uber, Lyft et cetera at different times of the evening or weekend are helping a loss experience at all. But it certainly is a great hypothesis, but one that we really can\u2019t answer with any surety. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Ms. Greenspan, your line is now open. Elyse Greenspan : My first question was related on, in your Tricia you mentioned an internal strategy council that you guys are forming on. I just was hoping to get some additional color there. Is this in response to autonomous vehicle? Is there something else in the industry? And how would that potentially include Progressive potentially expanding and to underwriting its small commercial policies on to our own balance sheet or potentially include additional M&A? Tricia Griffith : Okay, so if you recall a couple of webcast ago, I went over sort of our Horizon concepts that we have Horizon 1, which we talked a lot about today, execute Horizon 2 which was Expand and also we talked a lot about the commercial that you talked about a little bit Elyse with Bob in small business. What I am having the strategy council really focused on is Horizon 2, which is explored. So you can think of it as assumed there's a day where all these vehicles are autonomous or half of that et cetera, so we're modeling out opportunities for us. And so right now, the Strategy Council is fairly new. John and I meet with them very regularly. It's a group of 10 folks within the Company. Andrew Quigg, who I think you have met, is doing it as a side to his job of retention and PLE. I mean, we have other people taking some of his work. He's doing a tremendous job. And the team around him, we picked because they had a diversity of a careers for Progressive, and so we're able to leverage those careers to kind of think about what are things that we do really well and if we want to either grow our revenue or replace revenue; if the market gets smaller, what are opportunities we can do. So we're excited about this council. Again, we're pretty new there, 90 days in. So I'll have more to come as we flesh out more. But we're really excited, and I've been very impressed with their work today. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And my second question, you guys have been growing a lot over the past couple of years. As some of your peers have been retrenching, taking a lot more rate as they've seen pretty high frequency and, in some cases, severity trends. As we think about the overall, it seems like most players in the space are more or less at peak rate taking levels will take less rate and look to grow in '18. As you envision that environment, how does that play into how you think about continuing to go after the Robinson cohort and growing your policies in force? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I mean, so we've always talked about rate in terms of not having to rate shock our customers. When we've had to do that, you see PLE decline. So we've got out ahead of rates, probably 2015. And we've often said, it's better to have smaller bites of the apple. So 3 1 is better than 1 3 in terms of increase, and so we're really comfortable with our rate right now. And we have watched our competition, and that's what happens. And that's why shopping occurs. This hard market, we've been privileged to get those customers while they're shopping. And because we have a competitive rate, we've been able to grow. So at this juncture, I don't know, obviously, what all the competition is doing. Very few companies when we look at statutory data, actually, I think as of Q3, only 2 companies were growing profitably. And so I imagine those companies are going to want to get out in front of rate. And hopefully, as people shop, we will continue to be the recipient of those customers, Robinsons, of course, but actually, every customer. We want every Sam, Diane Wright, Robinson we can get as long as we can service them. We have obviously talked about the Robinsons a lot, because that's really the customer that we want based on our acquisition of ASI on the agency channel and working with other affiliated \u2013 unaffiliated companies on the direct side. So we'll continue to push those. But I think Cat talked a little bit about our changing creative. And really when you think about the Parentamorphosis and owning your first home, that's really addressed to the Robinsons. And so we are seeing -- we're seeing that happen. So we're going to continue with more creative around trying to retain more Robinsons. Julia Hornack : We actually only have one more caller in the queue, which is perfect given our time right now. So, Latoya, can you introduce last caller please? Operator : Yes. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt at William Blair. Mr. Schmitt, your line is now open. Jeff Schmitt : Just a quick question on some of the comments from state insurance commissioners, recently about passing on the benefits of the new tax rate or the lower tax rate on to consumers; do you have any view on the likelihood of that or a sense on what that impact may be? Tricia Griffith : It's hard to say -- it's hard to say, there's a few states out there that will likely do that and we'll react to that. Remember, our combined ratio goal is pre-tax, so our CR496 vehicle is pre-tax. So we will work with the department to make sure we have a product that the citizens of the states. Again, our hope is that once regulators regulate in terms of what I talked about in terms of not being -- not having our rates inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. But again we're nimble and we'll work with it to make sure that we provide a good rate for the customers and not change our stands on our 96 combined ration goal. Jeff Schmitt : Okay, and then I'm not sure if you mentioned it, but did you say what the growth of the platinum agents was in '17 and what percentage of total agents is that now? Tricia Griffith : It sells us small percent, we didn't say, it grew must say like 2000ish. John Sauerland : In terms of agents it agent headcounts, that's a reasonable number, Yes. Tricia Griffith : Yes, it's around 2000-2500 somewhere in there. We sort of stopped mentioning it just because we're really focusing on the agents that we have and making sure they have all the tools necessary to get those Robinsons. Again when we rolled out the Robinson model, we really rolled it out as a scarcity model because we wanted to be able to have these agents really wanted to have access to these customers. So they access that was great and then did they want to have us be number one in their shops. So we're really working now, especially as we integrated the company's, really working on making sure they had everything they need to have us be the number one choice in their agencies. So it's less about adding so many more, I'm sure we'll add more this year but it is really more about the ones that we have really making sure that they have what they need to provide more Robinsons for us. Julia Hornack : Well, we've actually exhausted our scheduled time, so that concludes the event.",

Susan Griffith : Good afternoon, and welcome to Progressive Second Quarter Webcast. We are thrilled to be able to talk to you about the investments we've been making for and on behalf of our customers and our customer relationship management group. If you read my letter to shareholders, I outlined several other investments that we're making on behalf of our customer on the claim side.  We've been talking about for a couple of years, and we are excited to tell you that a lot of the things that we had in place were come to fruition, and we're really pleased with how they're coming along. But before we get to that, I have to mention an accomplishment that has been over 10 years in the making, and that is getting our #3 ranking in the private passenger auto back. It's been a lot of hard work, and we're really excited and thrilled to be able to celebrate this accomplishment. And of course, it leads us to get even closer to our ultimate vision of becoming consumer's #1 choice. So we're really proud of that accomplishment, and I want to take just a moment to thank the over 36,000 Progressive people for their hard work, their dedication and their commitment to our core values. I want to thank our shareholders for their confidence in us. And ultimately, I want to thank our customers that were so privilege and honor to serve. So let me set up the day. You will have seen in this construct before, this is the third time we've talked about it. This is what we call our 4 cornerstones. Our core values, who we are; our purpose, why we're here. Our purpose statement is true to our name progressive; our vision, where we're headed, I just talked about that becoming consumer's #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance; and our strategy, how we're going to get there. We focused a lot on the strategy because that's really kind of the meat of how we will achieve our mission. We have 4-strategy pillars.  Today, we're going to hit on 2 of them. The first line is meeting the broader needs of our customers throughout their lifetime. We want to be available, where, when and how customers want to shop and be served. You're going to hear a lot about that today, because really not about us saying, here is what we're giving to give and customers you kind of figure out how to work with us, we really follow the customer. We'll continue to evolve, as technology involves and customer's needs evolve. The other pillar we're going to talk about is maintaining a leading brand, specifically experiences that instill confidence.  When the customer calls to add a policy, add a coverage, have a claim, at the end of that experience, we want them to say, I'm so confident, I made the right choice when I chose Progressive. That is so critical to us. And so those 2 wearily be on the footprint of what we're talking about today. I'm going to have two of my direct reports in tagteam this deep dive session into our customer relationship management our focus.  John Murphy, you haven't met in before, but he has been around for Progressive for over 25 years. The majority of his career was spending claims, and I've known for decades. He lived around the country in many high-level leadership positions and ultimately, before becoming the President of CRM, ran our customer service centers. When I met John and have watched his career along the way, what I really noticed about him is his passion for the customer, and his ability to always kind of see what we needed to do to continue to innovate and be more creative. And he has done just that in CRM. He has been in CRM as a President for 3 years, and I'm really thrilled to be able to have him highlight what he has been working on.  He will tag team with our Chief Information Officer, Steven Broz. You've met Steven before in this setting. Steve grew up in the Product Group, ultimately going into GM of our personal lines. He has also been in IT as a project Manager and claims is a process Manager, and now he his leading ID for the last couple of years.  You might ask why I have these 2 together. It really is about establishing how we work at Progressive in terms of the business and IT, and we're really handing together. When we think about investments, especially with the customer. And you'll see how when they speak, we just -- we all the things that are about our business, and we don't separate that. In fact, we often recall the technology company that happened to sell insurance, and you will see that technology the underpinning, but it's not separate. It is together, and that's the thing what makes our whole team really powerful that we look at everything together to make sure that we continue to profitably grow. I hope you enjoy reading in the shareholders letter. We're very proud of our results for this quarter and actually year-to-date and more proud of the momentum we have and the excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead office. So with that, John Murphy come up and join me and talk about what he has been working on, the results of that and just going forward how we think about our customers. John Murphy : Great. Thank you, Tricia, and good afternoon, everyone. Over the past 3 years, we've been on a very deliberate journey to customer centricity. No longer just auto an insurance company, but instead a customer company that really specializes in insurance products and services to meet customers needs where as they long as they have them. To fuel ongoing sustained and now accelerating growth, we've may retaining our existing customers as large a priority as acquiring new ones. And that business mandate is really the catalyst for the changes that Steve and I are going to discuss today. So we're going to start with some foundational adjustments that are attended to position us really well near- and long-term for success. And then we will refresh you on our preferred measure of retention, policy life expectancy as well as how we think about it and approach it. We'll spend much of our time on the technology-related investments that we've made for or on behalf of our customers, going across the lifecycle, while also giving you some insights into how we choose what we're going to invest in. And then finally, we're going to share how customers are rewarding us for the improvements that we delivered. And I think, you will see that the return on these investments has been really substantial. Now historically speaking, sustained improvements in retention have been elusive for us as they have been for many others. Knowing that we wanted to see both significant and sustainable progress going forward, we felt it necessary to make some foundational adjustments to position us to deliver in that matter.  Now this list that you will see here is far from comprehensive, but we want to give you just review into few meaningful changes that we've made. We're going to start with our company-wide mission. So we've long had this objective to become #1. Our excellence in marketing and new business acquisition practices have really allowed us to appeal to large segments of consumers and increase market share.  Previously, our company-wide mission to become consumer's #1 choice for auto insurance. And this is how we've evolved. To become consumer's #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance, this current statement really reflects the understanding that in order to become a destination insurer, we must have the products and the services to meet customers needs as they move across the insurance journey. We must go beyond new business, where we've been best-in-class for many years and deliver a more compelling comprehensive customer value proposition that really allows us to become the true destination insurer. And so to this end, we made some major changes to our business, products and services.  So as you know we've made the purchase of ASI, an acquisition that we have been extremely pleased with and we've rebranded at Progressive home. With Progressive home, we have broad geographic coverage in both the agency and direct channels and are position to offer the sophisticated rate segmentation that is really been the hallmark of our auto product for coverage that protects our customers most valuable asset. This acquisition has been instrumental to our substantial Robinson growth and the mix shift that we're going to talk about later in this presentation.  Now of course, to fulfill this destination vision, we needed to offer a breadth of products so customers didn't need to look elsewhere. So we expanded our product to include many products that were in demand, meet the most broader needs of our customers and ultimately extend policy life. We refer to these as our advantage products, and sales are on the climb. In fact, they are up more than 40% relative to this time last year. Now we know customers have higher expectations of brands that they engage with frequently. They expect an easy experience, one that really recognizes who they are, respects their time and makes recommendations that are right for them. So we enhanced our service offerings to deliver what's important to both our current and our future customers, inspiring trust and instilling confidence that they chose the right insurer. As we stand here today, we believe firmly that we can now meet customers' needs throughout their lifetimes.  So our vision and the tactics to broaden our vision, we're an important first step. But what the vision changes came and need to really look within to assess our organizational structure and ask ourselves whether or not we were set up to achieve this vision. Historically, customer relationship management organization was the operations arm of Personal Lines and thus heavily focused on new business acquisition. But in order to create parity among consumers and customers and to position CRM to serve as an advocate for our customers, our organization became a standalone business unit, now also reporting to pressure.  And by adding experience design responsibilities to our traditional delivery role, we can really embrace the and CRM and focus our time on starting, deepening and extending many more customer relationships. This customer focus leadership has allowed us to really challenge traditional beliefs to generate healthy debates and ultimately to create better solutions for customers who trust us to meet our needs not only our purchase, but throughout the ownership experience. So with the new organizing principle and sponsorship of customer first conversations among our entire senior team, it became clear that we have to have a single definition of the ideal customer experience. So next I'm going to talk about this unifying experience -- effort that we referred to internally as our target customer experience. Now the functional nature and alignment of our business groups has really allowed us to optimize the experience within our individual areas. But as a result, the experience is not been quite as cohesive as we moved across the life cycle. So to generate much greater consistency, we created a single vision for how we take care of customers. Our target customer experience provides an end-to-end view, and it goes across the brand by service and claims functions, while applying to all channels contains a common definition and experience Northstar for our collective design teams to pursue.  This was drafted by senior leaders representing each business function. It has really strong buying as a result, and it serves to inform our technology investment strategy. In just a few minutes, Steve is going to talk about some of the specific investments that we've made with this is our guide and with the intent of delivering easy, personal and caring experiences.  So now with an expanded view -- I'm sorry, with expanded vision, new organizational structure and shared experience strategy, the final piece for us was really to expand our capabilities. So these are functional processes and people-related investments that were intended to create a customer-centric environment, where we can really excel for the customers that we are so privileged to serve. We created a customer experience design organization to really lead these efforts. We had a digital expertise to enable self service and allow our customers to engage when, where and how they choose.  We invested in data science and predictive modeling to guide interaction frequency and content, and we enhanced our voice of customer platform, providing real-time and robust insights to inform our hypothesis. We applied the testing approach in rigor that has been so effective for us in acquisition to the servicing experience. And with the development of research and testing lab, we are able to quickly understand the effectiveness of personalized treatments. We found opportunities to leverage newly imported skills to build applications that capitalized on these learnings quickly. Examples that you heard about in the past, include chai or homegrown chat capability, which really leverages our artificial intelligence and the customer relationship assistant, which allows a contextually relevant and personal experiences going across engagement channels.  And we've grown our in-house agency. We refer to that as a Progressive Advantage Agency, not as to expand our multiproduct service offering. And by integrating the ASI insurance operations, we are going to be able to deliver a truly bundle experience for the Robinsons.  So to this point, you've heard about a handful of foundational adjustments that we've made to really position us for success. We enhanced our vision to reflect our ultimate destination and expanded our product suite to meet the broader needs of our customers. We adjusted our organizational design to elevate the importance of the customer relationship taken an end-to-end view to ensure both consistency and across the journey, and we've added capabilities that provide deep insights, analytics and testing to enhance our experience delivery efforts.  And we've made a lot of progress during these past few years, which for a company of our size and scale is markedly fast. As you come to expect from Progressive, we make a commitment to something, we execute and we make it happen. Now with solid operating plan is critical to increasing retention, but there is this cultural element that we're driving hereto. Operational excellence supply to discrete transactions are not just really key moments in successful long-term relationships, and we are seeking a really, really long lasting relationships. In fact, we're pursuing relationships lasting for decades. We've moved beyond individual policies and now think about households, the relationship that we formed and that was that's been in placed in us to protect our customers most valuable assets. This cultural shift that we're driving is really built on a foundation of our core values, integrity, always doing the right thing, golden rule, treating people the way they want to be treated and excellence, and never ending pursuit of constant continuous improvement. This encourages our folks to stop and ask, am I solidifying this relationship? And am I performing in a manner that will generate a relationship that's going to last a really long time, in fact, even decades? As a company who reviews data and goal setting, we choose to set an aspirational target around this relationships. And since 2015, we've seen a 33% increase in the number of households that have chosen us to stay with us for a decade along.  Now our decade customer measure is a motivating organizational metric, but the true KPI for our customer retention efforts is policy life expectancy. So I'm going to refresh you on the measurement and talk about how we approach driving it. So policy life expectancy is really the average length of time and new customer states with us. PLA describes our retention efforts in one number, taking into account mix and tenure. Let me remind you of the calculation. On this graph, the blue bar shows retention results by month. Each point, on the orange line, reflects the past 12 months and then we calculate that area under the curve, the result is the average time that we expect the new customer to stay. Now you've heard us refer to PLE in the past is our holy and in the Destination Era, this is truly our currency. So to improve PLE, our strategy leverages the 3 major drivers of retention, and we pursue process and systems improvements to try and change the shape of this curve. The 3 major drivers of nature, nurture and price. Think of nature is the mix of our customer segments. We talked about the Sams, Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons in prior meanings, and they have very different PLEs. So we are able to positively shift overall PLE by significantly growing the longest retaining segment, which for us is the Robinsons. Now nurture is about the experience we deliver. Through advancements here, we can give customers reasons to stay with Progressive longer and thus create even greater value.  Now for many price or product competitiveness is the reason they choose a company, choose to shop or choose to stay. On our last call, we talked about the gains that we've made in operating efficiency that we use to generate a pricing advantage. Next quarter personalized President, Pat Callahan is conduct about segmentation. So for today, we're going to focus our comments on nature and nurture.  So again nature is the mix of customers. And the graph on the left shows policies in force growth by segment of the past 5 years. The broadening of our product suite and the distribution of those products through multiple initiatives, including platinum, our enhanced independent agent program, HomeQuote Explorer or online HomeQuote aggregator and the Full-service Progressive Advantage Agency have helped us grow all segments, while the Robinsons segment in particular is growing the fastest and has been accelerating. On the right side of the page, you will find the PLE relativity is by segment and considering that the Robinsons have a much longer PLE, our efforts to shift mix are both really worthwhile and also really paying off.  Now nurture is the experience we deliver. And when we design experiences, we do so from the customer point of view, considering the 3 notions they tell us they value, easy, personnel and carrying. Insurance can be complicated, as you know. So execution for our customers just can't be. So we develop processes and tools to enable self-service, while also educating or outstanding customer care consultants to operate in an advisory capacity when customers look for guidance. Easy to understand and easy to execute, that's where we start. And we know that individual wants and needs can significantly. And many large organizations really struggle to move beyond a single experience overall. But for us by using internal and external data, leveraging our systems and predictive models, we're able to really know our customers so that we can personalize it scale. And then caring comes down to our people, our culture, our values and our overwhelming desire to fulfill the promises that we make to be here when our customers need us and to always do the right thing. When we deliver on these 3 things, we're able to instill confidence and trust and ultimately extend customer relationships.  Now the graph on the right shows the contribution that our nurture experience improvements have made to lifetime earned premium over the past several quarters. We didn't measure this prior to 2016, but we're able to now. And relative to that first quarter in 2016, we've increased our contribution 18 fold. Now we know our experience contribution because we conduct controlled experiments that allow us to measure our specific impact. So before Steve talks about the investments we've made to generate retention improvements, let's spend some time talking about how we measure the impact of these nurture enhancements and decide ultimately what we'll invest in.  Hypotheses are informed by extensive research, voice of customer insights and our business experiences. Taking a page from our acquisition playbook, we conduct rigorous calls testing using an AB framework, which allows us to then validate, which process changes, tools or treatments are truly valued by our customers. Now those resulting in a behavioral change are the things we choose to invest in. This combination of art and science is how we make decisions. Customers tell us where they want to go. We test, validate and then go there.  So now I'd like to invite Steve up to talk about some of the technology investments that we've made to really help drive the experience. Steve? Steven Broz : Thank you, John. Good afternoon. Let's kick off our discussion here with the Slide that John shared a few minutes ago. Becoming a destination insurer for our customers requires an investment in product breadth. Adding products to our portfolio allows us to meet the broader needs of our customers over their lifetime. And if you look at the PLE data on the right here, it's clear that no product is more important to add than homeowner sending. It increases auto PLE more than any other additional products we sell.  Going back to the graph on the left, John rightly pointed out how much Robinsons have grown. I just want to add another piece of here which Diane's on the Wrights are the largest customer segments in terms of policies in force and seeing growth there is important too, because they are the Robinsons of the future. We've been talking about Robinsons a lot, so let's talk about where Robinsons come from.  Some Robinsons are is a fully bundled customer. They bundle their home and their auto from the moment they join Progressive. For these customers, it's really important that we're really good at marketing to prospective customers and consumers. Many Robinsons come through graduation. They start at Progressive with either auto policy or their home policy. And as their needs evolve overtime, they have the other policy along the way. No matter how they get there, we call all of the groups Robinsons. And to be clear, the second line on this diagram is the largest source of Robinsons for us. Those who first buy their auto policy with Progressive and later by their homes, and this means that marketing to current customers is every bit is important as marketing to potential customers.  Whether you're current customer or potential customer, we believe you should be able to buy homeowner insurance the way you wish. Just like we do an auto insurance, we offer home insurance through the independent agent channel, online at progressive.com or on the phones at 1-800-Progressive. We'll cover each of these channels separately. But before we do that, let's take a step back and look at the homeowners and auto insurance industry as a whole.  What you see here our 2017's private passenger auto and homeowners insurance premiums segmented by channel and by customer segment. One opportunity really stands out for us. I would say more than half of the total premium is Robinsons. This is another reason why homeowners insurance is such an important piece of the product portfolio.  Furthermore, more than half of that premium is in the captive agent channel, an agent that -- channel we don't do business in. So our goal is to move that premium to the right. We believe independent agents are well positioned to compete with captive agents for this market. After all, their local just like captives, and we would argue that the offer a better customer value proposition. Captive agents represent one company, and our independent agents represent multiple companies, truly looking across their companies for the right combination of coverage and price for their customers.  We think direct can take share from the captives as well. Specially, as digital natives come of age and begin purchasing their first cars and their first homes, and be honest a homeowner's insurance product is long been dominated by agents, and as that product adapts to perform better in the direct channel, we think the direct channel will grow significantly here as well.  John talked about the customer journey and investments we have made all along the way. We won't touch much on brand today to learn more about that, you can look back at our fourth quarter 2017, investor event or talked about branding at great length. But let's start talking about buying specifically, buying homeowners insurance so that we change the mix of our customers to those customers that retain longest. Both channels are important, but let's start with direct. If you look at industry premiums, we can see that across the industry, direct, the direct carriers have a much lower share in homeowners than they do in auto insurance. In the long run, we believe these numbers will converge. And it's not because private passenger autos are going to go down, because homeowners insurance is become more direct. We look forward to leading the industry in this change and taking more than our fair share of that growth. One of the key investments we've made to increase and direct homeowners sales is HomeQuote Explorer, or HQX. It launched in March 2017, and its goal is to really make shopping and buying homeowners insurance online intuitive and simple.  Some of the ways that those are shown here. In the top box, it says info we found, and that just highlights in order to make the quote easier and faster for our customers, we some data. We don't that data to be secret from our customers, so we give an opportunity to see what we found and to verify its accuracy. And below that you can see sections on wall construction and roof type. And here we try to use clear visuals and concise language to help customers through some questions that can be a little tricky for them. The more we keep them engage with the quote, the more they can answer the questions they need to, to move through this quote the more successful this funnel is for us.  Finally, we take all that information and we compare rates across multiple carriers to find the right price and the right coverage for our customers. And in true Progressive form, we returned the rates of all the carriers even when Progressive is in the lowest. In this case, you'll see Progressive Home, second from the right, with the second Bottom line for us is we believe no other offering gives customers an option to enter the information just once and so quickly and easily get rates from multiple homeowners carriers. And the impact it's had on our ongoing home of the sales has been dramatic. We've seen big increases since HQX and elevated in the first quarter 2017. Our strong branding has made us -- long made us the leader in online homeowners quotes and HQX simply made that sales funnel much more efficient. We all believe this is a fantastic return on our investment.  HQX is also given us a nice feature to promoting our ads. The 2 TV ads that are featured HQX have been year-to-date, and they both done a nice job driving new auto and home sales. We think there is room for improvement here. We have a couple of carriers, who had a buy button on HQX, which allows the customer to buy the policy online and with carriers add that functionality, we see an increase in sales of about 10%. We're thrilled to say that Progressive Home added it's first buy and its first date in May. We're excited to bring that option to customers to be able to buy Progressive Home policy online and thrilled to add the direct capability to Progressive Home, formerly ASI and continue to extract value from that acquisition. Some customers, as I said earlier, they want to buy the home and auto at the same time. And for them, we have multiproduct It's exactly what it sounds like. You can quote your home and your auto in one seamless quote and buy them both too. In this case, it's important to note that our home quote here is connected to HQX. So these guys the same HomeQuote taking experience that we just reviewed.  The results here have been fantastic too. It's another investment that's produced great returns for us. We've seen multiproduct coding, homeowners sales increased dramatically in the last 2 years. And finally in the direct channel, we'll talk about the option for customers, who want to call. They might call because they want to start a quote or they might call to finish a quote that they started online. In any case, when they call, they end of contacting people in our in-house agency, the Progressive Advantage Agency.  And the results here are truly amazing. And the truth is that for most people insuring their home is insuring their most valuable asset. And they get some confidence from talking to a real person and knowing that someone understands their needs and has taken the time to match their needs to the right carrier, right coverage and the right price.  Technology is certainly help this growth. If you look at this inflection point in 2017, that's when we turned on HQX and improved the sales funnel dramatically through technology. But with that being said, none of this would be possible without the great work that John and his team has done. They started this team from scratch. They it up overtime and scaled it up as well, and these results couldn't happen without their great work.  Now that we cover direct, let's switch to independent agents and talk about our results there. You can see in the independent agent channel, the Robinson sales and have grown at a very healthy rate. Unit sales up more than 6x in the last 2 years, policies in force have nearly tripled for Robinsons and the independent agent channel.  One of the key drivers, and John mentioned this earlier, is the product -- is the broad geographic distribution of our Progressive Home product. You can see in 2013, Progressive Home was in about 24 states and was called ASI then, of course. And in 2018, Progressive Home, we're happy to say, is in 45 states. To be fair, many other things that contributed to the growth of Robinsons and the independent agency channel. For example, agent distribution and the agent compensation.  We don't have time to cover all of that today, so again I'd encourage you if you would like to learn more to look back at presentation that had today at our third quarter 2017 investor event. We've done well in growing agency Robins, but we believe we can do better. Portfolio quoting the soon and extend our lead in the independent agent channel, where we've long been recognized as a leader and technology and ease of use. Portfolio quoting allows agents to seamlessly quote and bind multiple products, including homeowners and special lines and of course, auto. On this screen, an agent simply selects the products she wishes to quote for the customer and bundle and enter portfolio quote. After working through an integrated a seamless quoting processes, the customer and agent end up here and returns rates for multiple products at once. In this example, you can see there is an auto, home and a motorcycle policy being rated. And the information makes it easy for the agent to highlight savings to the customer, you see those on the top, in the middle and green, the bundled savings and additional offers the agent might want to make for the customer. You see those in the blue on the top right. In this case, it's snapshot of an umbrella policy. We'll elevate portfolio quoting soon, so we don't have actual results to share. We do, however, have a feedback from -- that we've collected from agents in our usability lab where they had ability to use portfolio quoting, and their response has been fantastic. So game changer is beautiful and clean, intuitive and easy. We have distanced ourselves from the competition and this last one is my favorite, can you please elevate in my state first. There is an eager want among independent agents, who have seen portfolio quoting in action, and this overwhelming positive agent feedback makes us very optimistic about the impact that technology can have on agency Robinson growth.  Now that we've talked about direct and independent agency channel, and how Robinsons have grown each of them, let's wrap this discussion up by bringing that story together and talk about how successful we've been in shifting the mix of our customers to those customers who stay the longest to Robinsons. The best summary measure we have is to talk about our mix, our share of the household Robinsons households. And you can see here that over the last few years, our share of Robinsons householdsHQXas more than doubled. And as exciting as that is, growth has accelerated year-over-year. We're thrilled about the progress we have made, but it's fair to say that we're even more excited about the room we have to grow. The homeowners insurance industry has been around for nearly a century and before long it's been around people have been battling home and auto together. We're relatively new to this game, but really jumping in, in the last few years, and we're really excited about the progress we have made. And we're excited about what the future holds as well.  We've touched on buying and we talked about how bundling home insurance can change the mix of customers and increase policy life expectancy, now it's time to spend some time talking about servicing. I'll start with the comment that John made. He talked about how our shifting from product-centric culture, one that asked the question, who can we sell this product to? To customer-centric culture, but the question becomes, which products to our customers need? To translate this cultural change into action at scale, we think we need 3 key ingredients and the first ingredient is the right data. This year, we completed a foundational investment in customer data that we call customer hub. We purchased the solution and integrated with our systems. In the process, we modernized our customer systems and retired decades old homegrown systems. Customer have simply allowed us to know the customer and the household much, much better.  The second ingredient is a robust product portfolio. So far we focused on homeowners and rightfully so, it is the most important additional product we can sell. But to truly become a destination insurer across the customer lifetime, we have to be able to offer other products as well. And in 2013, we offered just a handful of such products, but by 2018, we tripled the number of additional products we offer.  This typically extend beyond property-casualty insurance and sometimes beyond insurance is itself. the manufacturing by others and distributed by Progressive. This is in part and often to play a video get paid commission on the sales, but it's also a defensive play. We want customers to think about their Progressive relationship first and have confidence that we can fulfill their needs over their lifetime. This will prevent them from developing relationships with other firms, who I'm sure. We'll gladly take the auto and home premium. So far we have two key ingredients, data from customer hub that allows us to know the household much better and an expanded portfolio of products that increased right product to offer at the right time. The last ingredient in determining this cultural change direction and scale is the means to offer these products to customers in the right context. And that's where customer relationship assistant comes in, CRA. When customers contact us for other reasons, CRA helps us make the right offer to the right customer at the right time. The CRM data science team builds a rapid prototype of CRA using machine learning in late 2016. And during 2017, we iterated on that product until we feel confident that we could roll it out to all of our customer care consultants, which we did in early 2018. And since then, we've also started to added to our digital channels.  Over that time period from late 2016 until now, we've seen the offer rate for just -- rate for just one of our offers. The offer to get home insurance, quote increased by more than 20%. That's a substantial increase when you consider the fact that this is an offer we make, millions of times per year. Take those 3 things together, the right customer knowledge, a rich product portfolio and an intelligent delivery mechanism for those products, and we think we're going to continue to increase the number of products per customer. This should in turn to higher retention. Now it certainly announces the customer experience to get the right offer at the right time, core customer transactions like paying a bill, changing a vehicle or adding a driver are important too. Our investments here focus on 3 areas, as they always do. They focus on people and process and technology. But today, we're here to talk about technology and the around of technology, we really focused on two things when it comes to core customer transactions. One is mobile and the other is online.  When it comes to mobile, one of our goals is to make sure that our customers can do everything that on phone that they can do online. You can see we made steady progress towards that goal over the last few years and while there are a few transactions that you can't do on your phone right now, those transactions are in frequent.  And we'll continue to chip away with this as our priorities indicate is the right thing to do. The other thing we want to do with the mobile devices make sure we take advantage of the capabilities that the device offers. And one of the simple capabilities it has, but powerful as well is its ability to recognize a fingerprint and our faces.  Customers can use face ID and touch ID to log into the app and also to pay bills through Google Pay or Apple Pay. If I can, I'd like to share a story of my own to show you how powerful this can be. A few months ago, my older son Parker got his driver's license. It was a Friday afternoon, and he texted me, of course, from the DMV with a picture probably portraying him with this new driver's license. I texted him right back and say congratulations, nice job and then I thought, oh my gosh, I need to change his status on the policy from being a permanent driver to driver. The great thing was without putting my phone down, I could do with walking from one meeting to the next, use my thumbprint to log into the app, changes with just 2 types of my fingers and then use my thumbprint to pay the additional premium. That's so easy and that's our goal. We think that during life events like this, any friction we introduce to the transaction increases the likelihood that our customer will shop and potentially live Progressive and making the process this simple and easy for our customers is a great step forward. We're thrilled about how mobile option is going. When you look at app downloads by our customers, which are quadrupled in the last few years or mobile option as a percentage of which also quadrupled the last few years, we're thrilled about the growth we're seeing in mobile adoption. Even with this being true though in the second quarter of this year, we saw a record number of logins to our online servicing site.  So online servicing is still really important, and we're reinventing online servicing. But you can see here as a previous expense that we had online, where customer feedback and customer actions that we have observed show that they struggle to navigate through this. Navigation was inconsistent from page to page. It was hard for customers to find the policy that they were looking for. And so we change things around on the right side, I can zoom in for you to see it better, we're reinventing policy servicing. And what you can see here, the visible changes are clear information hierarchy, the interactions and text are much are much clearer and navigation if you could see the next page is consistent throughout the site. We've seen customer feedback from usability testing, it's very positive. They find us new architecture clean and easy to use. As important as these visible changes are, there is some invisible changes that are equally important. Behind the scenes is a customer centric architecture built for the Destination Era and the multi-policy experience. Tasks and content can be prioritized and personalized depending up with a customer, who is visiting the page. And the flexibility that John's team uses to conduct that AB testing is enhanced in this architecture. It means that John's team can conduct those experiments faster and faster, and we can accelerate our learning to improve the customer experience. The bottom line here is that we look to understand customer needs and solve their problems, and then we find the right delivery mechanism for the solution. Sometimes it's the app, sometimes it's online and sometimes it's both. We expect our investments in mobile and an online servicing to increase retention and increase self-service as well. Finally, we come to the last leg of the customer journey for some customers and that's claims. This is a moment of truth for our customers and a chance for us to fulfill the promise we've long made to them. Our significant investments in claims technology give our customers enhanced visibility, communication and control during their claim experience. And I can't go into detail because time won't allow me into all the changes we made, but Tricia several paragraphs in our quarterly shareholder's letter to this topic. I encourage you to read it, if you haven't done so already. I'll summarize here by saying that we've added a lot of digital capabilities, you see those on the right, for customers and employees. And then you will see on the left that adoption of these new capabilities has been very fast and continues to grow. Now that we reviewed the technology investments across the customer journey and highlighted the significant returns that they have created. I'd like to invite John backup to wrap things up. John? John Sauerland : Thank you, Steve. So in summary, to fuel ongoing and sustained growth, we've made retaining our existing customers as large a priority as acquiring new ones. We've made foundational and cultural adjustments to really position us for near- and long-term success. We've shifted our mix to longer retaining customers, while continuing to grow all segments and delivered significant and measurable improvements to the experience, and these improvements go across the customer journey. Now we would not be nearly as successful, but for the really strong partnerships like the ones that Steve and I have and our teams have working toward a common objective.  So after hearing our story today, we suspect you might be wondering how are we doing? And the answer is exceptionally well. Policy life expectancy is at an all-time high. We've increased at more than 20% in just 3 years, and this increase in retention equates to well more than $10 billion in life time on premium across our entire book of business. And this is not a one-year phenomenon. We made steady progress in 2016 and built on it again in 2017.  We saw significant and sustained improvements and that is exactly what we've delivered. And while we're proud of the progress we made of the past 3 years, we are far more excited about what the future holds, because we believe firmly that we have just scratched the surface of what's possible. So on behalf on Steve and I, thank you very much for your time today. And now, please give Tricia and John a few moments to set up for the Q&A. Julia Hornack : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, Andrew, please introduce our first participant from the conference call line. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Amit Kumar : Good afternoon, thanks for that great presentation. Two quick questions. The first question goes back to, I guess, with the discussion on HQX and MPQ. It's been a year since HQX came online, and I was sort of broadly thinking of what kind of customer would respond to this product? Now that past, do you think younger, I guess, Sam or Diane is responding more than what you might have anticipated? And now that you have to sit and watch and on into our Robinsons? Or maybe talk about, I guess, the percentage share by the names you have as to how they are responded to this product? Susan Griffith : I would say rather than thinking about from a demographic, likely wouldn't be the Sam necessarily, Diane graduate, it would be someone is going to become a Robinsons anyway because they have a home. So I think when I think of customers that want to go through the HQX process, it's people that are digitally savvy and they want to make it easy and they want to make sure there is a place where they can go and they understand very clearly with pictures, what kind of rules they have. We can take publicly available data and input. It's really take the customer 20 years ago that started searching for auto online, these direct peoples are no one is going to ever search for auto online, but of course, that happened. Think of that customer, and that's what we think it will grow, because ultimately it's a customer that's just digitally savvy, and they want to do all of their business online. Amit Kumar : The second question sort of shifting gears, you're talking about growth. Recently last month a number of auto manufacturers in fact, revise their outlook as the impact of tariffs comes in. I was going through some all old transcripts, and if you go back to '08, '09, Glenn and others have talked about the impact of slowing auto sales in terms of margins. What is your view on that impact from here? Susan Griffith : We're not sure what we with the Obviously, we're watching that closely, and if there is less autos to ensure that affects the industry. However, we have a very small share of that addressable market. So when you think about that $300-plus billion in auto and home, we have 10%. So we believe even if the pie shrinks, it actually grew 8% last year. Even if the prior shrinks, we believe with where we're positioned that we will be able to have a bigger piece of that pie. Julia Hornack : Thank you. Andrew, can we take the next caller please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Greg Peters : Going back to HomeQuote Explorer, I was wondering if you could provide some additional current around the number of carriers that are participating in that product? And I know recently there were some news there around curtailing its partnership with Progressive. And I'm wondering if you could take your discussion around HomeQuote Explorer and the number of carriers and also comment on the announcement? Susan Griffith : Sure, Greg. Currently on HQX, we have four carriers, including Progressive Home. And for we've been working with them for years in our Progressive Advantage Agency and although the news came out this week for us is all news. We've been working with them at a price for over a year now to convert that business and upon nonrenewable be able to give them our rate for Progressive Home and other unaffiliated partners. The majority has gone to Progressive Home, and some to the partners, but we're happy about we continue to do around every month as things and that will continue through 2019. We're really impressed with the retention rate of those customers once they change their business from over to Progressive Home. Greg Peters : And then another specific question. I found your discussion around mobile adoption quite interesting. And I'm not sure you're going to be willing to give me what percentage of your total customers have adopted a mobile solution for your company. But maybe you could -- and maybe you will answer that, but if you don't, may be you could provide us some color around the split of mobile adoption between the segments, including the Robinsons? Susan Griffith : We don't really share that, I would say, mobile adoption continues to increase and have probably come out a little bit more on the channels. So on direct channel, obviously that's a customer that wants to go directly as well. So that is a much higher rate of adoption than say our agency channel Although in talking to agents, they're continuing to talk to our customers, our collective customers to get them to do some of these things like Steve talked about on the mobile device. So they really -- if they don't need to call the agent there, they don't have to. Greg Peters : Just maybe can you give us a sense, is it more auto versus home? Or am I just get nowhere with this? Susan Griffith : No. No. It is more auto versus our home goal, of course, when John talked about the targeted customer experiences to be able to have everything you have whether it is on Progressive paper or not. Mobile device, we're not there yet we continue to invest. I would say, it's a much higher percentage on auto. John Sauerland : I think we previously shared that a very large percentage of our direct customers, who quote online are now doing so via the mobile device. So our earliest our adoption of mobile was in quoting and buying as we've added functionality to the mobile app, the uptick there has been really impressive. So we found, as we build it, they will come, if you will, is predominantly been faster in the direct channel, not surprisingly. But increasingly agent customers are picking up on mobile as well. So one clarification I want to make on earlier comments on share for a home and auto, so Steve I think it was $325 billion market place of home and auto today, we're at about 10% share of the auto, think about 1 percentage of the home, $335 million is sort of 2/3 auto, 1/3 home, just a clarification. Susan Griffith : I remember several years back, it was actually while I did a presentation for the yearly IR presentation on imagine Diane. And Diana, I showed a graph of whole mobile payments. We talked about when Diane becomes a Robinsons, she is not going to certain start paying the check. So we to invest way back then into having more of those future Robinsons, we're able to do as much as they can on mobile. Julia Hornack : Great. Andrew, can we take the next caller from the line, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Montgomery Scott. Robert Glasspiegel : I was wondering if you could give us some dynamics in the homeowners rollout? What percentage is direct versus agency? And what is the relative profitability metrics of the 2 and growth as well? Susan Griffith : First of all, I'll start with the fact that my daughter, her first accident was backing into At the time, I was running claims I was CEO. I can get worse than that right. That dynamics of the home, we continue to do roll out more and more agents, so that is growing on the direct side. Clearly, the HQX has been a big key that we rolled out last year that you can see sort of the hockey stick of where we're growing with that. So we're growing in both channels. We don't talk necessarily about profit or the target margins, I should say, in that aspect we always, I'm sure for 96 in the aggregate. So we don't talk publicly about where we're targeting either channel. John Sauerland : Just for clarification, Bob. The property results we report in our monthly releases are the premium we're writing them through what we're not Progressive Home family as. We Steve, I believe mentioned also receiving commissions from the business that we write direct with our number of other carriers. But we also think the benefit of the currency we previously discussed around homeowners as being that auto PLE. So we showed you the relative policy life expectancy across Robinsons, Wrights, Diane and Sam, and the reason we are in the home is to get to that at least half of the marketplace, but to keep those auto customers, we've historically have been really good at bringing in those new customers to keep them for their lifetime for decades. That's the currency of the home. Obviously, that's, we previously talked about, the invisible balance sheet that we're building as a result of that PLE gain, but that's underline the profitability of your bill of home. Robert Glasspiegel : What the discount you give to someone that buys both John Sauerland : So the discount varies by product. There is a discount -- and generally speaking across states on both the home and auto, it varies by state and it varies by channel as well. Robert Glasspiegel : It would be great before too long we get the homeowners broken up by agency and directly auto so that we can track the relative growth and profitabilities? Susan Griffith : Yes. It is a little bit of tough, because to what John said in terms of not all of its on our paper. So where we have four homeowner carriers on one to be in Progressive Home, we have multiple on Progressive Advantage Agency. get a little tough look at premium even though getting commissions on some of those, but again auto PLE is our currency for that. Julia Hornack : Thank you. Andrew, can we take the next call from the conference line, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : I just want to also say congratulations to Steve by adding one more customers to your $17 million customer base. So my first question is on your last slide. If you look at PLE have a tremendous growth, but seems like kind of reaching a plateau in the last couple of months. Your second quarter 3-month PLE data or increase have also slowed down from previous quarters. I was wondering are you reaching the limits or seasonality? How much more room to grow there? Susan Griffith : I can't predict the future in that We obviously we've have grown a lot and so to continue to grow is our goal and to continue to keep customers for decades is our goal. Part of want the FX PLE and John Murphy had on this a little bit on price. So people care about the price watching that closely, because lot of our competition has increased prices those are slowing down a little bit. What I will tell you from the perspective of business is we're finding our new business conversion is still really strong. And so we're going to continue to look at PLE from the nature and nurture price expect and to continue to him make sure that we give our customers what they need to stay and understand that. Kai Pan : Okay. My second question, Tricia, back to your shareholders letter for the 6 months results. You achieved remarkable like 90% commodity ratio, 20%-plus premium growth. You normally have one-off either of them having not of both. But going forward, do you think you will back on some of these margins or faster growth? Or do you think the growth rate is that as much as you can handle given the infrastructure, remember couple of years ago, in your ramp up your staffing to anticipate for this growth? So I was just wondering margin going to deteriorate for you to grow faster on top line? Or you want to keep the top line growth rate at it is and let the margin through? Susan Griffith : That's a great question. Let's go back to our goal, and that is to grow fast as we can we are making at least $0.04 of underwriting profits. So when we have that ability to grow like we have and we have the margins like we have, we are really happy. We're really firing on all cylinders, and I think that's the key part here. We have a great infrastructure, an incredible brand, a competitive cost structure, and we have had no problem hiring great people across the company. So we don't believe where we have any need to slow down. Now when you step back and you look state-by-state, channel-by-channel, product-by-product, you started looking say we're still able to grow these margins. And if we don't believe we can grow then we will determine what we need to do to grow. But again, we look at it so surgically across so many variables, but again, I can't predict the future we're sitting in a great position right now, we're really bullish and excited about what we continue to do and again that momentum. So for me we're happy about our growth. Obviously, we're happy with our margin. We're going to continue to achieve our goal, and that is to -- our vision to become consumer's #1 choice and to grow as fast as we can, make $0.04 and take care of our customers. Anything, John? John Sauerland : I think you have it. I would reiterate the success we had with staffing and attention to people has been remarkable. There have been points in the past where we're growing very quickly, and we were challenged by having appropriately trained mature staff to handle the claims an example to take the calls and John Murphy's organization, customer relationship management has done a fabulous job getting ahead of the projected need. Our service levels have been outstanding. And at the level of growth, where we are enjoying, that's really impressive. And the claim sites, similarly we have had a little benefit there and the fact that claims frequency has been dropping a bit. So we haven't had to add people quite as quickly in claims. We also found some efficiencies, the stuff like photo estimating. But in short, we feel great about quality metrics and claims. We feel great about service levels in our customer relationship management organization. So as Tricia said, we're sort of firing on all cylinders right now and want to continue to grow as rapidly as we can. Susan Griffith : Yes. And think about we talk about, so we're excited about our Robinsons growth and we have less than 2% of shares. So I mean to think of the runway with that. We're well positioned and our mix shift is changing as well. So we've had our 83 Project we thought was fantastic to get more preferred customers end, our 84 project was even better and now we have 85 coming on the streets. So we're continually excited about our ability to attract and retain our preferred business. And so that mix shift changes, we believe there is lot of opportunities as well. John Sauerland : And if 84 and 85 don't mean a lot to you, wait a quarter, we'll have Vice President give you a lot more to tell around our product, iterations, which we are happy to say we're hitting the market even faster than we had previously. Susan Griffith : Yes. We're creating a lot of ways on how name our products. Julia Hornack : Thanks. Andrew, can we take the next call from the conference call line, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My question for a second quarter in a row, you guys pointed to favorable frequency trend. And we see that throughout the industry, I guess, a couple of questions, following on another quarter the favorable trends, what you guys think is driving the favorable auto frequency that we've seen in the industry? And when do you think we get to a point or maybe we say it's more of a new normal that the trends that persisted? What made the time to need to declare kind of a new home frequency base for the industry? Susan Griffith : Yes. I have a lot of things going in frequency. It's really tough to pinpoint in particular, I just talked about clearly our mix shift is changing. You can go into a vehicle miles driven. If you look a lot of macroeconomic data, and it's hard to react quickly because things change along the way. So we're watching closely things like gas prices and unemployment and things like that. So you can change in any given quarter, and I can't tell you exactly when we'll say, okay, this is a new normal and we're going to price because prices severity. But we do watch those to kind of understand, where we're priced and what's happening in the macroeconomic atmosphere. John Sauerland : We get this question often and Tricia pointed out, it's very difficult for us to even -- with the data we have around miles driven, types of miles driven, the economic data is such even explaining frequency changes that are past it's difficult for us, it's even more difficult to project them. We do know that the long-term trend has been negative. We expect it to be negative. When I say long-term, I'm talking about the past 4 decades. But if you look back within that 4-decade period, what you see is a lot of what variability. In the '80s, frequency was dropping dramatically. The '90s, it went back up and almost got back to where it was at the beginning of the '80s and it culminated with 2,000 combined ratio for the industry something like 112. We were a little below that, where we had 104-ish. You get to a point. After that frequency drops very quickly over the past decade or so, it's been fairly flat up or down a Bit. But I think those experiences even though the long-term trend is negative, make the industry less likely to quickly price to a drop in frequency. We have had six straight quarters now, I believe, frequency drop. But again, when you look back at the history, there is reason to be cautious and the key for us, I think, is ensuring that we are very agile, where we think things have changed. We act very quickly and make those changes in the marketplace. And I think that's a big piece how we win Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then there is a slide in the deck where you guys highlighted all the products that you are now offering to customers and compared back '18 to 2017. And so if you go back before you guys made ASI acquisition you always are identified opportunity to bundle with the auto and home customer, that was driving force there. Is there anything on this list that as you think about maybe to future acquisitions, something that you guys are not writing directly today, but providing to insurance that might the list of something you would want to take on the underwriting risk completely yourself? Susan Griffith : I think for now, we're happy with Progressive Advantage Agency products. And -- or I should say over the products that were on the paper that are given to our insurance. If we believe we need to access like we did with ASI and we start with the partnership, that to us is important, because we knew in the homeowners area. We started out and we actually after with a great career, but just in market agency channel started a partnership with ASI knew they were on the same values as us. So that made sense to purchase, because we didn't have access to those customers and agency channel. We feel very comfortable with the product offering that we have and our ability to again extend our auto policies with the products on that side that we necessarily have to right on a paper. Elyse Greenspan : And if I get one more quick one in. What's on the new money yield on the investment portfolio today? Susan Griffith : Bill, you want to take that one? New money yield investment portfolio today. William Cody : The New money yield on the investment portfolio, start with this that we run the portfolio in a total return basis, and we don't necessarily target a new money yield. In the second quarter, it was just a little bit over 3.5%. So going forward, I would just say, duration is around the same as 3-year treasury. And if you add a spread on top of that high quality, fixed-income bonds, you can get reasonable proximation of what money looks like. Julia Hornack : Andrew, can we take the next call from the conference call line, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is now open. Michael Zaremski : Yes. Thanks for the info on the Robinsons growth versus the other customer types. Can you remind us the approximate combined ratio differential between Robinsons versus the Sam, Diane and Wrights? Susan Griffith : I don't believe we shared it. So I think it would be. John Sauerland : And our target for all those customer segments are the same. It's 96. So we obviously have different economics across channels with an upfront loading the direct channel, the commission over the lifetime. So the pricing is not necessarily the same, but the target profit margin across those 4 customer segments is the same -- across channels. Michael Zaremski : Okay. I guess, you can -- you say -- you said a number of billion-dollar kind of invisible profits due to higher PLE. So I assume big chunk of that is coming from the Robinsons and more profitable, maybe I could through that more. Susan Griffith : So you're talking about that last slide that John showed. Michael Zaremski : Yes. Susan Griffith : Yes. So when we look at that, we look at the entire book and we say, if we added a month to our entire book, how much would that be in lifetime premium. And then John take a percentage of that, percentage of increase in PLE. So we normally sound average if we add them on to our entire book, it's about $1.6 billion in lifetime and premium. John Sauerland : So you might be confusing a new renewal split has been the same combined ratio, and it's not. So Robinson will stay for us for a longer than the Sam, for example. So that over the lifetime, we are achieving that 96 on a new customer versus renewal customer is dramatically different for Sam as you too from an acquisition because relative to Robinsons. Susan Griffith : And the way our acquisition model works is very different depending upon what channel you arrive in. Michael Zaremski : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And lastly, you talked about being optimistic about independent agents, potentially taking share from captives overtime and you're reasoning independent agents holding only one product. I thought that's kind of always been the case. So I'm trying to understand what's going to change for that market share dynamics to change? Susan Griffith : Yes. I think the demographics are changing. So I think people expect to have multiple offerings wherever they go. So whether it's an insurance their online. And so I believe there is a demographic of being able to have more offerings, and you have seen some companies actually go that route from being captive to bring part of the independent agent channel. I think seeing that, it's very different to have only one product to have optionality to what fits on your lifestyle. That sort of our promise. Julia Hornack : Andrew, can we take the next call from the conference call line, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Paul Newsome : You covered a lot of ground, thank you for that. I just wanted to retouch the 10-year effect impact of the growth. It seems like you had accelerating growth with no impact on the combined ratio, where the mass majority when we see this growth, you see some impact on the combined ratio from the growth itself, because new business is typically not as profitable as all. Is the 10-year effort in there? And we're just not seeing that? Is there something else that is going on that we are all good. Could you give us a sense of how you think this in the current book right now? Susan Griffith : I think there is so many, John. So many things going on, but what we've been really impressed about and read about so much in my letter is the biggest part of our cost is loss cost. And being able to have our claims organization, higher well in advance, trained well in advance and have systems that can alert us to make sure we have that high-quality outcome and we have been obsessed with watching those files because of the low tenure and the claims organization to make sure that we have the right people handling the right files at the right time with the supervisor being able to get out in front of file that might be going sideways before it settled. So that's, I believe, a big part of it. We do usually have a new business panel. We've been in this mode for a while, where we've been having a lot of new business. So that's kind of started to level out a bit. John Sauerland : To that, I would add, so we're going to try to understand how much better to grow new business. And we are conscious like I previously said, it's a 96 across channels all segments. We are actually cognizant of what we think the new renewal mix will be going into the air. So we say our target is that calendar year combined ratio less than 96, at the same time, we're looking at lifetime combined ratios for all those customer sites that we want to be within that 96 as well. So it's a balance across those 2 objectives, clearing the direct channel as you bring a lot of new business, those combined ratios are much higher than renewable and less differential. But increasingly, as we are moving the book to what's more preferred customers, the difference between the loss ratio for new customers on the Sam end is far bigger than the Robinson end. And then as we shift that book then the loss ratio a few put on the growth is far less. Julia Hornack : Andrew, can we take the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gary Banfield with and Partners. Gary Ransom : I enjoyed your discussion on customer experience, I wanted to ask about another level of customer service that actually increases the opportunity to interact with customers. And this is may be at the product level, but it perhaps your snapshot, mobile may encourage additional interaction and also a product such as our pay by the mile might encourage additional interaction. I wonder if you could share thoughts on that level? And also more specifically, whether your been thinking about pay by the mile product? Susan Griffith : We've been really focused from the snapshot perspective on having a more, we talked about is a mobile is a device. So actually using the phone to be able to understand the driving behavior, not just time a day, aggressive breaking our miles driven, but usage of your phone with an application or a phone call. So we're really trying to understand the behavior and the loss behavior that we have distracted driving. So that's really been our focus to understand with all the information we have at some point we can put that into a product model because of the data that we will have better drivers that have the mobile is a device versus a page ago. Gary Ransom : So you don't have anything in the by the multi-product? Susan Griffith : We're always thinking about things. Right now, we are focusing on mobile is a device in understanding the loss experiences for distracted driving as well as what we've always used as a huge editing variable. And when and talks the next quarter, we will talk a little bit about snapshot on the importance of that variable in terms of our ability to price and charge the right amount for the way people drive. Gary Ransom : May be just one follow-up on snapshot. Is it your belief that you are -- truly is a reasonable amount or significant amount of adverse selection that you are causing and you are not alone, there are other peers that are using a similar product, but not very many? Is that actually making everyone else's loss ratio higher? Susan Griffith : So I can't speak to the loss ratio of the competition. What I can say is that when our customers, who have driven with us and have a snapshot device get a surcharge often times they leave, which means that we're going to price them right, which is a high price. They didn't like it that to someone else and that to me sort of the definition the selection. Julia Hornack : Andrew, can we take the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Adam Klauber : What's the year-over-year increase in platinum agents? Or else could you give us that rough ballpark of percentagewise? How much increased? Susan Griffith : I'm not sure percentagewise. We used to give the number and we kind of start giving that because a number. I think I'll number to that, I think, it's around might be a little of it. We look at platinum now less of we need to increase more agents, but in any given geographic area, where we believe that our Robinsons, do we need to have a more platinum agents in there. So that's really how we look at now because we feel like we have a good footprint across the country, but we do look and say okay, here we're not growing as much is it the agents, is it the ability to have those Robinsons walk into those agencies not kind of a next level of assessment in terms of our need for more platinum agents. Adam Klauber : Okay. And then a follow-up. A point to your 10-Q, seems pretty low has been improving, look like it's only 2%, that's materially better than the industry looks like it's improved compared to year ago. I guess, what are you doing better in the industry? And how are you improving severity in a tough time for severity? Susan Griffith : I mean, I think from what I understood, it wasn't that different from the industry, 2, 2.5. We always obviously I talked about looking at making sure we are accurate in our payments to make sure we have the right level of people looking at our files because that's our biggest cost. And we have a an incredible training organization to be able to do that incredible leadership organization that claims area. And that's really what we look at this him in terms of making sure we get out there quickly, we have the customer and we help to manage the claim. Julia Hornack : Andrew, we'll take the next call from the conference call line, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Two questions, I think, touching on issues have been raised in the Q&A. First, to the extent that you are winning business either in independent agency or direct from captive agents, those customers are different either loss or PLEs than longer-term independent agent other customers? Susan Griffith : There will be able to really actually see that data from that right now, I mean, it's more of -- I would look at it in terms of the types of customers. The customers that have multiple products, the customers that have more to take care, the customers that have the credit, all the things that we look at in terms of proof of priors, some of those things are company look for it's really the variables that we look at versus where they come from. Do you want to add anything too? John Sauerland : I think that's truly Meyer Shields : Okay. That's helpful. And second, I have to agree to the point you made that demographically, we're going to see an increased focus on having options. Does that diminish the value of the brand recognition improvement that you have been fostering? Susan Griffith : No, I don't think so at all. I think our brand recognition will tell you, especially HQX Progressive Advantage Agency that we want to have Progressive Home. We also have different options for you. So I think we actually have highlighted that and some of our commercials and arguably the commercials we talked about HQX, we're doing it to make sure brand recognition our own home, and it improved our prospects on both home and auto. So we feel like it's actually getting better. John Sauerland : I would add. I think the relative to competitors, we are the brand that is known for providing customers options. Susan Griffith : Steve used the line in his presentation that was in the commercial years ago, when we used to have compared which we have to it was we're not always the lowest. And so that's kind of been our claim to fame to make sure we have the transparent company about saying you're better off getting going with XYZ. So we're part of that. Julia Hornack : Thank you. And I'm actually going to, I think, you said, 2800 platinum agents. Susan Griffith : Yes. Is that wrong? Julia Hornack : No. You're close. Almost 2,900 agents of 45% since last June. Susan Griffith : So I've ever reported a month ago. So must have add Julia Hornack : Exactly. Andrew, can we take another caller from the conference line, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Meritor with UBS. Brian Meredith : So just curious you've had at the ton of success here and lots of growth going on, but growth obviously requires capital. And I know you had the preferred offering. Just curious where are you with respect able to sustain or observe this growth here on your current capital position? And then what are your alternatives going forward given that your leverage ratio is up a little bit? Susan Griffith : Yes. I mean, we look at capital in terms of need from many different areas and we wrote a paragraph about in the Q. As we grow, we're going to need more regulatory capital to hit the premium to surplus. So we will continue to watch that, that's a good problem to have. We have dividends, we have a lot of different things that go into our capital structure and of course, our debt-to-total capital ratio we usually talk about in a 30% range. If we believe we need capital to continue to grow, we'll determine what that means whether it's issuing debt or in the past. So we look at that on a monthly basis to kind of understand our need, but we believe we see that as a good problem in terms of growth in our ability to get that if we need it. Brian Meredith : Yes, I don\u2019t disagree, just wondering, your willingness to the equity capital. Susan Griffith : We review it every time we go to market to determine where we should go with that, and what makes the most sense in terms of returns. So we do that as needed. Brian Meredith : Got you. And my next question, obviously, great growth in homeowners is going terrific. How do you think about managing volatility that homeowners potentially I know you've got some great arrangements in place right now to do that, I assume, it's getting bigger and bigger, bigger and it's harder to manage their volatility and I guess, what's the run rate here you got -- you may run into some concerns about that? Susan Griffith : Well, firstly, I think is really understanding segmentation in the home as much as we do on the auto side. So we're working very closely with the 2 R&D departments to understand the type of homes we should ride and obviously want to expand our coverage, not only just geographically, but to more homes. So we are watching that you understand, okay, this is the segment that we believe really fits in our in our real house. In addition to that, as you know, we added the aggregate last year and has been helpful and we feel really good about our insurance. So I think it's really about having a solid reinsurance plan and kind of understanding what we can on the history of weather and where we should write and how we should rate those homes and also continuing to segment homes as we do auto. John Sauerland : A lot of that growth is actually lessening our concentration risk geographically. So that getting bigger they're actually, I think, helps the volatility. The aggregate surplus agreement is not depending upon how big we are, it's a percentage across-the-board. So it's not dependent on sites. Susan Griffith : Our goal is to continue to grow extensively in home and auto unbundled. Julia Hornack : Thank you. We will take one last caller from the conference call line. Please, Andrew. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman, Balyasny Asset Management. Ian Gutterman : I just had two quick ones. First on the homeowners, I guess, sort of go back on history right, ASI before acquire them was obviously very overweight Florida and Texas I recall and is a middle of the country obviously had a lot of these other partners. And now, first, I talk a little bit about how much of the non-coastal growth as you fill out the math? Should we assume that on the margin most of that will be ASI? And secondly to the extent that it is, can you just talk about what I'm really concerned about something for future call is the infrastructure build out in states where you are heavily concentrated, right. If Tennessee or Nevada or something like or maybe where you don't have homes and you have a lot of auto customers and people are now to call in. How quickly can you build that home infrastructure because there is a lot different than our infrastructure, right? so maybe I'll leave it there and let you start answering that. Susan Griffith : Yes. So obviously as we expand on the agency channel, it will all be Progressive Home off. On the direction channel, we have multitude carrier. So really is the best fit for the customer. We only talk about the percentage get from each of the unaffiliated partners with Progressive Home at the direct side. We have lots of options to fill up the country. From an infrastructure perspective, we have made a commitment and investment on the claims organization to have offices across the country. We have hundreds and hundreds of officers across the country. For the most part in home, we use independent agents for the homes. So the infrastructure is already built out with our partnerships that, but we do have an opportunity to actually leverage our already infrastructure on the auto claims had with the leadership we had there. So and we also have our large losses and complicated losses, a very large kind of high value or high kind of loss organization here that handles any of those big claims on the commercial side, on the home side. And so we have an infrastructure build from the home we believe we can utilize for auto, for home as well as the fact that traditionally we've used independent agents across the country. John Sauerland : Yes, our writing a lot of the estimates for homes and states, where we don't have a lot of business yet. You're right about that for sure. But each of those files is owned by an adjuster that is an employee that is reviewing those estimates and reviewing coverage as well. So while there is some delegation of the adjusting process, it is still owned by an employee. Ian Gutterman : I assume the goal overtime as you get more critical more in certain states may be counties that you start to replace that independence with more of your own people when you have enough skill to do so? John Sauerland : I'm sorry, that's an absolutely what we've been doing as we grow in states in which we don't have a ton of business yet. So the claims organization for Progressive Home is growing very rapidly. Ian Gutterman : Okay. And then just quick follow-up about you earlier questions about an 86, I may be asked a little differently. Obviously, you've been in the 96 a fair amount for a number of years, let's say, a target on it, but somewhat down the line, you go from 2% of Robinsons to call it 10% Robinsons. Just given the longer PLE, they can sustain a higher combined ratio. Is it reasonable to expect that over the longer-term sort of neutral or be a smaller margin versus the 96, which isn't a bad thing is probably a good thing because the PV that is higher. But just from a GAAP perspective, is that something we should expect to happen overtime? Susan Griffith : I wouldn't necessarily go to that. Remember, it wasn't long ago in 2016 that we were over 96 for the quarter we came in at 95.7, I believe. That my memory in my mind since its was my first quarter as CEO. But 96, again, we have been writing about this is our first annual public in 1971. So we will continue to look at the 96 aggregate for all of our coverages. And again, they are different, but we optimize to the aggregate. So what we will do whatever we can to grow as fast as we can, make at least $0.04 to service our customers, and that's really sort of -- that's our blueprint. And then everything else we can to fit into that. This is a 96 is and it is what we do here it's our culture and it is really is served us so well for our 8 years. Ian Gutterman : Absolutely. I just tried to think spreadsheet here as you have more, more success with the Robinsons mathematically little bit natural optical pressure, right, not economic profits fantastic, but nominally I was thinking there was a mix change, I guess, if you're well that makes the 96 little harder. Does it make sense? Or I'm the other way? Susan Griffith : Yes. I think we're coming from new we just have to play it out and see how it goes as we continue to increase our mix of business. John Sauerland : I would just to reiterate. As we go into a calendar year, we know our calendar target is 96 or better, and we can project that we expect those combined ratios are by segment and by new renewal, and we can adjust our target pricing accordingly to make sure best sure as we can that we're below that 96 for the calendar year. Julia Hornack : Thank you. So we've actually exhausted our scheduled time. So Andrew, I'm going to hand it back to you for the closing scripts. Operator : Thank you. That concludes The Progressive Corporation's second quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

The dial-in information and passcode are available on the Events page at investors.progressive.com. Acting as moderator for the event will be Julia Hornack. At this time, I will turn the event over to Ms. Hornack. Julia Hornack : Thank you, Chanel, and good afternoon to all. Today we will begin with a presentation on industry-leading segmentation. After that presentation, we will have Q&A with our CEO, Tricia Griffith; our CFO, John Sauerland; our guest speakers today, Pat Callahan and Sanjay Vyas. And Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer, will join us by phone for Q&A. This event is scheduled to last 90 minutes. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events to differ materially from those discussed during the event today. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available on our 2017 annual report on Form 10-K where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investors page on our website, progressive.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith. Susan Griffith : Good afternoon and welcome to Progressive's third quarter webcast. We have a terrific session for you today. Before we go into the topic on segmentation, I did want to reiterate a couple of the milestones I talked about in my letter. First and foremost, we surpassed $30 billion in net written premium on a trailing 12-month period. That is phenomenal for us. What's more phenomenal is the fact that less than 3 years ago, Glenn Renwick , John Sauerland and I toured the country celebrating $20 billion in net written premium. So to put it into perspective, it took us nearly 80 years to get to $20 billion and less than 3 to get to another $10 billion, celebrating $30 billion. Phenomenal job for everyone at Progressive, and we couldn't be happier with those results. In addition we just surpassed 20 million in overall policies in force and 13 million in auto policies in force. Why that's significant is the fact that we are growing at a very rapid pace on Robinsons in both the agency and direct channel. And part of that is you want an influx of future Robinsons. So those auto policies support, that growth, is really important because they are our future Robinsons. Having that 2-pronged point of reference to be able to grow Robinsons is important, and that's why our policy growth is important. We always talk about unit growth being a very important measure. And lastly, we had an internal goal of getting to 1 million Robinsons, and we surpassed that as well. So a couple more milestones I won't go into, but a lot of excitement around the momentum we've had over this past couple of years. And we are ready to kind of wrap up 2018 and have great plans for 2019. Let's start with our 4 cornerstones : who we are, why we're here, where we're headed and how we're going to get there. Who we are, our core values. That is really the underpinnings of everything we do. We have 5 core values, and all of them work together to make sure we have a successful company. Our goal is to win, but we want to win in the right way, and our core values guide us there. Who we are. Why we're here. Our purpose statement is, true to our name, Progressive. And when I think about that, I think of the first 8 letters, Progress, always thinking differently, always questioning what we've done yesterday, should we do it the same way tomorrow, listening to our customers, listening to our employees and our shareholders and understanding how to always be forward thinking. Our vision, where we're headed. We want to become consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other coverage. For us, this is just a great thing to be able to try to achieve. We got a little bit closer there this year. We know there's a lot of room that we need to get there, but we are ready for it. And our strategy, that is really how we're going to be able to achieve our vision. Our strategy, as we've been talking about in the past several webcasts, are really based on 4 different pillars. And you've seen all of these and what we've spent the time doing is really dissecting each of the pillars, so you can understand our business model -- again, in order to understand how we're going to achieve our vision. In fact, in the next quarter, we'll have our Chief Human Resource Officer, Lori Niederst, talk about our people and our culture, which is so key to everything that we do. Today, we're going to do a little bit deeper dive in the pillar you see with the blue background. So if you recall in the first quarter, we had Kiara Berglund and Mike Esposito come up and talk about the balance of operational efficiency and claims accuracy, always trying to get that near-perfect balance of cost and quality. Today, our guests are going to be talking about offering competitive prices driven by industry-leading segmentation.  Let's start with our overarching goal, our operational goal for the company. And this is something that we've had in place for as long as I can remember, but nearly 50 years since it has been written about in every one of our annual reports since we went public in 1971. Our goal is to grow as fast as we can at or below a 96 combined ratio. The only caveat to that is we won't grow if we don't think we can service our customers in the way they have come to expect. The great news here is that with our tremendous growth in these last 3 years, we have been able to hire -- hire in advance of needs, specifically in the CRM and claims organization. And I can tell you, the talent that is coming into the doors of Progressive -- through the doors of Progressive is phenomenal, so I'm excited about our future. For us, a 96 isn't a \"solve for\" variable, it's a constant. And it sets the direction for the whole company in everything that we do. It's a great balance of consumer competitiveness and attractive margins. And it helps us in certain situations because it is something very specific and it provides zero ambiguity. As an example, in the quarter 3 of 2016 right after I took over as CEO, we went over 96. We had more cats then than we've had the year before on our commercial lines business. We had put some rates in but hadn't earned in yet because it's an annual policy. We were spending more on advertising. Probably spending a little bit more across the board. And literally that zero ambiguity was so helpful to the entire organization because we all got together and said, \"Okay, what levers are we going to pull to make sure we get under that 96?\" And in fact, when we talked about expenses, it caused us all to say, \"Let's question everything we do as far as expenses.\" And we've changed since then. So even that particular exercise was a valuable one when we went over 96. Again as you know, the end of the story is we got under 96 by the end of the year. Probably the most important part of the 96 is that it's truly ingrained in our culture. It's so core to everything that we do. In fact, as I speak to you on this webcast, I'm standing in Studio 96. We developed an in-house marketing agency several years ago that we refer to as 96 Octane. That's just a couple of examples of how embedded 96 is in our culture. Why? Frankly because it works. This slide you're looking at now are a couple of results. You'll see results from 2015, '16 and '17 and then on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. So obviously growth and profitability, when we look at underwriting margin, this is us compared to private passenger auto. We've outpaced the industry substantially in every single time period. And as a matter of fact if you look at our 10-year results, we -- our results are on average 6.5 points, well better than our 4-point margin that our goal is. And if you look at the industry, they haven't made money in every single time frame. We -- profit is one of our core values. We are going to make at least $0.04 and do everything we can to make at least $0.04 in every opportunity and every time frame. Net written premium. We have grown, outpaced the industry twofold, again in every one of these time frames, so growth and profitability. I already talked about our other measure, policies in force. So like I said last time, we are firing on all cylinders, and this is really an exciting time. And lastly what these results end up being is double-digit comprehensive return on equity for our shareholders. So it's a great balance for everyone. We've been able to grow the company for our employees, service our customers and grow the whole company for our equity holders.  So let's get on to today. I really want to have a deep dive into segmentation. Why? Because it's really important to all these measures that you see. We have 2 guests. Sanjay Vyas has been with us 15 years. He has been a product manager for 8 of those years in a multitude of states. And in his last 7 years, he's a general manager, leading product managers. He's going to give you a front-row view of how important that product role is at Progressive, owning your own state's P&L, really understanding it and then looking at the aggregate how it all fits together. In addition and I wrote about this in the letter, we just recently have done a cross-functional job swap, and Sanjay is a recipient of that. So just recently he took over as the claims controller. And I'm so excited for Sanjay as well as the others to be able to get to know different parts of the company. Job swaps at Progressive is a hallmark of what we do. We want to have talent across the company, a really good bench of people that have both depth and breadth. So I'm really excited to see what Sanjay brings to claims.  But before then, I'm going to ask Pat Callahan to come up. Pat Callahan, as you know, is the Personal Lines president. He's going to give you an overview of the product strategy, specifically segmentation pricing and how we match rate to risk. Patrick Callahan : Thanks, Tricia. Let's get started by jumping back to Tricia's last slide. And if you focus on the upper right-hand corner of this slide and look at Progressive versus industry, profitability and growth, you'll notice they're growing twice as fast as the industry while simultaneously delivering profit margins 8 to 10 percentage points wider. These results don't happen by accident. They are the direct result of our deliberate investment and increasingly fine segmentation and matching rate to risk. I'm thrilled to spend a little time sharing with you our investments we are making to continue to advance this segmentation and widen this moat around our Personal Lines franchise. Our vision is to grow Progressive in pursuit of becoming consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance. We all know that growing an insurance company is frankly not that difficult if you don't care about making money. And making money in insurance is not all that hard if you don't worry about growth. We are laser-focused on both. And as a result, it's absolutely critical that we have high operating efficiency, great claims accuracy and industry-leading segmentation. So I'll now share a little view that we've talked about previously, that breaks down the U.S. auto and home market by distribution channel in the columns and by Progressive segment across the rows. For decades, we've been heavily focused on growing share within the simpler needs auto insurance marketplace. The $90 billion row represented by the Sams and Dianes in the chart that you're looking at. And while these simpler needs customers were our bread and butter for a long time, they trained us and honed our segmentation skills, primarily because with shorter policy life expectancy, it was critical for us to get our prices right, given they weren't with us for all that long. Not with our expansion to focus on the broader $230 billion-plus opportunity that the bundled home and auto marketplace represents, this pricing discipline is serving us well. Because number one, it ensures that we understand our lifetime cost to serve for these new customers, and ensure that we don't have subsidization as we expand our market focus. But number two, it also enables us to bring incredibly disciplined segmentation skills to disrupt the property insurance market, much the way we did with auto insurance over the past several decades. And finally, it enables us to leverage the advantaged position we have with younger, simpler needs auto insurance customers to continue to build products and services to enable them to grow with us throughout their insurance lifetime.  We support this product expansion strategy within larger market opportunities with 5 key tactics. The first is to continuously invest to improve our matching of rate to risk. The second is to build and deploy highly competitive and stable products to meet the needs of these preferred customers. The third is to leverage verification to ensure accuracy of our rating models. The fourth is to continuously expand and enhance segmentation by leveraging third-party data, both our Snapshot usage-based insurance data and other third-party data sources. And the last key tactic here is to ensure that while we invest to improve the accuracy of our rating models, we're also keeping an eye on ease of use, to ensure that as complexity of our product models expands, we continue to deliver simple-to-use products for our agents and ultimately for all consumers. These 5 key product tactics are the foundation of what we call the virtuous cycle of risk selection. So the U.S. auto insurance market is highly competitive. There's many players, very similar products, high information transparency and relatively low switching costs. Given the dynamics in this market, it's absolutely critical that we have a highly segmented and accurate product model. I'll walk you through this cycle starting at the top, step 1, where we design and deploy these highly segmented models and leverage our pricing discipline to have highly competitive rates in market. Following around clockwise, step 2 is these highly competitive rates enable us to drive up conversion and retention for more preferred segments. Which takes us to step 3 where less-well segmented competitors experience adverse selection as their better customers are finding more competitive offers from Progressive. Which leaves these competitors ultimately with adverse trend. Their book looks to be increasing in loss costs. And they respond rationally by raising rates, but they raise base rates, given the lack of segmentation. And that takes us to step 4 where higher base rates create shopping across their entire book of business and a greater shopping rate with all their customers, results in their better, more preferred customers finding more competitive rates with carriers like Progressive. And that leads us to step 5 of the cycle where ultimately, we grow premium to support fixed costs, which lowers our overall cost structure and brings us more loss experience and more data on which we feed back to the top of the cycle, which enables us to be more finely segmented and offer more accurate pricing.  Now the sub cycle that you see between steps 3 and 4 at the bottom of this is what we call that cycle of adverse selection, and that's where a competitor raises base rates because they don't necessarily know which segments are underperforming. But by raising base rates, they cause shopping amongst our entire book. And only their best profitable customers leave, creating adverse selection and requiring even greater rate increases. Today, we're going to be focused on that top entry point of this cycle and talking about deploying our highly segmented products models, really with 2 sections to the conversation. I'm going to cover product design, and then Sanjay will cover product customization and deployment. And for purposes of this conversation, we're heavily focused on the auto insurance market. We'll talk a little bit about property and destination, but heavily focused on the auto market. When we think about our product models, we build highly complex, engineered and architected product solutions to deliver 2 objectives : number one, match rate to risk better than other carriers; and number two, deliver on our strategic goals of having competitive rates for our core customers, while simultaneously offering competitive and stable rates for more preferred customers. We liken this to a high-rise building where not only are there foundational and structural elements to the model, but there's a significant number of operational systems that are all designed to work in concert as we attack this strategic growth opportunity. And we'll start with the core foundational indemnity models. These are the models where we collect information about our customers in order to predict future loss cost. And our core indemnity models are honed and built on top of prior product models, such that we are constantly evolving and improving our segmentation over time. We layer on new rating variables that might be outside or internal variables more finely segmented pricing through analytical methods. Or potentially copying good ideas that we see in the marketplace. But ultimately, when we look at our product segmentation, we often see competitors who try to replicate it where they may copy the data that we use. They may copy rating elements that we use. They may even copy analytical methods in order to deliver similar segmentation. But frankly, doing this would be similar to me buying the same shoes LeBron James plays in, and frankly, it wouldn't change my basketball game. Our core structural advantage is in decades of rate-making segmentation and culturally, a relentless pursuit of matching rate to risk. Now we know that there's far more to the cost to serve a customer than just the indemnity or loss cost. And that's why we also layer in segmentation for acquisition expenses, operations expenses and billing in bad debt. And on top of this loss and expense segmentation, we then layer on our usage-based insurance program, which is an optional program, but highly predictive of future loss cost. And then finally, we have state-specific versions of these product models, given we operate in 51 different jurisdictions, which Sanjay will cover in more detail. But we tailor our product model to the required coverages, permissible or prohibited rating variables.  But the best segmentation and the most highly predictive rating model is only as good as the data that you input into the model. And as a result, we focus on ensuring that the data that we get from customers at inception is absolutely accurate. You can think of our customer onboarding process similar to joining an interstate toll road. And every year, millions of new customers get on the Progressive highway and most continue on unabated to their destination. More than 90% pass through what we might refer to as the E-ZPass lanes. You get on the highway and you continue on to your destination. However, there's about less than 10% for whom there is mismatching data at inception. And we ask those customers to stop at the cash pay lane, so that we can confirm the accuracy of information that they're providing. And that's what this is all about, accurate information so that our models can predict accurate future loss cost, which ultimately delivers fair pricing for all of our customers. This verification really happens in 2 steps, mostly focused on new customers, where at inception, a new customer is filling out a quote form, and we may find data that doesn't match with what we pull from third-party sources. We'll stop the quote, ask them to call at that point. For other customers, again a very small percentage of our customers during the first 60 days are what we refer to as a free-look period, we are able to run additional reporting against the data the customers provide in order to ensure that we have the most accurate data to price that policy on a going-forward basis. This accuracy enables us to avoid subsidization across our book of business and ultimately to continue to invest in a more accurate and complex product model, while concentrating the expense associated with manual follow-up on a very small subsegment of customers for whom the payoff is much higher. So when we think about our product model, I want to share a little bit more about our most recent development around 8.5, our latest auto product. Insurance is a highly competitive and winner-take-all marketplace, in that the carriers who have low operating cost, high claims accuracy and industry-leading segmentation can offer the most competitive pricing, while also delivering their target profit margin. And we know given the competitive nature, that nothing is standing still. So it's incumbent on us to continue to invest, to improve segmentation constantly. We do this through multiple sources. We may find new sources of external data that are predictive. We may find new ways to analyze internal data. Or frankly as I mentioned before, we may see a disruptor Insuretech or an incumbent carrier actually have different segmentation that we are not too proud to copy and frankly to improve upon when we layer it into our segmentation scheme.  So let's talk a little bit more about a couple of those key sources of segmentation that we are in the process of deploying. The first one I'll talk about is coming with our 8.5 product which is deploying to market currently. And that's for refined segmentation based on prior insurance. So when we were building 8.5, one of the objectives was we wanted to improve the accuracy of the rating model without increasing the complexity for our customers or our systems. And in pursuit of that, we started looking at prior insurance, which has been a predictive rating variable for a long time for us and most other carriers. We found subsegments or more finite and granular information in the prior insurance data we were already pulling about applicants for insurance, that enabled us to segment the market and discover that even though our 8.4 product was performing really well in market, as you can see on the screen, the yellow bars were segments that were overpriced. The red bars were segments that were underpriced in our 8.4 product. So as you can imagine, leveraging this pricing insight in our segmentation enabled us to lower prices on the yellow segments, ultimately becoming more competitive there, and frankly to raise prices on those red segments to deliver the target profit margin, whilst slowing down growth in these underpriced segments.  Second area that I'd love to share just a little more detail on finding new insights from existing data. With the increasing digitization of customer interactions and experiences, we collect billions of customer interactions. And we were able to mine those customer interactions in order to identify segments and combinations that are predictive of future cost to serve. And by identifying this segmentation and predictive power, we were then able to look at our incoming customers. And at any point in time, about 10% of the new customers to Progressive aren't really brand new to Progressive. At some prior point in time, they had a Progressive policy, but also had a lapse in judgment and left us to buy insurance elsewhere. Now when those customers come back to Progressive, see the error of their ways and come back looking for protection, we are now able to price more accurately on those customers, which enables us also to avoid segmentation -- avoid subsidization across the book and to ensure accuracy for every single one of our customers, which we believe is just a fair way to run the business. The final source of segmentation that I'll touch on is within usage-based insurance. And it's been almost 2 decades now since we pioneered this rating segmentation. And as we brought it to market, it has continued to be our single most predictive rating variable. Given that, it's our goal to continue to invest in usage-based insurance to drive up the accuracy and ultimately the adoption of UBI or Snapshot within our product suite.  Customers up until about 2 years ago would opt-in to the Snapshot program. We would send a hardware device that plugged into the OBD port on their car. That hardware device would collect vehicle operation data, transmit it to us, and we would use it in pricing the policy. Now in pursuit of increasing adoption, in the fall of '16, we launched an app-based version or a software-based version of UBI, which collected all the same valuable data on how the vehicle was operated, but also for the first time, gave us an incredibly rich data set, based on how the vehicle was being operated at the same time as the mobile device was being used. And over the past 2 years, we've been able to collect more than 1.5 billion miles of data, where vehicle operation and mobile device operation have happened simultaneously. And spoiler alert, not surprising, distracted driving does drive up insurance loss cost. With this rich data set, we have started using it in pricing, because despite the academic surveys or studies, this for the first time gave us a direct correlation between vehicle operation, device operation and insurance loss cost. And we're pricing on it now in just one state, but in the process of rolling that out. And in that state, we're using how much the device is used, how the device is used, and ultimately why the device is being used. What's really exciting here is not only do we have a pricing model that includes this distracted driving, but that enables us to use some economic leverage to potentially curtail or slow this pretty risky driving behavior.  Finally we talk about increasing adoption of UBI. Because we currently offer both a device-based and a software-based, we're able to optimize our presentation to get more customers to opt-in to the app-based or software-based usage presentation. And we do that to take advantage of the advanced segmentation that I just mentioned. Given a choice, more customers opt for the app-based version. And we are investing right now to continue to increase both availability and ultimately eligibility of all customers to get the app-based version.  So as you can imagine, this segmentation has incredible predictive power, and we're rapidly deploying 8.5 to market. Today we're in 16 states that represent about 40% of Progressive premium. And by year-end, we'll be in 23 states representing about 2/3 of our premium. To date, we've been monitoring performance of 8.5. And while we were thrilled with how 8.4 performed in market, 8.5 is outperforming across all key performance indicators. And one of those that we look at regularly is, \"Is our product model advancing our Destination Era strategy?\" And for that, we look at preferred customer conversion, pre-8.5 and post-8.5. And on the slide, you'll see significant lift in conversion across a wide variety of preferred customer metrics, whether it's prior insurance, home ownership, better credit, clean drivers, multicar, across the gamut, we are converting better. And that delivers value in 3 primary ways : number one, longer policy life expectancy; number two, greater propensity to bundle with Progressive, better credit, future homeowners or current homeowners; and number three, fueling that virtuous cycle of risk selection by enabling us to collect more data on these preferred customers that we can use to price our policies and out-segment the competition going forward. So the key for us at this point is to get this segmentation to market as fast as possible. Now I'm not a patient guy. And when I talked to you a few years ago, we talked about accelerating our speed to market through what we called our pace initiative. And at that point, we had cut the time to deliver a model upgrade to market just about in half, and we continue to invest to do it quicker. As an example, for 8.5, which we're currently deploying, we are able to reduce the model build cycle time and significantly increase our deployment capacity in pursuit of getting this segmentation to market faster. But what I get really excited about is additional investments that we've been making to ensure that we can develop and deploy product models almost in parallel. 8.5 is rolling out. 8.6 is in development and tests for launch next year. And 8.7 is already being built from a requirements and expectation perspective. So we feel phenomenal about not only our current segmentation, but this robust pipeline of future segmentation to fuel that virtuous cycle of risk selection. So let's take a look at how our product models are performing in market. We'll look at loss and LAE for Progressive in the orange line and for the industry in the black line, and this is over the most recent 4 or 4.5-year period. You'll note that we are out-segmenting the competition by about 5 points from a loss and LAE perspective back in 2014. And our investment in product development and risk selection widened that gap to 13 or 14 points as we got into '16 and '17. And while you note the industry has been seeing a lower loss and LAE recently due to both extreme rate take and some benign trends, the gap persists. Now what we really like to see when we look at selection and what we're doing in the marketplace, we look at rate take. So the rate change for Progressive is in the blue line. The rate change for the industry is purple. During the same period of time while we're deploying 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5, we've had to take half the rate increases that the industry has. That means current Progressive customers retain better through more competitive rates, and new customers coming in the door find more competitive rates relative to alternatives in market. So we feel great about the segmentation and how it's helping loss and LAE, but let's take a broader look to understand what it's doing to drive Progressive growth, by looking at a 15-year history of Progressive's auto policies in force. And this is a period of time when we more than doubled the business from about 6 million policies to more than 13 million. And if we zoom in on the period that we just talked about, that more recent period of time when we were deploying 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5, or the period when we grew from about 9 million to beyond the 13 million policies we're at today. If we look at how this growth has accelerated, using our million PIF growth milestones as a benchmark, you'll see that it took us 30 months to go from 9 million to 10 million policies in force. Yet after deploying 8.3 in the middle of 2015, it took us half that time to go from 10 million to 11 million. Deploying 8.4, it took us half the time again to go from 11 million to 12 million. And our most recent million policies from 12 million to 13 million, we did it in about 6 months\u2019 time frame. Now if we zoom back out to look at how that acceleration overlays with our product deployment, it is absolutely clear to us that investing in segmentation and speed to market for product upgrades is creating growth and driving growth for the company. Now what's particularly rewarding is when we overlay our combined ratio during the same period. And for the past from 2007 on, we've been rock solid within 92 to 95 combined ratio. So our operational goal of growing as fast as possible, subject only to that 96, is absolutely being delivered by our investment in risk selection and segmentation.  Now with that said, competitive auto is one piece of our Destination Era strategy, but we also know we have to have highly competitive property insurance offerings in order to meet the needs of the Robinsons. And that's why since taking the majority stake ownership within ASI, or what we call Progressive Home, we've invested to ensure that we are leveraging the property insurance expertise from the Progressive Home division in concert with the pricing and segmentation discipline that Progressive has honed over 80 years. This combination of property expertise and pricing segmentation is enabling us to leverage new solution methodologies, identify and deploy new variables and ultimately have much more accurate and competitive property insurance products. But competitive property and competitive auto on their own are not the only benefit of making the property insurance investment. There is a strategic benefit of having a holistic data set that for the first time for us, merges the auto-rating elements and loss experience with property-rating elements and loss experience. And having this holistic data set enables us to look across products. And it's that cross-product segmentation that we fully expect will drive our segmentation into the future. Here's a quick example just of auto-rating elements that are highly predictive of property loss experience that we are in the process of building data feeds to ensure that we can get to market. So in aggregate when we think about combining Progressive's expertise in segmentation with the Progressive Home division expertise in property, we fully expect this will enable us to not only run highly competitive rates, but to fuel that risk selection growth that we know ultimately creates adverse selection for our competitors and will drive profitable growth for Progressive into the future. With that said, I'll turn it over to my colleague, Sanjay, for some more details on product deployment. Sanjay Vyas : Thank you, Pat. My name is Sanjay Vyas. As Tricia mentioned, I've been in the product world for 15 years and just recently moved to claims. Given my experience in product, I wanted to add some additional context to what Pat just shared. Specifically, I wanted to touch on 3 points. First, states are complex. I'll discuss how that affects how the product is implemented. Second, I'll cover what does a products -- what product managers' decisions are across the 51 jurisdictions. And last, we'll see how product managers do more than just crunch numbers. So to the first point, state deployment is complex because of the legislative and regulatory diversity across the U.S. I'll impact this with a personal example. Recently, my wife was at Whole Foods here in Ohio, and she was parking and a pickup truck backed into our vehicle, a relatively new vehicle. So this could happen in any state. In most states, this is simple. The other driver was liable and her insurance company would pay for the repairs. But to highlight how things can be different across different states, in Michigan, the then neighboring state of Michigan, my insurance company would pay for the claims, not the other driver's. That's because Michigan laws emphasize first party for physical damage. You can appreciate then that our data should solve for Michigan differently than for other states. And just to round that out, in the grocery store accident, thankfully nobody was hurt. But had there been injuries to any driver, the jurisdiction would matter. In about 20 states, drivers may be able to get their medical bills paid for from personal injury protection coverage or PIP as it's known. The amount of PIP coverage varies across states. In some states, it's really small dollars. In others, it can be $0.5 million or even more. By contrast in the other 30 states, there's no PIP. It'd be covered through health insurance or through the auto policy if MedPay had been purchased. One last point highlighting the complexity that exists at the state level. Some states like California, North Carolina, maybe New York goes on that list, these states are more prescriptive about how the product should be structured. And those are some large markets. Those states require different models than the ones found in other jurisdictions. So you can see that the states vary by as much the types of yogurt that you would find at Whole Foods. And those differences are meaningful for the product design. The decision-maker who tailors a product at the state level is the state product manager. The product manager or PM has 1 to 2 states under her or his responsibility. For example, during my PM career of 8 years, I had responsibility for Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky and then finally Florida. And somewhere along the way, I appeared to have lost my hair.  The PM runs the state. They are measured first on profit and second on growth. The first day I joined Progressive, I was told that the number 96 was important. 96 is our combined ratio target. And hitting the 96 would improve the odds that my badge would work the next day. I had started on Arkansas and Mississippi, this was in 2003, and we weren't making money in Mississippi. By contrast, we were making the target margins in Arkansas. 50-50 odds that the badge would work did not sound great. So I started working on fixing the issue. Just to give you some context for my thinking, I saw 2 facets of the problem. Looking forward, how do we get Mississippi back to a 96 when it is over 100 CR? And second, how did we get here? If I look backwards, did the segmentation in the state fail? Or were the conditions in the state such that all the carriers were losing money? So we'll cover segmentation later. First we'll talk about the rate level.  So back then I worked with an actuarial staff to assess the indicated rate mean. Next, we filed the proposed rate increase within the state. It was a state where prior approval is needed, which is true in about half of the states. The state approved the rate increase after asking a few relevant questions. So we implemented the rate changes.  And then I spent the next 6 months monitoring the results. As you know, it takes about 6 months for customers to pick up on the higher rate level. In any given month, some customers will be at the old lower rate level and some at the new higher rate level. Each day, each month, that mix changes, and that makes measurement a little tricky. And during that same time, the environment also continues to change. Frequency at a state level can change due to seasonality like weather, changes in gas prices. And then there's severity, severity can be influenced by changes to medical costs, changes to labor rates, tariffs on parts. Interpretation of results is complex at a state level, which is where the PMs focus. Of course, thankfully some of the state level variation gets washed out at the countrywide level.  To share an analogy that you might have heard before, setting rates is like surfing -- we're trying to ride the wave. Now you can get ahead of the wave and crash, if the assumption about historic and future loss trends are too low. On the other hand if the assumption trend is too high, we'll inadvertently overprice the book and come in well under 96 and choke off growth. That's like not catching the wave at all. So working on Mississippi, I spent time reviewing numbers to see what course correction, if any, would be needed. I also reviewed our competitors' filings to ascertain whether or not the problems were associated with the general market or my particular business.  So that's the pricing of the book. It\u2019s what we call setting the base rate. It's also -- the job also involves segmentation. Segmentation is the most significant part of what we call product. As the job title implies, product manager and product management involves advancing the segmentation. So Pat spoke about the countrywide support that drives the product. As a PM, it would be my job to adopt that product to the local market. So for example, I elevated the 8.0 product in Florida in 2011. So I'll share 3 examples of modifications I considered. Before I jump in, I'll point out I'm using some old examples of mine in lieu of some more recent examples from current product managers. I want to be mindful of sharing too much information about their great work with competitors. So the first thing I needed to do was to modify the product to ensure it complies with state laws and regulations. So for example, in Florida, points for speeding tickets may not be assessed against the in-force policy. That's the rule. That's different than a lot of states. I had to alter the product to ensure compliance, but there's more to it than that. I also need to assess what other parts of the product need to be modified to make up for this loss in segmentation. For example, if you can't charge for speeds, and if speeds are more likely for 20-year-olds than for 55-year-olds, then it might be more accurate to modify the driver age factors to pick up on the segmentation loss for not being able to charge for speeds. This will make Florida different than the countrywide solution, but possibly more accurate.  The second product consideration for the PM is the territory model. The rates for Miami should be different than those for Tallahassee : pretty smart, right? But we don't price cities. We price at a more granular level and adapt by line coverage. So data can get pretty thin. So right there, you see a value we get from our scale. I'll contrast that with what a smaller carrier would be able to do. A smaller carrier has 2 choices. First, they could use less data to derive their territory factors. That's not great. Or they can use an industry solution which provides no advantage over the other carriers in the marketplace. And if this small carrier has an innovative product based on maybe new segmentation, then there's a question about the relevancy of that industry territory model to their product. So back to Progressive. At Progressive, our product managers will look at the historical data and take into account previous model changes. The goal is to estimate the factors at the territory level, while accounting for all the new product changes being made.  A third aspect is local market considerations. For example, I'd seen a decade ago that customers in Florida who had many prior PIPs had very high prospective loss costs. At that point in our company history, we had a policy to offer a rate for every risk. So I raised rates on the segment, but the loss ratio did not improve. It did not meet targets. Now I could see that competitors were not writing this business. We frequently review our competitors' filings and saw that -- to see whether or not those insights are applicable. And in this case, it was. So I filed a rule with the department, saying that under those conditions, we could not offer a rate for customers with multiple prior PIPs. Since then, we've added back some segmentation, so that the story has changed and we do accept business in that segment. So to summarize, at -- state-level details such as unique laws, territory pricing, local market considerations, are significant for the product. Those 3 examples undergird our assessment that focus at the state level is necessary. To describe our system, I'll borrow a chart from Pat's presentation. We start with data at the countrywide level and at our size, the amount of data we have creates a scale benefit over smaller competitors. But being bigger is not the same as being better; we want to be nimble, too. To get that, we have a diverse group of individual PMs identifying local insights. And then we feed those insights back into R&D. It's very possible those state-specific insights are relevant to other states or even countrywide. We acknowledge and reward PMs who contribute outside of their own states to the broader product development.  I'll close with a comment about the product manager role. It's an awesome job. I loved it. It's numbers plus a whole lot more. Let me share a profile of the types of people we hire into this role.  We have a combination. So we start with homegrown talent. These are folks who've grown up with the data, who have connections across the company. And we also have folks with professional degrees. For example, we have someone with a PhD in robotics from Stanford. So we make sure we source the best. And we want to have diversity in the ranks to ensure that we're thinking about our business problems broadly. So in summary, we hire business people into the PM job. We don't focus exclusively on actuarial skills or industry knowledge. Rather, we hire quantitatively minded business people.  We do that because the state profit and loss rolls up to the product manager. As you know, we are one of the few companies that reports out results on a monthly basis. That's true countrywide and also at the state level. I was a product manager for 8 years and a general manager for 7. And over those 15 years, once a month, I usually had a hard time sleeping, because the next day, the monthly income statement would come out. Once a month, Sunday was just a little tense. I viewed myself as the owner of the business. Seeing whether we hit our 96 mattered a lot. Seeing whether the segmentation played out the way I thought it would, mattered a lot. A great deal goes into going as fast you can at or below 96. It is more than pricing or segmentation. There are many structural elements to our business that also influence the profit and growth. To that end, as a PM, I'd be involved in many facets of the business. I'll share a couple of examples. First, 7 years ago, as the Florida product manager, I was driving around the state. As I recall, I was visiting agents in the state, and we were rolling out the new product. So I wanted to make sure they knew about the new rate level or perhaps new questions on the quoting platform. So we just finished meetings in Miami. And we were driving up to Jacksonville, and we drove through a toll booth. And I saw a competitor had put ads at the toll booths. I'm guessing the tolling authority was selling advertising space around the toll booth. So I saw their ads and I was irritated. We have a great brand. And I wanted that smart, targeted advertising for Progressive. So I worked with our media team. We bid for those toll booth ads, making sure we were under our targeted acquisition cost. And we won those bids. Progressive ads started to be displayed at toll booths throughout Florida.  Here's another example of being involved with all facets of the business. This one's a time when I was the GM. The PMs and I would meet with claims leaders. The goal? To understand how the product actually afforded coverage. There's a lot of complexity. We want to make sure we want to get to what we call ground truth. That's what one of my claims peer would say : How are claims actually being settled? Here's a relevant example. The PMs and I drove to a claims meeting, this was in New England, and we were talking with members of the Connecticut claims team. We happened to review a file where the Connecticut customer had been driving in New York City, and they had a claim. And unfortunately, the PIP, the insured, was injured. And we pay out on PIP coverage, which is established by New York law. There's a catch. Connecticut doesn't have PIP coverage. So we don't charge premium for a coverage that we don't offer. But as we've just seen, we do -- there are instances when we do pay out on PIP. As an astute businessperson, I realized that having a coverage that we paid out on, but one we didn't collect premium on, could present an issue. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't an issue without controls. We weren't losing money per se because of this. The losses were tracking back to the Connecticut income statement, so we were rate adequate. But there are implications to the product. And as a point of reference, in a perfect world, I charge only the customers who will be traveling to New York over the next 6 months a higher rate, because that's where the exposure emerges, in New York. But I don't know that perfectly, and I certainly don't think our customers know for sure whether they're going to be traveling to New York over the next 6 months. So how do we handle it? Well, we have a few options. We could rate on this in the liability line coverage, bodily injury. And that's what we had been doing, I learned. That would have all the customers in the state pay for these claims, and that's not unreasonable at all. But there are alternatives. One is to focus this cost on a territory. That would make sense if the exposure was localized to policies in the southwest part of the state. So what we're always trying to do is to match rate to loss costs. This insight about PIP exposure in a non-PIP state caused us to improve our segmentation. That's the value of ground truth, of working in all facets of the business.  So those are 2 examples of where driving around the field, we learned about advertising opportunities in Florida and about unique segmentation opportunities in Connecticut. And it's really complicated and we love that. We are driven to tailor the product to our state and out-segment our competitors. We are driven to hire and develop product managers who are entrepreneurial, curious and passionate about winning the right way, by following our core values. And we are driven to go deep on every facet of the business, because we know that important insights happen locally. The point is, as PMs, we are driven to grow as fast as we can at a 96 combined ratio or better, in every single jurisdiction. With that, I'll bring Pat up. Patrick Callahan : Thanks, Sanjay. Having spent about half of my Progressive career as a product manager, general manager, I can absolutely attest to the significant benefit that the combination of local market knowledge, customizing our countrywide segmentation, brings to the company overall. So to wrap up, we talked a little bit about how we build and deploy highly complex, countrywide product models. And Sanjay shared with you how we customize those product models to the opportunities in front of our product managers in order to deliver profitable growth across the country. The combination of both our countrywide product models and local product customization, in concert with accelerating speed to market, is fueling this virtuous cycle of risk selection, which ultimately creates profitable growth for Progressive and delivers against our strategic objective of growing more preferred business and expanding into a much larger Robinson-addressable market. The combination of investments we continue to make against this target market is absolutely delivering on our vision to become consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance. With that, if you can give us a couple of minutes, we will set up for Q&A. Julia Hornack : [Operator Instructions] Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Michael Zaremski : My first question is regarding your competitive advantages relative to peers. I'm curious if you feel they're materially stronger today versus just, let's just say, a couple of years ago? And if the answer is yes, if you can kind of boil down what are likely a lot of reasons, down to maybe the 1 or 2 underlying reasons you think are having the most impact. Susan Griffith : I would say absolutely, that we continue to try to drive a greater gap between our peers. And it's really a lot of what we talked about today. It's hard to actually talk about 2, but segmentation and what we talked about today with matching rate to risk is critically important, especially to achieve our operational goal. There's a lot of other things that go into play. So our cost structure, we think, is really important. We know that people can shop. It's easy to change. And having a competitive cost structure is very important to be able to have competitive prices. And then I think some, if I only had to do 2, I would say those. But again, our service, our local footprint, our brand, there's so many other things that come into play and it's all those things in aggregate that we believe chips away at being able to have a competitive advantage. Michael Zaremski : Okay, great. And my last -- my follow-up is regarding -- thanks for mentioning 96 Octane, which is your in-house marketing agency, and I had a quick moment to go over to its website. So just curious, a lot of advertisers are speaking openly about trying to better understand and manage their digital ad spend, given the tectonic shift towards digital consumption. It's getting a lot of press. So I'm just curious if I'm barking up the right tree or not. And is this one of the reasons Progressive has grown faster than many have expected? Susan Griffith : Well, we, from an advertising perspective, we try to be out and about where anyone wants to shop. So a lot of that has to do with demographics. 96 Octane was really born from us understanding and being able to do a lot of the things in-house that frankly, we were paying a premium on for doing outside. So that was a little bit different. On the media side, a couple of sessions ago, we had our guests talk really about understanding efficiency of ad spend, whether it is on social media, on Instagram or on mass media. We do believe that we have an advantage here. And that's one of the reasons why we buy a majority of our advertising in-house, because we believe we have an advantage. We've talked a little bit about that. I won't share great details, but yes, we think that's a competitive advantage. So 96 Octane is a little bit different, that's more on the creative side. But our in-house media buy and understanding of making sure that we only spend to our allowable costs, I think has, is a competitive advantage. John Sauerland : To that I would add, the digital space is obviously highly measurable and we spend a lot in the digital space and have for quite some time. Dan Witalec, in the session that Tricia mentioned, also tried to convey the level of understanding we have now in advertising attribution in the mass media space. So increasingly, we think we are able to buy shows, dayparts and understand exactly what the cost per sale is for those purchases. That obviously allows us to buy very efficiently, but also to negotiate very effectively with the media channels. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, I just wanted to get a little bit more color, I guess, on the PLE disclosure that you guys have in your Q. The growth slowed in the agency channel and it's actually down in the direct channel for a 3-month basis this quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk to a little bit about what you're seeing there. And is that being driven by what's gone on with maybe some of your competitors taking less rate and pushing for growth? Susan Griffith : Elyse, so yes, in terms of growth, we still feel positive. And the measure we use internally is trailing 12. We've talked about trailing 3 being an indicator. So we obviously always look into that. We have seen from a rating perspective, less aggressive rate taking. So if you go back a couple of years, there was a lot of rate. It's smoothed out a little bit, for the most part. There's some competitors still taking a little bit of rate and some actually reducing some rate. So that will put some pressure on PLE. That said, we continue to think about the nurture part in the ways of making sure that we take care of our customers, whether it's on the CRM side or the claims side. In addition, and I'm the executive sponsor for our retention team, there are times when we might make a decision for, and knowing that it might affect PLE negatively, on a process change. I won't go into the details, but we might look at a process change where we know it might cause customers to not stay as long, but we want to balance PLE with lifetime underwriting profit. So occasionally, we'll make those tradeoffs, because it's the right thing to do for the business. But again, we are very dedicated to continue on our path of retention and I don't have a crystal ball, but we look at really everything from rate to service to nurturing our customers. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then my second question is on the severity trends, which also did go up, based off of the disclosure in your Q. If you could just talk to what you're seeing there? And then as you think about pricing for frequency is still negative, but if severity continues to drift up, can you talk about how that might impact the prices that you plan to take? Susan Griffith : Yes, so as far as frequency, it's been -- we're pretty much in line now with the industry. We're a little bit -- it was a little bit lower in past quarters, it's fairly benign now. As far as severity, we do price to those trends. So the trend you saw this quarter was really, the increase was based mostly on collision and PIP. And PIP has a lot of volatility, so I'll talk more about collision. So our collision severity trend this quarter was just shy of 9%, about 8.7%. For the year, year-to-date, it's still like 6.7%. But we're seeing more frequency and severity on total loss vehicles, so newer vehicles becoming total losses. So if we continue to see that trend, of course, we'll price to it. And we don't price to overall. We'll price when we look at certain states and the channel, et cetera. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar of Buckingham Research Group. Amit Kumar : Just going back, I guess, to the discussion on higher severity, and Allstate flagged the same thing this morning in terms of the newer vehicles showing the higher severity component. Are you surprised by this change in trend which we are seeing? And I would have intuitively assumed that with all of that ADAS, it would have actually helped the trend somewhat in terms of collision warnings and all that stuff. Maybe just talk about has anything changed over the last 3 quarters? Because if I look at the older collision trends, it was flat. And even if I go back to '14, '15, '16, it was up in the 4% range or so. So what has changed recently? Susan Griffith : Well, very specifically, like I just talked about with Elyse, it's the total loss, both frequency and severity. And remember, even though ADAS is more and more prevalent in vehicles, there's still a large fleet out there of cars that don't have that safety equipment and there are a lot of people that have that equipment and turn it off. So it's, that's really hard to measure. From the word surprised, we just look at data. So when we look at -- when we see the data, we react to it, we watch it very closely. I try to get away from being surprised at anything I see, since we've been in this industry a long time. We always follow the data. John Sauerland : Yes, and I think the important thing to note is that our average premium has kept up, or actually, in this case, outpaced the pure premium growth, the frequency times the severity or average loss cost. So I think by that fact, you could assume that we don't have an exact under-the-line coverage. We can't predict the future, but in aggregate, our pricing has been keeping up or actually outpacing the loss cost trends. Susan Griffith : And we often talk about that. And Pat hit on that when he showed the chart of the delta. It's really about staying ahead of that trend. And we've always talked about small bites of the apple. We don't want to rate shock our customers, and we do think that influences PLE as well, so we'll continue to do that. Amit Kumar : The other question, the only other question I have -- and this 8.5 is actually very -- it's fascinating and very helpful. I don't know if this question is for you or Pat or someone else. When I look at the 8.5 deployment on slide, I think it's 14 or 15, I can't see the page number. Today versus the footprint at the end of the year, is there any method to that launch? I guess what I'm trying to understand is was there something which you noticed in those states which are being cashed up on initially and then it's being rolled out into other states? Or is that just as usual, how it sort of, how the process evolved? Susan Griffith : I'll -- if Pat wants to come up, he can, but I don't think there's a huge amount of rhyme or reason. Obviously, we want to get it out. When we believe it works, we want to get it out in high premium states, if that makes sense. Right now, we're in 15 states, 40% of the premium. There are also, there are states where we still have to get up to the 8.4 to get to the 8.5. So it's sort of a whole map and blueprint of how we're going to do things, and frankly, how it can go through our IT department as well, and so that's -- that would be my answer. John Sauerland : Yes, and how the states are currently performing on the 8.4 model, the regulatory environment can also affect the schedule. So we have a schedule that's fairly dynamic. But those are the considerations that go into that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Joshua Shanker : I want to talk about the new business penalty. You have been growing very aggressively, but you've also talked about telematics and also about customers who've been customers before who are coming back. Over time, does the new business penalty diminish for you in terms of taking on new business? Susan Griffith : Well, I think, and you can add on a little bit on this, I think from the new penalty, a lot of that comes from new business, but also from the advertising. But also, that's balanced with retention. So as our retention has grown, that has equaled out a little bit. We're going to continue to spend a lot on advertising. So that will be expensive on the direct side, but again, we only do that if we think it's efficient. You talked about telematics, that's a huge variable for us and in part, in terms of not just understanding the ultimate loss costs of those customers, and now especially, as we evolve into more distracted driving, but our preferred customer base as well. And then you talked about customers coming back. That's just us to understand both how to underwrite and understanding more about customers that have come before. So a lot of times, if it's a new customer, we don't know anything about them. We learn along the way. We've actually already known this person. It's like if you dated somebody, you broke up and you start dating again, you already knew he didn't put his shoes away. So you've got to figure that out and we know a little bit more. Not a great analogy, but it's the best I can come up with. Joshua Shanker : And along those lines, do you have a vast sort of collection of people who were customers or not -- maybe they weren't customers, they were 'try then buy' type people, who you never got around to dating? Or is that really negligible? Susan Griffith : So customers that quoted and didn't buy? Joshua Shanker : Or initially, you were talking about -- you said people could try out Snapshot and see what their discount is, and if they like the price afterwards, then they can come and you get to see how their driving is before you've actually taken on the risk. Susan Griffith : No, we had tested something called Test Drive a while -- years ago, and it was a little bit -- it was like that. But no, we, when you're with -- now you're with Snapshot, you are a customer, and we have other variables as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : So I just want to be more specific on the pricing versus loss cost trend. If you look at frequency up 6%, frequency down 3%, so that loss cost trend like up 3%. Your average premium per policy is up 4%. So you still have a little bit, like 1%, room to improve your margin. But my question is really, is that going forward, how quickly are you going to react to the potential rising cost trends on the pricing side? Will you try to catch up with it to maintain the margin? Or you could let it drift a little bit higher, because now you're in the 90%, away from the 96% target? Susan Griffith : From the reaction perspective, we are a rate machine. So we can react, I think, quicker than anybody in the industry. So that to me is something that's a really big strength of ours. We will react if we continue to see trends, whether they go down or up. And it really depends on, we can look at our conversion and we might do things differently if our conversion changes. Right now, we feel really great about where we are rate-wise. And we're not going to react, to again, one line coverage code in one quarter of severity. John Sauerland : And I'd also highlight what Sanjay was talking about, which is our product management structure that's very local and down at a pretty low level in terms of product analysis and product action. So if the product manager believes there is benefit to using that 1 point for a certain segment where they can get more competitive, perhaps it's Robinsons, and grow more, again, subject to that 96 combined ratio, they'll make that decision. So this really comes down to very smart, very motivated local folks who are figuring out how best to deploy that margin. It could be advertising. It needn't necessarily be rate level. We can say we want to advertise more in that marketplace to, again, grow as fast as we can, subject to that 96 ceiling. Susan Griffith : Yes, it's so important to have that balance of having a really healthy margin and growing. And if you make that decision because you think you can grow, we really want to make it about the -- you can grow and not just throw away that margin. Kai Pan : My follow-up question is that since you're so fixed on the 96 number, so I imagine you probably cannot wait for your segmentation model from 8.5 going up to 9.6. My question is that on the way from 8.5 to 9.6, is some -- is there a phenomenon, like, call it, diminishing marginal returns, that you get less as you move further and further? What I really am trying to get at is of your other opportunities, for example in the Robinsons, which you probably just started this progress, you could put more effort in that, making a bigger marginal impact, and with that helping accelerate the growth in Robinsons segment as well as improve the margin of that target market. Susan Griffith : Sure, and we've shared over the years, sort of those Gini curves, where you get incrementally better, and obviously, there are big segmentation variables that kind of give you that leapfrog. Think of credit and especially for us, usage-based insurance. Where I think our biggest opportunity is, and John, feel free to weigh in, is the fact that now we own a homeowners company. And to be able to share the data of losses that happen in both home and auto and have that deep segmentation on the home front and the auto front and combine those. So to me, there's so much to do there, and that's what's so exciting about our ownership, our eventual full ownership, of Progressive Home ASI. John Sauerland : Yes, and we did start at product version 1.0. So there's been a lot of iterations. And they've all been far incrementally better than the prior version. We think there are a lot of other opportunities. You both hit on, in talking about the Robinsons and pricing the household more effectively over time, even beyond auto and home is an opportunity for us as well. But we absolutely, as Pat showed, have 8.6 in the R&D lab, and we'll be out soon with that. We even have 8.7. So we look at the opportunities that are in front of us, figure out which we want to deploy and which product model. And invariably, we have many more opportunities on our list than we actually roll to market and they just roll to the next product version. So we are not yet seeing any diminishing returns in terms of product model upgrades. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Paul Newsome : You talked about the importance of, in prior companies, prior insurance, has the type of company that you get your customers for, I'm assuming it has changed. Maybe you could talk about how it has changed over time in the last year or so, in terms of where you're -- from whom, what type of competitor are you getting your typical customer today, versus before? Susan Griffith : Yes, I mean, I think there's obviously a lot of big players. So we focus on the bigger players, as I'm sure they focus on us. A lot of it has to do with rate. So if you get behind in rate and you have to take a lot, those customers are going to shop and they will likely come to another company that has a well-known brand, like Progressive. And so I won't necessarily name competitors, but we've seen a lot from some of the major competitors, and I think that had to do with just rate. And it's easy to shop auto insurance in both the agency and the direct channel and we see that when people raise their rates. Paul Newsome : What about cross distribution? I mean, obviously, direct is taking share in general. But could you talk a little bit about any changes in how people are -- I mean, are people going straight from agency to direct? Or are they going from agency to independent to direct? How has that process evolved in recent years? Susan Griffith : It's hard to say. So I think for years, people thought everyone would go direct. We have a very healthy robust Agency business. We have 30,000, 40,000 independent agents and they are growing. We're really happy about that. So I think it really is an individual thing. And for us, we want to be where, when and how customers want to shop. So we've got the direct channel, we continue to grow in that across the board, but more specifically on the homeowner side. So I think years ago, people said, \"I wouldn't shop for auto online, that's crazy.\" A lot of people do it now -- actually, obviously, a lot of people. And from a homeowner's perspective, the same thing. And we're seeing a lot of people shopping through our HomeQuote Explorer. So really for us, it's about the individual comfort level of how you shop. So it's hard for me to look at data across there, but I will tell you, we are growing in both channels, obviously as you see, substantially, but very happy with that. And we'll watch trends as they change, but so far, we really do focus on what the customers want to do. John Sauerland : And while we've seen, in aggregate, a trend towards more direct, what we see within channels is generally, people are shopping within the channel. So if you looked at the distribution of our customers, new customers, it would pretty fairly reflect the companies and their market share within those respective channels. The direct channel, actually, in aggregate over the past few years, has been actually taking more share from captive agent companies than from independent agent companies. Share for independent agents has actually stayed fairly constant. And we've seen captive share drop a bit and direct, increase. When we talk about prior insurance in our rating, we're talking about a lot more than just from where you came most recently. We're looking at a longer history of how many different carriers you were with, how long were you with them. It's a combination of a lot of similar attributes like that, that we're looking at that segments what was previously a fairly binary rating variable of do you have prior insurance or don't you? We've now segmented that far more finely. Susan Griffith : Thanks for that, I wasn't catching that. And I think on the captive side, it makes sense, because you only have one choice. And so for us, that's why we've really loved working with independent agents, because they do have choices, and I think people will demand that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Marcos Holanda of Raymond James. Marcos Holanda : So in the context of the achieved milestone of $30 billion in premium, I was hoping you guys could discuss the balance between capital demands and growth, and how that could potentially affect your annual variable dividend, and if you can discuss the formula for that dividend, that would be great. Susan Griffith : Yes, so I mean, obviously, we want to grow as fast as we can. And this is a fairly capital-intensive business. We're not buying things, but we have to have regular -- regulatory capital and then contingent capital, so it has taken a demand. We obviously just went to the debt market for another $550 million. And we believe that will allow us to continue to grow throughout this year and next. The variable dividend is based on a percentage of after-tax underwriting profit. It's a formula that the board approves every year, so -- and that's changed over the years. It used to be 20%, then it was 25%. This year, it's 33.5%. We multiply that times the gain share factor within the company. So right now, our gain share factor is 1.91. It varies from a 0 to a maximum of a 2 point. So if you do that math across that multiplication, that's how we come up with the variable dividend. The only caveat to that with the variable dividend is if our after-tax comprehensive underwriting, I mean, comprehensive earnings are less than our after-tax underwriting profit, then we don't pay anything. We pay 0. That's happened once, and that was in 2008 during the financial crisis. John Sauerland : And that is, as we say in the Qs and the Ks, it's subject to board discretion. So the board could choose, even if that criteria that Tricia just mentioned, of comprehensive income having to be greater than after-tax underwriting income, is not met, the board could choose to pay a dividend nonetheless. And if the board chose to pay less than the formula, it's under their discretion as well. We do have a lot of capital needs, given our growth. We're on track for almost an additional $6 billion in premium this year. We think of our surplus needs as a 3 to 1 for auto and around half that for home, so a blend that's in the 2.8, 2.9-ish kind of range right now. And obviously, we want to continue to grow. And that's why we did access capital markets recently, again, to ensure that we have the capital we need to support the operating business. If you look at our financial policies, I think you'll find it is all about supporting that operating entity, because that is how we consistently drive shareholder value. So we think we're in a pretty good position going into the next year. Depending upon how much growth we have next year, we may find ourselves in need of incremental capital. That will remain to be seen. Margins obviously right now are very good. Investment returns could be better, is the way I would characterize it. So we'll see how that plays out going to the next year, but right now, we feel great about our position. Julia Hornack : I'm actually going to take a question from the webcast now : Please discuss your ambitions. And I think that this is because multiple times in the past, we've talked a lot about the different sizes of the property and casualty market, the Personal Lines segment versus Commercial Lines segment. Please discuss your ambitions in the Commercial Lines insurance business. Do you envision in 10 years that Progressive will be a significant underwriter of such lines as worker's compensation, commercial property, commercial liability, et cetera? Susan Griffith : So we talked a little bit, I talked a little bit about this in my letter. And we obviously just rolled out what we call BQX, BusinessQuote Explorer. So that is insurance for small business. Think of GL and business owner policy. That is something that we believe we have a lot of opportunity, just getting started there. I'm not going to venture out and talk about 10 years from now. What I'll say is this, that we're the #1 Commercial Auto writer. We have a brand and we have the availability to, I think, really -- we have a lot of runway, I should say, to really grow in that space, because of our brand, because of our knowledge of that area. And whether we write it all on our paper, or use partners, which we will be using, assume it will do -- it will be like what we did with home, with our Advantage Agency on the Personal Lines side. We see this whole destination for commercial and that's what we have been building. We started building it last year. We just rolled out, had a soft launch this quarter. So all I can say is, I'm not going to talk 10 years out, lots of opportunity, we're very excited about it. And we believe it'll be something really significant. John Sauerland : Yes, we've noted before, the Commercial Lines space in property and casualty is in excess of $300 billion. And we play in a slice of that Commercial Auto historically and today, really that is probably 10% of that. And we are aspiring to move into a broader offering on our own paper as well. So the BusinessQuote Explorer offering today is predominantly third-party carriers for coverages outside of Commercial Auto. We have filed with the first state a general liability and business owners policy, and we hope to be out in that state early next year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer Shields : I'm trying to understand whether the increasing sophistication of the pricing that you're talking about, does that make your near-term results more or less subject to [ just ] variables like gas prices? Susan Griffith : I'm not sure if I understood the question. I missed -- I -- you mumbled a little bit in the front or I didn't really hear the first part of it. Meyer Shields : I'm sorry I mumbled. I'm just trying to understand, given the reliance on data, and obviously, it's working out really well, I don't mean to sound critical. But does this make your results, your underwriting results, more or less dependent on external realities? So I'm using gas prices as an example, maybe that will affect overall mileage. Susan Griffith : Right. I mean, I think from that perspective, when you look at macroeconomic data like gas prices and unemployment, those normally end up affecting frequency. And we sort of, we don't price for frequency. We really price for severity. So I would say it's always important, so we always look at it. We follow it very closely to determine trends. I would say -- I wouldn't say it necessarily changes. Would you differ? John Sauerland : No, I really don't think having greater sophistication in your pricing puts you at any -- in any different position relative to loss cost trends that are driven by gas prices, other economic changes. I really don't. So based -- those other economic changes might affect segments of customers more or less than others. And to that degree, we might see changes in trends more so. Say if unemployment increases over the past, we have seen changes in claiming behavior and coverages such as Personal Injury Protection. So to the extent your segmentation drives your mix of customers to one end of the spectrum or not, you might be at greater risk in terms of economic changes. But in aggregate, I would say it's really not an issue. Meyer Shields : And then the second question. I'm trying to understand the elasticity of pricing within homeowners compared to auto. My superficial assumption would be that there's less elasticity, because typically, a smaller dollar policy, but I don't know if that's accurate. Susan Griffith : I think that would be accurate. I'm not -- I -- do you... John Sauerland : Yes, so shopping for auto insurance is a lot easier than shopping for homeowners insurance. So I think there is some greater stickiness. The fact is that for a lot of homeowners, that homeowners premium is bundled within their mortgage as well. So it's not quite as obvious when the rate changes. So I think if your hypothesis is elasticity is greater in auto than home, I think that'd be a fair assumption. Susan Griffith : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Gary Ransom : I wanted to ask about UBI and its use in segmentation. I assume it's still an add-on at the end of the various other variables. And you can correct me if I'm wrong on that. But do you envision a time when that actually might begin to be more infused in the rating plan and become more of a primary variable, one that replaces other variables? I just would like a view of how you're looking about the UBI portion of the sophisticated segmentation. Susan Griffith : Yes, I mean, I think for us, the UBI is obviously so powerful that we would love to have it in every single auto quote. I think the issue is, obviously, it's a voluntary -- it's at a voluntary perspective. At some point, the car could be -- the car could be the place that actually tells you how you're driving, if we have that technology and the infrastructure to be able to understand that driving behavior. So right now, it's one of many variables. We think it's -- we know it's really powerful. We want to be able to give good drivers great prices. And so we'll continue to advertise on that. I wouldn't say that -- I actually wouldn't say it's necessarily an add-on, but it's not something that everyone has. So it's not like everyone has -- we're going to have everyone's proof of where their garaging address is. So I don't know if I'd call that an add-on or not. It's a variable that we think is important. And for people that want to get great rates, they're going to actually, obviously, do UBI. And if not -- or they go and they don't get great rates, they will leave and go to another competitor, which is okay with us. John Sauerland : So Gary, I'm guessing you're thinking from your actuarial point of view, and in terms of solving for the efficacy in terms of increasing the accuracy of the rate, it is actually solved last. Because not all of our customers take UBI, we want the greater program to be accurate for all of those customers. Then we solve incrementally, and it has a lot of incremental power, we solve that last. Would we prefer that everyone take it? As Tricia said, absolutely yes. Will there be a day when that is the model? It very well could be. Certainly, as data comes from vehicles directly going forward, and even today, data coming from handhelds increasingly. So I think there could be a day, I wasn't -- in the very near future, where it is all solved simultaneously. And that would get us the biggest benefit from the rating information. But today, we solve that -- for that last. Does that answer the question? Gary Ransom : Yes, that does. And maybe a follow-up to slip into homeowners, is, are you using data from any of the Internet of Things type technologies and collecting that? Is that a useful means of segmentation in homeowners? Susan Griffith : Yes, we're working on that. We have a couple of people, both at Progressive Home and here at Progressive, working on connected home and ultimately how that -- how we can understand what people do and what people buy and how that affects loss cost. Probably too early to tell right now. Those would be my answer, but yes, we're definitely looking at that. John Sauerland : We have pricing segmentation based on the different perils and the different technologies that can be deployed to try and limit losses on those perils, so water, fire, theft. The take rate now is very, very low. So the deployment of such technology is really just beginning. And we have discounts for those devices. I will admit that the data behind the discounts for those devices is somewhat limited, based on the fact that we simply haven't had much history. But that is absolutely where our product is designed to go. And as Tricia said, we have a lot of people who are actively making sure we are a leader when it comes to deploying those types of things in our rating for homeowners. Susan Griffith : And I think ultimately, what you want to get to from a home perspective, because the severity is so much higher than say in auto, is if you have a device and it alerts you, you have to stop the loss or at least lessen the loss from happening. That's really the key, is if you have something and you are on vacation and you can't stop the water leakage, that doesn't really help much. It's really about understanding and lowering loss cost. Gary Ransom : I wonder if I can -- can I just fit it one little one, too? How important, on the different levels of segmentation, that you're going from 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, the speed of that. How important is that replacement, that constant replacement, to your ability to develop the adverse selection that you talked about earlier? Susan Griffith : I think it's critical. John Sauerland : It's very important. So as you know, most of our rating algorithms are filed and in the public domain. The minute we send them to the Departments of Insurance, as we mentioned in the presentations, we are also looking at our competitors' filings. So we are copied very quickly. This is, frankly, about running faster. And then we talked about the iterations of 8.7, 8.9. 9.6, I think, was where we were headed. It's critical we continue to get them out fast. Susan Griffith : And it's more fun. Actually, that's the way, what Sanjay said, that's the fun part of being a product manager, is you -- some of that segmentation comes from grassroots efforts, and then we look at them countrywide. And there's a lot on the table, a lot of exciting things. So it is about running faster. It's in our DNA and we'll continue to do it. Julia Hornack : So we are going to sneak in one last caller, even though we are past the 3 :00 hour. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : I have 2 questions. One, as you continue to improve on your segmentation and pricing, I guess one thing that's quite notable is that your combined ratio is actually improving along the way as well. And I would have thought that with the target of growing as fast as you can, 96, it would kind of be the opposite way around and maybe achieve even greater growth while keeping to the 90 -- or getting as close to the 96 as possible. So I guess my question is, is the fact that 96 is -- or that you're well below 96, is that just because you're still keeping some margins of error and you're being cautious in how you're pricing? Or frequency is below what you had expected it to be? Or is there some other deliberate driver there that would keep the combined ratio as low as it is? Susan Griffith : Remember, it's 96 or better. So 4 is sort of the, we have to have, and then it's better. Frequency is one input. Again, we talked about today when I wrote in my letter, mix is a big difference, too, having more preferred customers. We still have a small percentage of the Robinsons. We have a lot of room to grow on that. And we also highlight and put a lot of emphasis on our cost structure, both on the LAE side and what we call non-acquisition expense ratio. So it's a bunch of different things in play that goes into our widened margins. Yaron Kinar : I understand all that, but I would have thought that, that could be priced for it to begin with. And not that I'm complaining about 20% net premiums growth in any way, shape or form, but why wouldn't it be 30% with keeping margins a little bit lower? Susan Griffith : Well, again, we said we look at state by state, channel by channel, segment by segment. And if we believe that -- one, the growth has been tremendous. But if we believe that there is an area where we think we could grow more handily, or we think that there's an opportunity to beat out the competition, we would absolutely consider whether limiting margins or reducing margins there to get that growth should happen. We go through that exercise all the time. So there's a handful of states right now where we have reduced new business rates in order to grow. We look at a lot of different data to understand that, conversion being one of them. Again, you could easily say, yes, let's -- if we can grow 40%, if you said to me right now, could we grow 10 more points and only lose 0.5 point of combined ratio, I'd say yes. But you just don't want to throw away that margin and not get the growth. So it's really surgical when you make that tradeoff. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then my second question, I think you've often described yourself more as an -- a technology company than an insurer. And it seems like now there is another technology company entering this space, or dipping its toe in the water, Amazon. And if I understand Amazon's mission correctly, it's basically to take margin out of businesses and out of industries. So I'm just curious to hear your thoughts as to how homeowners, or maybe even auto eventually, gets impacted as Amazon tries to build an -- a presence in insurance. Susan Griffith : Yes, I mean, I think we'll cross that bridge when we see it in terms of that, if we see it. Insurance is a complex product, having 51 jurisdictions. It's highly regulated, not an easy place to get into and do it well and make money. I think Pat said, \"It's easy to make money, it's easy to grow, not easy to do both.\" So we have 80-plus years of experience. We've had ups and downs, way more ups than downs. That said, we've seen a lot of competition come along over our 80-plus years. And we believe we're well-positioned, with all the things that we've said, in terms of great brand, incredible segmentation, great people and culture, service like no other. So we'll take all of our advantages, our competitive advantages, and work to continue to grow and grow profitably. Julia Hornack : So thank you everybody for your time and interest today. We've exhausted our scheduled time and then some. So Chanel, I'm going to hand over the call back to you for the closing scripts.

The dial-in information and passcode are available on the Events page at investors.progressive.com.  Acting as moderator for the event will be Julia Hornack. At this time, I will turn the event over to Ms. Hornack. Julia Hornack : Thank you, Carmen, and good afternoon to all. Today we will begin with a brief presentation by our Chief Human Resources Officer, Lori Niederst, about our culture and people being a competitive advantage. This presentation will include 2 videos, so we recommend joining our live webcast through the Events page on investors.progressive.com.  Our presentation will be followed by Q&A session with our CEO, Tricia Griffith; and our CFO, John Sauerland. Our Chief Investment Officer, Bill Cody; and our General Manager of Progressive's Home business, Dave Pratt, will also join us by phone for Q&A. This event is scheduled to last 90 minutes.  As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during the event.

These documents can be found via the Investors page of our website, progressive.com. It's now my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith. Susan Griffith : Good afternoon, and welcome to Progressive's fourth quarter webcast. We have a great session for you today. I'm going to quickly recap 2018. Hopefully you've had a chance to read the Annual Report and my letter to shareholders. But in a nutshell, an incredible year. 20% net written premium growth at a 90.6 combined ratio, so a lot of margin, way more than our actual goal of hitting at least $0.04.  We grew the topline over $5.4 billion in net written premium. And that was on top of 2017 when we grew $3.8 billion on top of 2016 when we grew $2.8 billion. So $2.8 billion, $3.8 million, $5.4 billion, incredible growth. That momentum has really sustained us as we head into 2019.  All of this compiled into a comprehensive return on equity with our investment returns of just around 24%. So great results. We also had a lot of celebrations and milestones that we were able to accomplish this year. I wrote about them in my annual letter to shareholders, but it's been a really wonderful year internally to Progressive to make sure that we celebrated both internal and external goals that we reached. I will let you know though, specifically for this audience, we don't rest on our laurels. We are hitting the ground running in 2019, and again, always trying to grow as fast as we can, make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit and take good care of our customers.  So from then, I wanted to just take a second and thank all the Progressive employees for all they've done this year and how we've succeeded in such an incredible year, and we've done it together, which is the theme of this year's Annual Report.  This slide should be very familiar with you, it's our 4 cornerstones. Who we are, why we're here, where we're headed and how we're going to get there. Who we are. We have 5 core values. We talk about them all the time. I'm not going to go into detail in them today, but Lori Niederst will when she gives her presentation.  Why we're here. We have a purpose statement. True to our name, Progressive. And that's really about doing better today than yesterday. Progress on how we are as a people and culture, progress for our shareholders and the customers that we are privileged to serve. We want to continue to challenge ourselves to have that always grow mindset and continually ask ourselves questions how we can continue to get better. Where we are headed, our vision. We want to be consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance. We get closer to that goal every single day as we add more and more customers. And how we are going to get there? That is our strategy. And that's really been the crux of what we've talked about in the last several webcast sessions. If you notice, there's a little bit different graphic on this one, and that I'll tell you about it in a little while, but it really is part of our employees of our Colorado Springs call center been a participant in the artwork for the employee annual report.  The tactics in the deep dives we have done in terms of our strategy pillars in the blue sections have really been around segmentation, brands, cost effectiveness and those are really important, but it doesn't work without our people and our culture.  So these are some people in Colorado Springs several months ago as part of our Annual Report. I was there that day. It was actually the same day we did Keys to Progress, where we give vehicles away to veterans in need. A very cold day, but really a wonderful day to be able to have all the celebrations. So let me back up a little bit and talk about how we think about the Annual Report.  As most of you know, art is a really important part of our culture and work environment at Progressive. Peter Lewis started that many, many years ago. And in 1988, he decided to make art a part of the Annual Report. So he would think of a theme and choose an artist, and we would have a piece made, whether it's a sculpture or a painting or a picture that reflected that theme. So as an example, in my first year as CEO, my theme was transition. That made sense. I took over in July of 2016 and Glenn really prepared me to take over, and so that seamless transition was really important to us as a company.  Last year when we had that growth on top of 2016's growth, I felt -- really felt like we were accelerating. So that was a theme, acceleration. We put our foot on the gas and were able to really accelerate.  This year's theme is together. And it really came to me as we were going through the year, about August, I thought, man, this has been such a great year and doing it together in unity. And that doesn't make it easy all the time. It doesn't make it great all the time in terms of not challenging each other. That's actually the best part of Progressive. Challenging each other, having great discussions and debate that ultimately lead us to the outcome that we had in an incredible 2018.  So to illustrate this theme, we chose Nathaniel Parsons, and he created what we call Camp Waterfall -- Wanderfall. And what it does it really takes -- it took a bunch of Progressive employees across the country that he worked with to create an installation that will ultimately be back here at our campus locations for us to enjoy. I was going to go through kind of step-by-step how Nathaniel created this and how our thought process was around the theme of together, but instead we thought we put together a 4-minute video to show you the making of the 2018 Annual Report.  [Presentation] Susan Griffith : So I hope you enjoyed that and all of the artwork is also on our Investor Relations webpage, so please feel free to view that.  It's funny how much we've grown because in that video that was only a couple of months ago I said 36,000 people and now we have over 38,000 people, which has been pretty incredible.  But because our people and our culture are such an important management, I've asked Lori Niederst, our Chief Human Resource Officer, to come up and talk about that today. Following her will be John Sauerland, and he's going to talk about our dividend policy change. And of course, we did some QA in our November's earnings release and I wrote about it in my annual letter to shareholders, so hopefully there's a lot of clarity around why we made the change, but he'll come up and talk about that as well.  So let me give you a little background on Lori. So Lori started her career in public accounting as a CPA. She came to Progressive about 21 years ago as an analyst in the finance group. She quickly moved to our call centers, which now we refer to as CRM, customer relationship management centers and did a variety jobs with increasing responsibility. I first met Lori when I was in her role and was hiring a Comp and Benefits Director. And when she first interviewed, we had a couple of different interviews, I loved the fact that she cared deeply about our people and our culture, really has always been a steward of our culture, then she had this balance of great business acumen. And I love the fact that she could bring both to that job as Comp and Benefits Manager. That's where she really learned the business of HR. And she and I along the years talked about other opportunities that she might do and how to best suit her up for that. So we thought it would be good for her to do a field HR job. So when the claims field HR job came open, she applied for that and landed that role. And that was a perfect HR field role because : one, it's the most employees we have for the company, and we spent a lot of money in claims. So every dollar that comes in, the most we spend out is in the claims organization. So she learned very deeply that part of our organization. And a little bit over 2 years ago, Lori became Chief Human Resource Officer, and she continues to apply that great balance of incredible business acumen and just caring so much about our culture. And the one thing that I love about having her on our team, and I think the rest of my team will agree, is that pretty much on any given day, Lori challenges us. And she challenges us to be better, and I think that's really important with an HR partner. So I'm going to let Lori take it from here. Lori Niederst : Thank you, Tricia. So as I was preparing for today, I assumed that I'd have to make the case for why culture is a relevant topic for this audience. But then about a month ago, in a letter to board members, State Street CEO made that case for me. He described corporate culture as one of the many growing intangibles that affects a company's ability to execute its long-term strategy. He also cited a recent EY study that concluded intangible assets, such as culture, drive more than half of an organization's market value.  We not only think culture is a relevant topic. We believe our people and our Progressive culture are our greatest source of competitive advantage. So my objective today is to describe why we believe that to be true.  Our culture is the foundation upon which we've designed people strategies and together, they generate our business outcomes. If there are any cracks in this foundation, our results will suffer. If our people strategies aren't aligned with our business objectives, our results will suffer. However, it's the strength of our culture and our successful people strategies that have allowed us to achieve exceptional results and sustain truly competitive advantage.  Our culture, as Tricia said, is deeply rooted in our core values that Peter Lewis introduced over 30 years ago. These 5 values aren't just words on paper. We take them to heart. We introduce our core values in new hire training and we reinforce them on a daily basis. Our core values guide our business decisions and define how we treat each other, our customers and our investors. Although they've been in place for decades, our core values continue to be closely aligned with our company strategy. As an insurance company, our product is a promise. It's a promise to be there when our customers need us most. We must have a culture of integrity if we want to make good on that promise and earn our customers' trust. Our customers have choices when it comes to insurers. We must have people to believe in and abide by the golden rule if we want to provide service that motivates our customers to stay.  We have formidable competitors in an industry that's evolving. We must have a culture of excellence, one that's always striving to improve if we want to anticipate and respond to the changes in our industry's landscape.  We seek to consistently provide consumer and shareholder value. We must have our team of 38,000 Progressive people with clear objectives, motivated and focused and growing as fast as possible at or below 96 combined ratio.  As Peter said when he introduced our core values, we are pragmatic and we recognize that we must earn a profit in order to be a successful business. But it's the first 4 values that ensure we earn this profit in the right way.  We are confident that our core values and, therefore, our culture continues to be aligned with our company's strategy and the interest of our people, our consumers and our shareholders. Beyond the words and our core values, our culture can be really hard to describe. So to give you a sense or a feeling of our Progressive culture, I'd like you to hear it from our people.  [Presentation] Lori Niederst : Tricia said it so well. Whatever part of the company I worked in, whatever job title I was in, to me, it always just felt like Progressive.  But how do we know that our culture is strong? How do we know that it's creating competitive advantage? First, our people tell us. Just last week, I received an e-mail from Tim, an analyst in our IT control group, and Tim described our core values as the anchor of our culture. And he compared his time at Progressive to his service in the Coast Guard. And Tim shared that even when he is working with someone new, he always just feels immediately like they are on the same team.  In addition to the anecdotes, we've got data to support our conclusion. For decades, we've been conducting an annual employee survey, and we recently started using Gallup's Engagement Index. As we expected, engagement at Progressive is significantly higher than the U.S. workforce. 68% of Progressive people are engaged compared to 33% of U.S. workers. And only 4% of Progressive people are actively disengaged compared to 16% of U.S. workers. Our 2018 results place us in the 96th percentile of all companies who use Gallup survey and only 2% of Progressive people disagree with this statement, \"Our core values guide our business decisions and define how we treat each other.\" For years, we have also conducted an annual compliance and ethics survey and here too, we learn the strength of Progressive's culture. Our results last year were the best of all 32 companies using Ethisphere survey and 99% of Progressive people said they are familiar with our core values.  And we don't have any easy jobs at Progressive. We work really hard and we have very high expectations, but we are unapologetic about this. And as a result, Progressive isn't the place for everyone. Yet our 8% voluntary turnover rate in this job market is further proof that a strong culture produces business benefits.  Upon this strong foundation, we've designed people strategies that leverage our talent, ideas and energy. These strategies aren't fleeting. They've been tested and proven successful in every phase of the insurance cycle. While we foresee these strategies continuing to serve us well, like every other part of our business, we're constantly analyzing outcomes, monitoring the results and we make changes whenever it's necessary. I'll highlight 3 of our key people strategies that we think are uniquely Progressive. The first is transparency and openness. In our 2002 Annual Report, we said that our desire for transparency demonstrates our belief that good decisions flow from clear information. There are many examples of how we've managed our relationship with investors and consumers with transparency. The most notable are reporting our financial results monthly to our investors and providing comparison rates to our customers. We are committed to the same transparency and openness with our people.  If you missed everything I just said because you were distracted by the art in this particular Annual Report, then I'll probably have to tell Glenn that 16 years later, it's still having the intended effect.  So let's get back to transparency and openness. For us, it all starts with our approach to communication. Similar to our practice of reporting our results monthly to investors, we make a commitment to tell our people what we know when we know it. This means we are often sharing information before we have all the answers. And at times, this can be uncomfortable, but we believe it builds trust in our leaders and strengthens our culture.  Another example of our transparency and openness in communication is our diversity and inclusion report that we first published last year. In this report, we summarize our progress, highlight our opportunities and tell the story of some of our incredible people. In this report, we also disclose our employee demographics to our people and to the public. And we declare our commitment to pay equity and proudly state that we have gender and racial pay equity at Progressive.  Another example of our transparency and openness and communication is what we call our open door policy. Any Progressive person can reach out to any manager or any HR representative in the company when they have a question or a concern or they want to share an idea. It's not uncommon for Tricia or anyone else on our executive team to get a phone call or to get stopped in the hallway by someone who wants to share their perspective. But we don't just hope our people speak up, we expect them to. And when they do, we protect them. That's our open door policy.  Our commitment to transparency and openness transcends communication and it applies in other areas like compensation. Much like we provide comparison rates to customers, we provide comparison rates for our jobs. We publish the salary range and bonus target for every job in the company. And we also provide market median data to help our people understand how much they might earn at a similar job at another company.  We believe this transparency with compensation generates good conversations and produces fair outcomes. It requires us to be really diligent in managing compensation and it forces our Progressive managers to make fair and equitable decisions when they set pay.  Transparency and openness are key people strategies that are a model for the behaviors that we expect of ourselves as we interact with our customers, our shareholders and each other.  The second people strategy that I'll share with you is what we call cohesive diversity. At Progressive, we leverage each of our unique differences to make it collective we stronger. We're disciplined and focused, and we like to win, but we don't compete against each other. We compete together to become consumers' #1 choice for insurance.  We reinforce this cohesiveness or togetherness, as Tricia described it, in many ways. We have aligned job objectives that cascade throughout our organization and provide each of us line of sight into how the work we -- each of us do contributes to our company goals. Our performance evaluation process is rooted in coaching and development, and every Progressive person participates in our gain share bonus program.  Gain share rewards us altogether based on company growth and profitability. This was true last year when our gain share factor was 1.91, meaning each of us earned almost twice our annual bonus target. It was also true in 2000 when the factor was 0 and none of us received a bonus.  On gain share day this past December, Tricia received a really touching message from Eric, one of our call center consultants who's been with us since 2002. Eric told the story of his mother who sadly passed away not long after he joined Progressive. Eric promised his mom that he would send his son, Noah, to college. And he's been saving his gain share bonus every year, so that he could afford to make his mother's dying wish come true. Eric reached out to Tricia to thank her for last year's bonus because it was the final savings he needed to fund Noah's tuition. For Eric, this was a very personal celebration in addition to the Progressive gain share celebration that included all 38,000 of us. This cohesion may seem like a small detail, but it has a profound impact on our culture. Our people are motivated to teach and help one another. In fact, it's not uncommon for peers who are competing for the same promotion to encourage each other and even share interview strategies. I experienced this several times in my Progressive career. And most recently, it was about 2.5 years ago when I applied for the CHRO position. I knew many of my peers who had also applied for the role and a few of them even called me before the interview started to see what they could learn from my HR experience.  When it was announced that I was offered the position, one of the first people I saw was one of those peers and she came right up to me, congratulated me, gave me this giant hug and then reminded me that she is not a hugger.  Our togetherness or cohesion is only part of the strategy. That cohesion is stronger because we embrace our diversity. Diversity and inclusion are strategies that we thread through every facet of talent management. From our hiring practices that ensure we have diverse candidate pools to our development programs that teach cultural competency and make us more aware of our unconscious bias. To our job objectives that hold each of us as leaders accountable for cohesive diversity.  Like many companies, we leverage our ERGs, or employee resource groups, to support our efforts and at Progressive, the results speak for themselves. More than 13,000 Progressive people belong to an ERG. And these members are more engaged, more likely to apply for a promotion and more likely to stay with Progressive. But unlike other companies, our ERGs aren't just affinity groups. They bring us together to tackle the difficult topics that are dominating the headlines. A great example is our courageous conversations series, which brings small groups together to talk about real examples of bias in the workplace. Courageous conversations makes us feel uncomfortable and vulnerable but in a safe environment where we are learning from each other.  For more than 40 years, we've also been leveraging our art collection to spark conversation and learn to respect our differences. One of the first artworks that Peter Lewis installed in the '70s was a series of Andy Warhol's Maos. It being the end of the Vietnam war era, these images upset many Progressive people and they wrote to Peter expressing their opposition. In fact, 300 of the then 400 employees shared their opinions. Peter was invigorated by this response and it inspired the art collection's mission of provocation. We continue to leverage our art today to foster conversations about our values and our cohesive diversity. As an example, our 3-day workshop for new leaders includes a course that we call, Uniquely Me, Together Progressive, where we use artworks to help recognize a variety of perspectives and learn to leverage them as we lead our teams. Our ERGs and our art collection are just 2 examples of our cohesive diversity come to life, leveraging our differences and making us stronger.  The third people strategy that I'll share with you is our talent pipeline strategy. For decades, we've been developing claims reps, calls center reps, analysts and product managers into talented business athletes that rise to our executive ranks. This grow our own strategy is a real differentiator for us, so let me explain how it works. Over 90% of our people in our entry-level jobs were hired from the outside, where we're able to attract a talented and diverse candidate pool.  In our Manager ranks, over 90% of our people were promoted from within. Now I am sure we are not the only company who's focused on promoting from within, but when we compare our internal promotion rates to those of our peers on Fortune's best companies to work for less, we find that our internal promotion rate is far above average.  Feeding our pipeline starts with external hiring, and the growth in our business has required us to feed this pipeline with over 20,000 external hires in the past 3 years. Our growth has come during one of the lowest unemployment periods in 50 years. And adding to our challenge, we're competing in over 250 labor markets, each with their own local competitors.  Add to that, we are selling a career in insurance. But despite the constricting labor market, and in contrast with other companies who are really struggling to find talent, we are consistently filling our open positions and we are making great hires. Our Progressive brand helps us attract a significant number of candidates for each job that we post. In fact, we hire less than 2% of the people who apply for a job at Progressive. To help us manage this significant applicant volume, we're leveraging sophisticated analyses that help us understand the number of candidates we need by job and by market to have confidence that we've got a qualified hire in the group.  We're also adopting many of the approaches that we've learned from our marketing and media teams to advertise our jobs. We know our cost per hire, candidate demographic and success on the job by channel and by source, and we're leveraging this data to optimize our spend.  While our marketing budget in recruiting has several fewer zeros than Flos, we like to think we're learning from the best and we're applying the same discipline. We seek to hire the right talent with the right raw materials, but the real advantage comes from our ability to develop, retain and promote our people. All of our HR practices are designed to support this talent pipeline strategy, including our compensation plans. If you want to earn more at Progressive, you look to get promoted. And because of our transparency, you know exactly what promotions are available and how much more you can earn.  Again, promoting from within isn't unique to Progressive, but promotions at Progressive are different. They aren't appointments or designations. Instead openings are posted and anyone who's interested and qualified can apply. It's an open and transparent process. This process requires more responsibility on our employees to chart their own career path, but it also results in some pretty progressive career paths.  Tricia shared my journey from analyst to CHRO, and I'll share John Barbagallo's. John was hired as a claims rep. He was promoted to a supervisor, moved to a field sales manager, was promoted again to a product manager and then a National Accounts Manager before pursuing a job at another company. John soon learned the errors in his ways and he came back to Progressive to hold positions in product design and agency management before becoming our Commercial Lines President.  But this isn't unique to me and John. Our pipeline strategy has produced our current class of executives. The average company tenure of our executive team is 22 years. According to our review of proxy and other publicly available information, this is a lot higher than the average at our industry competitors, and this tenure translates to a leadership team that deeply understands our business and our culture and can pass it on to the next-generation of Progressive leaders.  In fact, Jeff Charney is the only current executive who was hired into his position from the outside. And that's not to say we'll never hire another executive or another senior leader externally. But when we do, it's because our business changed and required skills or experiences that we don't currently have. This was true for the talent we recently added in our strategy organization and it was true when we hired Jeff 9 years ago, which makes it pretty funny that we all still think of Jeff as a new guy even though it's been 9 years already. This strategy has served us well for decades. But when our organic open posting process isn't creating enough opportunity for development, we manufacture those opportunities with job swaps. I'll share a recent example.  Last year, we identified 7 high-performing senior leaders who we thought would benefit from leading in a different part of our business. Sanjay Vyas who presented at our last webcast was part of this job swap. Sanjay had 15 years of experience in our product organization. He was promoted through the ranks and became General Manager of our resell. Sanjay's deep product background is a huge asset to us, but we wanted to give him the opportunity to learn a different side of our business at a very granular level. So we asked Sanjay to become our claims controller, where he will learn claims, which he knew, but not nearly as well as he will after serving as controller.  We are so committed to developing talent that we conduct these job swaps when we think the time is right for our people, not necessarily when it's ideal for our business. This was the case with the swap I just mentioned. We were experiencing significant growth, which creates a whole host of business challenges, but we were willing to disrupt what was working well and introduce some risks because we deeply believe in the long-term benefits of our talent pipeline strategy.  We also deploy functional groups of leaders to solve complex business problems. We assemble a diverse group and assign them what amounts to a part-time job on top of their day job. This experience provides individual development and it provides business benefits. The most significant recent example is a team that we put together to identify our horizon 2 and horizon 3 opportunities and this team ultimately formed the strategy organization, which is led by Andrew Quigg.  For our newer leaders, we invest in a whole host of development programs aimed at preparing them for more senior roles. Our flagship program is one that's sponsored by our ERGs. This 18-month development program teaches business acumen, analytical skills and cultural competency. Because our talent pipeline is a key people strategy, we analyze promotions and career moves like other companies analyze turnover. We know that participants of the development program that I just described are 50% more likely to get promoted. We know our people who work in an office apply for promotions at a higher rate than our people who work from home. And we leverage data like this to design career paths that best leverage our talent.  Now it's one thing for me to tell you that this is a competitive advantage, but it's quite another when it's validated by an external source. We recently assessed our organizational effectiveness using McKinsey's Organizational Health Index. We ranked in the top decile of companies using this tool. And we were aligned with their leadership factory classification, meaning we have strengths in developing emerging leaders and an open and trusting culture.  The third component of our talent pipeline strategy is managing staffing very efficiently. Overstaffing and understaffing both presents significant risks to our business, and we consider the implications of both as we make staffing decisions. Our primary measure of staffing efficiency is PIPs per FTE. And that measure improved in the last several years and was flat in 2018.  We also measure employee expenses as a percentage of premium, which shows how our people costs are impacting our combined ratio. This measure improved just over a point last year.  Much of the operational efficiencies that we have gained have been generated by an increase in mobile utilization, automation and outsourcing. In claims, photo estimating and outsourcing glass claims are just 2 examples. In CRM, we are automating less complex customer service tasks and eliminating some work that had historically been manual policy servicing.  Our current estimate of the remaining benefits of these changes is a meaningful cost savings, but what we believe to be a very manageable staffing impact as we are currently hiring 1,000 people per month, and we've got a successful track record of redeploying talent as our business changes.  A very recent example of this is a change we made to our service center model. This evolution of our business required significant modifications to our systems, our workflows and to our staffing, yet we were able to redeploy 95% of the 650 people impacted by this change.  As a result of our talent pipeline strategy and the strength of our culture, we knew our people had the experience to be successful in other jobs and they had the desire to stay with Progressive. Now I realize that I am speaking to an audience of financial analysts, and so it's probably hard for you guys to get excited about some of the softer stuff, but it's our culture and our people strategies that are generating the results you care a whole lot about. Here's the proof.  Despite the very low median tenure of 1.6 years, the quality and efficiency of the work done by our claims reps has improved. Despite the even lower median tenure for our reps in CRM, our sales conversion is up 2 points and our service measures are holding steady. In our product organization, we've increased speed to market by 50% and reduced quality defects at almost the same rate. These impressive individual results have collectively produced our 2018 growth of $5.4 billion at a 90.6 combined ratio with a 2.7% improvement in PLE. Our performance over the years allows us to claim the #3 position in the auto insurance industry and the top spot in the commercial auto, specialty RV and motorcycle markets.  Our Progressive culture and people strategies that I shared with you today are the result of the contributions of thousands of individuals over many years. I am honored to share this story on behalf of all 38,000 of us at Progressive and all those who came before us who are contributing to this truly sustainable competitive advantage.  And now I'd like to turn it over to the former Progressive intern who is now our CFO, John Sauerland. John Sauerland : Thank you, Lori. Good afternoon, everyone. So I am sure you all know culture is not your typical topic for an Investor Relations meeting. And frankly, I think Lori nailed it. Our culture and our people are absolutely at the core of our success. I believe we have the best people in the industry. I believe we have some of the best people in all of industry. I am continually in awe of the caliber of people we are able to attract and retain, while at the same time maintaining a collaborative and a driven environment. I am very confident we will continue to foster this culture moving forward and I look forward to that journey. Now we're on to a far more typical topic for this environment, our new dividend program. In December of last year, we announced -- or our board declared the 2018 variable dividend. We also reiterated at that time that, that dividend would not be paid unless comprehensive income was in excess of after-tax underwriting income. In our upcoming Q&A, we expect and welcome questions from you all around our dividend program, so we thought a little more of our rationale around that program would be good lead-in to the Q&A. As a reminder, and Tricia mentioned this as well, there are prepared Q&A in the November news release as well as the associated 8-K that was filed on December 12.  On February 11, we paid the 2018 variable dividend in the amount of $2.51 a share or around $1.5 billion in aggregate. Comprehensive income for the year was $2.52 billion. After-tax underwriting income for the year was $2,303,000,000. So based on our stated hurdle around comprehensive income and after-tax underwriting income, we were $217 million from not paying any variable dividend for 2018. Subject, of course, to board discretion. The intent of this hurdle is clear and certainly well intended. That said, we think being in that situation, meaning potentially paying no dividend or potentially paying a $1.5 billion dividend, is not in the interest of owners or management. So that is part of our rationale around the change.  Funding growth is another part of our rationale around the change. Our insurance company subsidiaries are generally required by regulators to carry statutory surplus equal to at least 1/3 of net premiums written. In 2018, we added, as Tricia and Lori both mentioned, a $5.4 billion of incremental premium. So all else equal, we were required to have $1.8 billion of incremental surplus in the insurance companies. In addition, we carry what we call an extreme contingency capital layer. That layer is derived from a number of factors, but in short, it generally scales with our balance sheet.  So net for that $5.4 billion of growth in 2018, we carried an incremental $2 billion in capital. Now, of course, we can generate capital by maintaining comprehensive income or by raising incremental capital. We are very clear around our leverage policy, which is to maintain debt at 30% or below total capital. And depending upon the composition of comprehensive earnings and projected growth, the formulaic dividend could have us in a position where we would be challenged to continue to grow as fast as we can at that 96 combined ratio.  So that, in short, is additional rationale around the change. Obviously, growth has been robust lately. We have great momentum, so we want to ensure we have the capital we need moving forward. While we've been making investments in many near-term growth opportunities, we also want to ensure we are investing for the long-term growth of Progressive. We've been very focused on our core offerings. This has served us really well. We want to be continue to be hyper focused on our core, meaning what we call our horizon 1 offerings. And at the same time, we want to be investing for the long-term growth of Progressive for decades to come. So a further rationale for the change is to ensure that we have the flexibility to invest for that long term. A great example of our investments today in horizon 2 are investments to bring to market in our commercial lines business, general liability business, and business owner policies program. We think our strategy plays really well with those markets. We also think that grows the addressable market for our commercial lines group probably in excess of threefold, so we are looking to bring that to market in the near term, actually in the first half of this year.  Naturally we are working on further opportunities to continue to grow those horizon 2 and 3 opportunities, and we'll keep you informed as we come to market with those opportunities. Our final rationale for the change is that while we believe the variable approach to dividends is very aligned with our goal of growing as fast as we can at that 96 combined ratio, we understand that the variability in cash flows from our shareholders' perspective can be perhaps a bit out of sync with expectations. What you are seeing here on the slide is our trailing 12-month dividend yield without specials and including specials, relative to a peer set as well as a broader market group in the S&P 500.  Interestingly when you look at our dividend yield over a longer period, so this is a trailing 5-year view of the previous slide, our dividend yield is fairly robust. So we are certainly a growth stock, but we also probably don't get the attention from a broader potential ownership set due to our sole reliance on variable and special dividends. Consequently, we are adding a quarterly dividend that will start at $0.10 a share for this quarter in addition to an expected annual variable dividend. So that, at a high level, is our rationale for the dividend change. We believe we've been great stewards of capital here at Progressive, and we certainly expect to continue to be. As a reminder, we produced returns on common shareholder equity in the high teens over many periods, including the past 20 years. We've also returned 70% of net income in the form of dividends or share repurchases over that same time period, while growing the top line of the company $27 billion or 9.5% per annum.  So while the mechanics of our common share dividend are changing, our financial policies have not. And we aspire to continue to produce as good or even better results for our shareholders than we have to date.  We'll now take a moment to set up for Q&A, and we certainly welcome your questions. Julia Hornack : [Operator Instructions] And with that, Carmen, can you please introduce our first participant from the conference call line, please? Operator : And the question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan at Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, going back to some of, I guess, your closing comments, John. You spoke about your efforts to expand into general liability and business owners policies. I know you guys mentioned that briefly on your last quarter's call. I guess I am just trying to get a little bit of an update in some numbers how big do you think that, that opportunity can be, and you said in some of your comments today that you guys would think more about potentially it seemed like some other lines as well. Do you envision Progressive's continued expansion in Commercial Lines, assuming it all goes well? Could this all be done organically or do you see inorganic potential M&A helping to expand your initiative there at some point? Susan Griffith : Let me start, Elyse, let me start with that. So we believe the addressable market is really big, and we are doing it not unlike we did our Progressive Advantage Agency over on the Personal Lines side. So we are starting with partners that we work with third-party unaffiliated partners and then, of course, we'll write on our own paper this year with BOP. So it will go a little bit slower this year. We've, obviously, been investing in this for a while, but we believe that there is such a good synergy with having the #1 commercial auto position and then really at some point having the whole household. And I really think about the business owner that has business in their home or nearby their house and they have their vehicles with us, maybe a toy, their home and kind of taking care of the entire customer. So I would say a lot of opportunity. We will use both written on our own paper as well as partners to make sure we can cover as many small business people as possible. John Sauerland : Just to elaborate a little bit. We are the #1 commercial auto writer in the country by a wide margin. We are having great results in that space right now. You saw the 2018, I think 28% growth, a tremendous combined ratio. We've got to continue to have a runway there and GL and BOP probably is a marketplace 3x the size of commercial auto. As Tricia said, we have started to -- our foray into other products, predominantly through third parties, Personal Lines side as well as commercial side, on predominantly the Direct side of the business. And that affords us a lot of experience and opportunity into what works with our customer set. And GL and BOP are products that we do offer through third parties today in our Direct business for Commercial Lines. Similarly, to how we started with auto in -- I'm sorry, with home in the Personal Lines group, we expect to offer our own product up alongside third-party products, it's worked really well in the homeowners space. We think it will work really well in the Commercial Lines space as well to ensure we've got the product that will keep that core household, as Tricia was saying, and ensure that if the product that is right for them is the Progressive product, we have that for them as well. Susan Griffith : And we refer to that as BusinessQuote Explorer so we have HomeQuote Explorer, BusinessQuote Explorer. You'll be hearing a lot more about that and likely we'll have John Barbagallo or -- and someone on his team at a webcast later this year. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of -- you guys brought up your commercial auto results. You've been pretty exceptional compared to what we've seen across the industry as some others really deal with both adverse frequency and severity issues. Can you just talk about what you are seeing within your book, the price that you have been taking as well as the loss cost trends and how you kind of see the margin profile of that business running in 2019? Susan Griffith : So if you go back to 2016, we were really challenged from a profitability perspective and John Barbagallo who runs that organization took a step back and these are 12-month policies so we know when we need rate it's going to take some time to earn in. So we really got ahead of that in 2016 and said, \"Okay here is what we think we need.\" In addition, just like we do on our Personal Lines side, we use segmentation for all of our BMTs. And for us, this is really important to understand and match rate to risk. And so we got out ahead of that. We feel great about our rate. We took about 5.5% in commercial last year. And we feel great about our ability to pull back, if we need to, segment. And, as you know, in a couple of states, we had some restrictions for quite some time until we felt like we were in a really good position, and we've lifted most of those but, obviously, you saw the numbers. We are doing incredibly well from a margin perspective as well as a growth perspective. And we think that will really help to spearhead like you talked about, at least, our small business insurer. John Sauerland : I'd take one more moment to tout our successful positioning right now in commercial. The other area we're really excited about is in electronic logging devices. So, we think we've been at the forefront of employing usage-based insurance rating in the commercial side similar to what we have done for well over a decade on the personal side with Snapshot. Here, we are providing pretty significant discounts to interstate truckers who are now required to have electronic logging devices on their vehicles, provides a great insight into the driving behavior and allows us to apply that to the insurance premium. So we think, Tricia was talking about matching rate to risk, that is a huge step forward in the commercial business in doing so. Julia Hornack : Carmen, can we take our next... Operator : Yes, and our next question comes from Yaron Kinar  with Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : I wanted to start with the expense ratio, if I could. And it's a 2-part question. So first, I noticed that the January expense ratio was up quite a bit relative to 2018 and was hoping that maybe you could talk about the drivers for that. And also within the expense ratio, I think you had talked in the past about achieving a target of a non-acquisition expense ratio of about 9% by year end '19. I think you're already essentially there now in Personal Lines. So is there another leg there? And similarly for LAE, I think you had targeted a 9% there as well for '19, by the end of '19 and looks like you're at about 10% at the end of '18. So do you think that you are -- are you still on track to get that 9%? Susan Griffith : Again, that was -- you know, it's an internal target that we look to and a lot of it depends in a good way on where gain share flows in from that perspective, from an expense perspective. We look at that at a 1.0 gain share, kind of our target gain share, if it's higher, obviously, it's tougher to control expenses. I would say from an overall expense ratio, we've been doing a lot of advertising, which flows into our expense ratio and that's why we bifurcate the non-acquisition expense ratio with all others. So that's -- so advertising has been a big part of our expenses, and we only advertise when we feel like it's an efficient use of our funds and that we can get in customers at a cost lower than our target acquisition cost or cost per sale, so we feel good about that. And again, it's 1 month into it and things flow there but part of it right now in January is internal gain share and advertising. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then my second question is around PIP in Florida. Where are we there? How many reopened claims do you expect to still flow through into '19 and beyond? Have you kind of capped this at this point? And also, do you think that there's any risk that PIP will become an issue in other states? Susan Griffith : Yes, the actual number, there is a lot of variables that go into it, the type of claims some would be pre-suit demands, some are out there, some are already in lawsuit. Here is how we treated this. So we watch that litigation really closely, and it was the industry watching it, because we all felt like  the deductible, we were doing it in the correct way. The Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed that. Went to the Fifth District Court of Appeals and they overruled that. And then, of course, you know the results from the Florida Supreme Court. We treated this -- so we knew the files that were at risk, and we had the inventory. We, obviously, reopened a bunch immediately and treated this almost like a cat, where we got people down there and resolved those claims, and we have a big portion of them resolved and all of them reserved to the best of our knowledge, obviously. So we feel really good about our position here. From an overall, does this go to other states, PIP is really different in each state. So PIP isn't in every state, it's only in about 15 states and it's very different. And different states have a very different litigious atmosphere. Florida happens to be 1 that is always ripe for litigation. So I don't feel -- I'm not nervous about it going to other areas of the country because it's just different. This was very specific about how a deductible was treated and so I'm not concerned about that particular litigation going to other states. Julia Hornack : Carmen, can we take the next question from the conference call line, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Amit Kumar : 1 comment and 2 questions. First of all, I do want to applaud you on these presentations. These are actually very helpful and I do hope that other companies follow your lead and give us these additional insights. So I know you made a comment regarding the investment community, but we all look forward to these presentations. Susan Griffith : Thank you. Amit Kumar : That's that. The questions I have, the first question I have is going back to the comment you made in the 10-K regarding PLE. And there's a comment that it's declined due to targeted underwriting changes introduced in our new model. Can you just talk about that a bit more? Susan Griffith : It was really just a process change in terms of when we determined you would renew with a lapse in coverage. And we used to do it at a certain time frame, and we reduced that timeframe because we found those customers, we weren't reaching our target margin. And so when we looked at that, we modeled out what we thought -- what the effect we thought would be on PLE and that's just flowing through to what you're seeing now. Amit Kumar : Got it. The second question I have is I guess is a bit more broader question. In the 10-K, you talk about pricing of 1.2%. You talk about premium per policy growth of 5% in Agency, 4% in direct. And I think a lot of it is due to the shift in business mix. How are we thinking about, I guess, the trends as we head further into 2019? Should we expect the Robinsons, this whole thing to continue? Or anything which could lead to a different outcome? Susan Griffith : We are enthusiastic about 2019, specifically as you talk about with the Robinsons. So as you know, we have more platinum agents than ever. We are continuing to add in that. We are continuing to expand across the country. So for us, both on the agency and the direct side, we have a lot of runway. In fact, we're less than 2% of the Robinson market. I used to stand up here probably several years ago, and John, I think you did, too, and forever, we were about 1%. We were 0.7 forever. We've built the infrastructure now so that Progressive Advantage Agency that at one point had 25 people now has hundreds of people for those direct callers to come in, and we have a broad array of home products for them, whether it's Progressive Home or others. Then we've built an online version of the HomeQuote Explorer. We are building buy  buttons. So we feel like we have a lot of runway in that bundle as point of sale and as we graduate. So even when you think about our increase in our renter's policy, that's a prelude to the people that are going to buy our home. So we think that's really important. On the Agency side, I was just with a platinum blue agent this morning who had become the #1 in his shop and it's a big shop. And we're talking about how we're going to continue to work with him to grow our business and take care of our mutual customers. So from my perspective, and John you can weigh in, I feel very bullish on our ability to continue to grow in that preferred market. John Sauerland : Yes, we have tremendous opportunity on the preferred and, as Tricia said, our share there is very low. Our share, however, on the other segments is actually -- affords us plenty of growth opportunity as well, and we have grown very nicely across all segments, certainly more with what we call the Robinsons and others, but we've been growing across all segments and all channels. In terms of loss cost trend premium trend, if that was part of your question, we can't perfectly predict loss trends going into 2019. Obviously our product managers and pricing team attempts to do that when we set the prices. We can't know for sure. Clearly, claims frequency has been coming down, that's been a fairly consistent trend. Claim severity, going the other way in a fairly robust way. We think that will probably continue for a lot of reasons as well. We continue to take rates up in our commercial business, in our Property business. In our core auto business, our rate increases have slowed. You've probably seen that. It's becoming a bit more competitive in the marketplace. But, obviously, our margins remain very robust. Julia Hornack : I'm actually going to take a question now from the webcast. So you talk about preserving culture but as you get bigger, and you just noted that you hired over 2,000 people or you've added 2,000 headcount to the employee base in the last few months. How do you really preserve this when senior management is unlikely to personally ever get to meet many of these people? The company's change in size alone would strongly suggest that the culture today isn't the same as it was 10 years ago. So how do you deal with this? Susan Griffith : That's a great question and couldn't disagree more because we make it such a passion to talk about our culture. So we will hire 10,000 people this year. I go to and speak at every new hire class as does my senior leadership team. So believe me, that has been almost on a weekly basis. I go to the claims new hire, I go to the corporate new hire, which includes commercial, I go to CRM new hire and I spend an hour oftentimes right in this area that we are sitting in and I talk about our culture, our values, what I need from them. So I do get to one-on-one, either in-person or via webcast, meet nearly every new hire. There might be an occasion when I'm gone. Think that is hugely important. And my whole team does that. In addition, I think it's important for me as a leader to travel out extensively as does my team. We are out and about all the time. And oftentimes, it's sitting in rooms of 20 people saying, tell me what you don't like. Tell me what you may talk about that we wouldn't know about. Lori in particular, who you just met, our head of HR, constantly goes out and just does town halls to see what's on our minds and tell us what we can change. Many of our changes we've made over the years were from the employee base saying have you thought about this, can you make this change? Would you consider this? And that's our passion. And for us, cultures evolve and it will continue to evolve because we have different demographics and different needs, but we are very in tune to that and this is something that is so critical to our success that we spend a big majority of our time, a large part of our time making sure that we hear our people, that we're here for our people and that we are open. I can tell you that it's not uncommon like Lori said for someone to stop me or for someone just to pop into my office and say hi, I knew you were up here, can we talk? And I purposely make an effort usually I try to do it on Friday, and some other days I'm actually going to venture out of the building I am in. I walk downstairs, grab lunch and randomly sit with 5 or 6 people that I haven't met. And it's usually super awkward for like 5 minutes after I ask them if I can join them and then 10 minutes later, we're laughing and I've gotten to know 5 or 6 employees, and it was funny because this week I said to my assistant, let's plan on me going to different offices around Cleveland because I sit in one of the campus locations, but we have a lot of locations. It won't be perfect but this is something we talk about every day. We talk about culture, diversity, engagement at every single 1 of my meetings and that flows all the way down. So to me, it could be something with companies grow too fast, we will not let that happen. Julia Hornack : Carmen, can we take the next question from the conference call line, please? Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : I want to follow back on one of the earlier questions on the small commercial. You're getting into that at the same time that we've seen some recent announcements from some pretty formidable competitors on the same thing. And so I'm -- I guess I'm, given those were pretty recent announcements I'm wondering how that factors into your thoughts about how competitive that landscape is in the small commercial, especially direct. And then I think John said, GL, BOP is 3x the size of the commercial. John, did you mean both the overall market? Or do you mean specifically in the space that you play in the small commercial for that 3x size? John Sauerland : I meant that GL, BOP, I'm going to round, a little over $100 billion in the U.S.; commercial Auto, around a little over 30 billion. So 3x the commercial auto marketplace. We don't compete specifically in every niche of that market of course, but it gives you perspective on the breadth of market we are opening up by being able to offer those products. The other thing, similar to the personal lines side that offer, it's not only about writing incremental GL, BOP, it's about keeping the commercial auto longer. So to the extent a business evolves and grows and buys a location, et cetera, they have broader needs. Today, we can't meet that broader need, especially within our Agency channel  those incremental products will afford us the ability to retain our current customer set longer. Again, same path we took with personal auto and home in order to increase PLE. Susan Griffith : And Michael, I would say that competition is great. It makes us all better, it makes us all think about the customer differently. I like where we are positioned because we've invested in this in the last 18 months or so knowing it would take some time to get it right and own it. But we also have the advantage like we try to do with broadened coverage where, when and how customers want to shop. So we have our Agency customers who want to sit knee to knee and kind of understand the coverages for their small business and then we'll have Direct both, just like we did in Personal Lines, on the phone or online. So having a variety of ways with which to buy as a small business consumer depending on your tenure and kind of your knowledge of what products need to protect you. So I think to me, competition makes all of us better. I'm excited about what the future will bring. Julia Hornack : Carmen, can we take the next question from the conference call line, please? Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Just a few questions. The first one is the advertising expense disclosed in the 10-K I think it was up about $0.5 billion year-over-year. What are the type or range of outcomes we can expect in terms of thinking about that? I mean, is it -- could that be $700 million less next year? Could it be $700 million more? I mean, just trying to get a feel for how that might flex in any given year for these levels? Susan Griffith : Yes, we look at advertising and look at it from an efficiency perspective. And we look at that from everywhere we advertise, so whether it's radio, mass media, digital, and what we really look at is a target acquisition cost. And that can be different for customers, and we've also started to look at sort of a lifetime customer value and we look at the home. So there's a lot of different things that go into that. But when we have a targeted acquisition cost and our cost per sale is less than that or less than or equal to that, we believe that's efficient use of our dollars. So we will use those dollars and flex them, depending on what's going on in the other part of the company as needed. So this last couple of years, it's been great because we've been able to really put on the gas in terms of advertising, and we've had a lot of different advertising campaigns that have brought in new prospects and ultimately conversion. As you know in 2016, we reduced advertising cost a little bit when we got close to our 96 target combined ratio. So those things happen. And 96 takes priority over everything, but we believe if we play it right, and we have efficient marketing and great segmentation and a great brand and a low-cost structure, we can have it all. Some years, we have to flex. John Sauerland : To that, I would add, we are hugely data-driven. We've gotten really good at measuring our advertising, not only in the digital space, but now in the mass media space. We buy virtually all of our advertising in-house. So we use that information, we know day part, television show, how our cost per sale performs on that buy, and then we know where we can buy it for the next show. So we have tremendous negotiating ability because of the knowledge we've gained, that we've used historically in the digital space, but we've now expanded it to mass media, which has had us making a lot different decisions and way more productive decisions in the mass media space. So that is how we manage it, and I think we are in a way better position now to manage it broadly across our spend than we were even just a year ago. It's pretty impressive stuff. Susan Griffith : And a shout-out to our marketing department who continues to evolve this campaign so you know we had kind of Flo in the superstore and then we had Jamie and now we have a whole squad of Flo. We have our campaign of Parentamorphosis that says when you buy your first home, you become your parents. We've got a couple of really great ads coming out pretty soon. And you are going to see some different, a couple of different campaigns, I won't give a spoiler alert, coming out in the next few months, one for our Special Lines, our motorcycle. And we're delving into some things like podcasts that I think you're going to be really interested in, but we continue to evolve our cast of characters, and that to me is a big thing. We're not using the same old commercials over and over. We continue to expand. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then I had a question on the frequency statistic, down 3% for 2018 and it sounded like in the annual report somehow it was attributable to mix. If you had been able to hold mix constant, what do you think the frequency would've been? Susan Griffith : That is a hard question to answer because you'd have to go back and see. There's a lot of things that are going on in terms of frequency. So some of it is mix. We have more of a preferred mix, but it also has to do with macroeconomic factors, people driving -- driving behavior, climate in terms of how the roads are, there's a lot of things that go into it. I would be hard-pressed to give you an answer that I felt comfortable with. I don't know if you can do any better? John Sauerland : I agree completely. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then just quickly. The one other one I have was just on the January adverse development that wasn't related to Florida. It seems like for whatever reason over the past few years, there's been that going from December to January. Just curious what the explanation might be for it? Seems like consistently there might not be enough IBNR at year end. Susan Griffith : You know a lot of it, it depends on the year, but almost always, you have late reports from December from the holidays that go into January. Sometimes you can have a late report and it's also weather-related. So it could be double. Like this year, some of the adverse development was Florida PIP and some was late reporting. But if you look over the last 3 years, I would not use January as looking at the whole year out. So if you look at the last 3 years, January was at least 1 point upwards in 1 year of like 3.2 points I think in 2018. Throughout the year, the most that we have come to in the last 3 years at the end of the year had been 0.4 points, so less than half a point. So January is just kind of bumpy because of timing and we kind of stop it there and start a new year, but a lot of it is late reporting, weather or some circumstance. But don't put a lot of thought into January because if you see over the last 3 years, it really does smooth out and we try to be exact as we can for our reserving and we have been pretty close to that. Julia Hornack : Thanks for the question, Ryan. Carmen, can we go to the next caller, please. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Zaremski : So my question's on the severity trends. I was going to ask specifically on bodily injury, which looks like if I do the math, it ended the year at 4%. So that means 4Q had to be around 8%. But then John, you also made a number of comments earlier I'm hoping you could shed some more light on, about the severity continuing for a number of reasons. So maybe you can kind of talk about those trends you are seeing and why you think that will continue? Susan Griffith : I'll start, and you, John, you can add. So on trailing -- on a trailing 12, it's more benign. But the fourth quarter overall, severity was up about 6.8%, and we attribute that to medical expenses for injuries and cars are more expensive to fix because of the technology in those vehicles. And I believe that's why you were saying -- I mean, as you look at the cars and what components are in there, they've become expensive and, obviously, healthcare costs continue to be expensive. So those are a couple of the things that go into both the collision as well as BI. John Sauerland : Yes, I think Tricia nailed it. BI is pretty consistently plus 4 lately. Collision, as you saw, was plus 8 for the year. Tricia mentioned that as well. Technology in vehicles is making crashes more expensive and it is making the frequency with which we total a vehicle when it's in a crash go up as well. So we think those trends are going to continue. And if you look back, they've been pretty consistent for quite some time. So the frequency side of the equation is much harder to predict, the severity side we're pretty confident is going to continue at a pace it's been at for a while now. Michael Zaremski : Okay. My follow-up is on the personal auto underlying loss ratio in January. It improved very measurably, kind of more volatile than it has been in the previous year. Is there any color on what made it improve so much? Was there any anomaly in there? Curious if any color there. Susan Griffith : John, you can add anything you want. For us, it's really about the mix of the business. And as we have more and more of our preferred market come in, you are going to have loss ratios change again. We feel like we have a lot more runway to add more of those customers. There's a lot that goes into that, but that would be my main take. John Sauerland : Yes, that obviously is the positive side of why was the development from the prior year 4.8 points. The accident year loss ratio for January was exceptional. We don't report severity and frequency on a monthly basis. That would get us into some very interesting territory. So I won't really explain further there, but my previous comments around severity and frequency, I think you could bring forward to January. Weather makes a lot of difference as well. In winter months, how much precipitation that's freezing, et cetera and in the Northern part of the country, it matters a lot. So we are happy with the loss ratio for January, and we are not going to get into specific frequency and severity for months. Michael Zaremski : Can I sneak one last in, just you mentioned mass media versus digital spend, what's the really high-level breakdown of percent mass versus digital? Susan Griffith : I don't know that we actually share that, but I think it's really dependent on a time of year, buying -- to buying time, so there's times where there is more shopping for home or shopping for auto. And increasingly, though, I will say our digital is becoming much more a part of our spend. Julia Hornack : Carmen, can we take the next question from the conference call line, please? Operator : The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian Meredith : A couple of quick ones here. The first, I'm just curious, your renewal retention rates look like they improved nicely given the renewal apps that are up in your personal auto business. Wondering if you can give us some sense of how much of a benefit that was to growth this year? And also perhaps maybe loss ratio because obviously renewal book has a better loss ratio? Susan Griffith : From an overall PIP growth, it was substantial. I mean, I think anytime you can keep the customers you have, you already had the acquisition cost of them coming in, I think it's substantial. I don't have the actual percentage with me right now, but it's substantial. That's why we put such a focus on retention and making sure that we -- the customers we bring in we satisfy, give them a reason to stay. They add more policies as their needs evolve, so it has been significant. Brian Meredith : Got you. The reason I'm asking is a couple of years ago everybody was worried about the total 10-year impact rate with the growth and we just didn't see it this last year, and I figured that was probably due to the good renewal retention improvement? Susan Griffith : Yes, I mean, I think you -- I think if you're talking about, I think a couple of years ago, we were talking about sort of the new business tax and that coming in, I think... Brian Meredith : Yes, exactly. Yes. Susan Griffith : Yes, as you see that flow through, I think it's really important. I think a part of that as well is the type of new business that we bring in. So we really do a lot more underwriting now to make sure that we bring in customers where we believe we can make at or below our target margins. So the inflow is changing. We're keeping people longer, so those 2 things together, I think, has been a good story. Brian Meredith : Great. And then my second, just curious. As you continue to shift a little bit here more towards some commercial, you've got the homeowners, and granted it's going to continue to shift, should we expect your premium to surplus ratios to decline here going forward just because those are generally more capital-intensive businesses? And also as a result, is your target combined ratio going to have to be different in those businesses? Susan Griffith : So I'll take the last part first. Our combined ratio, that 96 is an aggregate number. So they are -- we have different targets in every different part of our business, sometimes in different states, definitely new and renewal, and in different products. So that 96 is really an aggregate. So we already have different targets, depending on the volatility of the business. From a premium to surplus perspective, so I think John used the 1 to 3, which is auto. It's about half of that for home, so those do change as we have different types of products. Brian Meredith : And commercial I'm assuming is 1, 1.5 also, you think? John Sauerland : Commercial will be lower than auto, for sure. But recognize, if you think about total return on the business, we try to target underwriting margin in concert with investment return to reach similar ROEs across our business lines. So commercial is a great example where a much longer tail in terms of the claims, much greater investment return as a result. We blend that with our underwriting expectations. So yes, the surplus requirements for those other lines outside of auto are more robust than our auto lines, but at the same time we're targeting returns similar across those lines. Susan Griffith : And like homeowners, we have for our higher limits, we have reinsurance on the commercial side. Julia Hornack : Carmen, can you take the next question from the conference call line, please? Operator : And the question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Adam Klauber : You're showing some very good early signs as far as your digital effort on homeowners and bundling. How are you going to accelerate that in 2019? And then the second part of the same question is as you think about rolling out more and more commercial, is there -- is part of that strategy also more of a digital effort? Susan Griffith : Absolutely, yes. So we are going to continue to have the ability on our HomeQuote Explorer, which is what we call our digital capacity, to not only quote, but bind online, to have that buy button so we will continue to invest in doing and rolling out that to more and more states because normally when people go online, they want to be able to seal the deal, so we'll do that. And that's the great thing about having your own home plus partners is you have the ability to service almost every customer. The same thing on the commercial side. We will have the BusinessQuote Explorer. We did a soft launch last year. We'll continue to invest in that. And almost follow suit with what we did on the Personal Lines side, which we found very successful. So we are putting a lot of investment in technology on in both of those platforms. Adam Klauber : And then the HomeQuote Explorer, if I remember you had just a couple of states up and running this year, should that expand pretty aggressively -- I mean, last year, should that expand pretty aggressively this year? Susan Griffith : Yes, we'll do everything we can to get more and more states and the buy button as we can. John Sauerland : So the buy button right now for Progressive Home is in a limited number of states. HomeQuote Explorer is broadly rolled out. I don't know about 50 states, but the predominance of the country for sure. The piece that Tricia was talking about that helps conversion a lot is if you present the potential customer with the ability to just click a button to buy. We don't have that for Progressive Home across the country, that's what we are rolling out. Julia Hornack : Carmen, we'll take another caller from the conference call line, please. Operator : And the question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Gary Ransom : I saw that you mentioned in your letter, Tricia, that you have a new algorithm for distracted driving in your telematics product? Could you talk a little bit more about that? About how effective that is qualitatively? Or what that -- will that spread out to more states? Susan Griffith : Yes, it is from our handhelds, so our mobile as a device. So as you know, we have 2 different ways you can have our usage-based insurance, with a dongle and with a handheld. With a handheld, we're able to tell when you are using the phone hands-free or holding it, which we have found is very correlated to losses. I can't give you all the data because it's private to -- confidential to Progressive, but we find that people that use their phones either an app or a phone call, X amount of time, it's more correlated to losses. So it's sort of the next wave of how we think about our usage-based insurance. And I think for years, people said we knew if someone is in the left lane and they are using their phone or on their phone, they have to be worse drivers. That was our premise as well but we like data, and so we took a long time to understand this and then we developed an algorithm and are using it now with the people that choose our mobile device for UBI. Gary Ransom : Is it fair to say something like it is as just as powerful as either the braking factor you use or the time of day factor? Susan Griffith : I don't know if I have that data. I think we believe it's powerful and we'd probably be able to tell you that when we have more development, more time. John Sauerland : We are confident it is quite additive, and we haven't rolled it out everywhere yet, but we are working to do so expeditiously. Gary Ransom : All right. Just one other thing. You also mentioned in your letter about savings in loss adjustment expenses. That's a piece of the expenses we usually don't get to look at carefully, but it sounds like you have a number of initiatives to bring those costs down. Are there some that might be the main components of helping that LAE piece move downward in the future? Susan Griffith : Yes, there's a couple of things. The main one that -- we are working on a lot of technology, but the main one that we have been working on, we continue to roll out in the last couple of years, we call photo method of inspection. So customers being able to take photos or video and we are able to be very, very efficient in writing those estimates because you don't have to be side of car by the sheet metal. And we have been doing really well, but rolling it out slowly because if you -- you can do that and reduce LAE, but if you increase indemnity, that doesn't make any sense, so we are trying to be really exact with that. And we believe that, that will ultimately, and we are testing it right now, lead to the machine being able to write a portion of the estimates that are pretty minor. And so we'll be testing that this year. Those 2 things are going to be really big in claims. And we continue to always chip away at different processes in the claims organization to figure out how to get more efficient. What are we doing that doesn't add value? So we chip away at that and have a whole spectrum of process type of things we are working on as well as obviously being accurate, making sure we pay the right amount every time for our customer. But I would say those are the big things really with our estimatics. Julia Hornack : Well, unfortunately, we have exhausted our scheduled time. And so that concludes our event today. Carmen, I'm going to turn it back to you for the closing scripts. Operator : And that concludes the Progressive Corporation's fourth quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

This event is available via a moderated conference call line and a live webcast with a brief delay. Webcast participants will be able to view the presentation slides live or download them from the webcast slide. Participants on the phone can access the slides from the Events pages at investors.progressive.com. In the event, we encounter any technical difficulty with the webcast transmission, webcast participants can connect through the conference call line. The dial-in information and passcode are available on the Events page at investors.progressive.com. Acting as a moderator for the event will be Julia Hornack. At this time, I will turn the event over to Ms. Hornack. Julia Hornack : Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon to all. Today, we will begin with a presentation by two senior portfolio managers, Richard Madigan and Jonathan Bauer. That presentation will be followed by a Q&A with our CEO, Tricia Griffith; and our CFO, John Sauerland. Our Chief Investment Officer, Bill Cody will also join us by phone for Q&A. This event is scheduled to last 90 minutes. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during the event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available on our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investors page of our Web site at progressive.com. It's now my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith. Tricia Griffith : Good afternoon and welcome to Progressive's first quarter webcast. We are delighted with our first quarter results growing net written premium 16% at 88.8 combined ratio, really great start to 2019 especially after several years of profitable growth. Today's webcast is going to be a little bit different than what we have done in the past. We have focused the recent webcast on our operational strategies and how they help us make investments to ultimately achieve our vision. Today, we're going to talk about the investments side of the house. Before we get into that I want to step back a little bit and just make sure we are all clear on our overall objective function and now it's for both the operating side of the business and the investment side of the business. We want to grow as fast as we can at or below at 96 combined ratio as long as we can service our customers. The great news is, we have been achieving that goal many times over the last several years, 2016, we grew 2.8 and net written premium 2017 another 3.8, last year 5.4 and comparing quarter one of 2019 with quarter one of 2018, we've already grown nearly 1.3 billion. What that has made us a huge asset under management for our investment firm to invest of about $35 billion and of course premium flow is one of the input to our investment strategy. Progressive Capital Management or PCM as you look here called today is based in Norwalk, Connecticut. It's a 13-member strong a small but mighty team. It's first talk about overarching risk. We want to balance our operating risk with the risk of financing and investment activities to have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance we can possibly underwrite and service. Within that the PCM organization has three mandates, Jonathan will talk about this; Jonathan and Richard will both talk about this a little bit later in more detail. The first one, protect the balance sheet. The second, achieve a strong risk-adjusted total return. And the third one, support the operating business as we think about future endeavors. I think about Horizon 3 that I shared with you before. We tend to be more conservative on the investment side because we have chosen to lever the operating franchise because we see it as our most durable means for a really strong ROE. Our comprehensive ROE is measured by a business profitability and capital efficiency. This Slide gives you a sense of how we look at comprehensive income. This is the pre-tax basis and it is the past five years plus the first quarter of 2019. And each of the bars you will see several colors, the blue is underwriting profit, the orange is investment returns and the small sliver of gray are interest expenses. As you can see, the investment part of our company is very important and that's why I thought it was important to share with you a little bit more about our philosophy today. As you can see for 2019, it's actually over 50% of our comprehensive income. We don't have an exquisite comprehensive return on equity goal rather, it's the natural outcome of our operating goals, our investment mandate and our financial policy. So again, operating goal, grow as fast as we can into 96, investment mandate, have a strong total return on our investment; and our financial policies that we shared with you before and that is maintain a 3 :1 premium to surplus and then have a contingency layer of capital for unforeseen things that could happen and then have no more than 30% of our total capital comprised of debt. When we have those three working together which we have for many, many years, we are able to earn an attractive comprehensive return on equity in excess of our capital structure. So now I'm going to get to the heart of the matter and that is to introduce you to Richard and Jonathan. So, they both started out many years ago at PCM. They started out as analysts and quickly moved into the portfolio roles. They both report to Bill Cody who you've met before, so we thought it would be nice for you to meet two members of his strong bench. Richard Madigan has his BA in Accounting from Boston College and his MBA from University of Chicago. He currently leads our structured product portfolio and he served on the strategy Council that we developed several years ago, and so works closely with Andrew as think about the future. But first, I'm going to introduce to you Jonathan Bauer. He has his BA in Economics and Political Science from what we Ohioans call the school of North in Ann Arbor and he has his MBA from Columbia. He leads our corporate bond portfolio and he takes the initiative to think about technology strategies to make sure that PCM organization is efficient and effective. Jonathan Bauer : Thanks Tricia. Richard and I appreciate the opportunity to give you a more detailed understanding of who Progressive Capital Management is, what our strategy is and how do we fit into the larger organization. To start with, it's important to mention that we only manage the money of Progressive. We do not take in any outside funds as we believe it could distract from our core mission. As of March 31, 2019, we have 13 investment professionals who manage just under $35 billion in assets. That $35 billion is composed of $32 billion in fixed income and $3 billion of equities. We manage the fixed income portfolio on an active basis, while almost the entire equity portfolio is passively indexed to the Russell 1000 Index. If you look back over the last 10 years, you can see a sharp increase in our assets under management, especially over the last three years. One of the benefits of investment management is the scalability of the business. As you can see, we have only added three members to the team even though our assets have more than doubled. However, that scalability does have limits, and as Progressive grows further, we will continue to make sure we have adequate resources. Before we go any further, we thought it might be useful to review what the sources of our investment funds are. Starting at the bottom of Progressive's capital stack is our shareholders' equity which comes from the company's retained earnings. Next up is our preferred stock. Progressive issued $500 million of preferred stock in March of 2018 to support our operating growth. Above that, you can see our deck. Some of you on the call may have participated in our two issuances in 2018 as we came to market in both March and October. Finally, the last two contributors to our investment portfolio, first is the float we make on premiums, next is the reserves we have in place in our insurance business. All of these funds flow up to our fixed income and equities portfolios. I would just point out that the size of these boxes on these slides are for illustrative purposes and are not the actual size of the category. Now that we've talked about the sources and growth of our portfolio, let's talk about our investment returns and where you can find the components of our returns in our financial statements. We manage our portfolio on a total return basis. So, what encompasses that total return? First is recurring income. This flows through our operating income and comes from the interest income that we earn on our fixed income portfolio and the dividend income earned in our equity portfolio. This is one component of our total return. Second on our slide is realized gains or losses on both portfolios as well as holding period gains and losses on equities. Now what does it mean for a gain to be realized or unrealized? We realize a gain when we sell a security at a price above where it was purchased. A gain is unrealized when a security is trading above the purchase price, but we have not sold again. As you can see, these gains and losses flow through our net income. I do want to point out that it was only last year in which holding period equity gains and losses started flowing through our income statement due to changes in accounting standards. Moving on to the last component which is unrealized gains and losses on fixed income. This is not something that you would see on our income statement, but instead flows through our comprehensive income. As stated earlier, we measure ourselves by our total return, which encompasses income realized and unrealized gains on the fixed income portfolio. I have mentioned earlier that we have 13 investment professionals. On this slide, you can see how we've structured the team. We have four individuals including Richard and myself who report up to Bill Cody, our Chief Investment Officer. The four individuals are broken up by corporate bonds, structured products, treasuries and short-term, and economics and financials. Beneath these four people, we have a team of portfolio managers and analysts who help to drive our strong performance. It's important to note that this is the current structure of the team. But as I will speak to you later in the presentation, rotation through different sectors is a core tenant of our investment philosophy. While our team is small, that has not prevented us from achieving outperformance versus the overall market. While our compensation is not driven by outperformance of a benchmark, we thought it would be useful for demonstration purposes to compare us to the index that most closely matches our investment constraints. As you can see, there has been consistent outperformance on a three, five and 10-year basis. And on the following slides, I'll provide you some of the broad hallmarks of our group that we think have helped drive that outperformance. We think there are certain aspects of our investment team that are unique compared with other fixed income investment managers. The first one, I would want to point out is our flexible mandate. As mentioned earlier, we measure our performance based on our total return. Therefore, our purchase and sale decisions are in no way influenced by the book yield of the security. We have the ability to purchase both high-grade and high-yield securities as long as we ensure that our overall portfolio rating does not drop below A plus. While we showed our performance versus an index on the previous slide, that was purely for illustrative purposes. Our security selection and asset class allocation are in no ways meant to match an index. Further, the size of our different portfolios whether they be corporates or mortgages are in no way fixed. So, we can adjust them based on the best opportunities that the market provides us. As I mentioned earlier, a core tenant of our team is the rotation of analysts and portfolio managers through different sectors. So why do we do that; don't we give up a lot in terms of specialization? We think the rotation adds a significant amount of value to the organization. And in fact, this rotation is something similar to what occurs on the operating side of the business. To begin with, it offers each individual a fresh look at the risk-return potential of different portfolios. Through this rotation, individuals get a better sense of relative value across different asset classes. While it's a daunting task to get up to speed on a new portfolio every few years, we think it actually helps with both recruiting and retention as it offers a continually challenging position to highly motivated individuals. We feel this rotation not only benefits the entire organization through improved performance, but also creates a deep bench of future leaders for Progressive Capital Management. As Lori mentioned on the last call, part of our culture is to promote from within and this rotation allows individuals to prepare for greater responsibility in the future. The final component to our unique structure is our incentive system. To begin with, one portion of the incentive compensation is based on Progressive's overall gain share score. As I mentioned earlier, our first goal is always protect the balance sheet and we are incented to do so with such a significant component of our incentive compensation coming from Progressive's annual performance. The other important piece of our incentive compensation comes from the group's fixed income total return on a one and three-year basis versus a group of other fixed income money managers with generally similar constraints. We point this out for two reasons; one, to show that the team is encouraged to be long-term focused in their thinking and investing; and two, that all members of the PCM team are incented by the group's total return not based on their portfolio size or their individual portfolio's return. Therefore, no one is incented to purchase assets that do not benefit the overall performance and everyone is encouraged to assist other team members because it will end up benefiting them in the end. We feel like we have created an integrated path within the organization. Our unique strategy helps to drive outperformance which generates more capital for the operating business. This increased capital provides a base for further operating company growth and increases our assets under management and then the whole cycle begins again. Now, we mentioned on the previous slide the flexibility in our mandate. However, that is not to say we don't have strict constraints in order to manage risk in our portfolio. On this slide, I will talk about some of our more important guidelines. We have a limit of 25% of Group 1 assets in our portfolio at any time. So, what does that mean? Group 1 assets include equities, non-investment grade bonds and preferred stock. The total amount of these three types of securities cannot equal more than 25% of our entire portfolio. Why did these securities get put into Group 1? We view these as our most volatile assets and also the ones most likely to incur a permanent loss of capital. Therefore, it makes sense to have a limit in terms of how much they represent within our portfolio. We mentioned earlier that we have the ability to buy both high-grade and high-yield securities within our portfolio. That flexibility has benefited our performance over the longer term. However, that capacity to invest in lower-rated securities is not infinite as the weighted average portfolio rating must be at least A plus across the portfolio. The constraints also extend to our interest rate risk. Our duration is an indicator of how much interest rate risk we're taking in our portfolio. The allowable range for the portfolio is 1.5 to 5 years. However, for individual securities, we will invest out to 10 years. At the end of the first quarter, we had a duration of 2.6 years as we believe there was a higher probability of rates increasing rather than decreasing over the intervening 12 months. Finally, we feel it's important to have limits on how big any individual position can be in proportion to our shareholders' equity. The limit is 6% for municipal state obligation bonds, for investment-grade bonds the limit is 2.5% and 1.25% for non-investment grade bonds and preferred stock. We believe it is imperative to prevent one idiosyncratic investment from impairing Progressive's capital. We've gotten the question from investors like yourself many times regarding yields that we're seeing in the market. So, we thought this chart showing yield opportunities in the U.S. fixed income market might be useful. The Y axis of the chart shows market yields on offer, while the X axis shows the total market size of these different asset classes, where you see the blue numbers is the post-crisis median yield for that individual asset class. As you can see, for many sectors that they are at or above their post-crisis median yield, a big driver of that increase has been the increase in treasury rates across the curve over the last few years. We thought it would be useful to highlight a few of the market yields available on sectors where we have exposure, starting with high-yield corporate bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and treasuries and municipal bonds. We mentioned earlier in the presentation that our flexible mandate allows us to invest up and down the credit curve. So, when we make the decision to invest in high-yield corporate bonds, what are the characteristics of those types of investments? We look to invest in companies that are high-grade quality. The reason that they may be high-yield is that they have more financial leverage than the rating agencies : Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch might be comfortable with. This provides us with an opportunity to purchase these investments at attractive levels and many times when the companies improve their balance sheets down the road and get upgraded, we see a strong incremental return. Many times, we also find interesting opportunities within the industries that are penalized for previous issues which no longer exist. The most recent examples in the post-crisis period have been the automotive and housing sectors. Most importantly, what we want to get across is as you look at that table at the right, we only focus on the blue boxes. We're focused on avoiding investments in businesses that we view as weak even if the financial leverage seems relatively low. Taking it one step further, let's look at a couple of examples of high-yield investments. First up is a BB rated non-cyclical business. The reason why this company will be high-yield is because they have high financial leverage that won't conform to rating agency high-grade standards. However, we view the leverage as sustainable. We could earn 275 basis points, or 2.75% more than treasuries. This would be about 125 basis points of incremental pickup over an investment-grade company. Potential outcomes for this type of bond is an upgrade to investment-grade. We would see about an 8% increase in the price of the bond. There's the potential for no change in price, but we would still get to earn the incremental compensation. And third, would be the potential for company underperformance driving a 4% depreciation in the bonds upon a downgrade. While possible, for the companies that we tend to invest in, we do not see a high probability of that downside outcome. Now let's look at one more example. Instead of a non-cyclical BB rated name, let's assume we buy a more cyclical B rated issue. In this case, the financial leverage might look optically high because the industry has just recently bottomed. Therefore, the company's EBITDA or cash flow is at a cycle low. On this type of investment, we would expect to in the current environment to earn about 400 basis points or 4% over treasuries. That would be 250 basis points, or 2.5% over a similar maturity investment-grade bond. In terms of potential outcomes, we could see an upgrade in ratings to BB. This could occur just by the EBITDA, or cash flow normalizing as the industry recovers. In this case, we would see both price appreciation and 400 basis points of incremental coupon. If we see no change in the business, we would still earn an incremental 4%. And in a downside scenario, we'd see an increase in financial risk because of depreciation in both ratings and price. I should mention that an investment like this one tends to occur earlier in the economic cycle as opposed to where we are now 10 years into the cycle. And with that, I have the pleasure of passing it over to my teammate and partner Richard Madigan. Richard Madigan : Thanks Jonathan. So, Jonathan walked you through how we're set up as a group, how we think about value, our performance over time, and how we think about opportunities in corporates. Now I'm going to spend a bit of time going into more depth about how we approach portfolio construction and securities selection including one example in commercial mortgage-backed securities before wrapping up and moving to Q& A. Most basic question that we ask ourselves on a regular basis at PCM is, do we want to take more interest rate risk or credit risk? And as is the case with most questions, the answer is typically, it depends. In general, we look for asymmetric risk-reward relationships in which we believe the upside is greater than the downside. As fixed income investors, we are particularly sensitive to downside scenarios and will generally look to stay away from low probability with high severity downside situations. We'd like to say that the upside takes care of itself if you're focused on protecting the downside. This chart plots the path of the 5-year treasury note against Progressive's duration positioning over the last 10 years. As a reminder, duration is a proxy for how much interest rate volatility we are willing to take on. As Jonathan mentioned earlier, we have a guideline of 1.5 to 5 years on our duration, 1.5 would be taking the least amount of rate risk possible and 5 would be the most rate risk, mathematically putting our midpoint somewhere in the 3.25 range. As you can see in the chart, we've been lower than our midpoint and in fact very close to our lower bound of 1.5 on taking interest rate risk for quite some time, for the very similar reason that U.S. interest rates have been historically low coming out of the financial crisis. You can also see that our duration positioning has come up more recently as the Fed has increased rates and moved toward a more neutral policy position. While we are closer to our own duration midpoint of 3.25, we're still short of that mark. Key indicators that we watch closely to inform our duration positioning include inflation, a multitude of economic indicators, rate movements themselves and Fed commentary. As always, we will be watching these indicators closely in 2019 and beyond to inform how we position our duration for rates going forward. In addition to interest rate risk, the other major question we ask ourselves constantly as a group is, how much credit risk should we be taking on? And the answer once again is, it depends. It depends on where we are in the economic cycle, where valuation, also known as credit spreads are and it depends on the capital needs of the company. This slide shows our Group 1 assets as a percentage of the portfolio over the last 10 years which is roughly the length of the current economic recovery. As a reminder, our Group 1 assets are a rough proxy for our general risk appetite because Group 1 contains our most risky assets, high-yield bonds, preferred stock and common equities. Coming out of the financial crisis, valuations were quite attractive. As you can see from the chart, we maintained a Group 1 exposure very close to our 25% constraint for a number of years. There are some wiggles in there which were mostly related to intra-year capital planning activities like share buybacks and our dividend payment, but for the most part, we saw it as a good time to take risk from the standpoint of both valuations and the economic recovery. As the economic recovery is continued, risk assets have performed well as expected and valuations are no longer as compelling as they once were. Additionally, there's the risk of a downturn at some point during which fundamentals and valuations will both likely take a hit. We don't know exactly when that will occur, so we've taken some chips off the table in advance. Our Group 1 assets have steadily come down over the last several years and we're currently running at 14.3% of the portfolio as of March 31. We're defensively positioned right now. And we hope to capitalize on more attractive valuations when markets get cheap. And they always get cheap at some point often very fast and without warning. We want to be ready for those type of opportunities. Turning now toward our portfolio in aggregate, we thought it would be helpful to show our portfolio composition against the widely followed index, the Bloomberg Barclays Intermediate U.S. Government Credit Index. There are few differences that I would point out between our portfolio and the index. The first of course is that our portfolio is really the output of bottom-up security selection, not the result of top-down asset allocation. While we do discuss relative valuations across asset classes frequently to inform where we should put our resources in the short-term, our portfolio remains a bottom-up fundamental portfolio. Turning now to a few examples of how our portfolio differs from an index. I will first point out the allocation to U.S. treasuries. In the index, treasuries make up 60% of the portfolio whereas cash and treasuries made up 39% of our fixed income portfolio at March 31. Second, you can see in the highlighted orange box that we have a significant exposure at 26% of our portfolio to securitized products. Securitized products, also called structured products, are bonds that are backed by common loans such as car loans, home mortgages, credit cards or commercial real estate mortgages. I am personally biased because I oversee securitized products for Progressive, but I believe that we have great domain knowledge in this space and it will likely continue to be an important asset class for us over time. Finally, I'd like to point out the duration differences. The index currently has a duration of 3.9. That would be at the longer end of our duration range of 1.5 to 5 and we would be taking on higher than average interest rate risk if we were to map to the index. As you can see in our portfolio, our current duration is 2.6 resulting in lower than the index interest rate risk. You can see the contrast between our portfolio and an index even more starkly in our corporate portfolio. The left pie chart shows the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Intermediate Corporate Investment-Grade Index and the right pie chart shows our corporate portfolio as of March 31. The first major difference you can see is the difference in allocations to financials. The index has 40% financials exposure while our corporate exposure is 23%. We do broadly see value in financials and we take targeted risk to financial institutions through both our corporate portfolio in the 23% you see here and our preferred stock portfolio where we think there are number of attractive securities. The second difference I would point out is our exposure to consumer non-cyclicals. Consumer non-cyclicals are a broad category containing things like healthcare and consumer packaged goods. We have spent considerable time researching both of those industries and we feel great about our 30% portfolio weighting versus the index weighting of 15%, particularly as we get closer to the end of a long economic expansion. The last difference I would point out is our smaller than the index exposure to the energy industry. We have approximately 3% in energy versus 8% for the index. The rationale for our smaller exposure is that we're very mindful of the volatility of commodity price movements and our inability to predict those movements. As a result, within energy, we skew toward stable subsectors like pipeline assets. While our positioning limits our upside during commodity price spikes or risk-on markets, it substantially helped us during the big high-yield and energy sell-off in 2015 and '16. As mentioned previously, we are focused on protecting our downside and we worry less about giving up a bit of upside in euphoric markets. I haven't shown duration on this chart, but our duration is lower than the generic index. As a reminder, we manage our duration at the aggregate portfolio level the rather than at the individual asset class level. I thought I would spend some time describing how we think about security selection in two of our major portfolios, corporate bonds, which Jon overseas and structured products, which I oversee. They include things like asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. If I were to summarize our corporate bond strategy, I would say that we're looking for great businesses with great management teams and stable industries. So how do we do that in a bit more detail, first, we look at the industry structure. All else equal, we prefer more mature industries with some level of consolidation, stable pricing power and no major threats from emerging technologies. When we look at management, we look for a strong track record of doing what they say they are going to do. We will not invest in companies with known questionable ethical track records. We have in fact sold securities after attending meetings or conferences with management teams that left us uncomfortable. Management compensation is a powerful tool that directly drives behavior. We look to ensure that management compensation is aligned with stability and conservative debt management and not with a specific accounting metric that might encourage lender unfriendly behavior. EPS and sales growth, those are examples of broad compensation metrics that could encourage things like large M&A activity which is generally a negative for bondholders. Cash flow. cash flow is where the rubber hits the road for the credit investors. We either look for stability over an economic cycle or strong tailwinds in the cyclical recovery. Cash is king. We love the Benjamins. Predictable capital allocation policies. Management has a number of choices in capital allocation. They can invest in the business, pay down debt, pay dividends, pursue share buybacks or pursue M&A. We prefer debt paydowns or business investment first and we look for predictability and stability in dividends, buybacks and M&A. Performance during the financial crisis. We have a great built-in stress test for how companies perform in a sharp downturn. If it's available, we always look at performance during the financial crisis even if the business has changed since then. It's a great data point. Finally, as Jonathan mentioned earlier, we look for catalysts that could drive credit performance. One key catalyst that comes to mind is whether the company is a potential acquisition target. If they are a strategic target for well-capitalized competitors, that's great. That could cause their bond prices to rise potentially significantly. If they are target for a debt fueled type private transaction, that would generally be a negative. Another asset class that's very important to our portfolio is structured products which I rotated on to and have overseen since 2016. Again, structured products sometimes referred to as securitized products are bonds that are backed by cash flows from everyday assets, things like car loans, home mortgages, commercial mortgages or credit cards, everyday stuff in the real economy. Because not everyone on this webcast may have the same level of background in structured products, I thought I would use a simple example of car loans to help visualize how these securities work and how we think about them. Structured products typically start with a product we're all familiar with in our daily lives such as auto loans. In the case of this example, the process starts with a consumer purchasing a car and taking auto loan. Millions of buyers purchase cars every month making this an important market. Auto loans are typically extended by a bank or a consumer finance company such as Ford Motor Credit. The banks and finance companies have a choice. Do they hold these loans, or do they sell them to free up capacity to make more loans? When they sell them, that's where structured products come into play. When enough loans are made, the bank or finance company sells those loans into a trust. The trust receives the cash flows and security on those loans and then the finance company working with an investment bank creates and sells bonds to institutions such as ourselves. These bonds are typically enhanced by various forms of what is known as credit protection to shield them against defaults and losses in the loan portfolio. It sounds complicated, but these products have long track records and work well through the ups and downs of the economy. So, what do we look for when we evaluate a deal? First, we look at the reputation and track record of the issuer. How long have they been in business; how have their assets performed; do they do what they say they will do? Next, we look at the underlying asset class. Car loans to prime buyers had been a very dependable asset class. But contrast to autos might be something more esoteric like aircraft finance or shipping containers which are considerably more difficult to analyze and predict. Next, we look at the underlying borrowers. We look for quality and reliability and statistics such as FICO score, income levels and geographic diversity. And finally, we look at the structure of the bonds themselves. Structured products are typically issued with built-in credit protection. The most simple example is the bond ABC example, I have highlighted here. In the case of a typical deal, bond A would be senior to bonds B and C, in case the trust started to incur losses from defaulted car loans. If you make bonds B and C large enough, bond A can survive even the harshest stress test which is what we look for. Last point I'd like to make about structured products can be summarized through a simple example. Unlike corporate bonds in which we are analyzing one company, structured products often contain hundreds or even thousands of underlying loans and mortgages. As a result, we have to rely more in statistical testing to underwrite the credit quality. And as Mark Twain was rumored to have once said facts are stubborn things, but statistics are pliable. We couldn't agree more and we reflect that in our analysis. This chart shows two-illustrative normally distributed borrower pools that might exist in a typical securitized deal. Both of them have a seemingly identical creditworthiness as shown by an average FICO score of 740. If you knew nothing else, you would think these are both high-quality borrower pools. However, it's not the average that we are after, but rather the dispersion of the FICO scores and the size of the left tail which represents the lower FICO score borrowers with higher default risk. As you get below the roughly 660 or so FICO scores subprime cut-off, that default risk rises exponentially. So that's were you're exposed as a lender. In the left chart, FICO scores have a wide range from 580 which is considered deep subprime to 900 which is pristine. You might think that having pristine borrowers in your pool is a positive, but that merely helps the average of the pool without improving the loss potential of the lower quality borrowers. Mark Twain would probably furrow his substantial brow here. The right chart has a much more narrow dispersion. In other words, all FICO scores are closer to the average than the left chart. The pool ranges from just under 660 that rough subprime cut-off, to just under 860. While this pool doesn't have any 900 FICO score borrowers, statistically speaking, a 900 FICO score borrower isn't much different from an 800 FICO score borrower in terms of probability of default. So, we would strongly prefer to invest in case 2 which contains a significantly smaller left tail and probability of sustaining material credit losses. Now, I'm going to run you through a quick example in commercial mortgage-backed securities which I will refer to as CMBS going forward. There's a lot going on in this chart, so I'll try to break it down for you. Before I describe this slide, the punchline is that we like to deal on the left and we chose not to purchase the deal on the right. CMBS is really a tale of two markets. The depiction on the left is an example of the single asset single borrower market which is a fancy way of saying each deal contains only one property and that property is often a very high quality such as Trophy New York City office building on Park Avenue. Loans are typically also backed by large sponsors such as publicly traded REITs or other large well-known real estate investors. That depiction on the right is an example of a conduit. Conduits are deals that contain multiple loans usually more in the small to medium size range. Properties and conduits can range from things like regional malls, to suburban offices, to self-storage facilities. Sponsors can range from high-quality sponsors, to small local real estate investors. If we were to stop there, it would seem to be enough to convince us that the single asset single borrower market is of much higher quality and it typically is. However, it gets a bit even better from there. The single asset market is also known for its lower leverage which results in more protection against losses. By way of comparison, if you look at the skinny blue bar on each chart known as the single A rated tranche, you can see they are protected from losses from all of the bonds and the equity beneath them. In the case of the single asset deal, the property's value would have to go down by a stunning 68% before the single-A tranche lost money. In the case of the conduit deal, the bonds are protected from a loss of value of 47%. Now both are substantial cushions, but think back to the quality and resiliency of the underlying assets. On the left, you have that Trophy New York City office building backed by a deep-pocketed sponsor. On the right, you have a set of lower quality properties with lesser-known financial backers and therefore more volatility and more downside. So, is this all too good to be true? Why not? Always just buy the quality single asset deal. Well, if you look at the numbers circled on the track, these show credit spreads that you receive as investors and you do get paid more to hold the conduits bonds, higher compensation for high risk. In the case of the single asset deal, you would receive a spread of 100 basis points or 1% over LIBOR. In the case of the conduit, you would receive treasuries plus 215 basis points or 2.15%. While you're certainly getting paid more to own the conduit, we believe the better risk-adjusted return through both economic ups and downs is in the higher quality asset. You can either eat well by getting paid more to own the conduit bonds or sleep well by owning a single asset deal. We prefer to sleep well at this point in the economic cycle. So, how are we positioned now? As mentioned in an earlier slide, our Group 1 risk assets are at 14.3% of the portfolio relative to our 25% constraint. That's on the low side for us as you saw from our 10-year chart. Cash and treasuries make up 36% of the total portfolio and 39% of our fixed income portfolio. And our interest rate exposure is lower than the midpoint of our duration range. In short, we feel that we're conservatively positioned and ready to take advantage of market opportunities as they present themselves. What will we be thinking about going forward? First and foremost, we will continue to support the company and its mission to grow as fast as possible at 96 or better combined ratio. Second, we're watching the risks out there, things like unexpected inflation, or signs of an economic downturn. And we're always mindful about what we're focused on, it's unlikely to be the actual problem. Black swans absolutely do exist in our experience. And finally, valuations are fair at best right now. These things can change suddenly as they did in 2015, '16, and December of 2018. We will focus on staying nimble with the goal of going on offense and buying cheap securities when others are playing defense. So, in summary, we believe our team is rock solid. We have significant investment experience through economic ups and downs, we have a great culture, and we're tightly integrated with operating business. Our mandate is clear, support the business. We do this by focusing on protecting our balance sheet first while pursuing the best risk-adjusted returns we see in the financial markets. Our model is flexible. We can shift the portfolio rapidly when we see opportunity and we're focused on generating total returns without having to worry about accounting or other metrics. And finally, our compensation plan is simple, company gain share and our performance against our peers. We'll work toward the same common goal of generating one aggregate portfolio return. Thank you very much for your time. And now we will pause and transition to Q&A. A - Julia Hornack : [Instructions] Joel, can you please introduce our first participant from the conference call line please? Operator : The question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Kinar, your line is now open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. My first question is around severity and then I have a follow-up. So, with regards to severity, I clearly saw an up tick in the BI severity in the first quarter. And physical damage severity is also continuing its creep up. I guess, do you have any thoughts as to what's leading these increases now of all times as opposed to say the last I don't know a year or two years, three years? And what actions could you take in order to offset some of that other than raising price? Tricia Griffith : Yes. on the physical damage the portion of it, we are still seeing the component parts are more expensive. So, that continues to be pretty clear as cars get -- as the technology gets more advanced. So, we can price that pretty quickly. On the BI side, what we did is we took kind of a deep dive into that trend. Mike Sieger, who is our Claims President has a group of people and they did a deep dive and have narrowed down the BI severity to seven specific states and specifically we look at segmentation and claims like we do in product, specifically soft tissue, attorney rep claims that aren't litigated. And we're actually seeing the special damages increase, not the general damages. So, think of general damages as pain and suffering, the specials as medicals. So, what Mike and his team are doing is they're taking another deep dive right now into those seven states to understand and have hypotheses to prove or disprove so they can take action, are the specials, is it more frequency of bills or more severity; is it the fact that we've grown a lot, so newer people? So, more to come on that. But Mike is all over it and literally we've gone through a lot of data to understand that BI severity so that we can correct any actions from our process improvement perspective. Yaron Kinar : Got it. Okay, we'll keep track of that I guess as we've. Then my second question is around PLE. So, I think in the 10-Q you mentioned that you've made some targeted underwriting changes in the new product model and that's what's some of the PLE erosion. Can you maybe explain what you're trying to achieve by these changes? And I don't know if you'd be able to quantify what portion of the PLE decline came from those changes specifically? Tricia Griffith : I touched about this at a little bit in the last call. A big portion of some of the decline in PLE was the process change that we made. And the reason we did it was for our lifetime underwriting profit goals. So, we had process in place. It was basically a timeframe that you could renew without a lapse. And when we looked at that timeframe, one, we thought it was too long because we were able to tell that those customers were not profitable. And when we narrowed it down, one, we're more consistent with the industry; and two, we make money on those customers. So, we knew we would lose those customers and that would decline in PLE. And I think two, and I can't necessarily quantify specifically, but we have our usage-based insurance and as we continue to evolve that model and we have people that are surcharged, they tend to leave as well. So, a couple of different components. But the process change was the biggest component. We should see that diminish a little bit after the second quarter after it's gone through the book. Yaron Kinar : Thanks so much. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Julia Hornack : Joel, if you could take -- Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Mr. Phillips, your line is now open. Mike Phillips : Thank you. Good morning. I want to hit on I guess my first question on the other side of the loss side and frequency. And this is not a new topic obviously, but you said in the past that that you don't price for the frequency changes, the favorable frequency. I guess I want to understand that a little bit better, if that's what you said and kind of why not if long-term trends and short-term trends are still very favorable, kind of talk about why you're choosing not to price the latter, it's what you meant by that? Tricia Griffith : What we don't do is we can't -- there are so many macroeconomic trends that go into frequency. So, severity we can pretty much pinpoint what we think is happening, where frequency, it could be vehicle miles driven, it could be our mix of business on the book, it could be gas prices. So there are so many things that go into it. It's hard to have the specific input. So what we do is, we watch that trend to see what's happening, but it's much more difficult than severity. Do you want to add anything? John Sauerland : Sure. Yes. We absolutely price the frequency. We have a frequency assumption that's forward looking to some degree driven obviously by the past. I think our previous statements have been that the frequency assumptions we made for forward-looking pricing weren't as big of a decrease as we've seen. So, we didn't price for the level of decrease in frequency that we've seen, we have been assuming smaller frequency declines in our pricing. But not again as much as we've seen recently. Mike Phillips : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Second question on the commercial side, commercial auto, can you talk about what you see in terms of different loss experiences for I guess your core commercial versus kind of the ride-sharing business? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean commercial also has five different what we call BMTs. So, it is across the board from a tow truck to a sand and gravel hauler. So, they are very different across the board. And TNC is a higher frequency I think because they are in more of an urban areas. So, I can't give you specifics on that. We're look at that specifically with each of the BMTs, the TNC will look at state, we look at especially in the bigger states where there's a lot of construction going on. So, it varies dramatically. It would take me quite a while to go over it. I am going to have John Barbagallo who runs our commercial business attend the next webcast because I think he can go into a deeper dive on how we look at that product from a profitability perspective and a growth perspective. Julia Hornack : Thanks Mike. Joel, can we get the next question from the conference call line please? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Ms. Greenspan, your line is now open. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. My first question, Tricia, in your Shareholder Letter, you mentioned that there are some signals of a softening personal auto market. I was just hoping that you could just give us a little bit more color on what you are seeing and how you guys are kind of trying to combat that and just kind of policy growth thoughts given expectations that the market could be a little bit softer? Tricia Griffith : Sure Elyse. So, let me give you sort of a little bit of the punchline. But, let me walk back and walk you through how we have been thinking about for the last couple of years because we have a lot of tenure at Progressive and we've seen hard and soft markets come and go. So we're just seeing less price movements, so whether it's less rate take or actually many companies are taking slight decreases, so there's just less shopping. So, people are satisfied with their rate, less shopping. But let me walk you back a couple of years ago because as we have this robust or have continued to have this robust growth in profit, what we wanted to do is we wanted to take a look and say, okay, during times where there was a soft market, what are the things that we did or didn't do that we would want to do differently in this next market. And of course, things always change, so it's never the specific point in time. But a couple of years ago, we did -- about 1.5 year ago we did a deep dive into saying, okay, what would we do differently and sort of kind of gauged that around our operational strategies to continue on this growth. Because we really enjoy this great growth and profitability and we wanted to continue and we want to set ourselves up to continue that. So just recently as we've seen less rate take in the market, less shopping in the market, prospects are a little bit more challenging to get where we have great conversion now., so that's what has enabled us to continue to grow. We got together our group of people, Pat Callahan, our Personal Lines President, got together just to have a summit to say, okay, what -- how are we going to get out on front of this while we're in this really great position to continue this? So clearly, we continue to increase our marketing. And we're having a lot of unique marketing where actually you'll see something new next week from us with our specialized lines of motorcycles in particular product that a new campaign we are excited about. And we're looking at different ways to market in different areas to get the customers that we desire. On the agency side and I wrote about this a lot in my letter, we've done a lot of investments for the agents and we are really trying to focus on agencies that we believe can continue to help us grow that may be haven't grown as much as other ones and work with them on our product and our systems to have them sell more Progressive, making Progressive number one or two in their firm. And the overall, I think when we think about combating the soft market, I think about what we talked about for years. And that's the whole destination era strategy. Obviously, we invested in homeowner's company and we have many other unaffiliated partners that we work with, so making it easy for our customers. So HQX we have a Progressive home buy button in eight states now and we have other unaffiliated partners we work with to make it really easy to buy that home and connect it with the auto. We also have and we talked about this a lot. When we talked about the destination era, a lot of people that are going to graduate ultimately they have an auto and may be a renter's policy now they are going to graduate. So how do we market to them? We have metrics that we look at in the destination era that we look at auto plus another product. And when customers have more products and they are able to have our service and on the claims side and the CRM side and they like it, likely they're going to have more products. And if you compare the auto plus one metric from March of this year to March of 2018, we're up about 8.5%. So that's actually just kind of scratching the surface. Pat's team and actually teams around the company are working on, okay, what do we do? And we're just seeing slightly softening, so we want to really get out in front of that to continue to set ourselves up to ensure a profitable growth for some time to come. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's very helpful. My follow-up which is I want to go back to the severity conversation from earlier when you had mentioned there are seven states that have really kind of been a red flag for you guys. Are those states that you've grown -- that the growth was greater in over the past few years than other states that would may make you think that maybe it was greater growth? Tricia Griffith : I would say about half of them are. So, yes, we have grown so much in every state. But yes, there are couple of larger states where we have grown tremendously and that's where we are really taking the deep dive to understand and create hypotheses to get our arms around it. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you very much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Elyse. Julia Hornack : Thanks. Joel, can you take the next call from the conference call line please? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Mr. Zaremski, your line is now open. Mike Zaremski : Hey, thanks. Follow-up to one of the previous questions about the targeted underwriting changes that will continue through the second quarter. Are those changes behind some of the underlying loss ratio improvement and I think the last quarter on the call I asked you guys about that. You said it was due to business mix changes. And I'm curious if this is a major component to that? Tricia Griffith : These are really more process changes. Our underwriting is a little bit different. It would be a portion of it, I don't think it would be a huge amount. A lot of it is our ability to make sure that we care about expenses deeply. Our mix of business continues to change. I didn't mention this when Elyse asked the question, but we are seeing our agents more and more floating us the preferred business that we are starting to come to enjoy. So, it's a portion of it, I wouldn't say it's a major portion of it. John Sauerland : And most of our underwriting activities are focused on incoming customers. The process change that Tricia mentioned was the renewals, so obviously in force customers with us, but the predominance of our underwriting efforts when we talk about them over the past I don't know five years or so have ensured that we are getting accurate information from people coming in the door and risks whose intent is truly to ensure. Mike Zaremski : Okay, great. And my last question is regarding your ambitions to grow into small business, commercial, and BOP. In terms of the playbook, I'd be curious, is the majority of your current commercial auto book, is that sourced through brokers? And two, in terms of the BOP business you are selling today, are you privy to the underwriting and loss ratio data that is ultimately going on to the third-party paper that you're using? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : So, the majority of the BOP already now is from unaffiliated third parties. So, we just rolled out our -- and sold our first policy on Good Friday for our BOP coverage. And we're going slow as we want to understand the system implications et cetera. So, we have it in Ohio handful of agents, we're going to add on more agents in May and then continue the roll. So, it would be slow and methodical just to make sure that it's a good process for the agents, a great product for the customer et cetera. So, slow and steady. What we're happy about is that we invested in this a couple of years ago because we think -- as we think about Horizon 2 initiatives, this is an important piece of it. And again, John Barbagallo will go into detail in the next webcast on what we're doing and commercial. We don't use the data from the other companies those who inform us of what we do. We bifurcate that data. Mike Zaremski : And your commercial auto book today -- it's commercial auto, is that sourced mostly through brokers? Tricia Griffith : Commercial auto -- I get what you're saying. Through our independent agents, yeah, the majority of our commercial auto business is -- does go through commercial agents. We rolled out there BQX, the soft launch of BQX a couple of months ago, which is BusinessQuote Explorer. So, we'll continue to have more direct and online, but right now I'd say about 95% of ours goes through independent agents. John Sauerland : In terms of premium for first quarter was about 84% of premium went through independent agents. So, a slight majority. Mike Zaremski : Thanks so much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Julia Hornack : Thank you. So, I'm actually going to take question from the webcast right now. So, this question is from a current shareholder and their question is, what is Progressive's view on investing in alternative asset classes, specifically private equity? Tricia Griffith : Do you want to take that Jonathan? Okay, we'll have Jonathan Bauer answer that. Jonathan Bauer : Sure. Thanks very much for the question. We take a very thoughtful approach to all of our investing, at the moment, how we've currently decided to split it out is public equities that we index as I mentioned before, actively managing fixed income. Within that fixed income portfolio, we focused on having more liquid securities as we mentioned in terms of mortgages, treasuries and corporate bonds. We always stay open to looking at other opportunities in terms of alternative asset classes. But, at this point in time, we felt that we'd prefer to stay in more liquid asset classes and have chosen not to invest in private equity. Julia Hornack : Great. Thanks Jonathan. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Jonathan. Julia Hornack : Joel, can we take the next caller from the conference call line please? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt with William Blair. Mr. Schmitt, your line is now open. Jeff Schmitt : Hi, good afternoon. Question on severity, it was 7.8% in the quarter, looks to be above the industry or at least at the high-end of the industry, and I think it had been running below for you guys fairly recently. Do you have any sense on what may have driven that shift? Tricia Griffith : Well, we don't have the industry quarter results yet, so we'll compare after that. But there is the three components that we talked about, the BI severity specifically soft tissue in several states, the physical damage or severity in terms of components and car parts. And then PIP severity went up a little bit based on, I talked about this on the last call on a Supreme Court case with the industry lost in Florida. And that's the main piece. We'll continue to watch it and watch what happens in the industry. John Sauerland : To that I'd add, we are looking at a quarter and maybe you've seen a couple of other reads from other companies for the quarter. If you look over the long-term, I mean decades or even years, generally you see our severity trends track fairly well with the industry. We are also the subject to the same inflation trends for parts, for medical services et cetera. Where you see our trend diverge from the industry is on frequency. So, our frequency trends have been going up less than the industry over the longer term, or more recently going down more. And we think there's a lot of things that go into that, but certainly we think our pricing, segmentation goes into that, the underwriting efforts that I mentioned previously as well as our shift to a more preferred end of the customer spectrum. So, over the longer term, I think you'll generally see our severity trends similar to the industry, we think if you look over the longer term, again, frequency is where we find the advantage. Jeff Schmitt : Okay. That's helpful. And just one more on the Robinson's segment. Could you discuss how growth looks there versus the year ago and what your outlook is? Tricia Griffith : Yes. Growth continues to be strong. We're growing the fastest in Robinson's I think in both direct and agency by a lot. We only have about 2.5% of the home market with our PHA and our Platinum agents. So, we believe that there is a lot of runway there. And we have our agency and team working with our agents to make sure they think about us when they are thinking about auto and home bundle, but that's a place where we continue to be really bullish on our ability to grow and grow substantially which of course the more we have that preferred segment relates to frequency. So, we're really excited about that. John Sauerland : And on the direct side, obviously we've been putting a lot of new products in place or new methods of coding, our HomeQuote Explorer is a great example where we're making it easier for Robinson's to either graduate to Robinson's with us or come to us as new customers, our advertising mix has shifted toward messages that are geared toward that segment of the population. So, that's helping drive business there. And as Tricia mentioned, getting agents to change behavior around whom they think are Progressive best serving, it takes a while. And we've seen that shift she mentioned earlier in agents coding us we think their most preferred households. Within the independent agent channel, we actually find a lot more potential for Robinson's growth than the direct channel. So, we're really excited about that. Julia Hornack : Thanks Jeff. Joel, can we take the next caller from the conference call line please? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Mr. Shields, your line is now open. Meyer Shields : Great. Thanks very much. Tricia, I was hoping you could comment on whether the growth that you're seeing in Robinson's sector implies that all else equal Progressive is less vulnerable to market competition than five years ago or some prior period? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean it's hard to quantify, but I would say that's one of the reasons why we chose to invest in ASI and invest in relationships with other unaffiliated partners. We know from data when customers have more than one product, their likelihood to stay is longer, their stickiness is better. And we wanted to be -- as part of our strategy, we wanted to make sure that -- and I think you said this in a webcast, I think John Sauerland said, we want to be able to say, yes, we got that, we can get that for you. And so whether it's on our paper or not, yes, I do believe you are less vulnerable if you have more and more products and services that can take care of as many consumers as possible. Meyer Shields : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Second question, unrelated. Is the shift to the Robinson's having any impact on the average claim settlement in the legacy non-standard book, in other words, is it changing the mindset of claims adjusters? Tricia Griffith : No. I mean I would say our claims adjusters and this is I think a little -- couldn't be different than what I've heard from adjusters who are coming from other companies. We focus on every customer whether they are Sam, Diane, Wright or Robinson and make sure we give them the best service ever. So, I don't believe that Robinson's affect the Sam's. Of course, a lot of the Robinson's have higher limits, so that could be a dependent factor as well, but I don't think that has an effect. Meyer Shields : Great. Thank you very much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Meyer. Julia Hornack : Well, that actually appears to be the last question in the queue. So, Joel, I'm going to hand the -- I'm going to hand it back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation's first quarter Investor event.

Tricia Griffith : Good afternoon and welcome to Progressive\u2019s second quarter webcast. We continue to be thrilled with our results across the board and probably, more importantly, our plans to continue to gain market share. That said if you have been watching the commercial lines results they are nothing short of phenomenal on both growth and profitability. And in addition, we have taken this last couple of years to really invest in IT and talent, and we\u2019re going to talk a lot about that today and the addressable markets that we are really running into and excited about and we are going to have a couple of guests give you a lot of details. This slide might be familiar in a little bit different form, but when we started this webcast, we literally wanted to look at the overall P&C addressable market and understand where Progressive plays and where we win. In the last couple of years, we\u2019ve really focused mostly on the Personal Lines section, which is more than half of the P&C industry, and more specifically on auto and home, especially as we integrated ASI to Progressive Home and we have shared with you the four pillars and our cornerstones and really our ability to continue to grow market share on the auto, on the home and of course in our bundles the Robinson and we\u2019ve proven that we can do that. The great news here is that we are less than 9% share on the Personal Lines side of the whole P&C market. So we still have a lot of runway. And as I am sure you have read, our highest growing segment is the Robinsons. The other half of this is the Commercial Lines addressable market, which is nearly half of the overall P&C market at $328 billion. Let\u2019s take a look at what we will call a down \u2013 I don\u2019t know, walk-through in Commercial Lines, where we are going to play and where we believe we are going to win. And I am going to start with that orange segment and I will work counterclockwise. So the orange segment is where we are now, monoline commercial auto, it\u2019s almost $14.5 billion addressable market. We have been doing really well there for decades. Right now, we are the number one commercial auto writer with 22% market share. And with our advanced segmentation in our talent, we really believe we can even gain more market share. The next tranche to the left of that in green is small fleet. So think of small fleet as vehicles between six and 30. In the six to nine, we do really well, but we\u2019re going to expand to the 10 to 30 vehicle fleets. And Karen is going to talk about how we\u2019re going to attack that market. The next sliver, the black sliver at $1.5 billion is the insured TNC. As you know, we\u2019ve had a long-standing relationship with Uber where we insure the drivers on their platform in 13 states. So we want to continue to grow there as well. The next color over in yellow is commercial auto, bundled with GL and BOP. So think of the Robinsons of commercial auto, we just started writing that this year we are going to expand across the country and we\u2019re really excited about the opportunities here. Again we are going to be surgical, we are going to make sure that we don\u2019t just grow but we profitably grow but we are very excited about this opportunity. Those first four tranches really have the commercial auto at the base. Let\u2019s go to the blue section. The blue section is small business with GL and BOP. So think of it as a $20 billion addressable opportunity, so we are really excited about that. But think of 30 million small businesses with less than 20 employees. So we think we are going to win and we think we are going to win in a big way. When you look at all five of those sections, it really increases our addressable market to over 3 times. That\u2019s what\u2019s so exciting and the fact that we have done so well in the commercial auto market with really understanding segmentation, we\u2019re going to take the same approach to these new areas with a lot of segmentation and less underwriting. So we are very excited. A couple of places where we\u2019re not going to play in just yet are the gray area and that is, think of hazardous materials, public transportation, and right now, businesses with more than 20 employees. Again, we want to get this right, be surgical, be measured, be disciplined and then we\u2019ll consider expanding. On the other area that\u2019s fairly large as other insurance \u2013 other commercial insurance. Think marine Insurance, workers\u2019 comp, mortgage guaranty, things like that. But for now, we\u2019re really excited about the growth opportunities and excited that the fact that we have been taking a couple of years to really make big investments and now they\u2019re coming to fruition. What are you seeing here you should recognize. I have showed you this, a couple of times with private passenger auto. You are seeing the last 5 years of Commercial Lines growth and profitability. Profitability on the X-axis with the combined ratio inverted, so you want to be to the right of 100, net written premium on the Y-axis, so you want to be in that gray-shaded area. Progressive is blue, the industry is black and the nine competitors in any given years are the gray bubbles. And as you can see, we have always been in that gray area and in fact the last couple of years by pretty wide margins. That\u2019s what excites us about delving into new opportunities in this really vast addressable market. So let\u2019s get to the need of the day with my guests John Barbagallo and Karen Bailo. You\u2019ve met both of them over the years in different capacities. Karen started at Progressive in 1990 in the CRM organization. She has had a multitude of jobs in terms of process and claims and product. But for the last 10 years, she has been either a Personal Lines GM or more recently in charge of agency distribution. In fact she has been integral in rolling out the Platinum program and integrating the sales force of ASI and Progressive. So she\u2019s done a phenomenal job. Last year, she was one of the seven people that we did a town swap with, where she landed in Commercial Lines Control. So I\u2019m really excited to have Karen share with you what they\u2019re working on. But first, I will ask John Barbagallo to come up. John has been with the company since 1983, he started in claims and has done, again a lot of jobs, whether it\u2019s national sales or claims. He left for just a two-year hiatus. We welcomed him back, thank goodness, with open arms. And in the last 10 years, one, he\u2019s worked with Karen on the agency distribution, but more importantly he has been our Commercial Lines Group President. And what you are going to see today is really what John has been working, on seeing the vision of how we can get great at commercial auto, which we are and then expand. And so I\u2019m really excited to have John share with you his plans for the future. John. John Barbagallo : Thank you, Tricia. Commercial Lines continues to be a really good story at Progressive, commercial auto in particular and it\u2019s an important contributor to overall growth and profitability. Now this has been particularly true for the last five years, but it really reflects a competitive position we\u2019ve carved out over the last two decades. And as Tricia just alluded to and as Karen will get into a lot more detail in a few minutes. We still see lots of opportunity for continued growth simply by capitalizing on the people, skills and assets we already have in place, plus some new capabilities we\u2019ve been developing. But first, I want to talk a little bit about results because our results have truly diverged from most of the rest of the industry. So on the left you see 20-year time series of Progressive\u2019s commercial auto direct written premium growth versus the rest of the industry. Two things popped out here. One, commercial auto has some cyclicality to it and intends to move along with the larger economy and two, when the market grows, Progressive historically has grown at a much faster pace. In fact, over the last four years, we have increased our market share by 50%. So not only are we taking advantage of an expanding market, but we are taking share from competitors. But perhaps the more important divergence is the chart on the right, which shows underwriting profit and they\u2019re same 20-year time series. You see a consistent delta of 8, 10 and in some years, more than 20 points on combined ratio versus the industry. So how is this possible in what is generally considered to be a very competitive industry sector? Well, I think there are a number of factors that contribute to that. And I really can\u2019t get into all of them. But perhaps the most important one has just been our intense focus on commercial auto as a core line of business for the company. So back in 2014, I introduced you to our business market targets or BMTs. Now this was originally a marketing construct designed for product management, but over the intervening years we have operationalized these BMTs across virtually every aspect of our business and this is important because we see meaningful actionable differences between the BMTs. Some examples, the demand function is different by BMT and how that demand function reacts, the changes in the economy is also very different. How loss is present and how they develop, attorney representation rates litigation outcomes, all different by BMT. Certainly frequency and severity trends and other factors change at different rates and at different times by BMT. All of these things are critical inputs to our rate levels and our underwriting actions. This granular focus allows us to develop insight faster, be more responsive and develop strategies and tactics to profitably grab market share. So having a granular focus and understanding the business at that level is certainly helpful. But beyond that, you have to have the will and the confidence to react to what you\u2019re seeing, and the process capability and dexterity to continue to make adjustments as new evidence emerges. So back in 2016, we saw a marked uptick in accident frequency between the months of May and November. And on both these charts that\u2019s indicated by the blue shaded area. At the same time that frequency was increasing rapidly, prior-year loss reserve development was contributing to an already positive severity trend. We saw these trends and we reacted very quickly and in a little over three months, we raised rates by more than 10% on the portfolio and implemented a number of underwriting changes. And as you can see, we have continued to make a series of changes and adjustments over time. I would suggest to you that having a granular approach to the business and reacting decisively to what we see while much of the market was slower to react and it\u2019s all been an important part of us maintaining strong underwriting margins and growing the business in this recent period. Now we know our claims organization provides us with a significant competitive advantage on commercial auto. This is really a combination of two things. One, leveraging the massive personal auto claims infrastructure and quality control processes to handle a very high volume of our commercial auto claim features at low cost. On the chart, you can see in the last four years, we\u2019ve essentially doubled the size of our core auto business while maintaining a very competitive loss adjustment ratio and good quality. The second factor is having very targeted specialization within Commercial Lines on the highest impact claims now. Progressive\u2019s claims organization has over 19,000 employees, and a very high degree of specialization and a focus on quality and efficiency. This larger group handles the majority of our commercial auto claim features and that alone gives us an advantage over many of our commercial auto competitors. But beyond that, we have invested in a specialty claims group that now numbers more than 750 people and they work exclusively on Commercial Lines. Now, while the larger claims organization handles the majority of features the specialty group accounts for nearly 60% of the indemnity dollars we spend as they deal with the highest impact and most complex claims. To that end, we have 115 highly tenured commercial casualty adjusters and managers handling the highest exposure and often most complicated commercial injury claims. On the physical damage side, we have over 300 dedicated claims people for the majority of them deployed in the field that only handle heavy equipment and cargo claims. And to support our new but rapidly growing TNC business, we now have over 200 wholly dedicated claims adjusters and managers. We have built the specialty group, primarily with internal hires drawing from some of our most experienced and savvy employees. So while many on the team or new in their roles, they are not new, in fact they\u2019re very experienced and produce consistently good outcomes in line with our claims guiding principles. I believe this combination of a well-tuned, highly efficient claims infrastructure for the majority of our features, combined with a group of highly skilled commercial specialists for the highest impact claims gives us a competitive advantage on claims that few can match. I am going to make one last point on reserving where our philosophy to be as accurate as possible with minimal variation has served us extremely well. This chart shows our commercial auto reserve development versus the industry over a period of seven years and you can see we have much tighter variance. There are two primary reasons for this. One is the claims organization I just talked about. Getting more of the high impact and complex claims into the hands of that specialized claims group more quickly leads to more timely and accurate claims handling and better estimates The other contributing factor is a highly segmented approach we take the loss reserving for commercial auto as we do with our other products. This is another area where we operationalize our BMT structure, where in addition to the usual loss cost cuts, a BMT view allows us to see pattern changes sooner and react appropriately. More consistent loss cost estimates through accurate reserving let\u2019s us understand our true ultimate costs faster and be more responsive with pricing and product refinements. So that\u2019s a little background on what you\u2019ve been seeing in our results recently over the last few years and why we\u2019ve been able to produce some very different outcomes. Now I\u2019d like to have Karen come up and share a little bit about our going-forward strategy and tactics, and some exciting new opportunities for growth. Karen Bailo : Thank you, John. As both Tricia and John referenced, we have a growing and profitable Commercial Lines business and with our investments, we have an expanding addressable market that affords future opportunity for growth. The road map for growing the business focuses investments in three areas, pursuing untapped commercial auto potential, expanding the distribution of our products, and then expanding our product portfolio. I will start with the opportunity in our core commercial auto business where we have investments and additional enhancements that are fueling growth. We don\u2019t have time for a comprehensive review of everything under way, so I\u2019ll cover a handful of items that we are excited about and how we are opening up new substantial and under-penetrated markets with more competitive offerings. I will cover preferred truck, fleet and how our two telematics space programs are fueling our competitive position. This chart specifically highlights growth in our truck segments with written premium index to the year 2000. Now, we have been investing in our truck business for quite some time and we\u2019re excited about our progress, but also the opportunity ahead. Reflecting on recent contributions to growth, I\u2019ll start with the year 2012. Back in 2012, we rolled out our long-haul product more broadly and we also began using business market targets or BMTs in our segmentation and our product. And then in 2015, we launched a new product with a proprietary scoring model for trucking risks. That model included parameters around tenure, safety and stability, and introduced powerful segmentation into our product. And then between 2017 and 2018, there were a number of things going on in the marketplace for which we were well positioned for growth. The economy was growing, the trucking industry was all also growing in terms of new truck sales and new ventures, the industry was also raising rates given poor underwriting results and adverse development, and in late 2017, the federal electronic logging device mandate went into effect. Given we had already addressed rate need, as John mentioned earlier and introduced powerful segmentation into our product, we were well positioned to grow profitably during that time period. And while we\u2019ve grown significantly, there is more opportunity ahead and I\u2019ll cover that in the next few slides. Back in 2016, John shared that we saw a potential in telematics space pricing for truck. We have been collecting our own telematics data and we observed that the driving behavior of commercial operators varied significantly from personalized customers in terms of how, how much and where they drive. And in 2017 as I mentioned earlier, the federal electronic logging device mandate went into effect, and because we had already invested in telematics and had an earlier generation telematics-based product ready to go to market, we were well positioned. And what we have learned since is that telematics data for trucking is as powerful as we thought it would be. So part of the federal mandate, most over-the-road truckers are required to have an electronic logging device to manage their hours of service. And Smart Haul is our telematics space program that uses the driving data on the truckers existing electronic logging device in exchange for a potential discount on their insurance of up to 18%. The data on the left shows the power of that data. We have policies grouped into quantiles and the loss ratio relativity across those quantiles. And what we see is that the predictiveness of the telematics data is very powerful. And there is a lot more we can do with those data. For example, geolocation information has the potential to significantly improved rating and ultimately eliminate some less reliable approaches like radius of operation. We expect the segmentation value of this information to be more meaningful for Commercial Lines, and as a result, telematics data to be even more predictive than what we see in Personal Lines with Snapshot. So while there is more we can do with this data, this early generation Smart Haul model that we\u2019re using today is better than any competitive offering out there. Results are also really terrific. We are seeing that Smart Haul quotes are converting at a rate of more than double our normal trucking business and the savings is substantial at around $1,400. Now that\u2019s a significant competitive advantage for us considering insurance costs are the fourth largest cost for a trucker behind fuel, lease payments and repair costs, and it shopped often. I will also point out that even after applying these significant discounts, we continue to see that the loss ratio is better on this business. So it\u2019s good business and it\u2019s all incremental segmentation. So this is a big win for customers and for us and consumer adoption is strong. We see 50% take rate in our direct business, and although the agency take rate is lower, the adoption rate in agency is stronger than what we see in Personal Lines. So, the segmentation value here is real, it\u2019s powerful, our results are terrific and we are just getting started. So while we have grown a lot, we are always looking for untapped potential for growth. And we see the preferred truck market as an area of opportunity for future growth. We estimate this market to be about $1.2 billion in size and focus is on 1-to-10 vehicle risks. Now, this is an internal definition of preferred and it has parameters around tenure, safety, financial responsibility and business operations. And this is a look at the estimate of the top preferred carriers in the marketplace, and also a look at their change in market share over time. We have made significant progress in growing our market share over 50% in the last 3 years. We estimate that we are the #2 writer of preferred truck and we are closing in on that number one spot. We have made significant gains by applying telematics and our core strengths of pricing and segmentation to really intentionally target in this segment and improve our competitive offering. The ongoing evolution of our preferred truck offering will include continued investments in Smart Haul as well as rate changes and product enhancements to improve our rate competitiveness, rates ability and our overall coverage offerings. So these investments that we are making will continue to improve our competitiveness and our ability to grow preferred truck. So another exciting opportunity for us to grow across all of our business market targets is really focused on businesses with 10 to 30 vehicles. This small fleet market is estimated at around $4 billion in size. We have low penetration today and we\u2019ve only started to put energy into it. Our approach of using objective and verifiable data historically hasn\u2019t worked well in an environment where pricing is driven more by qualitative assessments of an underlying business. Today, we have assets and capabilities including more verifiable and objective data that enable us to use our strength on pricing and segmentation to target this opportunity. So the fleet opportunity has required us to really think differently about these customers in terms of our product, our process and our workflows, and we have completely revamped our approach around these areas. We\u2019ve made investments in our product to rethink how we assess fleet risks using new data available. We\u2019ve redesigned our process and workflows around service levels and turnaround times. And we\u2019re building an underwriting skill set was profit and loss accountability and really solidifying an acquisition mindset with the goal of improving quotes and conversion. We\u2019ve piloted these new enhancements in Texas and we\u2019re excited about the results we\u2019re seeing. We are seeing 28% improvement in quotes and our conversion is more than 3 times what it was prior to rolling out these new small fleet enhancements. And so based on our success, we are undergoing a countrywide roll-out of these new enhancements and we expect to be in states that represent over 80% of our premium by the end of this year. Now, while we\u2019re very excited to get these new enhancements to market, I\u2019ll point out that we\u2019re just getting started. We have a robust road map ahead of us with continual improvements and enhancements that are on the way. So to round out the opportunity to pursue untapped potential in our core commercial auto business, I\u2019ll touch on telematics again. Like in our truck segments, we expect telematics to be a key driver of success in our small fleet business. There will be benefits to us and our customers, which we expect to drive adoption. For us, we get the added segmentation that we expect to be as important as it is in Personal Lines with Snapshot. And for customers and there will be savings through discounts and better rates, but also through value-added services that will come in the form of our SmartTrip program. The additional savings will come through improved safety by monitoring and enforcing safe driving behavior. Additional savings will also come through improving the efficiency of fleet operations through better asset management and monitoring. We think there is a ready-made market for these services because today about 20% of the 10-to-30-vehicle fleet operators are already buying these services on a stand-alone basis. So there is a need, penetration is low, creating this market opportunity. And we also believe through the indemnity savings and the retention benefits we can essentially deliver these services free of charge. So we\u2019re piloting SmartTrip in six states, through the remainder of this year and we have a goal of being ready for a countrywide roll-out next year. Now let\u2019s talk about the second area of investment, which is expanding distribution in our small business direct channel. Back in 2016, we also shared that we expect a shift in small business owners accessing direct channels for their insurance needs. Consumers across a wide range of industries are showing not only an acceptance of direct channels, but a preference for shopping in those channels. And we don\u2019t expect, small business owners to be any different. Also market projections are pointing to the growth in the small business direct channel. According to a report from Novarica, which is a technology strategy research firm, they are expecting that the small business direct channel to capture as much as 15% market share in the next five years. Additional findings in that report show that younger small business owners have a comfort level with shopping online and buying online and a significant portion of those young business owners have a preference for shopping that way. So we believe the changing demographics of small business owners will contribute to continuing that trend and drive up more market demand. Ultimately, we see this as largely an untapped part of the Commercial Lines market with ample room for growth. We\u2019ve been selling direct commercial insurance for over 10 years now and our early approach was very auto-centric. And then in about 2012 we broadened our approach and our marketing to be much less auto-centric and more focused on ensuring and protecting the business. More recently, we\u2019ve made significant investments and additional capabilities. And as a result, in the last two years, our growth has accelerated considerably. I\u2019ll talk about those investments in the next few slides. At the same time, we broadened our marketing. We began to add capabilities to offer other carrier products to meet the growing demand of commercial prospects and our own customers. We built an in-house agency to sell other carrier business owner policies general liability, workers compensation and professional liability products in addition to our own commercial auto product. And we\u2019ve been having terrific success in growing our direct business. In September of last year, we introduced Business Quote Explorer or BQX, which is our online quoting platform for small business owners. Now customers have a choice for how they shop with us for their small business insurance needs. And over time, we\u2019ll work to optimize and improve the experiences in both of those pass. There will be times when a self-directed online approach is the right option for our customer, and there will be other times we\u2019re calling in for phone support is the right option. Today, I\u2019d like to focus on the online experience and share some of our success. We learned early on, there was an opportunity to make it easy and intuitive for small business owners to get the right coverage. The process for obtaining the right coverage can sometimes be complicated and nuanced and a challenge for a small business owner who isn\u2019t an insurance expert. So we built BQX to help business owners with what they need, match them to the right carrier and ultimately have them confident they have insurance that\u2019s tailored to their unique business needs. In BQX, We have built a business quoting platform that is very capable of good new business yield and we\u2019re just getting started. When we look to the success of our personalized direct business, we have had tremendous success by advancing our quoting platforms through a continual testing and learning and improvement feedback cycle and we expect to build success in Commercial Lines with that same virtuous cycle approach. We also know that even small incremental changes in the quoting experience can result in significant improvements in our sales metrics. So we\u2019re focused on continuous improvements in the following areas. First is increasing engagement and one of the early steps in the quoting flow, which is accurately classifying a business. The second is improving the overall quoting experience by increasing capacity and improving or accurately matching carriers to the risk and then. And then finally, adding online buy functionality. So the business classification step can be a defection point in the quoting experience, and the challenge is helping a business owner describe their business in a way that can be matched to how a carrier classifies and assess risk. Let me give you one example. While everyone might think that landscaper is self-explanatory, from an insurance classification perspective, most carriers, there is a difference between landscaping services, lawn care services and tree services. And inaccurately classifying that business can lead to misrating or inappropriately declining or accepting that risk. So to improve that process, we\u2019ve recently introduced an advisor tool using supervised machine learning that guides a business owner through a series of questions and are designed to get to an accurate and common business classification. Since rolling out that tool, we\u2019ve seen an immediate 7% increase in quoters moving forward into the quoting experience. We\u2019re seeing the better improvement in quotes coming through mobile devices and tablet devices. So this is really an early effort at leveraging supervised machine learning and we fully expect that our results will only get better from here. In addition to accurately classifying the business. We have a number of efforts under way to expand our capacity and increase the availability of our products to meet the needs of customers who are contacting us for their insurance needs. We\u2019re working with a strong carefully selected group of carriers and we\u2019re having working sessions on how we can potentially expand their appetite and improve our matching process. We\u2019re also identifying where we need additional carrier supply. And we\u2019re currently exploring additional capacity in the select business owner policy classes, workers compensation capacity, and excess and surplus lines, which should help us with contractor business where the demand is high. So in less than a year, we\u2019ve made significant investments in expanding the availability of our offerings and today, we can meet the needs of about 70% of customers who contact us. Now, the work that I\u2019ve described is all designed to improve what we refer to as quote yield. Quote yield is the measure of the number of customers that complete a quote and see a rate online. And the combination of improvements over the last year have resulted in a 2x improvement in our quote yield. That\u2019s a pretty dramatic improvement in successfully getting more customers through the quoting experience and match to the best carrier, based on the risk carrier appetite and the coverage\u2019s needed for their business. Finally, I wanted to highlight a significant step in improving sales and ultimately the efficiency of our direct operations. Our data and experience tells us that some customers get confidence from talking to a real person. But we also know that many customers don\u2019t ultimately pick up the phone to complete that purchase. So, in April, we launched an online buy option for select general liability business classes and the results are encouraging. Quotes that are offered an online buy option are quoting at 15% higher rate than those not offered an online buy option. So these results indicate that online quoters are comfortable executing their purchase digitally. And offering an online buy option gives us one more opportunity to meet the expectations of customers who prefer to shop online. To build on that success, in July, we introduced additional online buy capabilities for select professional liability business classes and we have plans for additional general liability business classes in the near future. Ultimately, we\u2019re working toward a fully digital experience with online buy options for all products. So with the investments that we continue to make to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we are confident that we will continue to grow our small business direct channel.  With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to John to wrap up with some of our efforts to expand our product offering. John Barbagallo : Thanks, Karen. Yes, this is actually a very exciting development for Commercial Lines and that\u2019s in May, we introduced our own manufactured business owners policy or BOP and we now have 144 independent agents trained and authorized to sell it. So again, BOP is a multi-line policy that provides business liability coverage and covers common property exposures that many small businesses would have. So we see this as a first step in a country wide roll-out of the product that will open up that $20 billion addressable market that Tricia mentioned in her opening, as well as begin to unlock an additional $12 billion addressable market for commercial auto that today is tied up in auto BOP bundles. I\u2019m going to tell you a little bit about the product and we will be updating you on results in the coming months. So our Commercial Lines strategy has always been to be low cost and easy to use. And similar to commercial auto, for BOP, we want to have a streamlined intuitive quote flow and we have competitive pricing derived from expense discipline and price segmentation. Now we chose to deploy our BOP product in the agency channel first and we\u2019re designing the product, systems and experiences to succeed with agents, while keeping an eye on the requirements for the digital channel. Reality is today this business is in the agency channel and agents continue to deliver real value on small business insurance. Initially, we have a limited \u2013 we have limited our underwriting appetite to the five categories you see depicted on the screen. These categories are big enough to matter, will allow us to develop pricing and segmentation skills, and will allow for that straightforward intuitive quoting and binding process. Those five categories account for about half of the 31 million small businesses in the United States with fewer than 20 employees, which is our target market. We\u2019ll expand those categories over time as we gain experience and identify additional opportunities to automate the quoting and underwriting flow. Now, this will be a competitive product. The coverage will be on par with anything available in the market. We\u2019ll be offering industry-specific endorsement packages and some really unique embedded endorsements to cover things like employment liability, cyber, equipment breakdown and E&O. Early market response to the product has been quite positive. And it would suggest we have really hit the mark on ease of use. Now keep in mind, ease of use is one of the things that really drives Progressive personal auto and commercial auto business in the agency channel is a key strategy that we think will work for BOP. Here, you can just see some of the quotes from our Ohio agents\u2019 experience with the product. It\u2019s consistent with the feedback we\u2019ve been receiving. So we\u2019re pleased with the level of quoting activity from our agents. The distribution of quotes across those five categories is generally in line with our expectations. Now there is a slight skew toward contractors, but that\u2019s not unexpected because contractors is a really, really strong category for Progressive on the commercial auto side, and it\u2019s actually a place we think we can begin to make headway capturing that bundled auto BOP business. We\u2019re going to be revising our rates in October as conversion is lower than we want it to be. Now our initial rates were built off an ISO base, but now we have live competitive quoting data in our hands, we think with just a few adjustments we can get the rates where we want to be, and we\u2019ll see conversion move up. One key metric for BOP is the quote start to finish ratio. And that is very high and in line with all our established products. So we really think we have the design right. We\u2019re excited to be in this business and we\u2019re excited to expand our addressable market. We feel good about where we are today and we look forward to adding three additional states by the end of the year. Beyond that, we expect to roll-out to be fairly aggressive in 2020 and 2021, but as with everything else we do, we will take a considered measured approach, and we\u2019ll be disciplined around our loss ratio targets and our business mix. So this is really all part of our broader vision to become consumers\u2019 and agents\u2019 number one choice and destination for auto, home and other insurance. And we\u2019re excited to have considerable under-penetrated addressable market out in front of us, where we have the people, skills and assets to win. Thank you for your time this afternoon. Now we\u2019re going to take a few minutes to set up for Q&A. Julia Hornack : Thanks, John. [Operator Instructions] So Bridget, can we please introduce our first participant from the conference call line? Operator : The first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Mr. Greenspan, your line is now open. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Good afternoon. My first question is just on the personal auto side of things. In the 10-Q, you guys make mention of a softening market place, which I know you had also mentioned last quarter and you allude to the fact that you\u2019re going to continue to take rate action. Can you just give us a sense, does that imply that you\u2019re going to take some rate clients from here as you look to maintain your growth levels in a softening market, if you could just give us a sense of what to expect from you guys on the rate side of things? Tricia Griffith : Absolutely, thanks, Elyse, before I answer that question, you\u2019ll notice that I have two Johns with me, because we had so much information on Commercial Lines, we thought it\u2019d be best to have John Barbagallo up here as well to answer any questions you have about what we presented today, really anything about Commercial Lines. So if you have a specific question on that, just make sure you say John Barbagallo or John B or John S, just wanted to clarify that. So yes, Elyse, we\u2019ve seen the market continues to soften, and so less shopping. And as usual we look channel by channel, state by state, segment by segment, to see opportunities where we believe we can either increase inversion due to the competitors\u2019 actions to grow rate. And with that we have taken several actual rate decreases. And we mentioned that as well. So we were going to do, like we\u2019ve done in the past though, because I don\u2019t want to overshoot, because there\u2019s a lot of unknown. So we really want to make sure that we continue to grow as fast as we can within our target margins. We\u2019ve enjoyed these really great margins, and we don\u2019t want to give those away unless we believe it converts. So we are very surgical in our approach. I think I mentioned last time Pat Callahan and his team did a soft market summit and we kind of went literally so deep to say what are ways we can win, what are places where conversion seems to be going really well. And let\u2019s not mess with that. So, yes, when we believe we will grow, we\u2019ll take rate action for that positive growth, but we won\u2019t just try to grow just to grow, because we want to make sure that our conversion. We know that the \u2013 marketing is working harder than ever, but we\u2019re still well within our allowable costs. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then my follow up I guess this is for John B, this is on some of the \u2013 when you were guys, we are talking about BOP and that you\u2019re going to need to revise some of your rates in October to try to see the conversion move up. I just want to get a sense of I guess how you maybe where you guys set the rates off a little bit to start and how we could think about the rate-setting as you roll out that product more widely across the country. John Barbagallo : Sure, Elyse. Again, we have no data of our own to price off, so we\u2019re using ISO data as a base, we are building in our assumptions about expense ratios at run rate and we have introduced some of our own segmentation using external data that we\u2019ve tested. So we have a good base, it wasn\u2019t really until we got into market and had some competitive quotes that we could start looking at to see where we were relative to the market. And we believe with just a few really minor modifications to our rate calculation, we\u2019re going to be right where we want to be long-term we think in a couple of ways. One, we believe at scale, we will have a better expense ratio than a lot of the people writing this business, we believe we will out execute on segmentation over time and we just think the breadth of our distribution and our marketing power is going to drive a lot of business our way. Tricia Griffith : Yes. And to add, we actually have a new marketing campaign coming out shortly that I think really tells the story well, with the small business and other products. Julia Hornack : Great, thanks. Bridget. Can you take the next caller from the line please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Mr. Peters, your line is open. Greg Peters : Good afternoon. My first question, in your letter, you spoke about rolling out a new property product. I think you call the product 4.0. Moreover, you talked about the results in your property business being affected by catastrophes. I\u2019m curious as you roll out this product and make adjustments, how do you think you\u2019re going to mitigate weather-related challenges going forward in your combined ratio results? Tricia Griffith : Yes, so we did roll out what we call Next-Gen 4.0. It\u2019s in two states now we\u2019ll plan on rolling it across the country. And that product really is much more aligned with what we\u2019ve done over the years with our auto product on the Personal Lines side, so much deeper segmentation, understanding deductibles in areas where \u2013 that are more hail prone, etc. And really our R&D teams are working lockstep together to understand how to more deeply have segmentation on the homes. So although we won\u2019t be able to prevent mother nature, we\u2019ll set some parameters within our product to be able to mitigate us some portion of the loss. Greg Peters : Great. My follow-up question would be on Slide 16, you talk about your accurate and efficient claims handling and you talk about your LAE ratio and you show a nice chart where your LAE ratio is trending down. Can you talk about some of the levers you\u2019ve used to lower your LAE expense ratio on top of just the growth in the business? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I can start with that and then I think you \u2013 specific to the commercial, if you want to add to the can and stuff . So yes, overall we have worked on our loss adjustment ratio for many, many years, making sure that we pay the accurate amount every time. We do in-depth training, especially during these years of high growth, we\u2019ve hired in advance of need to make sure we have in-depth training to really understand to get the right file to the right rep at the right time. We\u2019ve also centralized a lot of our claims organization to make sure that we have people to do similar activities over and over again. And so some of the slides that John B showed were really about the larger losses that happening in commercial and making sure that we have people that handle litigation files every day, large loss files every day, non-litigation files. So that really helps us with our efficiency to be able to get more throughput with the right people and the right leadership. John. Barbagallo: Yes. So, Greg, the chart you\u2019re referring to that LAE is strictly commercial auto LAE. And I guess a more pointed question might have been, hey, you\u2019ve doubled the business and it\u2019s kind of stayed the same instead of going down, but the point is we have actually made a lot of investment in commercial-specific capabilities over the last few years and the fact that it\u2019s kind of held level, while we\u2019ve dramatically increased our volume, one, I think it\u2019s a positive, and two, portends for much greater efficiency and accuracy, as we go forward. I feel really, really good about where we are on the claim side with commercial auto and I think you\u2019ll see us continue to win in the market, in part because of our claims organization, how efficient it is and the outcomes we get. Greg Peters : Thank you for your answers. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Greg. Julia Hornack : Thanks, Bridget. Can we take the next caller from the conference call line, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open, Mr. Zaremski. Mike Zaremski : Great. First question, can you give us an update on personal auto, bodily injury, inflation levels they stayed higher, we could see in the 10-Q and in the last quarter you, had mentioned it was coming from a specific number of states. And I think we were all trying to decipher whether this was a kind of Progressive-specific issue or an industry issue. Tricia Griffith : Absolutely, Mike. So, we started to see really in Q4 2018 both Progressive and industry having inflation BI. So, if you look at our results for the quarter specifically and incurred BI severity, it\u2019s up about 9 points. Take two of those points out for just strengthening of our reserves. And so, we see it at about 7 points. We\u2019ll be anxious to see the quarter two results for the industry. A couple of our competitors that have announced earnings for the second quarter, we\u2019re very much in line with them. So, a couple of things. We have continued to narrow down a handful of states specifically five states where we believe we have opportunity for some process improvements. We\u2019ve also kind of narrowed down what we\u2019re seeing in terms of increased specials. So, more attorney rep files, a little bit more surgeries, more injections, things like that. So, we\u2019ll keep an eye on that and I think that I think that will affect the whole industry but I obviously can\u2019t count assess that. In addition, we\u2019ve changed our mix of business with higher limits. So, with those higher limits, you\u2019re going to get the premium associated with those limits. So, we believe we\u2019re in a good place. Net-net, what I would say is frequency in BI is down, average written premium is up. We feel comfortable across the board with our loss cost, which in turn of course result in combined ratios lower than our targets. Mike Zaremski : Okay. And my last question is a little bit of a follow-up on Greg Peters\u2019s question on the expense ratio. If I recall correctly, over the last couple of years a couple of years ago, you guys came out with kind of an improvement in certain expense ratio targets. And I don\u2019t believe you met the target and one of the reasons was because you had decided that it was a good decision not to meet the target because you want to spend more on advertising. You are winning more. So just curious and then you got also a competitor recently, a major competitor come out and announce a major expense ratio improvement initiative that are taking place now. And so I know this is a long-winded question, but kind of curious, are there is there low-hanging fruit in the coming years to improve the expense ratio, and also if the competitive environment continues to increase, will the these are kind of a natural lever for the expense ratio maybe to tick down due to less advertising? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Yes, we look at expense ratio in two different ways. Overall expense ratio and non-acquisition expense ratio. So, when we are growing and when we believe we have sufficient spend in both agency commissions in our advertising, we will continue to spend because we\u2019ll continue to grow as long as we believe it\u2019s sufficient. What we look at on the claims side, we talked about loss adjustment expense. The rest of the house we talk about expense ratio or not acquisition expense ratio. And we always believe there\u2019s opportunity to be more efficient to understand how technology advancements will help us. So, I think I\u2019ve talked a couple of times about a cohort in the claim side a cohort of claims that we do from either video or photos that the insured send and those are really efficient. We\u2019re always looking at ways to learn new technology through that, same thing on the non-acquisition expense ratios. So, we\u2019ve rolled out many things in our CRM organization, whether it\u2019s chat through AI or natural language IVR, there is some things that we rolled out. So, our intentions are to continue to push down expenses and it\u2019s the balance of course of investing in things for the future like we\u2019ve done across the board with commercial lines and we\u2019ll continue to do. We know that one of our strategic pillars is competitive costs. We know that customers care a lot about that. So, we always want to be competitive in order to win when people are shopping for insurance, so that\u2019s expenses are something that are always on our mind, but we do bifurcate that with acquisition cost. Do you want to add anything? John Sauerland : Sure. You mentioned targets for expense ratio. We don\u2019t have a target for the overall expense ratio, as Tricia noted, to the extent we think we can advertise effectively and bring business in below our allowable costs, we\u2019re going to do that. And as you\u2019ve noted in the Q, advertising costs are up about 30% year-over-year. In the agent side, we know we have to pay a competitive commission to bring in the business. So, we focus on that non-acquisition expense ratio as Tricia noted, we have had internal targets for that ratio and bringing it down. We\u2019ve actually been hitting those targets. And for the Personal Lines business year-to-date that non-acquisition expense ratio continues to drop. We expect that the marketplace will continue to get even more competitive as you mentioned. So, it\u2019s our intention to continue to drive or we think of those infrastructure costs, those non-acquisition expense costs down. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Julia Hornack : [Operator Instructions] Bridget, can we take the next call, please? Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Mr Newsom, your line is open. Paul Newsome : Good afternoon and thanks for the call. This may be almost housekeeping question, where are the expenses that you\u2019re making in Commercial Lines running through? Is it all through the Commercial Lines segment, and are they material to the expense ratio, if they are in that segment? John Barbagallo : Yes. All expenses related to Commercial Lines activity, including all the investments we\u2019ve been making some of which you heard about today run through the P&L for the Commercial Lines. So, we need to in effect self-fund what we do and still achieve our overall combined ratio and expense ratio targets, if that\u2019s responsive to your question. Tricia Griffith : Yes, I think the only thing I would add is, they have they also have their own marketing budget. However, I\u2019m certain that they get some brand from the whole Progressive brand to help out as well. And that\u2019s something that we obviously attribute to each area of the Company, but everybody sort of gets it because our brand is so well known. Paul Newsome : And then, slightly different question, do you plan to use any level of reinsurance to cap some of the different risk that you are taking here in the commercial investment? John Barbagallo : Yes, we do, so I\u2019ll just talk a little bit about limits in retention. So, for the BOP product that I introduced today, we will have a maximum total insured value on any risk of $5 million. But our retention in any coverage group is capped at $1 million. So, we\u2019re using reinsurance to cap that exposure at $1 million per occurrence within each coverage group. So again, our target is small businesses with 20 or fewer employees or fewer than 20 employees, about 31 million of those in the United States. Those limits going up to a $5 million total insured value, TIV, is more than adequate for the vast majority of those businesses. And I think generally our limit distribution will be much below that, but we are capping at $1 million through the use of reinsurance. John Sauerland : Like you said, to the extent we are going into lines that we are less familiar with or coverage is, we are also having quota-share arrangements and at least in one line one-line coverage I believe we have 100% agreement. So, I think our intent and going in is not only to cap the maximum exposure, but also to provide competitive product while learning and getting our own experience while we do so. As John mentioned, we come into it without any of our own experience. And we are very intent on pricing accurately and segmenting really well. So, we have to gain our experience, but we\u2019re doing so to some degree with help from re-insurers. Tricia Griffith : I think John, both used the words we\u2019re going to be measured and disciplined because this is really exciting, but we\u2019re not just growing these addressable markets just to grow. We want to grow and we want to be profitable for sure. Julia Hornack : Great. I\u2019m actually going to take a question from the webcast, Bridget. So, if you could bear with me for a moment. So, this question and I\u2019m going to paraphrase a little bit. Can you discuss the role that service revenue and expense, of course, that\u2019s the other side of it, such as commission income will play an, Progressive\u2019s income model in the future? This item has been increasingly rapidly over the past couple of years. Do you see this continuing to increase, what is the margin on this revenue, etcetera? So, what role does that play in our future? Tricia Griffith : From a commission revenue perspective, we look at it differently depending on actually different types of agents in our books I referenced when I introduced Karen the platinum agency. So, those agents that are we they are broad across the board, but they have access to the Robinsons, auto, home bundles that we have, we\u2019ll pay them more on commission. If you have if you\u2019re a No-POP agent that writes a lot of non-standard, we\u2019ll pay a little bit less. So, on average, they\u2019ve been increasing a little bit but not extraordinary. We want to make sure, as we expand our footprint and become more and more preferred that we pay our agents commensurate to that. John Sauerland : You might be referring to the service revenue and expenses lines on our P&L. And if that\u2019s the case, they have been growing a lot. You\u2019re right, and that is predominantly because we are writing a lot more property with third-party companies direct to consumers. Obviously Progressive Home is a part of that offering as well. But we still have a stable of a number of other third-party property carriers that we write a good run of business with and a growing amount of business. So that commission is recognized as service revenue. Naturally, we have some costs associated with that. We have, I don\u2019t know how many, hundreds or maybe in approaching 1,000 people in the group that actually takes the phone call. So, homeowners we have what we call Home Quote Explorer which allows people to get rates and in a lot of circumstances buy online. That said, homeowners, is little more complex product than auto. So, we have more phone calls where consumers want to ensure that they\u2019re getting the right coverage and we close over the phone. So all of those costs flow into that service expense category and as you can see, there is a slight margin there, but by and large, the intent of that whole effort is to open up the Robinsons for us as a segment direct in this case, get those auto policies and retain those policies for decades. Julia Hornack : Great, thanks, Bridget. Can we take the next caller from the conference call line, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields, KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great, thanks. I think this is going to sound like a question about competitors, but I\u2019m really asking from the perspective of growth potential. We\u2019ve seen phenomenal growth in underwriting results within commercial auto at Progressive and most competitors seem to be struggling to catch up with worsening results. That\u2019s been the case for several years, and I\u2019m wondering in your view how much of the competitor challenge is because Progressive segmentation allows for picking the best accounts leaving them with sort of unintentional adverse selection. John Barbagallo : I don\u2019t know that I can quantify how much, certainly segmentation is a key strategy for us again I go back to just having a really intense focus on commercial and really kind of getting deep and granular in terms of how we analyze what\u2019s going on with the business and then having that will to react to what we\u2019re seeing. So, I think with some of our competitors \u2013 and I really can\u2019t speak for our competitors, commercial is thrown in with other commercial lines and they manage on an account level or portfolio level and that\u2019s really never been our approach. I think we definitely extract advantage there just by kind of moving faster in a more timely way. The market is not in great shape. Yes, our results continue to diverge from the overall market, but I would say the rate and magnitude of competitor rate activity is starting to slow a little bit. So, it\u2019s potentially getting a little bit healthier out there, but I would not say we\u2019re seeing the same softening that perhaps you\u2019re seeing on the personal side. Tricia Griffith : And I would say, from that perspective from John\u2019s team, when we need to react or when we needed to react back in 2016, we did swiftly and really, we\u2019re able to turn the corner, especially when we\u2019re thinking about annual policies. John Barbagallo : I will say Karen talked a lot about telematics. We really believe in the power of telematics and we think we have a significant lead in the commercial auto space there. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Somewhat unrelated question in the queue, you talked about business mix within commercial auto shifting to shorter PLE products and I\u2019m wondering if we connect what you\u2019re talking about today with that phenomenon? John Barbagallo : I think, yes, to the extent the business mix shift by BMT changes, yes, we\u2019re growing faster in some of the lower PLE categories. That\u2019s really all that is. And we\u2019re very happy with our truck growth, and as Karen shared with you earlier, we\u2019re ecstatic about our ability to start penetrating the preferred truck market. And that will actually improve PLE within that segment, although again that\u2019s still lower than what we see in business auto and some of the other areas. Meyer Shields : Great. Thank you. Julia Hornack : Great. I am actually going to take another question from the webcast. And it follows on actually well to the last question that Meyer just had. Paraphrasing a little bit again, but the question is really about adding bundled customers to the Commercial Lines and what that will do to the Commercial Lines segment\u2019s combined ratio as well as policy life expectancy. John Barbagallo : Sure. And I did talk a little bit about how having our own BOP and GL offer will at least give us access to that commercial auto that\u2019s bundled today, I would say at this time, we have less of an explicit bundling strategy in commercial. I mean, we\u2019re really focused on kind of getting BOP deployed getting it like, I think we have the product design right, getting rate levels right, improving segmentation and just winning in that category. But again, it will certainly improve our consideration for those more established businesses that do tend to bundle, and that will be higher PLE business at this point. I couldn\u2019t speculate what that will mean for loss ratio, but generally higher PLE business is a good thing for loss ratio. Hopefully that\u2019s responsive to your question. Tricia Griffith : Yes, I think we talked I talked a little bit about the opening about that being the Robinsons and that was sort of it was our approach when we went into homeowners just to make sure that we extended auto PLE and as we have more Robinsons they have the highest PLE. So, I would we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but I think... John Barbagallo : Well, one thing I would add is within our in-house agency and Karen talked about BQX, what we find is, there\u2019s a lot of what I would call bundling of a personal auto in a business insurance policy. And again, we\u2019re very focused on small businesses and about one in seven small businesses is actually home based. So, we actually think there\u2019s a lot of bundling opportunity there between personal and small business. John Sauerland : One more addition on that one, so the direct business in our commercial group is a little over 10% of the business and there we are working with third parties and have had experience bundling, we have actually seen some increased retention policy life expectancy for those customers who have more than one product with us. Obviously, the predominance of the commercial business in the US is sold through independent agents, and that is why we are now providing our own BOP and GL product to independent agents. So, I think we can take that same experience from our direct business replicated in an arena that is 85% or so of the marketplace and enjoy the benefits of both PLE and as John mentioned, and we would expect loss ratio as well. Tricia Griffith : We basically want more share of wallet in every household in America. Julia Hornack : I\u2019m actually going to take another question from the webcast. We\u2019ve got a bunch of good questions from longtime shareholders today. So, in light I\u2019m sorry, wrong one. Give me a moment, got it. In light of a somewhat softening pricing environment, what other steps are being taken to maintain the impressive and important gains in PLE? Tricia Griffith : Well again, we continue to make sure that we have and then John mentioned this John Sauerland mentioned this, available home whether it\u2019s Progressive Home or unaffiliated partners that we have been working with for a long time to make sure that we can have a conversion on every almost every policy that comes in, whether it\u2019s through our home quote explorer, whether it\u2019s through HQX or Progressive Home in the agency channel. And so, we continue to make sure that we make efforts around segmentation. Our advertising has been huge, our brand continues to get back, we have obviously everyone knows flow, but we have less reliance because we\u2019ve really, broaden the aperture of how we look at customers and what they need. And I think that\u2019s been really key, we have a very fine campaign coming up as well. I\u2019ll give you a hint, it\u2019s during NFL season, I won\u2019t give any more of that, but it\u2019s going to be really good as well as the new campaign we have in commercial lines. We\u2019re constantly getting new creative, you\u2019ve probably seen some of the commercials that don\u2019t have any superstore in it, which is what we call it the store the flows [indiscernible] you become your parents when you buy your first home. So, what we\u2019re noticing is we thought if we went in and advertise something that talked about home, it wouldn\u2019t increase our prospects on the auto and we were wrong, they absolutely do. So, we\u2019re seeing, because we have such an overall brand a lot in that perspective. And I think, lastly, we\u2019ve really look at all four of the strategic pillars that I\u2019ve talked about when I talk about our four cornerstones. So, we want to make sure we have competitive prices. So, we continue to look at how we can continue this segment across the board and how we can be competitive on LAE and NAER, and we talk about that obsessively. We talked about brand. We want to have broad coverage. We want to be we follow the customer where, when and how our customers want to shop in and be serviced. And I think lastly, and this is something that I wrote in the shareholders letter or the president\u2019s letter was we care a lot about our culture. We have 40,000 people here that are all marching to the same tune. We want to take care of our customers. We want to grow. We want to profitably grow and we do it all while we\u2019re following our core values. So, all those things together, it\u2019s not one thing and we talk about this all the time, not just in my team, but across the country. John Sauerland : And as we\u2019ve had softening market as portions of a couple of questions, maybe a few just some general commentary. The rates were dropping among competitors pretty markedly in the first quarter. I would characterize the second quarter as continuing decreases but far fewer of them and for less in terms of severity of the decreases. So, in aggregate even the industry and we are experiencing increased severity, but decreased frequency, but net loss costs are rising. So, rates can\u2019t keep dropping as loss costs keep rising and the industry continue to have acceptable combined ratio. So, we have seen some softening in the softening conditions, so to speak. It\u2019s still a difficult market for sure, but we think that trends over time will take us away from that. Julia Hornack : Thank you. Our next caller has been very patient as we go through the webcast questions. So, Bridget, can you please introduce the next caller. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Mr. Meredith, your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes, thank you. A couple of ones here for you. First, I\u2019m just curious, if I look at your commercial written premium growth that slowed down in the second quarter. You had this increase in the number of states, you have with Uber. Just curious why that happened, was there some the reinsurance you bought something happen? John Barbagallo : No, nothing like that. The Uber premiums tend to get recognized in big chunks in certain months of the year. So, it\u2019s kind of distorts the view a little bit. So that would have been in March. First quarter. And there is not a similar event in the second quarter. So, I think that\u2019s a little bit of what you\u2019re seeing. And for about four years, we grew at 20% compound rate. So, we have slowed a little from that, but we still have very, very robust growth on a much larger base, but yes, it is slowing somewhat. Brian Meredith : Great. And then I\u2019m just curious, as far as the severity, you guys are seeing on collision obviously you addressed it, you said it\u2019s a lot of its new technology in cars. Are you seeing in the rest of the industry react to that as far as new cars? I know it is often a challenging for insurance companies to when new car comes, a lot to understand all the options and stuff on and on. Is that something that you\u2019re able to kind of measure pretty quickly and pretty well, and maybe have an edge over everybody else? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with our competition in that aspect, but we look at that very carefully and we continue to hone in on our models to understand what type of ADAS equipment it has, do they have it on, what is the ultimate loss for those so we can, one, give the right discounts, two, understand the cost associated with those losses, whether it\u2019s more total losses or more components that cost more. So, I believe we have a good model that continues to get better and better. Brian Meredith : Great, thanks. Julia Hornack : Thank you. Alright. We have one more question from the webcast. Here we go. So, the question is really about deploying excess capital. Given Progressive\u2019s recent growth in profitability, could the company being more aggressive with share repurchase activities over the new few over the next few years? If not, what other ways would you look to deploy what seems to be a growing amount of excess capital? Tricia Griffith : Yes. We have, and we always talk about what we want to do with under-leveraged capital. And so really this past couple of years, we\u2019ve really wanted to make sure with the opportunities that we have to grow the company and continue to grow. And with that growth, obviously we have to make sure we have the right a capital adequacy. So, we\u2019ve got the 3 :1 premium-to-surplus that has grown as we have grown. We want contingent capital in case unforeseen events happen, and that continues to grow as we get bigger. So, we consider share repurchases when we think it makes sense. What we have been doing clearly is growing the company and we have so many opportunities that we feel are worthy of using capital in that aspect. Obviously, we changed our dividend program this year, and toward the end of the year, we\u2019ll be talking with the board and working toward what would be a variable dividend payable next year. And likely we will use some of the excess capital for that. Julia Hornack : Great. Well, that\u2019s actually the last question that I have in either queues. So, Bridget, can I hand it back over to you for the closing scripts? Operator : That concludes Progressive Corporation\u2019s second quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on Investor Relations section of Progressive\u2019s website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

These documents can be found via the Investors page of our website, progressive.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith. Tricia Griffith : Good afternoon, and welcome to Progressive's Third Quarter webcast. I feel like a broken record, but we continue to be really thrilled with our results. I started off my letter talking about having 15 consecutive quarters of net premium written over time. And so to me, at double-digits, I should say. And to us, that is really incredible. And I start thinking about not just growth in premium because, of course, that's very important, but it can be influenced by trends or a mix of business. I started thinking about what we also talk about that is growth in units. And so I looked back and realized that, we've had nine consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in auto policies for us. So to me, that's equally impressive. We continue to be bullish on where we've come from and where we're going, and that would be a lot of what we're going to talk about today. Andrew is going to focus on horizon 3. He's our new Chief Strategy Officer, and he'll talk about how we're thinking about the future. And then we'll have ample time for Q&A with John Sauerland and myself. So thank you for being in attendance. You're all familiar with this construct. We call it the 3 Horizons based on McKinsey's 3 Horizons. Today, I'm not going to talk about horizon 3 because Andrew will cover that. He'll also cover a little bit of horizon 2. But as you recall in the last webcast, John Barbagallo and Karen Bailo gave a really deep dive to all the exciting things we're doing in horizon 2, including small business, our BOP coverage, TNC, fleet, Smart Haul, just to name a few. We have a plethora of things that we've invested in a couple of years ago, they're really coming to fruition now, and we're very excited about that. But it doesn't mean that we won't stop thinking about more opportunities in horizon 2, we absolutely will. And we'll make sure that we capitalize on our brand, our acumen in terms of analytics, our segmentation strategy. But probably more importantly, once we get those plans together, the ability for 40,000 Progressive people to execute on those plans. Speaking of execute, that's what we call horizon 1. And we've really -- for the vast majority of progressive people over this last couple of years, really want everyone to focus on executing horizon 2. Think of auto and home, bundled, monoline, but taking growth, increasing our market share. It's been something that we're surgically focused on because it can get exciting to think about the horizon 2 and horizon 3 opportunities, and they are, but we have so much to gain here, and I believe our strategy has worked incredibly. For the next few slides, I'm going to show our net premium written growth over 10-year period with the exception of our property. I'll show that from 2015 when we took over a controlling interest in ASI. We will look at that, and then we'll look at our combined ratio, the orange line, compared to the industry, the gray line. So as you can see, this is auto for the last 10 years. We've had incredible growth, especially over the last four or five years. In fact, in the last 10 years, we have grown premium $15.4 billion, and that's over 130% increase.  And probably more importantly is that we've had a delta, on average, of 8 CR points lower than the industry. That to me is really incredible, especially as we've been growing at such a fast rate. On the commercial side, same story, huge growth, especially in the last several years. In fact, we've grown over 150% and $2.7 billion in premium. More impressively is the fact that the difference on average of the CR between us and the industry is a full 18 points. That is incredible, and that has led us to really understand the segmentation in this industry and continue to invest in horizon 2. Our property, our home has grown substantially as well as we've kind of expanded across the country. We're about in lockstep with the industry. But that's not satisfactory to us because we want to have every product to make money. We don't subsidize per products. So we will take and have been taking the time to roll out our next product model, continue to increase rates, have some underwriting restrictions and have some coverage changes to make sure that we try to set expectations for next year to be within our target profit margin. But again, looking at these over time, we continue to be impressed with our ability to grow and grow profitably, especially compared to our peers. The combined success of our insurance products and our investment income has really made a strong ROE, as you can see from these slides. So what you're looking at here is, the blue bar is Progressive, the orange bar is the S&P 500 P&C index and the gray bar is the S&P 500. And as you can see, over a 10- and 20-year period, we have substantially outperformed all the index and the S&P, and that's really impressive. So we continue to be thrilled with those results. In fact, over the last five years, we've returned 55% of net income to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  As a reminder, how you think about equity or capital, I should say, as you think about capital, we want to make sure we invest in expanding the business as long as the long term, it reaches our financial policies. Under-leveraged capital, we return to shareholders. And we want to expect -- we expect a return on equity in excess of its cost. The importance of net income, EPS and ROE is never lost on us. But we view achieving long-term performance of these measures is stemming from our consistent focus on the primary elements of our business model. And that's, very clearly, grow as fast as we can at a 96. We have done this since we went public in 1971, so nearly 50 years. You can see from the data on the chart that, that formula works, and we'll continue with that. So now I'd like to introduce you to Andrew Quigg, our Chief Strategy Officer. You've probably seen him on this stage a few times over the years, a little background on Andrew. He has a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics from Yale and an MBA from Harvard. He came to Progressive in 2007 as a Product Manager in the Agency, a division. And he's done a couple of states as a Product Manager in both agency and direct channel. After that, he ran our direct media business. And more recently, he was a General Manager of our customer experience organization in the CRM, and really focusing on retention. He's done a great job there. Last year, we named him our first ever Chief Strategy Officer. And so he's here today to talk about Horizon 3. Andrew? Andrew Quigg : Thank you, Tricia. Today, I have the pleasure of sharing some additional details around Progressive's growth strategy. For our agenda, I'll first walk through our four strategy pillars and provide more details on the growth strategy framework, which Tricia discussed earlier. In this area, I'll underscore the mission of the strategy group, which I lead. Second, we'll discuss the important balance we are striking between being aggressive with the opportunities available to the company and our long history of using capital prudently. Finally will be our high level framework for evaluating the Horizon 3 areas of opportunity. So let's get going with Progressive's business strategy. Executives, investors and analysts, all discuss company strategy, but it can take on a variety of meetings and approaches depending on the context. Definitions for the word strategy generally fall in two realms. Broadly, strategy can be any plan. Narrowly, strategy can be known as a plan for military action. But neither of these really correspond to strategy in the context we're discussing today. I feel the topic was well examined in a Harvard business review article from 1996 by Michael Porter, appropriately titled, what is strategy? In this article, Professor Porter asserts that differences in performance between companies is the result of the many, many activities that companies undertake. A company can outperform its rivals if it executes similar activities better. This is operational effectiveness. An example of this is segmentation. Every auto insurer segments their pool of risks. A company can also outperform if they choose different activities than rivals.  This is strategic positioning, a historical example for Progressive has been Snapshot. Progressive uniquely invested in Telematics starting in 1998 and continues to differentiate ourselves in this space today. Professor Porter also argues that operational effectiveness is necessary, but not sufficient over the long run for outstanding performance. This is due to the rapid diffusion of best practices through talent movement, consultants and benchmarking. Instead Porter and many academics believe that choosing different activities is the basis for prolonged differentiation in performance. In particular, Porter detailed a method of looking at the activities of the firm and how they reinforce the strategy, the activity map.  Strategic positions are strongest for firms where the activity map demonstrates a high degree of fit and internal consistency. On the screen is the activity map for Southwest Airlines in 1996 from the Porter paper. Each circle represents a strategic position of Southwest that was different than at least some of their competition. As a low cost carrier, activities like automatic ticketing machines and quick gate turnarounds were important to keeping costs in check. However, not all of the activities were low cost if viewed in isolation. Southwest pay their employees more than others, recognizing high quality employees would help keep asset utilization high. With that background, let's turn to Progressive's business strategy. We have four general strategy pillars at Progressive. People and culture, competitive prices, broad needs and leading brand. Our core values, purpose and vision also sit at the middle of these strategy pillars as a unifying focal point. Progressive has provided webcast over the years to our investors outlining additional aspects of our organization. The webcast provide a good overview of the additional activities and the fit of Progressive's activities. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2017, marketing and acquisition leaders discussed our leading brand and the supporting marketing tactics and innovations. In the first quarter of 2018, and our business unit controllers discussed operational efficiency from many different lenses, including how technology and automation play a role in reducing our expense ratio. In the second quarter of 2018, CRM President, John Murphy; and CIO, Steve Broz, outlined investments in relationships with our customers as we continue to refine our customer-centric approach. In the third quarter of 2018, Personal Lines President, Pat Callahan, demonstrated how the speed of innovation and product development creates a competitive moat. In the fourth quarter of 2018, our CHRO, Lori Niederst, outlined how our people and culture creates sustainable competitive advantage for the company. And finally, in the first quarter of 2019, our portfolio managers, Rich Madigan and Jonathan Bauer, discussed how our investment approach supports our strategy pillar of competitive prices. The choices we make in these interlocking activities represent our unique strategic position, which is not as simple as low cost or focused on one segment. In my role, I have the fortune of interacting with external advisers, consultants and partners. Each of them views Progressive differently and believes that some aspect of this activity map is the most important. I know I speak for the entire executive team when I say that it is truly the internal consistency of all these activities that makes Progressive special. It is extremely hard to duplicate the success of Progressive by replicating one bubble without the full tapestry. Along the bottom of this page are parts of our strategy that have emerged over the past decade and a half. Broads needs, in particular, became more pronounced as we entered into the destination era. We want to solve the broad needs of our customers over their lifetimes. This requires us to investigate the needs of our customers and adjacent areas where we can serve them. Broad needs also provides Progressive with an avenue for diversification as we look to disrupt other products and as we monitor changes in the mobility environment. Tricia articulated this investigation of new products and services in Progressive growth strategy utilizing 3 horizons. We think of horizon 1 as executing on our current core products within property and casualty insurance. On the right-hand side, you can see that the market share we currently have today, only 8% of Personal Lines and 2% of Commercial Lines. We are fortunate to have ample headroom to grow. Horizon 2 includes expanding to adjacencies within property and casualty insurance. And beyond horizon 2, horizon 3 represents an opportunity to explore close-end opportunities to leverage our core competencies. We think of this area as generally being outside of property and casualty insurance. As an example of horizon 2, we have Commercial Lines. In August, John Barbagallo and Karen Bailo discussed how commercial -- the Commercial Lines business is expanding their addressable market from $14 billion to more than $50 billion. On the right-hand side are the efforts underway in Commercial Lines. Some of these reflect improvements in our core Commercial Auto product, but a large part of the expansion is from new products, general liability and BOP that are horizon 2 initiatives within Commercial Lines. For horizon 3, the executive team decided to invest in a small group, the Progressive strategy group, to focus on horizon 3 in order to keep the vast majority of Progressive employees and resources focused on horizons 1 and 2. The vision for the strategy group is building and enduring Progressive for future generations, always growing. Our mission is to create lasting value by leading and establishing businesses beyond the core and supporting expansion of our property and casualty business. With that introduction to Progressive's strategy overall and the strategy group's mission within this, I'd like to turn to the important balance we are attempting to achieve in horizon 3. We have enormous growth potential as a company as we increase scope. We saw this play out in our acquisition of ASI, now Progressive Home, where we generated revenue synergies and leveraged our data footprint. On the revenue synergy side, you have heard over the past few years, how we've created additional opportunities to sell the Progressive Home product. This included expanding their state footprint from 27 to 44 states, adding thousands of agent groups and establishing the Platinum program. And finally, investing in direct sales through our Progressive Advantage Agency, adding an online quote-and-buy process and adding analytical triggers for our customers. In total, the impact is impressive as you can see on the right-hand side of this page. As we abstract away from this example, our base of customers help us generate revenue synergies from new efforts. As a reminder, we have existing relationships with about 15% of U.S. households and hundreds of thousands of small businesses. Our proven ability to extend relationships is the first component of our growth value as a company. Possibly even more important is our data footprint. As an example, on the screen, we have two auto policy attributes and their impact on homeowners loss cost. We continue to find that auto behaviors are predictive of homeowners losses. In general, we see product upgrades at Progressive Home, including auto, methods and variables, are much more powerful than using isolated product information. To build on this further, we have historically seen our data footprint is driving data. What we found with Progressive Home is that we have responsibility data. Our data seems to be predictive of a number of behaviors. And our data footprint is larger than just our current insurance. We believe we have data on about 30% of U.S. households. When we combine our quote data, active customers and recently expired policies. This is the second facet of our growth potential as a company. If we go back to our activity map, we can see that to execute on the Progressive Home synergies, we were able to leverage the entire network of activities and by reinforcing new activities, an ability to market additional protection to our customers and to leverage responsibility data for broad needs. While growth potential is exciting to consider, we are very cognizant of the fact that we have a historic reputation for being prudent stewards of capital. Progressive has an excellent reputation for efficiently generating returns for our shareholders and returning capital. Our comprehensive ROE since 2010 has been consistently high, especially in the past few years, and we have returned these earnings to shareholders at a high rate. More than 50% of comprehensive income is returned to our shareholders. This reputation has provided the company with a solid valuation and low cost of capital. Continuing to add to these high returns is a daunting task that is ever-present in my mind. It is our goal that these additional business lines will add to these impressive results while growing the company. We also know that diversification is inherently risky. As an example, Bain has produced some insightful research on growth diversification. Let me describe this chart. Along the left-hand side are different dimensions by which a new business can be judged. The dimensions are the 5 Cs : customers, costs, channels, capabilities and competitors. As the new business shares less and less of these aspects, they are defined as being further steps away from the core. Bain finds that each step away reduces the probability of success by about 60%. This work, and others like it has caused us to isolate certain factors like customers, channels and capabilities, as we think about new products and services. To summarize, we see both immense opportunities for Progressive, and we'll continue to balance these with a sober perspective of the challenges. With that background, I'd now like to spend some time explaining how we will identify and execute on horizon 3 ideas. We think about high potential ideas in three ways. First is market attractiveness. We want to invest in horizon 3 businesses, where the overall market makes it more likely that we'll have success growing. We look at a number of factors here. Trends, we track a number of trends and have a subset of macro trends, which we believe will impact our industry and adjacent industries. Market metrics, factors such as size, profitability and market concentration, can be observed and evaluated for industries. Market dynamics, like Porter's five forces provide greater insights into the power structure of value chains. Next, we look at Progressive's ability to win. For any possible area, there needs to be a fit with Progressive. Here, we examine the fit with our strategic pillars and our activity map. We look at assets that we could leverage like relationships and data. Finally, we consider the proximity to our core and the likelihood of success. In the intersection of these two areas, we also need to find an unmet consumer need. These horizon 3 potential opportunities appear at the top of our horizon 3 process. Our strategy process team, led by Navin Verma, generates and researches these opportunities. Once we have an area of interest and a consumer need, we have two approaches to execute that are not mutually exclusive. We have formed a corporate development team under Erwin Raeth to investigate external organizations that fulfill our ideas. We also have an internal growth incubator, led by Azadeh Hardiman to build new businesses. We believe building has a longer timeline, but with lower risk. We're doing a pause for a moment on corporate development, given that Progressive has not traditionally been an acquisitive company.  We still believe that this will be a rare event. Beyond acquisitions, the corporate development team has two additional methods to engage with companies, strategic alliances and strategic investments. Progressive has a long history of alliances through Progressive Advantage. On the screen, you can see 15 Progressive Advantage relationships that stretch across many products. We continue to believe that our Progressive Advantage organization is a well suited path to meet the needs of our customers and provide income without capital requirements. An example of a successful horizon 3 product is life insurance, specifically, term life insurance. On the left-hand side, you can see our view of the market attractiveness.  It has medium to low attractiveness from a market perspective. However, Progressive's ability to win is higher, given that it is approximate to our core and could leverage our pillars and assets. We also find, in our research, that many families go unprotected due to a complex research and purchase process. In addition, based on our brand, customers have told us, they can see us offering the product more than other leading brands. Finally, we've been able to work with a carrier to distribute life insurance products and have increased sales by about 10 times over the past eight years. In addition to protecting consumers, Progressive has generated millions in commissions and materially increased retention for bundled customers on our core auto product. In addition to strategic alliances, we leverage strategic investments in the corporate development group. As you may have noticed in our quarterly and annual reporting, we do own a small amount of nonredeemable, preferred securities in private companies. Today, these preferred securities represent strategic investments from Progressive. On the screen, you can see two of our representative investments so far in Upstart, our personal loans partner, and KeepTruckin, our commercial EBI partner. Strategic investments allow Progressive to better understand industry dynamics where Progressive has interest and better strategically and economically align with key partners. My purpose today was to keep you apprised of our investments, approach and progress in horizon 3. I hope the past 20 minutes have been helpful in providing this context. As we reach material milestones in this exploration, we'll certainly provide additional updates. To recap our conversation, we believe that we have a robust strategic position that has been underscored by previous investor presentations. We have generated impressive revenue and data synergies with Progressive Home and believe this will continue as we consider additional products and businesses. We balance this with a recognition that growth beyond the core is challenging, and we will continue to be prudent with our capital. Finally, we have our framework to evaluate opportunities and make them actionable, both through external and internal approaches.  I'll now turn it back over to Tricia and John Sauerland for Q&A. A - Julia Hornack : [Operator Instructions] Before we get started with questions from the conference call line, Tricia, I have received quite a few questions about the change in dividend policy we announced in December of 2018. So why don't you start with a little bit of that history and the reasons for that change. Tricia Griffith : Absolutely, so the Board terminated the dividend policy that we had for many years in December of last year. Let me give you a little bit of background. So in 2007, we initiated a very formulaic variable dividend policy. And what we -- the three items we looked at, one was a full year after-tax underwriting profit. We multiplied that by our internal gain share factor. And that is a factor we used -- then we looked in growth and profitability across the board. And it is for our employee bonus that it's on a range from 0 to 2.0. And then Board would decide a percentage on that. So it would be the after-tax underwriting profit times the factor, times at that point 20% divided by the number of shares. And that's how we came up with the very formulaic dividend policy.  We made a tweak in 2008 and we said that if comprehensive income was less than the after-tax underwriting profit, there would not be a dividend. And that was, although, just kind of a nuance was very important because in 2009, after the financial crisis, we did not pay a dividend. So it was kind of a prudent change to the dividend policy. 2010, the only change we made was we raised the percentage from 20% to 25%. And then in 2011, we raised it to 33.3% and that stayed the same until the end. We have done a couple of extraordinary dividends. In addition, in 2010, '12 and '13, and we gave $1 per share or an extraordinary dividend in top of the variable dividend. So as we started really growing in earnest around 2016 and going to the debt market occasionally because we needed capital because how fast we were growing.  We started thinking about, does this still work? And the logic around it was that our shareholders would kind of be in lockstep with our employees. And that does work on a calendar year basis, but when we think of shareholders, we really want to think of how are we creating this enduring business? And does it always make sense, to have -- when we have a lot of capital, to give it back or when we need capital to give it back. And it didn't -- it really wasn't aligned. So we took a look, and we said we really want something that was a little bit more flexible. And so we spoke with the Board about it. They terminated the dividend as we know it in December of 2018. And for us, this really allows us some flexibility. And its flexibility if we need capital, its flexibility, if there's some opportunistic event that we might want in horizon 2, horizon 3, and so this is the first year. As you know, on a quarterly basis, we -- shareholders earn a $0.10 per common share. And then in the fourth quarter, the Board will discuss any variable dividend and that will be payable in first quarter 2020. We did a Q&A in December, I think -- I believe, in December of 2018, and that was -- that's on our investor website under stock and the dividend policy. So we did a bunch of Q&As, if you want a little bit deeper dive into that. But that really is the history of our dividend policy. It's evolved as we have evolved, but I think it's been nice -- it will be nice, continue to have some flexibility given our current state of thinking about so many growth opportunities in the future. John, do you want to add anything to that? John Sauerland : Sure. The trigger around comprehensive income being greater than after-tax underwriting income, certainly, it was instrumental in 2009. In 2018, however, it was potentially an issue for us in that investment income was very low. And you may recall, it was a material sell-off in December, underwriting income was robust. Around a 90 combined ratio, growing 20%, but comprehensive income was very close to becoming less than after-tax underwriting income. And so we are in a place where we were potentially not going to pay any variable dividend or potentially pay what we ultimately paid, which was about $1.5 billion. And we think that sort of binary trigger there isn't optimal, either for the company or management or shareholders. So I think that's another benefit of moving away from the previous approach to the variable dividend. Obviously, the dividend is part of a capital management plan. We've been fairly transparent in our capital management philosophy. Obviously, we have capital requirements from a regulatory perspective, 3:1-ish for auto, about half of that for property. On top of that, we can carry a contingent capital layer, both of those, generally speaking, grow as we grow. So we have additional needs for capital. That said, at this point, we are in a very good position from a capital perspective, and we will continue to follow the path we have, as Tricia noted earlier, around returning under-leveraged capital to shareholders in the form of dividends or deploying them in share buybacks. So I guess, in aggregate, as Andrew noted, I think our financial stewardship has been good over the years. We have, as Tricia showed, achieved fairly impressive returns on our equity and it is certainly our aspiration and intent to continue to do so. Julia Hornack : Great. So Chris, can you please introduce the first caller from the conference call line? Operator : The first question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar at Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : I had a couple of questions. First, we did see a moderation in auto severity this quarter. And at the same time, a little less favorable frequency. Could you maybe talk about both of these shifts and what you see as underlying causes for those? Tricia Griffith : So are you referring to collision, in particular? Yaron Kinar : I'm referring to -- I think it was even more broad than that. I think it was overall severity and overall frequency. Tricia Griffith : Yes, the frequency, overall, was a little bit less, more in the 2% range. And severity is a little bit up. We look at it differently in collision versus PD. So collision was -- the severity was less than in prior quarters. And there could be a lot of reasons, but we believe our mix of business is changing from a preferred perspective. But on the severity front, we know that it is costing more to fix cars and the components of the vehicles continue to be more expensive. And so we relate a lot of severity to that in total losses, but the frequency is still in the range. It's a little bit less -- I mean, the frequency, the frequency is a little bit less. And that, of course, is really hard to predict. That can go up and down, but we don't see anything systemic. Yaron Kinar : I thought that property damage already actually came in, in the quarter. Tricia Griffith : The property damage -- may you repeat that? Yaron Kinar : That property damage severity came in this quarter. Tricia Griffith : Yes. John Sauerland : Yes. I would sort of characterize it. So a point or two, quarter versus year, we don't normally view that as a material trend. It's tough to project as it is. But if it's 6% severity change for the quarter, 7.4%, year-to-date. We consider that to be a similar severity trend. And from what we can see, our severity trends are fairly consistent with those of our competitors. We obviously don't have full transparency there, but we have pretty good insight, and we think severity is in the 6% to 7-ish percent range right now. Frequency, down 2% to 3%. And that's generally speaking, what we are thinking going forward as well. Yaron Kinar : Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is around the agency new application conversion rates this quarter. Seem to be a significant decline there. Could you maybe talk about what drove that? Tricia Griffith : Well, I think there's -- we've talked a little bit about a soft market, and there's less shopping when people's rates aren't changing. And so if you look over the last couple of quarters, there's been either rate decreases or less increases, so less shopping. And so as we've talked about in the past, we continue to advertise, and that affects both our agency and direct to make sure that we grow and the growth is slowing a little bit. We believe our conversion is still solid based on when people do shop, we have a competitive rate. But yes, we definitely have seen a slowing down because there's either been rate decreases or less increases. And I think we'll have to see if that changes are not based on what we're hearing from the industry, as you just talked about, from severity. John Sauerland : Just to add that... Sorry. Yaron Kinar : I just would have thought that the lower rates would have driven lower new applications but not necessarily decrease the conversion rate of these new applications. Tricia Griffith : Well, yes. Well, good version is usually based on -- is the rate. When you do shop, is it the right way for you and some people, if it's not significant, it won't convert. John Sauerland : On a year-over-year basis, actually in both the agency and the direct channel, conversion has been up. And it's been sort of a highlight of our product model introductions. And I would also add that its conversions has been improving in segments that we're targeting. So we're targeting more and more preferred customers, especially in the agency channel. We've seen nice shifts up and preferred characteristics of the business we're writing, and that's predominantly driven by the new product models and the conversion that is driven by those models and that we're getting more competitive by introducing factors for the preferred end of the segment that are more competitive. Tricia Griffith : Yes, I think the only one we haven't -- where we haven't grown new apps on the agency channel with an inconsistently insured, which we call Sams. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom at Dowling & Partners. Gary Ransom : Tricia, you mentioned in your letter on Snapshot, you said that your program encourages customers to improve their driving behavior. That's a little bit different from what I've heard over the last several quarters of measuring for pricing, using Snapshot to measure pricing as opposed to changing behavior. Is there something behind that message that you're doing differently, either in your newer distracted driving measurements or in something else? Tricia Griffith : No. Not necessarily. I mean, we use that, obviously, as our most predictive variable, but we also do want to encourage people to understand when, from a distracted driving perspective, as an example, when they are using their telephone, hands free, not hands free, et cetera, mostly for the safety of every other drivers. So we've always cared about it, and we've tested different things, whether it's beeps, start giving you the information right away. It's still -- it's mainly used as a variable. But obviously, we want to give the best drivers, the biggest discounts. And so both of those things important, it's understanding our rate to risk as well as of helping people to drive better. Gary Ransom : Do you have any intention of changing your -- the Snapshot concept of you just measure for 6 months, and you're done and make it continuous? Tricia Griffith : You know what, we're actually -- we talk about that a lot, and that might make more sense on the mobile device versus the dongle we have right now. So we're always talking about that. And I'm always talking about different ways with which to use that data, whether it be for claims, et cetera. So we're always kind of in discussion around that. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Amit Kumar : I wanted to go back to Yaron's question on loss cost trends and maybe build on that. If you look at the frequency and severity data by quarter, it has been stable. But in the queue, you talk about additional pricing actions. So all those being equal wire, why not would that translate into additional margin pressure from here as we head into 2020? Tricia Griffith : Well, I think that depends on each one of our products. Obviously, I talked about property, and we're seeing some high loss cost on property. So of course, that affects trends. So our focus right now is to get into that profitability and expand our products and our segmentation skills and make some underwriting changes. But I think what we will look at is the continued severity trends, understand those where we feel like we're in a really good position as we haven't, in certain areas, where we've thought that small decreases would increase conversion. We've done that. But we haven't done it to the extent that some of our competitors have.  So as things change, we believe we'll have to -- our rates would have to change substantially. And we've always talked about that with our customers because we know our customers want to have stable rates. And so when we think about increasing rates substantially or decreasing rates substantially, for that matter, we try to make them stable. So that it will be less sort of a topsy-turvy. But we'll follow the trends. And we will, as we've said in the past, take small bites of the apple. We've always said if we increase rates, we want to be out ahead of it and understand 1 -- 3:1 is better than 1 :3, we used to say, to take small, small bites, so customers stay with us because another big part of, obviously, our growth strategy is retention. Amit Kumar : Got it. The only other question I have is on commercial auto. In the queue, you talk about the change in loss cost trend. You talked about the shift in the mix of business towards for higher tracking as one piece. Intuitively, as the book pivots and other pieces versus a monoline book grows, would that translate into a higher initial loss pick as we get into 2020? Tricia Griffith : I wouldn't take 1 quarter or 1 month of commercial to be -- to something -- we feel like it's not a very alarming trend. In fact, if you look at our year-to-date, we're in the high 80s. So we feel very comfortable with that. And in fact, if you look at accident year, it's even better, about 2 points better. So what we do, again, we surgically look at every BMT, every state, new and renewal, and we watch that closely. We take rate when we need it. As evidenced by -- if you remember, back in 2016, Commercial popped up a bit, and we reacted quickly and got back in the track. So we watch new business. We watch our renewal business. We watch our competition. You saw the delta we had in the combined ratio on Commercial Auto in comparison to the industry. So we are on that very aggressively all the time as we see something change because a lot of this could be affected by macroeconomic trends, we are on that. So if we see loss cost on a certain BMT go up, and we believe that trend is going to continue, we will be on that with rates or changes or underwriting restrictions. John Sauerland : I would just clarify that our loss ratios are always bottom-up. They're not top-down. So you mentioned a loss ratio pick going into the next year. That's not how we reserve. So we actually have average reserves for losses that adjustors set below a threshold. And above that, we use the adjustor's estimate for the loss. We also have inflation factors that apply to other losses in the average layer over time so that if we think generally, severity trend is X, we are baking that in over the course of the year. So we then -- when we actually incur claims and add that to our IBNR, that's how we derive our loss ratio. We are seeing more large losses. And as I'm sure you noted, and Tricia alluded to, we did take a reserve change on commercial lines. In September to reflect those trends. But again, we don't go into the year with a loss pick and then develop that, we take a bottom-up approach. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Mike Zaremski : This is actually Charlie on for Mike. First question, one of your competitors recently announced initiatives that cut its expense ratio. Do you feel your expense ratio or loss adjustment expense ratio can fall in the coming years based on any specific initiatives that you are undertaking? Tricia Griffith : We always look to have competitive prices. When you think about -- what Andrew went over, sort of our cornerstones and our pillars, it's really important for us to have competitive prices. So we constantly look for ways to be efficient. And there's a few things that we've talked about in the past. When you think of LAE, we talk about just gain efficiencies through more estimates that -- we can do through photos, making it efficient and customers are happy with that. That works as long as there's no supplements, et cetera, but we've continued to work our way into having a higher percentage of losses settled in this way.  We continue to use our technology to get out in front of that. In terms of expense ratio, we talk about that all the time and my team, we're headed into our objectives for 2020. And we're talking about how we think about both expense ratio and LAE and have a goal to reduce that over the years. I talked about that a few years ago where we wanted to get down to a certain percentage. We continually do that. Of course, you don't want to do it, as an example, with claims, there's that balance of having the right amount of people, the right amount of talent because you could reduce your LAE substantially. But if it increases your indemnity, then it's not worth it. So we look at that all the time. It's really about people. It's about making sure that people have the right technology, and we've obviously used some things on the CRM side with AI to make sure that when our customers call in for really simple needs.  We don't necessarily have to have a person on the end of the line. That, of course, makes sense, and it's easier for the customer. And helps with expenses. But yes, that's a big part of it. We know price is big. We know that we have to be competitive, and we will continually try to make sure we do the right thing, but we reduced our expenses across the board. Our non-acquisition expense ratio, I should say, on the other side, because we -- in terms of advertising, we'll spend as much as we think we should to make sure that we have efficient use of our media. And if our level costs are too high, then we won't. But we've been really happy about increasing our media spend. So we look at that a little bit differently. We look at non-acquisition expense ratio. Mike Zaremski : Got it. And then can you update us on the take-up rate for Snapshot? And what percentage of users stay on the program after the initial period? And whether there's been any changes in that rate recently? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think the -- well, the take rate on the direct side is much higher. And probably, I think, around 40%? John Sauerland : 40%. Tricia Griffith : 40%, it's single-digits on the agency side, we continue to work with our agency workforce to, kind of, to understand that. We would say, at any given time right now, our policies enforced, someone's been on the Snapshot program at some time, about 15% of our policy enforced would say that. So we're really trying to make sure people understand the discount, understand what we're looking for. A lot of people, it's just -- it's that they don't want to do it because of big brother. I think it's sometimes hard to explain from the agency side, partly because we give a participation discount.  But when we have the data, we make sure that you can get either a 20% decrease, which is great, or you could get a 20% surcharge. And so I think some people that try it may know that they're not going to get the discount and that won't work out for them. But we think it's -- we think it's, obviously, a great rating variable. We think it's a great for society because hopefully, you do change your habits. But the take rate has been pretty stable, but much higher on the direct side. John Sauerland : I would take the opportunity to add that In the commercial space, we now have an analogous offering we call Smart Haul, and our commercial business is still largely -- by far and away, largely agency based. And the take rate for the commercial business for Smart Haul has been far more promising than it has in the Snapchat side for the Personal Auto. There we are working with our agents to target the four higher transportation segment. So I think interstate trucking, those premiums are fairly substantial. So if you can offer a customer a material discount, and they're an independent operator many times. It's a material consideration for them because that's a business cost. And we're seeing great -- as in the last quarter, I had John Barbagallo share our commercialized precedent, along with Karen Bailo, shared some of the results from that program, which are very promising. Loss ratio is very predictive from the information that comes from the electronic logging devices. And we're providing, as I mentioned, significant discounts as well as, surcharges. But even -- given that, our loss ratio line, if you will, is still fairly steep. So we think there's tremendous continuing potential with our Smart Haul program in Commercial lines. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Greg Peters at Raymond James. Greg Peters : In your comments, you mentioned the capital requirements for your property business being about half that for auto. And I'm curious if that changes your expectations about underlying combined ratios or combined ratio targets. And in your letter, you also introduced the ASL agreement. And I was wondering if you could provide color on that. Tricia Griffith : Yes. No, I think that capital requirements are really from a regulatory perspective to make sure that we have the right amount in case of losses. And then I think John referenced briefly, when we talked about the dividend policy, we also have a self-imposed contingency layer in case things happen, should it be a big catastrophe or whatever. So our capital requirements won't change based on that. Our reinsurance does in terms of us understanding the ultimate loss costs. So we went into the ASL a couple of years ago. And basically, we wanted it help us. It doesn't prevent going over 100 clearly, but we wanted to kind of lessen the downside depending on if we have not just name storms because now that's part of the ASL, but it used to be 63 LAE and non-storm or liability. It's really just another protection factor besides our name storms, our 1 in 100 years name storms. So that's something that we've had for a couple of years now. Just more of a downside protection. John Sauerland : And just to elaborate on the combined ratio part of your question there. We target, generally speaking, return on capital across our product lines in the same neighborhood. So you're correct in that if we have to have more capital around for property, we target combined ratios for property that are lower than auto. You might quickly point out that, that is not right now, our performance, and we're very cognizant of that. As Tricia mentioned in opening comments, taking actions to improve profitability in the property space. Greg Peters : My follow-up question. And I'm using the words from your conference call about an environment where there's less shopping. I'm curious if you can tell us how you might adjust your advertising budget, considering that we might be in this new environment where there is less shopping, as you described it, from your consumers? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So how we look at our media spend is really, we believe, if -- we have an allowable cost per policy. And if our cost per sale is less than that, we'll continue to advertise if we believe it's efficient. We watch, what we call, NP6, which is new prospects that haven't shopped us in the last 6 months, and then we watch conversion. As long as those numbers, we believe, are within the guidelines that we set, then we'll continue to advertise. We want to make sure that we advertise across the board of all of sort of our customer set. So we offer -- advertise a savings message, protection message for auto and home, and we watch those to make sure how good each commercial is, how good each digital advertising are. We have -- we do such deep analytics from our media spend that we will continue to spend as long as we think it's efficient and if not, we'll pull back. John Sauerland : Yes, we think that some of the lower levels of shopping over the previous periods has been driven by the fact that many competitors have been actually lowering rates. We think that environment has changed, and we're starting to see far less rate decreases and more rate increases. And naturally, as customers receive rate increases, they're far more likely to shop than the rate decreases. So it's a dynamic environment. As Tricia mentioned, we manage spend very dynamically, even daily. And when we're seeing changes in the environment, we can react very quickly. Tricia Griffith : We don't want to -- you don't want to pull back either. Obviously, we still feel really good about our spend. But you don't want to pull back because as the environment changes, you want to consistently be out there because people will have awareness of you and then ultimately, if they shop you, that would be a consideration. So we even see a couple of the trends or the turning point where some -- there is some increases. So we can't predict what's going to happen. But John and I often talk about and look at data and challenge ourself \"is the soft market softening,\" because we have seen a turning point from that based on what we believe are consistent industry severity trends. Unidentified Company Representative : I'm actually going to take a question from the webcast now because it kind of builds on a question that Greg just had. The question is, what specific actions is the company taking to achieve underwriting profitability in the Property segment? Should investor -- why should investors, excuse me, be confident that Progressive will get this line to underwriting profitability, when that has been a challenge during the last several years? Tricia Griffith : We -- let me start with the end one. If you know the history of Progressive, when we set up to do something we execute it. And so I referred to in 2016, when our trends went up and we were a little bit over 96. We got together. We made changes in our expense ratio, and we got rate, et cetera. And we nailed that in really a short period of time. And Dave Pratt, you're on the phone, you can add in. So what we've looked at over the last couple of years, obviously, if you take out cats, we're profitable.  The catastrophes, especially wind and hail have been substantial. And so we are basically -- we're changing some of our underwriting guidelines. We're changing some of our coverages, some of our deductibles in specific states, where we see that hail and wind. We're rolling out our 4.0 product. We have it in, I think, three states now, maybe three more by the end of the year, and then we'll have an aggressive rollout in 2020. If we have to pull back a little bit on growth, we will. We obviously have reinsurance as well. And now I think the beauty of having the ASI Progressive is that we have the auto R&D in pricers, the home R&D in pricers, and we can share that data to really understand loss experience across different consumer segments. So for us, we have all hands on deck. I will leave from here today to go down to St. Pete to Progressive Home. We are encouraged about what we're seeing. It takes a little time because some of these are annual policies. But I feel very confident we will get where we need to go. And as a reminder, when we think about growth and profit, we always want to do both. And this has been an amazing several years where we've been able to grow substantially and make a lot of money. If we have to make a choice and we never want to, profit comes first. So we do what we can to make sure we make our target profit margins. Dave Pratt : Tricia, I could add just a little detail on the wind and hail comment, if that's appropriate. Tricia Griffith : Yes, please. Dave Pratt : Because you're right, if you look at our losses, the weather losses in the last few years have been higher than we had priced for. The non-weather claims in water, fire, theft, liability, et cetera, we've been right on our pricing targets. And so we've -- when we price for weather because it's so volatile, we can't really use our own experience from the last few years as a good predictor of next year's losses. So we rely pretty heavily on models to do that. The models for hurricane performed pretty well. But what we've found as we've dug into this problem was that most of the tools we had been using for severe convective storms, so thunderstorms that cause wind and hail. We're not performing well at all. And so we've done a lot of work. We've adopted a new tool from Karen Clark and company that we think, with some proprietary adjustments on our part is a much better predictor of future losses. And we're using that to guide our pricing in states with significant wind and hail exposure. So I feel much more confident going forward that we're going to have -- we'll be priced to the risk accurately. And then we'll manage our risk concentrations in areas that get a lot of hail, just to make sure that we don't have an overconcentration in a place where we don't want to. Tricia Griffith : Yes. And Dave is down in St. Pete right now, and I'll tell you, he's got an extensive career at Progressive doing many of these things. And if there's anybody that can right this ship, it will be him. And really, we have all hands on deck. So my confidence level is very high. Greg Peters : Great. I actually have a follow-up question, sort of related, but it kind of speaks to the questions and the comments, I guess, that Dave had about weather and weather data. But the question is, what do you think the impact to the company will be in the long-term from the risks of climate change? Tricia Griffith : I mean, that's really hard to say. And clearly, we will continue use of reinsurance to, again, protect that downside. I think what Dave said is right on target with that question as well in terms of us understanding the models better and understanding how they affect our book of business. And so he said, we have some very specific work we've been doing on severe convexity in the last several months, we feel good about it. We'll continue to tweak those things, continue to -- if we have to pull back, have underwriting guidelines, et cetera. It's really hard to say overall, how it will affect us, but we'll do things to understand it better and protect ourselves better. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Crystal Lu : This is Crystal Lu in for Ryan Tunis. For our first question, can you please talk about what is driving the increased severity trends in the parts of your commercial auto book that are seeing higher losses? And why those drivers or characteristics are not impacting the healthy portion of your commercial auto book? Tricia Griffith : I think the primary driver of a lot of the severity is medical costs, and they are affecting the book overall, whether it's auto or commercial auto, it's just more pronounced in the for-hire trucking. Crystal Lu : Okay. And can you also talk about which parts of the commercial auto reserves you reviewed in September and which parts of the book are going to be reviewed in fourth quarter? And maybe whether or not you pulled forward any reserve reviews when you found some trends of increasing severity in certain parts of the book? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I'm going to let Gary Traicoff, he's in the audience. I'll have him come up because he will know specifically what he's reviewing and, ongoing, what we're going to review. But I would tell you, just as he gets -- comes down here, we review a big portion of the book of our entire organization on a very frequent basis to understand that we're reserved. And when we think there's any trend that we see, we really want to strengthen the reserve. And that's why I wrote my letter this quarter to make sure that we knew we were strengthening because we saw those, and we wanted to get out in front of it. Gary, do you want to add? Gary Traicoff : Sure. Everybody, I'm Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. With respect to commercial auto, we review roughly about 90% on the reserves in commercial every quarter. And bodily injury, for example, where we took the $25 million increase, we look at every quarter. So from the perspective of are we changing the ways in which we're looking at the reviews in terms of timing. No. We cover pretty much everything every quarter. The other 10% would be more of our smaller coverages such as collision, property damage, et cetera, that might be reviewed a couple times a year. In general, just to give you a sense as well, we -- across all of our products, we would look at about 80% to 85% of the reserves every quarter. So we are touching them multiple times through the year. And then most of our injury coverages, we will hit those four times a year. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Gary. John Sauerland : I'll just add, while we're on that topic. Again, referring back to our last quarterly webcast, John Barbagallo and/or Karen Bailo. I forget exactly which shared a chart with you all around commercial auto prior year reserve development from, I believe, 2012 through 2018 and showed what Progressive had developed and what the rest of the industry has developed. And I will give kudos to Gary Traicoff and team in saying that the Progressive dots were fairly close to the 0 line. Not always on 0, obviously, we're not going to be perfect all the time. But within 1 to 2 points every single year. This year, we're a little over 2 points year-to-date. And the industry was an average that was far greater, and in some years, was even experiencing 9 points of prior year development. That level of reserve accuracy helps the product managers in commercial auto price accurately. We also reserve down to, I think, a finer level than some of our competitors in that space. So again, that drives more accurate prices that makes us more profitable and more competitive in the marketplace. So we have had some development. It's a little higher than we've seen historically. I think the product managers in commercial lines in the appropriate areas are right on top of taking rate, as Tricia was mentioning, it is their job to do. And I think they've got great data to make sure they're doing it in the right place. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt with William Blair. Jeff Schmitt : Could you provide us with an update on your efforts to move into the small business market? Obviously, a pretty big opportunity. But any details you can give on your growth outlook there? Tricia Griffith : Yes. We see, obviously, the growth outlook we see as extraordinary, but it's really too early to talk about. So our focus is on the 30 million small businesses with 20 or fewer employees. And we just rolled it out in the agency channel. And so we're going to continue to learn. When we have anything to tell we will, but we believe that really fits in our opportunities and we're excited about it, but nothing really to tell yet. Jeff Schmitt : Got it. Okay. And then just a question on catastrophe losses. They've been left out the last three or four monthly reports. And then looking in the queue, I think they're close to $160 million in the third quarter. It's obviously very useful to look at those sort of underlying loss trends with those backed out. But should we expect those to return to the monthly results? Or are they going to be sort of left out going forward? Tricia Griffith : Well, we've had a long-standing sort of policy that we will put cat information in the monthly reports if it's 2 points or more on the combined ratio. And so that's been decades old. And so we doubt we'll change that. We feel like we're pretty transparent with the monthly reporting and with, obviously, we share a lot during this webcast. So the likelihood of us changing that, I think is low. We'll always consider it, but that's really kind of the -- where we delineate when we share it on a monthly basis versus a quarterly basis. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Well, that really swept my question, but I do want to at least throw in a vote for including the information. Because that way we'll be able to have a better read on what's going on. I understand that you're not expecting to change it, but I did want to urge a reconsideration. I wanted to get your comments on the softening of the softening in personal auto. And to see if you can break down whether -- like how much of to be expected Progressive response is to maybe pull back on the modest rate decreases you've been taking or to anticipate improving top line growth -- or policy organic growth, I should say. Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, we always look to improve on top line growth. We took really modest decreases across the board. And it really was to balance out that growth and profitability in terms of getting higher conversion. Just watching the competition and seeing the whole industry, when you combine everything, things have been pretty stable. And in fact, you have seen a couple of our competitors take a few small increases. And that's what we think about when we think about trends and we're watching severities. Like, okay, if this is turning, how are we positioned? And we believe that we're really well positioned because we didn't say, okay, we have this margin, let's take huge decreases to take on -- to take on growth or maybe not take on growth commensurate with those increases.  We're very deliberate in understanding, okay, if we take a little bit, how does that convert to balance that great margin, but also that great unit growth. So we feel like -- and the softening of the softening, that's just John and I talking in the hallway because we're like, what do you think? And we'll look at numbers together. We are just going to watch that surgically. And what I would say is, we're in a really good position because we are -- we feel really good about our rate to not have to take huge increases. If we need to take increases across the board, we always will. But again, if we do, and the trend continues to be able to take smaller increases. And of course, I'll have the caveat we always say, that could be different in terms of states and channels and products, et cetera. Do you want to add anything? John Sauerland : [Indiscernible] Tricia Griffith : Is that good? Meyer Shields : Yes. On my end, it is. I had a quick follow-up question, if I can. I was just curious, when we look at the responsibility relationships between auto data and Homeowner data. I was wondering whether the claims that don't necessarily reflect responsibility, is there any relationship there? Tricia Griffith : We're just looking into that in terms of sharing data with, specifically, only and only Progressive Home with Progressive Auto. But we do see there's overlap. And so there's some interesting just components that we're looking at to better understand how to segment. So yes, there is a relationship. I don't have a lot to talk about with it publicly now, but yes, we're definitely seeing that sharing that data is gathering insights for both auto and home. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber at William Blair. Adam Klauber : Could you give us an idea how the -- how your digital acquisition is expanding? Just any ballpark over the last three to five years, how much of your auto -- personal auto business is coming through the digital channel, whether it goes to your agents internally to sort direct? What was it like 3 years ago compared to today? And then where are you on the homeowners and bundled as far as your digital rollout? Tricia Griffith : I would say, the acquisition on the digital side -- I can't tell you exactly percentage, has increased substantially over the years compared to when you look at mass media. We're assuming we actually -- you don't know if somebody sees it if they end up calling an agent. So we believe it likely helps the direct side more often because it may be a different kind of customer who's looking online versus going into your agent and kind of wanting to sit knee to knee for the that consultation. But I would say, it's -- I know that it's increased substantially. I don't know the exact percentage.  And then with Home Bundle, we continue to change our message. So forever, it was auto. And our assumption was that when you bundled that it extended auto PLE. What we're finding is from -- when we do the ads where we talk about home actually or auto, that helps to measure that bundle. So I would assume that happens again on the digital side. It's hard to say because you have so many ads coming your way, what actually makes that happen. But we have increased on our spend in the digital portion of our media spend. John Sauerland : To that, I would add -- by far the majority of our auto sales now are digital, and that has continued to climb, as Tricia noted. I think the other important trend there to understand is the majority of those are now mobile. So it's amazing to me, frankly, that so many people are willing to buy their insurance on their mobile device and that trend doesn't seem to be abating either. That trend has yet really to transfer to home as much. We're starting, as Tricia noted, to build the capabilities for people to efficiently quote and buy property insurance online. We're seeing some interest in the mobile space for property. But the property -- I mean, sorry, the auto trends are pretty amazing and very digital and very mobile. Tricia Griffith : And I was talking about, he was -- John added on the acquisition side. And I think I was interpreting your question more as the advertising, which we, of course, equate to acquisition. But again, we believe that what we're spending with Home will eventually go that way as well. So for years, people didn't buy digitally. On our HQX, our HomeQuote Explorer, we now have Progressive Home, the buy button, in 12 states. We'll have 14, we're expected to have 14 by year-end. So just to continue to make it easier, have less questions, all those things. We're going to continue to invest in that because we believe that will go the way of auto and just trying to make it easy, especially if we have data that is publicly known that we can help to guide the coverage for your home. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. David Motemaden : Just wanted to get an update on the process improvements in the 5 states where you were addressing some of the BI severity on the auto side. And sort of how those are progressing? And when we should start to see any improvement there? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So a couple of things. We've done some deep dives. And there's a couple of things that we've tweaked, nothing substantial. We really see that it is inherent in the industry. And in the spirit of transparency, as we've kind of looked and stepped back and we do a lot of audits across the board in our claims organization. I would say, it's likely now more low double digits. And so we see that even more in the five states that we talked about before. In looking at the industry, we believe that it's really just inherent with increased medical costs.  We've also seen an increase really over the years in a attorney rep rate. Not necessarily litigation, but having the attorney there at some point in the claim, sometimes at the actual first notice of loss. When I looked back at data around March 2013, we started to see increase in auto countrywide. And I would say, from 2013 to now, there's been about 6 points of increase in ultimate attorney rep percentage. And so for us, we're seeing that. Obviously, when you have an attorney they need to get their fee, so it's going to be more expensive. And that said, we haven't seen a huge increase in general damages, more on the medical side. So we feel like it's more usage. We've seen more injectables, et cetera.  So what we're really trying to dig into is, is this a trend? Is there something we can do about it? Because if someone's treating and they're with an attorney, we can't necessarily influence that. We always try to get out in front of the customer to make sure we take care of them and walk them through the process because it is very emotional when you're injured. But some people get attorneys right away, which does make the ultimate cost more expensive. Again, not necessarily litigation, but attorney repped. So we're working on those things all the time. But really, as we have watched the results come in for this quarter from the industry, it seems very consistent with what everybody is seeing in terms of higher medical costs. David Motemaden : Got it. Great. And just switching gears. I noticed in the queue, there is just some discussion of a higher portion of bundled auto policies that have 12-month policy terms. Just wondering how you think about this going forward as you shift your mix more towards the preferred segment? Are we going to see this continue -- the 12-month policies continue to increase? Any sort of difference in profitability in those products versus others? And I guess, just how you view -- it obviously can enhance retention if your mix moves in that direction. But then it also kind of prevents or limits your ability to reprice as quickly based on experience. Tricia Griffith : Yes. That's true if you were following us back in 1999 or 2000, but we are very cognizant of being able to be nimble when you have 12-month policies. One of the things when we went with Progressive Home in the agency channel is we wanted to make sure, for competitive reasons, too, that we could have yearly policies on the home for the agents, which was consistent with the other preferred companies that they were purchasing. We watch those very closely and make sure that -- especially because sometimes they'll get multi-policy discounts. We watch this closely to make sure that we maintain profitability and flexibility. We do have a higher percentage of those, which we think it is good when you're priced right. But again, we watch it closely, and we'll continue to likely talk more about that. John Sauerland : One fact that I'd point out on that question. As Tricia noted, we had some bad experience back in '99, 2000, where we overweighted our annuals. And we learned from that. And today, we don't price our annual policies, generally speaking, at twice the 6-month. We actually price them higher than that to offset or mitigate the trend risk that you mentioned. So we are, yes, growing. It's still not a large percentage of our policies, and it's just in the agency channel right now where we have annual auto policies, and we think we're managing it pretty well. Tricia Griffith : And I think, too, I just -- I've been -- I've had a couple sessions with some big agents. And we have been really for years, wanting to make sure that we're seen as the preferred company or 1 of their preferred companies in agency. And with that, for them to get bonuses, their loss ratio has to be within a certain percentage as well. So it's -- it behooves them to put on really good business. Julia Hornack : I'm going to finish up with maybe another one or two questions from the webcast. The first one is can you quantify the improvements you've seen so far with Model 8.6 in the five states where it's been rolled out? Tricia Griffith : Early read is that it's doing very well. Again, that's early, but we're happy with the results. Julia Hornack : Okay. And then the last question I have in here is what is the growth prospect for commission income at Progressive? So this is the service revenue line in our income statement. This investor makes the assumption that it's typically a high profit margin and is given a high multiple by investors. So what will Progressive do, if anything, to highlight this expanding revenue stream of the company? Tricia Griffith : Well, the commissioning that we get from a lot of non-affiliate carriers that we work with -- and I think Andrew talked about the life insurance company we work with, which is great. But we also offset that to make sure that we fund what we call the Progressive Advantage agency. So we use that sort of that contract spends to fund that. So we continue to grow that because we continue to grow. I don't -- we don't have actually any goal with that. It really is about making sure that we have the right amount of carriers for the customer base that comes into our door. And obviously, we want to be competitive with commissions based on the companies that our unaffiliated partners work with. John Sauerland : Yes. So the commission revenue is great. You're right. Service revenues are becoming material. But I hasten to remind that the primary intent there is to keep those auto customers longer and to keep the most profitable auto customers longer. So the commission is great. We are also offering Progressive Home in that same space, but the primary intent is to, as we say, bundle and extend. Meaning, get more of the household into the Progressive family and continue to ensure we meet all their insurance needs for decades to come. Julia Hornack : Great. That actually is our last question for today. So I'm going to give it back to Chris for the closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation's third quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to The Progressive Corporation's Fourth Quarter Investor Event. The Company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the Company's website. And we'll use this event to respond to questions after a prepared presentation by the Company. The event is available via a moderated conference call line and a live webcast with a brief delay. Webcast participants will be able to view the presentation slides live or download them from the webcast site. Participants on the phone can access the slides from the Event page at investors.progressive.com. In the event, we encounter any technical difficulties with the webcast transmission, webcast participants can connect through the conference call line. The dial-in information and passcode are available on the Events page at investors.progressive.com. Acting as moderator for the event will be Julia Hornack. At this time, I will turn the event over to Ms. Hornack. Julia Hornack : Thank you, Jason, and good morning. Today, we will begin with a presentation about Progressive Home business. Our presentation will be followed by Q&A with our CEO, Tricia Griffith; and our CFO, John Sauerland. Our Chief Investment Officer, Jonathan Bauer will also join us for Q&A by phone. This event is scheduled to last 90 minutes. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during the event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available on our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investors page of our website, investors.progressive.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith. Tricia Griffith : Good morning and welcome to Progressive's fourth quarter webcast. We wrapped up 2019 with another banner quarter and banner year. We're very excited to start 2020 and obviously you've seen in January's results. So, we continue to be really excited about our opportunities around growth and profitability. As Julia said, today is about property. And so, we're very excited to tell our story both where we're come from and where we're going. Before I get into that about three quick items. The first one, we heard you. Many of you asked for us against the loss ratios associated with catastrophes. And as you'll see the January earnings, we started to do that for each line coverage, so hopefully that will be more transparent for all of you to understand the effect of our underlying loss ratios on any given month with any given catastrophe, especially in the more volatile lines hover just like properties. Second, as you likely read in the 10-K, Progressive and minority stakeholders an ARX decided to conclude the acquisition a year early. So we're spending 242 million to acquire the remaining shares of ARX. And we will close that, if all things go well, which we expect that to happen in 2020, April of 2020 versus 2021. I was talking to Jay Pratt right before this, and he said, he had so many e-mails from people at Progressive Home saying didn't this already happen. So, this is really something where we've been dating forever. People assumed we're married let's just get it done early and we're really excited to move forward and really execute on our plans. And then the third item, which I'm sad about, but happy for her and happy for Progressive is Julia Hornack has decided to take her talents down to St. Pete with Progressive Home. All of you gotten to know her very well over the years. She is really our Investor Relations Guru and she's filled a lot of your questions over the years, and we're going to miss her. But we're excited for her in her next stage of her career. She's been a controller. She's been a product manager. And now she's moving on to work on specialty products. Vendor management and some process management. Again, we're sorry to lose her from here, but so excited for Progressive. Congratulations, Julia. Julia Hornack : Thanks, Tricia. Thanks a lot. And to all of our shareholders, portfolio managers and analysts, it's really been a pleasure getting to know you. And to do my best to represent Progressive in this and the facts that we provide in all of our public disclosures. It's been a pleasure serving our executive team. It's truly extraordinary and a wonderful partner, our wonderful partners. And I'm really excited to take my talent to St. Pete. Hopefully, I'm travelling back to Cleveland quite a bit to see my friends here, but I look forward to making friends with all my extraordinary colleagues founded on in St. Petersburg. So thank you. Tricia Griffith : I imagine you will be very diligent when you come to Cleveland versus what you say and in Saint Pete. Julia Hornack : Yes, same thing. Tricia Griffith : So I'll visit you in the winter. Julia Hornack : Exactly, exactly. Yes, great. Tricia Griffith : Let's get started. So, we changed the vision statement last year, and usually when you change the statement two words doesn't really make a difference. This really did make a difference. And as we started to think about a new vision statement, we started to think about how many bundle customers we had and so home fit right in there. But as we stepped back and thought about being consumer's number one choice, we really thought about why don't we have the word agents in there and this actually came from Heather Day because our collective consumers go into agencies and we want our agents to think of us first in each of their agencies. In fact, 60% of our business when you look at commercial lines and personal lines come from the agency channel. I'm the agency customer myself, I wrote in one of the quarterly letters last year about, how important this channel has been for us, and especially going forward. So for us, this key door is one change is really significant for our growth. In fact, recently I have the opportunity to do a fireside chat at the Big \"I\" with the CEO, Bob Rusbuldt. The Big \"I\" is national alliance of about a 0.25 million businesses to sell auto insurance products or insurance products, I should say. And I talked with his board, which have representatives for each day. And really, I told them about how important they are to us and really wanted to solidify our relationship and know that we want to get inside the hearts and minds of all of our agents and invest in them, and think about the future of our collective customer. So that word is very important. The Home word made sense because we believe in a dual channel strategy one of our pillars is to have broad covers. So, we want to be where when and how customers want to shop for home insurance as well as auto insurance and others. So whether it's any agency channel through our Progressive advantage agency or HQX, we want to be there. So, the vision statement changes two words that pretty significant. I shared this chart with you last quarter really to talk about the return on equity, and we looked at a 5, 10 and 20 year time frame with Progressive compared to the S&P 500 and the S&P P&C index. And we outpaced in all of those years, both of those industries, and we're really proud of that fact. What I also said was that under leveraged capital, we would return to shareholders, either in stock purchases or dividends, and 2019 was no different. This was the first year of our new dividend policy, and our board declared a variable dividend of $2.25 per common share which equated over $1.3 billion returning to shareholders. In fact, if you add in the four of quarterly $0.10 per common share fixed dividends equated to over $1.5 billion, we're returning to shareholders. And although we don't have comparisons, I'm pretty proud, very proud to say that our return on equity for 2019 was over 31% that is phenomenal. I'll obviously update you once we have a more than comparison. So, we're very proud of this. So the question I would ask if I were an analyst or an investor would be, if given the recent struggle with profitability. Are you still glad that you had the ARX transaction? A couple of words very easily, yes, absolutely, unequivocally, all those things. I'm going to give you a couple of data points and then Heather Day will really talk about our plans. So, we're really excited about that. So first of all, over the inception to-date period, we've grown 11% at a 96 combined ratio. So we've made money and we've grown. Do we want to grow more and have wider margins? Absolutely, but the key part of this acquisition was for us to have access to those preferred customers and the agency channel. In 2019, we believe that 715 million of our auto premium and the agency channel we would not have had, but for having the partner home products to have that bundle preferred customer. We equate that to the nearly 5 billion in life time earn premium, a level low our 95 combined ratio. So, those are few data points to say absolutely this was meant to be. On the more softer side which I think sometimes is lost when you have an acquisition is the culture and the people and being able to really run as fast as we can collectively together to gain market share. As you know I want to give credit to John Auer, the former CEO of ASI -- or ARX I should say, and Glenn Renwick, the former CEO of Progressive, really starting that relationship. We have fits and starts along the way of buy, build, partner and nothing quite words. And that relationship started, we started with a 5% interest. And right away, we saw that these companies were alive. In fact, I always smile when I got on the same team because in their first year of business, they had a plaque on their wall that said, we want to be the Progressive of homeowners insurance. And to me that just meant something was almost a foreshadowing. In addition, we knew that we wanted with this preferred customer base to be able to lengthen our auto PLEs and that has worked. We have comparison products we both built Umbrella as an example, where we would say, Eric, this process is superior to ours. So we'll merge those together and have even a better product. I think, more importantly, and as in January, Dave Pratt started reporting into Pat Callahan, we're really starting to share resources R&D pricing to get that depth of segmentation in property like we have an auto. I do want to thank John Sauerland for getting us to the final acquisition because he really was working on that for the last couple of years, and we're so excited to be able to wrap that up in April. But again, the values the people and the ability to really search for the great customers that we want and be able to achieve our ultimate vision is really exciting to us. I'm going to end by just talking about something that's probably the softer side as well. But I think it's key to our culture and as a formula that I talked about in my annual letter to shareholders. The first part of the formula is, question everything. I think when you have a high tenure company like Progressive, especially at the senior levels. Sometimes you can be just surgically focused in growing. And my goodness, we could -- we've been doing that incredibly. But partly you have to sit back and say, why do we do this? Why do we invest in this? And question things that you said we may never do. And great example is to create a homeowner's company. After we, for lack of a better word fail to do that. A decade ago, we said we would never be in the homeowners business. Well never say never because things around us changed. And we knew we wanted to evolve as a preferred company and we needed to do that. And so this is perfect. So what I asked really everyone for about some to do, with my team does all the time is we always question and have really incredible debates to make sure that we're always thinking as this environment changes so rapidly. The second part of the formula is to always grow mindset. And I talk about this being sort of a double entendre. For me is everyone can share about their personal growth? I actually had an interview take place last week, and the woman said to me, what do you do when you get bored? And I said, if I get bored, shame on me because there's so much out there to read to listen to podcast to do look at TED Talks to get an outside event. And we really want all 14,000 plus Progressive people to continue to be curious and things differently because a lot of the best ideas come from the grassroots efforts. We think if we always grow ensuring the Company will grow and that said double entendre. So question everything, always grow mindset equals an enduring business. And for us, this is going to be our legacy for all of our senior leaders for the people who come after us. And that is our job to make sure we have an enduring business for decades and decades and decades to come. Speaking of always growth mindset, let's talk about property, both growth and profitability. So two guests today, both of whom I think you've met, Dave Pratt, who is our Property GM down in St. Pete, has been here for quite a while. His undergraduate degree from Duke is in electrical engineering and has a Harvard MBA. He came to Progressive in 1991 as the Product Manager for New York. I can't go over to his whole resume, but he's ran marketing, product development and many, many products along the way. And we asked him to take over as a Property GM right after Hurricane Irma in 2017. And he's been down there since doing a fantastic job. He has a great story to tell. Before that, I'd like to introduce you Heather Day. Heather has her bachelor's degree in economics from Miami. Her master's in international relations from USC. And if that wasn't enough for the always growth mindset, she got her MBA from Wharton. She also has an extensive resume started as a product manager, has worked in recreational lines. She was our marketing leader for snapshots and most recently our preferred marketing leader rolling out our Platinum for agents, which we'll talk about a lot today. Most recently, a couple of years ago, she was part of that swap that we arranged and she is the Head of Agency and Sales Distribution. So Heather, why don't you tell us what you've been working on? Heather Day : Thanks, Tricia. So I will echo Tricia and reinforce that Progressive continues to invest in the independent agent channel. We recognized the value that agents provide to consumers that are looking for both products depth, and local professional advice. So our commitment to working with independent agents has been long standing, but it lines up well with recent market research and trends. The graph that you see on the left is from J.D. Power, and shows that over the last 5 years, independent agents have made steady gains in purchase satisfaction compared to captive agents, or exclusive agencies J.D. Power would call them. The satisfaction levels today are 20 points higher and what they found when they were digging deeper it was the preference for flexible product offers that really drove the largest performance gap amongst these channels. And this area of successful product offers is a place where independent agents thrive based on their ability to place clients among several different brands, compared to a captivate agents that simply lacks that flexibility. So this change in purchase satisfaction correlates to market trends. There was a parallel shift in market share beginning in 2015, 2016. A time when most major carriers were taking rate increases. Consumers started purchasing more in the independent agent and captive channels where price comparisons could be made most easily. Direct carriers may gain in personalized market share, independent agents carriers held steady while captive carriers gave up share. Now Progressive has steadily grown our own share in the independent agent channel. And that's accelerating in recent years as we have had the home to the lineup. And if we look back at our recent growth, we were clearly well positioned heading into a hard market. And our overall agency results were boosted by our product segmentation and pricing. Progressive was steady. We were profitable and competitive during the period where many other carriers were taking larger rate increases. So this provided an excellent opportunity to make headway on those auto and home bundles. The compelling auto position maybe overall bundle more competitive, and the demonstrated commitment to property with the purchase of ARX in 2015 and then the subsequent launch of our Platinum program really gave our agents a reason to believe that they could partner with Progressive as a preferred bundle carrier. And indeed as a sure of our new business, bundles have grown fivefold over this period. Looking at our independent agent share across these two products. In private passenger auto, we have gained two market points each year in 2016, 2017 and 2018, which could afford a 20 point share in 2018. And then on the home side Progressive has moved into the number 6 spot with 3.5% of the market in 2018. Now despite the strong market position, we continue to see upside and the whole product is key to that. Expansion of our addressable markets was really core to the destination era strategy. And I want to reinforce how critical that expansion is for our platinum agency. The table you see breaks down auto and home market premiums across channels by our market segments. So for a quick refresher on these market segments, you've got Sam's looking for auto insurance as needed, very price sensitive, they tend to be more nonstandard. Your Dianes come to us with prior insurance, more financially responsible, but not homeowners. Wright, these are homeowners that purchase home or auto insurance from us, but they do not bundle and then finally we have the Robinsons. These are typically the most preferred customers, they bundle home and auto and they tend to look to agents for ease and confidence. So not surprisingly, due to our legacy isn't bottom line auto carrier, we tend to over index on the Sam, the Diane, and the Wrights. And despite our steady growth and bundles, we still have just about 2% of the independent agent Robinson market. So this is lots of room to grow in a $59 billion market, and disruption in the captive market is putting more of that 97 billion of captive bundle in play as well. And while there is still lots of upside and work ahead of us, we are pleased with our results today. We have continued our momentum in writing bundles with agents with 27% growth in 2019. A part of that growth comes from the expansion of our platinum program, which at year-end 2019 was at 3,700 agents. However, platinum will continue to be exclusive going forward. It is available only to those agents that have strong potential to write preferred bundles, and strong commitment to writing those bundles with Progressive. So scarcity will remain part of the platinum appeal. And we currently have less than 10% of Progressive agents that are platinum. So we're going to manage that number carefully as we go forward with continued emphasis on profitable growth as key to an appointment. And we also see platinum working as it drives consideration of the home and auto bundle and our preferred auto more generally. So I'm going to reprise the graph that we share during prior Investor Relations calls updated year through 2019. This graph compares two cohorts of agents, one group and both of these agents -- both of these groups of agents had Progressive Home back in 2015. One group was selected for platinum and the other remained in the more general Progressive Home programs. Of course, if we go back to the start of 2015, the more productive agents were ultimately invited to join platinum. So there is that initial Delta that we see. However, after the launch of platinum, that gap starts to widen. The momentum was initially slow as we integrated the sales teams. And we looked for Platinum program infrastructure to get built out. But what we're now seeing is that in that multiplier effect of various initiatives that are starting to come together. So maintaining that original cohort of agents, so that we can actually compare the same-store sales, what we see with the solid orange line for platinum, versus the solid blue line for those non-platinum property agents, is that platinum agents are now 4.5 times more likely to bundle their home and auto. And then if I had preferred auto growth, these are the dashed lines that are now on the graph. You'll notice that both sets of agents have increased their preferred auto volume overtime. However, once again, those Platinum agents are again producing about four times more volume per agency. So the gap between these platinum and non-Platinum lines is really that time difference. And what we see when we're looking back from 2019, is that this list has held over time. And the platinum program itself is really about a comprehensive approach. So I'll speak a little bit more about partnering with agents both in terms of enhanced compensation, as well as making it easy for them to write bundles, and to leverage a strong brand. And then I'll hand off to Dave, who will share how we are positioning property for long-term success with a stable competitive offering. All of this comes together and builds our agents' confidence in our ability to serve your customers. So on the compensation front, we recognize that we would have to think differently, and increase compensation in order to offer a compelling alternative to preferred carriers in this space. We laid out what we call past a partnership. It allows us to compensate agents for their increased commitment while maintaining our overall low-cost position. So as an example of how this works, I'd like to share the story of G&G Independent Insurance. This is an agency with a smart leadership team that I had the opportunity to get to know last year. G&G joined Progressive in 2014. This was the same year that this agency opened their office in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and in the beginning, they wrote mostly non-standard auto with Progressive and when we rolled out our national commission schedule as part of past the partnership, they started off in the growth tier. A tier that we provide agents with an opportunity to getting started to really start growing your books with Progressive. However G&G's is overall agency strategy was more bundle focus, and they had a lot of preferred customers. So they were able to earn higher commissions as they wrote more preferred auto with us. Our Progressive sales representative Ben Burleson developed a strong relationship with a team at G&G. Ben recognized that this agency had a larger bundle opportunity and was a good fit for the platinum program. They moved to platinum by May of 2018, making them one of the first 12 platinum agents that we had in Arkansas. With this new level of partnership G&G was at the investment tier, earning higher personal auto Commission's especially for that more preferred auto, unlocking the opportunity to earn some of our highest commissions available in the bundle say write, and they also gained access to annual policies and other marketing benefits. And because they had moved on to the Platinum path, they were also eligible to earn a performance bonus that rewards profitable growth in bundles, as well as on their entire personalized book. G&G quickly moved up a level with platinum, earning higher renewal commission on their bundles and a cash reward. And then by 2019 G&G was had Progressive as their number two carrier within their offices, gaining share quickly. So the agency see qualified for that Platinum Blue level, which earned it yet another cash award for reaching that goal in less than three years. And this May we will celebrate G&G's Platinum blue level achievement with a VIP trip. And they now have their sights set on becoming one of our Platinum 25 agents. So G&G moved from being a largely non-standard book with Progressive to becoming a platinum blue level partner with a pervert book, a bundle business and written premium that has grown tenfold. With this story highlights is an outstanding agency. But the scenes here play out again and again across our agents. It really underscores the power of providing different levels of partnership with compensation that reflects their commitment, as well as transparent and clear goals. So these programs that we have in place now allow us to maintain our cost advantage as a broad distribution carrier, while still using targeted compensation to ensure that we encourage and that we recognize increase consideration with partner agents. So in other part of the Platinum promises ease of use which is really part of our core value proposition for agents. We have carried that over to the preferred bundle space to our portfolio quoting platform. Portfolio allows agents to select multiple products to quote whether simultaneously or to add product during the interview. There's prefilled available for customer, vehicle and property information across the products that are being quoted. In the portfolio summary page provides agents in their customers with an overview of their premium, their bundled savings and applied discounts. So agents can add or remove a product with the click, really speeding up that sales process. Portfolio is also a win for us internally, as it was an early example of strong teamwork and deepening integration across our auto and property businesses. We launched portfolio in September of 2018 and at the end of last year, we were live in 27 states representing 73% of quote volume, as well as almost 120,000 users. We are seeing the expected list in our auto conversion. The list in our properties conversion actually surpassing expectations, which seems to be a result of both better representation at discounts, as well as easier access to the property products through this new interface. And what I personally find most encouraging is that the upgrades to the underlying architecture of the platform really allow us to better test and learn our way to continuous improvements as we respond to our agents evolving needs and their feedback. Now, being a brand with a national presence that customers want or ask for is cited in our internal research as a top reason that agents look to Progressive to help grow their business. So we want to ensure that agents can leverage that brand for both our home and their bundle offerings. We know the power of the Progressive brand extensor homeowners. Research confirms readiness to consider purchasing for Progressive Homeowners product, especially amongst those younger homeowners. And we find that featuring home is the message performs well. Our media has shifted to a greater emphasis on home as part of the overall message mix. That in turn drives increased consumer awareness of the Progressive Home product, which makes the brand and even more powerful tool for our agents. So we're leveraging that Progressive brand and our Platinum agent marketing collateral, making it easier for them to showcase both Brexit product with our co-branded materials across print, digital as well as mass media. And when we look at the overall program, Platinum is emerging as a driver for future commitment. So in a blind survey that was administered by a third-party agents indicated that Progressive is one of the companies where they placed their best customers 72% of the time, but when we put that data to focus in on agents that have access to our home product, that response jumped by 10 points. Now, we have room to improve. We are still coming up short against two of the largest long standing preferred carriers in the market. But when we look at this from another angle, and we asked agents where they are planning to increase business, Progressive outperforms, even when compared to those long standing preferred carriers. And once again, there is a stronger result with agents that have our home product coming in at almost 80% intent to increase placement. So, we feel good about things early years out, but we continue to learn and to look for opportunities to improve. Listening to our agents to understand their expectations and their customer's needs is critical. We do so through our agency council and an ongoing conversation with partner agents across the country. Guidance from our agents has also informed this deepening conversation across the home and the auto product teams as we evolved the bundle offering and our property product. And I'll hand off to Dave to share more on that front. Dave Pratt : Good morning. I'll begin with a very brief overview of our financial results, and then dive into some of the details. Our growth is meeting our expectations. You see, last year, our direct written premium and property grew to just over $2 billion. And we're leveraging not only the Platinum agency program that Heather just described, but Progressive brand and marketing strength in the directional. The combined ratio improved by about four points last year, but it's still not meeting our goals and we'll talk in a lot more detail about that. So, I start with growth. I'm showing here growth in our new business deals over the last three years. The blue bar at the bottom is sales from local independent agents, and all of the growth that you see there is coming from bundles from auto and home bundles that we're writing largely through the Platinum program. The orange bar is our direct to consumer business. That's pretty new to ARX until we're seeing very high percentage growth in the direct channel. We've almost completed the conversion from the ASI brand to Progressive Home. So those of you who ensure your home was Progressive on your most recent deck page, you saw the Progressive Home logo. We've made investments in the quoting channels. So the portfolio program for agents that Heather described is now in 29 states. On the direct side, we're part of the home called explorer quoting platform. And we've actually built the capability to go all the way from quote to buy the policy without having to talk to an agent in 14 states as of the end of the year. And we'll continue to roll out both of those platforms in 2020. And then the light blue bar at the top, mostly in 2018 was a fairly large book role. So one of Progressive partners in the Progressive news agency decided to opt out of that program, we worked with them to roll that book over to Progressive Home. So when you combine all of those sources of growth, we had 61% growth in 2018. Looking at 2019 without that book role in the denominator, it looks like our new sales are pretty flat. But we continue to have strong underlying growth in both agency and the direct to consumer channel. Now as we grow outside of ASI's original things, the mix of our businesses shifting. So ASI was founded as a Florida property insurer expanded fairly quickly into the other Gulf States. So if you go back to 2006, here, Florida was about 80% of ASI's business and Texas and Louisiana made up the rest. And the light blue part of this graph is all other states. So we've -- the expansion into the rest of the country has come to the point where Florida now only accounts for about 20% of our exposures. And those expansion states now are more than half. Now, that expansion also means that we are now exposed in a bigger way to new perils, especially winds and hail. If you look at the components of our loss ratio over the last few years, the orange part of these bars is wind and hail. The great part of the top is hurricane losses. And then the blue part at the bottom is all other perils with the property policy coverage. So you see that all other peril section has been stable and predictable. We've been very close to our pricing expectations on the all other peril selection. Wind and hail though has gone from 10% to 15% of premium to more than 30% last year. So, really getting our hands around what our expectations would be for wind and hail costs and pricing appropriately is an important part of meeting our profit goals. Now I'll talk in more detail later about a reinsurance program. Just sort of highlight here, how that results in differences between our direct and net results. So the lower line here shows the direct combined ratio for ASI in our Progressive Home over the years. The blue line at the top is the net result. So in the early years, ASI was seeding lot of premiums to our reinsurance partners. We didn't have any hurricanes making landfall in those years, so we weren't seeding any losses. And so our net loss or net combined ratio was higher than the direct. In the last few years the reinsurance program has been working as intended. And in years where we've had some big hurricane losses with hurricanes Irma and Michael, the reinsurance has kept the combined ratio near 100. Now, it's worth noting that even in these recent years where we haven't been satisfied with our results, we've been consistent with the industry. So the chart here the blue line shows our direct loss ratio each year. The gray line shows the industry but with the industry premium --state premium weighted based on the ASI and Progressive Home mix. So, in the early years, there you see with mostly Florida premium and no hurricanes very little loss ratios, as we've expanded into other states, we should expect to see the loss ratio be higher than no storms here in Florida though it's still been, at or a little bit below the industry result. So let me talk for a minute about what we did last year to improve profitability. And then we'll transition to our plans for this year and beyond. On the map here, the blue states as called the hail states. And so the chart on the right shows our rate increases last year. So in those hail states, we took rates up almost 9% compared to the 4% in the rest of the country. And then we also implemented some covers changes. So the states that have the stars on them, we did two things. We started to require new customers to buy higher wind and hail deductibles and the issue there's the when fairly small hail falls on a new or well-maintained roof it really shouldn't do any damage. But that doesn't prevent roofers from aggressively marketing to our customers, suggesting that the roofer could help them get a free roof from their insurance company. Now, it's clear that if our customer's roof is damaged, we want them to report that claim and we want to pay it as quickly as possible so we can help the customer get the repair made. But we have found that in cases where the customer's deductible is a little higher, they're less likely to submit a claim, when there's no visible damage in response to the marketing pitch from the roofer. The other change we've made is it for roofs where the shingles are nearing the end of their useful life. We're requiring actual cash value covers for the roof. That seemed fairly small hail, if it hits a shingle that's been out in the sun for 15 or 20 years, is much more likely to crack this shingle and then that needs to be repaired or replaced. But it just doesn't make sense for us to offer full replacement cost coverage for a maintenance item on something that needs to be replaced. And so it as the roof reaches sort of nears the end of its life, I asking people to have actual cash value coverage. And we see evidence that both of those changes will bring the loss ratio down and mitigate the need for further rate increases. Now, despite those actions in the blue states last year, we ran at 115 combined ratio compared to an 89.5 combined ratio in the rest of the country. So, I think a natural question would be will, how can you feel confident that you have addressed this problem and you can make money consistently throughout the country? So let me talk a little bit about the tools that we use to price for these parallels. Because weather is very volatile, we can't use last year's experience as a good predictor for next year's claims, wouldn't make any sense to say, we haven't had a hurricane for 3 years, so we don't have to price anything for hurricane. We have pretty good models for to help us understand what are likely hurricane losses will be, until recently, we only had 2 models available to predict severe convective storms. So those are the big thunderstorms that caused wind and hail. And I'm showing here the modeled prediction for what our annual average loss should be from wind and hail from those models over a 5-year period. Here's what our actual losses look like. So, the model which is not doing a good job of helping us predicts what we should expect in terms of claims from wind and hail. Fortunately, there's a new model that has become available in the last couple of years. And as we back test at against our broker business, we feel much more comfortable with that models going to do a good job of helping us to predict what our future loss costs will be. So model see here in the orange shows the models prediction of what our losses has been compared to that light blue bar, which is the actual that we paid. So we're now using that new model in our pricing decisions for wind and hail. So we feel much more comfortable that we will be priced accurately going forward. Now, we also want to continue to grow this business, while we work to improve the profitability. And so we are in the process of rolling out what we're calling the 4.0 version of our property product. As we've grown outside of the gulf states, we're collecting a lot more data in the rest of the country. And we've been able to collaborate with progress this auto product R&D team and Cleveland to use their most sophisticated tools to help us get the price segmentation, where needs to be. Heather mentioned the feedback we've gotten from our Platinum agents, so that's been very helpful as well. So, we've been able to expand eligibility in some cases, our underwriting appetite was much more restrictive than their other preferred markets. We've removed some exclusions from the contracts that were unusual in the market. And we've brought in coverage through endorsements, and so this gives me an excuse to put the picture of the German Shepherd puppy here because we used to have a fairly long list of dog breeds that were ineligible. And as we studied further, we were able to pay that back. So this little guy would now be eligible for insurance Progressive Home. Let me talk for a minute about our reinsurance program. We maintain a very conservative reinsurance program and intend to continue that. On the catastrophe side, it's designed to provide coverage for three major hurricanes in the single year. So, on the far left, you see the coverage available for our first event in Florida. So the way the program is structured today, we retain the first $16 million of losses from a single event. The gray part in the middle there is the Florida hurricane catastrophe fund, that's a state reinsurance farms that were required to participate in and do. And then the blue section is voluntary market reinsurance that we buy. And then finally at the top, we have a catastrophe bonds so insurance links security. Altogether, we have coverage for an event of almost $1.8 billion in losses. Now, most of the blue section is reinstated, automatically. So if there's a big claim, we get a reinstatement. And so the middle bar there shows what our coverage look like after $1 billion event, we would still have about $1.34 billion in coverage. And then we would even have this as a second $700 million event. As a second event, we would have remaining $640 million in coverage for a third event. And to put that in context, Hurricane Irma is the most expensive storm we've ever encountered. And our estimate of ultimate losses for Irma is less than $400 million. So we feel good about the structure of the catastrophe program. As the business continues to grow, we expect to increase our retention at the bottom slowly, and we expect to buy even more limited at the top of the program. And we also have an aggregate reinsurance program. That's to cover the volatility in wind and hail that I described earlier. So no individual hailstorm is likely to reach that $60 million retention. But if we have a year with a lot of hailstorms, that could put pressure on our loss ratio. In previous years, we had a program that was based on a loss ratio attachment so far loss ratio reached the attachment point we get ahead of recovery from the reinsurance. We switch that this year to an aggregate catastrophe excess of loss program. So in this year's program, we retain the first $375 million of catastrophe losses, and then we have coverage for up to $200 million above that. So if you have a really bad wind and hail year with lots of activity, that aggregate program would kick in and we have a recovery. It's important to note that that change may result in a change to the monthly volatility that you see in our property results. So what we're showing here, the blue line shows the property combined ratio that Progressive reported each month in 2019. The orange line shows what we would have reported, if we didn't have that loss ratio based aggregate reinsurance. So you see in January, it was a very like weather month, the combined ratio was below 80. So there's no need for aggregate recovery. In February was as a busier weather month. The combined ratio approached 120, but we hadn't yet hit that year-to-date the attachment point for the reinsurance. That changed in March. So March was, again, a busy weather month, but now we had a recovery on the reinsurance and so our reported combined ratio in March was about 100. And then each month through the rest of the year, the recovery would go up or down based on the weather. So you see in April, relatively quiet. We actually reversed some of that recovery, but then in May and June busier months. So again, we -- recovery we had in the reinsurance increase, but our reported combined ratio was pretty stable. With this year's program, we won't have a recovery on that aggregate unless we get to $375 million in total catastrophe losses. So in the early months of the years, we have a month where there's a lot of weather will report a higher combined ratio, but we expect the reinsurance to be available if needed the full year results are difficult. So, looking in with just a very brief description of our priorities for the property business for the year, job number one is improving profitability. We've talked a lot about that. The second is a focus on our people and culture. Because of the fast growth in this business over the last three years, we've gone from less than 600 people working in the property business to more than 1200 people. So it's really important that we spent a lot of effort on coaching and career development so that those people are effective in their jobs, enjoy their jobs and want to stay with Progressive for a long time. We have opportunities to improve processes as we grow to become more efficient and reduce cost per policy. I don't know if you noticed that on the first page, our expense ratio was down by more than 2 points in 2019. And we've seen some further opportunity for efficiency gains. We wouldn't continue to make it easy for agents and customers to quote and buy our policies and the investments in portfolio quoting and home quote explorer by or can be there. And then finally, we want to work to improve the customer experience. And the focus here is on those bundled customers. So there are instances today where, for example, the billing experience is different on your auto policy compared to your home policy. And we want to align those experiences so that the bundled customer has the same experience across all of our products. And we think that'll result in even better customer retention will keep those bundled customers for a long time. So with that, we will pause just briefly and we'll give Tricia and John an opportunity to come up for questions. Thank you. A - Julia Hornack : Thanks Dave. [Operator Instructions] And before I kick it over to Jason to take our first question from the conference call line, there's been a lot of discussion in the property casualty industry about the effects of this concept of social inflation. And so, Tricia and John, I thought you might want to start off by talking about how that concept of social inflation can affect, particularly bodily injury, severity and in PIP trends. Tricia Griffith : It's a great. I'll take a stab at that on both the personal auto side and commercial line side, and then John, if you can weigh in on anything you forgot or anything that that's important to note. And then why don't I have Gary Traicoff, our Chief Actuary, let come up and talk about the reserve part of it, I think that's a really important part. So, first and foremost, in the personal auto side, frequency is down about 3% and if you compare it to the last data point, we have for the competition, it sound lower because it's flattening out. It's was about zero for the competition in quarter three. That is the 12th consecutive quarter that our frequency has been down. Again, we talked about trying to attribute certain things to frequency, it's really difficult. And we would say that our mix shift to more preferred customers seems to be a part of it. But again, it's really hard to attribute any one particular thing we'll watch that very closely. On the severity side, we're about a point different from the industry at this juncture. The typical reasons in collision and property damage component parts, actually labor rates have been increasing and total losses. We're having more frequent total loss. So those are continuing the trends we've talked about for several quarters. On the BI severity part, which we take more seriously because they have a slightly longer tails and I talked a lot internally about injuries are not like fine line, they do not to get better with age. So, we really tried to make sure we have the right file at the right rep at the right time. So here's what I would say at this point. We see the BI trends, flattening out somewhat. At this point in time again, this is changing and if you're talking to some of our competition, I think we're all watching this very closely. So it is flattening out. But our BI trends are up and if you compare our incurred trends to the paid of industry, we're about a 0.5 difference, which we would assess to actuarial increases or reserve increases. We're seeing the same aggressiveness. We think about the social installation, buzzword that Julie talked about. We're seeing aggressive attorneys. We're seeing aggressive attorneys early on in the files. And so that's really an important piece. We call it like day zero before or right after we get the claim reported. We see attorney evaporate up about 2% year-over-year in the personal auto side. And we're looking at different cohorts of coverage limits. And we're seeing about mid-single-digits in every cohort and they're slightly different depending on it. So think of 5,100, 2,550 et cetera. And this is an anecdotal piece, but some of our CRM reps and said that they are getting calls from someone other than the names insured to assess what the limits are. And I remember being in a claims range for 15 years and getting those calls oftentimes they were from plaintiffs attorneys. Again, this is anecdotal, but am I going to take my more interested take a file that says 5,100, then in 2,555. So again, those are just some things are anecdotal. A new piece of information that we have from a vendor that we work with shows that attorney media spend is up 10% and when you compare the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter 2018. Again, I could have anecdotally told you that from my travels and you turn on the TV in any state you go to look at billboards. So we think that that's getting more aggressive. So we have to watch that really carefully. I assume that many of you will ask, because I referenced a handful of states a couple of quarters ago that we're watching closely. So, there's about 5 states that we've been watching from BI severities trend. 4 out of 5 of those have shown a decline in severity in the fourth quarter compared to full year 2019. But again, 3 out of 5 of those states are still higher than countrywide. So we're watching closely right now and it appears to be flattening but again, that can change at any given time. We are very surgical in pricing each line coverage each day channel product, all those things will keep on top of that, clearly our margins we believe are really strong and we believe we're conservative from the reserving side. So on the commercial side, we are down 4% from a frequency perspective, up about 19% from a severity perspective and about a couple of those points are reserving because it's actuarial strengthening. Here's what I would step back and say one thing. Every BMT in our commercial lines organization was at or below our targets. So very successful 2019 and into January, we were sub 90 combined ratio. So we are very strong on the commercial side. We also are no stranger to being able to react a trend. So if you recall, in 2016, we bumped up against our 96 and we immediately when you part of that was commercial, we immediately increased rates, knowing it takes a little bit longer because the majority of those policies are annual, still continue to take rate in 2017 and 2018. 2019, we saw the competition was also taking rate during those time frames, but in the first half, that started to diminish a little bit, it's picked up at the latter half of 2019. I would say for Progressive we took less than a point of 1.5% rate increase in 2019. We will likely be a little bit more aggressive in 2020 as we see specific things and last trends increase. And part of our, in terms of the 17% or 19% on BI trend. Part of that, too, we are having a mix shift to our four higher transportations, which are higher severity. So it's one of the keys. I talked to John Barbagallo. He sees three states very specifically where we see loss trends accelerating. And so we either already have smiled or in slaves rate increases and in addition to that we have three states, those things three states, we have multiple variations of underwriting restrictions. So as an example, we have a 9.6% rate increase going in May in California, we'll watch those closely. And again, when we think growth and profitability, if you have to make a choice which we never want to, it's always going to be profit. So want to show really, really great at our solid results in commercial, especially compared to the industry. We will get on anything we don't see quickly, and make sure that we meet our profit targets. Do you want to add anything? John Sauerland : We're going to ask Gary to come on and talk about reserves. I'll fill in well he makes his way with two thoughts. So one, it's important to take a little step back when you're thinking about trends, frequency and severity, and look at the longer term trends. We think in aggregate our severity trends are normally very consistent with the industry and frequency trends, we actually have been enjoying bigger drops in frequency more recently over the past three years actually, than the competition. Tricia mentioned some of that is due to writing more preferred mix of business. I would offer we also believe that is due to more robust underwriting we put in our upfront process in binding new business. We think that's had a lot of great outcomes in terms of avoiding risks whose intent is not to ensure but to prefer. So longer term severity sort of where the industry is frequency better than the industry is it also offer where Tricia was mentioning on the commercial side matching price risk, we are also very agile in the personalized side and was certainly continue to make sure we are matching prices that we perceive should rise and at least on the liability side due to the trends with risk as fast we can. Julia Hornack : Okay. What are your thoughts? Gary Traicoff : Well, I think this is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. Hello, everybody. Tricia and John gave a great overview and description. With respect to reserves, as you know, we developed unfavorably last year, about $232 million, which was six tenths of a point on the combined ratio. And that development was primarily related to the increasing injury severity trends that we were seeing and led to unfavorable case development. We recognized that early in 2019. And over the course of the last three quarters, we increased reserves from actuarial changes, roughly about $60 million. So we ended up going up about $186 million during 2019. And in addition to that, our claims adjusters continue to strengthen reserves, through natural movements as well. So when we look at overall, with some the changes that we took, we know in an accident year basis are up about 12% for commercial auto year-over-year , and 6%, or personal auto that would be lost and LAE for liability, which you probably noted in the annual report. Of course, LAE is a little bit flatter. So on an indemnity side, we're a little bit north of that. And when we think about how development is occurring recently, last year, over the last two quarters, we did develop slightly unfavorably about $20 million, of that $230 million that we saw come through two tenth of it was in the first half of the year, and a much smaller amount during the second half of the year. In January, we ended up developing unfavorably about $78 million, which was a little over two points on a combined ratio. In January, though the development was really related to some other areas. We primarily developed unfavorably due to December claims that were reported in January. When we look at our injury case reserved development between personal and commercial auto combined, we actually developed slightly favorably in January. Now that's just one month. So it's hard to say that how the future will go. And I definitely can predict how we see development and for the year of the changes that we take during the year. But as you know, as the year plays out, primarily, the development we see on the injury case reserves are a main driver of what we end up seeing. Julia Hornack : Great, thanks, Gary. Gary Traicoff : Okay. Thank you. Julia Hornack : So, Jason, now, can you please take the first question from the conference call line? Operator : Certainly, your first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey, thank you for all the details. My first question is on any potential impact from the current situation with a coronavirus. The New York Times has come out and said that they're seeing just recently ad spend fall fairly materially across the brand with [indiscernible]. Curious if you think Progressive should in the near term is or is this at this part of that? And also, are you seeing any impact maybe from your [indiscernible] drivers on lower frequencies, if people are maybe working from home? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Mike, that's a great question. So I'll start with ad spent. Right now, we're going to continue to spend -- this as a prime time of the year when people are buying insurance we're getting into that season. So, we'll continue to spend. That we have some flexibility in. But again, whether you drive a little bit or a lot, you still are required to have auto insurance. And so, our intentions will be to spend as long as we feel sufficient. So again, we'll have to be nimble because all of this, as you know, is ever changing. The great question on the UBI, so with the recent death in Washington, we asked the UBI team just to take a look at UBI, vehicle miles driven or traveled by week in January and February this year, compared to the prior 2 years. We are not quite seeing a difference. And again, there's very little data, but that tells us we haven't seen it yet. Again, now then we'll look at it weekly, we can start to see that we'll look at it across the country where we can. So we'll be able to understand pretty quickly. If you go back to something like the financial crisis, I was running planes to time and we saw frequency need drop really quickly. And so we'll have some good insight, we get our frequency data on a daily basis. So we'll under very quickly where we're at. From a vendor perspective, we always think of the concerns around auto parts that are possibly made in China. So we got our property process team talked to all of our vendors, the percentage of always that we use on our vehicles, the percentage they get from China, et cetera. For the most part with the exception of one OE, we feel like there's low risk at this time. And even with that partner, they have inventory. I guarantee it's always so it's like first and second order effects. So it could be that more cars are told, because you can get parts and then there's used car parts. So if we're going to keep watching that. From an internal perspective, we already have over 25% of our people working from home. We have had many team meetings. We're having a table top pandemic exercise tomorrow, I believe and then our Chief HR leader, Lori Niederst had a meeting yesterday with our Chief Medical Officer talking about the same things that most companies are talking about in terms of non essential travel and what to do if you're coming from a country that's been affected. So, right now, we aren't seeing any effect. But again, this is such a moving target that we have a lot of data points that we're going to be looking at literally on a daily basis to understand how will it affect possibly our frequency? Mike Zaremski : And lastly, just a follow-up to the actuarial comments at the end of the prepared remarks. I believe, you said that January's reserved problem was worse than I expected, it was fairly material. And are you saying that, that was mostly due to December flames? And maybe people just to make due to the holidays. And then you said in January exit was actually favorable, and for that just implies that just last year's loss ratio was worse and then forward-looking basis things looks a little bit better? Tricia Griffith : Gary, talking about that, but partly was the December loss is like reported. Gary Traicoff : Sure, sure, great question. So in January, we were about up to 78 million pretty much all of that really related to December claims that were reported in January. And we look at it throughout the year. So when we look at January claims, they come in February claims that come into March, et cetera. Some months were high, some months were low. It's really noticeable in the first month, because it's prior year coming in. If we exclude that those late reports that came through, our development pretty much was rated right at zero. In addition to that, if we looked at just injury case reserves, which was the primary driver of the unfavorable development last year, we actually were slightly very close, but slightly favorable in January. So those claims as they paid out came in a little bit below the initial reserves we had. Again, that an indicator that that's how the year-ends up, but that's what we had in January. Tricia Griffith : Well, Gary, over the years you've shown us that that one data point in January, and how it evolves is very different, in every year you show us a comparison of three years or four years, and so what I would say Mike is, one data point strengthen it we have sort of -- oftentimes the December late reports, but I would say we are all over this and feel good about where we're at, of course we'll react quickly or should we need to strengthen. John Barbagallo : I can put it in perhaps simpler terms in combined ratio points. So, simply because we're turning the page what Gary was saying, we're going to see some losses we categorized as prior year every January. We are 2.2 points of prior year losses in January this year, last year we started out the year with 4.8 points, that was a lot higher than we normally see but as Trisha was mentioning generally speaking in January you're going to see some prior year development and the 2.2 doesn't concern us at all. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Okay, great. So, again maybe possibly. Julia Hornack : Jason, we'll take the next caller from the conference call line, please. Operator : Certainly, your Next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, yes. I was hoping, Tricia, you could provide a little bit more info on your outlook on the personal auto reading environment. It sounds like from some introductory comments that you continue having to expect on pretty modest rate movements I guess throughout the majority of your book for 2020. But has anything changed or maybe in some specific states where you're taking a little bit more rate? Tricia Griffith : Great question, Elyse, we'll continue to look at that as it evolves. It's really hard to kind of have that crystal ball. So, we last year and most of the industry knows, some took some overarching rate decreases. People were taking a little bit of decreases. People want to start to grow a little bit. We're seeing less of that the industry is getting closer to 1% at this juncture. We are very surgical in each stage, like we study each channel, each product, and we'll react to that as necessary. We feel really good where we're at in terms of our profit margin. But I talked to Pat Callahan, our Personal Lines leader all the time on specific states and what we need to do to strengthen it. Again, we don't want to get behind. It's really important for us to have stable rates for our consumers. And so, we're going to take that 1% or 2% to make sure we reach our target margins. But we feel really good specifically on the direct side of the new business coming in, we have new business targets as well, and we feel really good about it at this juncture. Again, I feel like we are really nimble when we need to be, should we need rate. But we feel good at this point and again point here point there depending on what we're seeing in specific states. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then, my second question, could you just provide an update on the small commercial side of things, you guys were kind of a rolling out some products in one state and then the expectation was to maybe expand into more state. Can you just provide an update on where those initiatives stand today and then how that's -- how you're thinking about additional steps and rollouts throughout the rest of 2020? Tricia Griffith : Absolutely. So, in mid-2019, we rolled out Ohio, like, literally small -- five agents, trying to figure out was the product ease of use, etc., got the thumbs up, got some feedback on pricing, rolled out to Ohio and three more states in 2019. Since then we've rolled out two additional states in January, two more in February. We expect to roll out two more in March. And so total for 2020 should be in 15 states. We've bought 2,000 agents selling small business, and we are really excited about the momentum. And so, this was something, as we thought about the three horizons, think about investing before you need to, to make sure you have that enduring business -- we started thinking about this a couple of years ago, and we're really excited actually about small business, both in the agency side and through our BusinessQuote Explorer. And we'll have the Progressive product hopefully on the BusinessQuote Explorer some time in 2020. We have many different unaffiliated carriers, partners that we work with and we continue to be able to give the small business owners what they need. So I would say the one word about small business would be momentum. I feel really good about where we are. And actually really good about where we are with a lot of the topics that John Barbagallo and Karen Bailo went over a couple of quarters ago. We rolled out our small fleet program to 49 states, and the conversion has increased fourfold. Obviously, our relationship with both Uber and Lyft in the TNC has increased. So we're excited about that. Just like across the board, I feel great. Our Smart Haul program is showing great conversion -- great take rate, I should say. So that's our UBI. In commercial, and in fact on the agency side, where the customer is eligible, the take rate is 25%. So I would say commercials firing on all cylinders, small business and everywhere. Do you agree? John Barbagallo : Yes, absolutely. And I share that excitement. Just for clarification, for all viewers, when we're talking about the rollout here, we're talking about business owners' policies in general liability. So, as Tricia mentioned, we got in the four states in 2019, we've elevated two year-to-date, and we expect to actually add about 15 states for this year, so ending the year maybe around a little over 20 states. And again, this is intended to vastly broaden our addressable market for commercial lines. We've been number one in commercial auto for a number of years now, and this opens up a marketplace that is probably 2 times, perhaps even 3 times the size of commercial auto for us. So very excited about that growth, as well as the plethora of other great things we have going on in commercial lines. Tricia Griffith : Yes. When you think about bundle customer with BOP NGL, and then you think across our channels as well, there are many small business owners that actually also have our auto and home. So as we think about that we really think about the household economics going forward. That's really what's exciting as well. Thanks, Elyse. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Phillips : Thank you. Good morning. I guess, as sort of a continuation from that last question in a different angle. A large part of your earlier comments on the slide presentation this morning was on the agency channel and that's where the Robinsons lived. So with the focus there because of that, can you talk about any maybe incremental help that that does more -- more focused on the agency channel that that helps you with your commercial lines offerings? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So many commercial -- whether it's small business or commercial auto, actually go through the agency channel. So a little bit more of a complicated product, so that's actually a much higher percentage than would go on the direct side, although we believe at some point we want broad coverage -- or actually now we want broad coverage for everything. So, I believe, as I talk to agents there are some agents that are only personal lines, some are more commercial. But there's many especially large agencies we work with that are both. And for them to have access to all the products they need for that customer whether they have a small business and they're auto and home is really a great umbrella for all of them to serve their customers. And that's what they want to be able to do. And so I think it's really important in the agency channel because it is still a little bit more complicated. So if you think a person who is opening their first business, they want to make sure they're protected, they want to be educated, that is nicely done through the agents. So we're very bullish on that as well. Michael Phillips : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then I guess back to frequency on the personal auto side, how does that vary by, I guess, age of car and model year? And maybe the reason to think about that is, is there a continuation of continued frequency to the extent that it's maybe more of the recent car years versus the prior ones? Tricia Griffith : We can't really assess that based on -- we look at it mostly based on customer. So from a preferred to a non-standard who are more likely to have accidents or we look at it in terms of the demographics of, are you a mature driver or are you just learning to drive, so that's how we look at frequency rather than types of car. And what I said is, it's really hard to attribute very specifically to frequency, but we do believe a piece of it is more of our preferred customer who likely have less accidents. John Barbagallo : Yes. And as Tricia was saying, diagnosing exactly where the frequency is driven, meaning, by the driver of the vehicle, the environment, all that it is very difficult. That said, if you're focusing on model year vehicles, certainly newer model years are driven more miles than older vehicles, and we've been growing a lot and we've actually been increasing our share of those newer models as we write more and more preferred business. So the fact that our frequency is down in the same time period, the trends that I just described there, makes us pretty confident that we're writing the right preferred business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Good morning, everybody. My first question goes to the partnership with the ridesharing companies. Is it fair to think of the incentives as not necessarily fully aligned, namely, the ridesharing companies I would think are very focused on growth, would probably be interested in settling claims as quickly as possible, maybe not necessarily pushing back as much when you guys may think it is necessary. And if it is, if that line of thinking is correct, I guess how do you manage that risk for that misalignment of incentives? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So we -- actually that hasn't been an issue. We fully handle the claims. They're completely done in-house. And the great part about Progressive that I've always felt, especially having my upbringing in claims is we really haven't ever even differentiated between an insured and claimant. Every customer is a -- every consumers, possible customer, etc., and so we settle fair and accurately. So we don't get pushed back from them. I haven't heard anything about that. What they want is somebody out there getting their drivers car back on the road so they can make a living, and if there's injuries, making sure we're fair and settle those. So we haven't had that issue. I think they look for partners that have a world-renowned claims organization like we do. We have feet on the street because we have local presence and so it's really worked for both Uber and Lyft. And all the feedback has been that we do a really great job in that. And that's how I see it in terms of -- they want to have the claims handled by somebody who has a history of doing the right thing from indemnity perspective and that are also cost conscious from an LAE perspective. John Barbagallo : And from a financial perspective, I'll point out that in both of our ridesharing relationships, there's quota share agreement. So in both of those cases, those companies have captive reinsurers that are part of their organization, and we are ceding premiums losses. So they are sharing in the financial results that we are experiencing with the other drivers. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then my second question just goes to bodily injury severity, maybe broader terms. So can you maybe talk about what accident years you saw the increase in bodily severity coming from both in personal lines and in commercial? Tricia Griffith : Oh, you probably have to help me on this. I would say if I need to guess, well, he is looking it up or you can't -- more like 2017, '18, where we're starting to see it develop. I can't say for certain without looking that up. But again, those trends do develop a little bit more over time. And I know -- off the top of my head, that's what I would say. John Barbagallo : Of the $232 million of prior year development, approximately $131 million was from 2018, $73 million from 2017 and the remainder from 2016 and prior. We detail all of that in our annual report. Tricia Griffith : Like I guessed, that's what I guessed and luckily I was right. Great. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And those ratios are relatively -- distribution between those accident years is similar in commercial lines and personal lines? John Barbagallo : I think it's safe to assume that. Actually, don't have those numbers to quote for you. But generally speaking, older accident years have already developed previously, and by a large part, they have settled. So we also provide in the Annual Report loss triangles where you can see where we picked, if you will, the loss reserves at the end of the respective year and how that develops over time. You can also see the percent of those claims that have been paid, and obviously on physical damage claims, those get paid very quickly in a bodily injury. You can see that development. But especially on the personal side, those bodily injury claims will certainly take longer to settle than fixing a car, they developed fairly rapidly. Commercial lines a little longer. But you can see all that in the annual report. It is safe to assume that prior year development is predominantly from the most recent year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. Your line is open. Gary Ransom : Yes. Good morning. You mentioned briefly during the presentation about the direct side of the homeowners business. Can you talk a little bit more about why that's growing more rapidly, what kind of customers, whether it's bundled customers that are coming in on that side as well, or any other comments you might have on the direct growth? Tricia Griffith : And so we've grown -- I think I've talked previously -- and we're going to have one of the upcoming quarterly webcasts sort of a spotlight on our Progressive Advantage Agency. So in our Progressive Advantage Agency, we have Progressive Home, along with many other unaffiliated carriers. And that we were able to really have broad coverage for the customers that come in. So maybe Progressive Home doesn't want that risk, but another company does. So we're able to really -- we have a very low D&Q rate in there. So we're able to bring that in-house. We've grown our Progressive Advantage Agency substantially in the last three or four years, and that is one way where customers want to come in. In addition, we have HomeQuote Explorer that we developed a couple of years ago where you can go online, and we also have Progressive Home as well as several other unaffiliated carriers. And we have a buy button with that in 14 states. So when you're able to go on and actually purchase, I think it's really important, and we'll continue to roll out more and more states with that. So I think it really is customer preference, and that goes to our strategic pillar of broad coverage. And if you feel comfortable -- and the great part about HomeQuote Explorer is that we're able to gather a lot of information from publicly available data to make the quote really easy, and especially if it's a pretty simple basic home with things that we are able to get, they can get it done really quickly, and some people don't necessarily want to go through an agent. So we've got both areas growing rapidly, but it's really great in the direct cycle because a lot of people want to go either on the phone or online. Gary Ransom : Can you just expand on that question on the -- moving it into commercial as well? On the commercial side, it also -- you're growing more rapidly on the direct side as it says in your K than in the Agency side. Is there any characteristics of the customers there that are bringing that growth stronger? Tricia Griffith : Yes. It's also on the base. So BQX is fairly new as well. The customers are -- the similar type customers. It is more complicated. I wrote in my letter that I sat with a BQX rep and it gets really complicated when they start adding different coverages that they want. So we feel like right now that we can accommodate about 70% of the small businesses. And that's why we're going to continue to have more and more partners and then ultimately have the Progressive BOP GL in our BQX. I would say BQX is less mature than HQX, HomeQuote Explorer, but they're doing similar things that we did several years ago in the personal auto side, and that is build in-house agency, utilize partners so we can cover many different types of small business owners with different products that we may or may not write on our paper. So I think that's a really important part. It's the similar thing. We want that bundle. So where we believe will have longer tenure commercial auto partners is if we have more of their commercial needs. Same thing on the personal line side. John Barbagallo : Now, one thing I'd offer to add to that, Gary, when you're looking at the premium mix numbers, direct versus agency for commercial lines, you should be aware that we categorize the rideshare partners business as direct. So those obviously are pretty significant premium relationships, and as we add those in that states, you're going to see that growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great. I just want to start by thanking you for the enhanced catastrophe disclosure and maybe more importantly for the responsiveness. Tremendously welcome. Tricia Griffith : Our pleasure. Meyer Shields : This is a bit of a leading question for Gary. When I look at the triangles in the 10-K, the age-to-age factors for auto liability, agency, direct and commercial, they are all speeding up, and I was wondering what that actually reflects. Tricia Griffith : Yes, sure. Gary would be up in a second, Meyer. Gary Traicoff : Hi, Meyer. Now, when you are relating to that, are you looking at the paid or the incurred? Meyer Shields : Paid. Gary Traicoff : On the paid side? Yes, so on the paid side, there is a couple of things going on, right. There are definitely some states where we are seeing a speed-up in closure rates, particularly 30 days, 60 day, 90 days coming in as well. And then on the incurred side, you may noticed some changes. What we have seen is our adjusters we feel are recognizing larger claims quicker and so they are recognizing those claims and we're seeing the numbers come up quicker, which would mean theoretically then we would see lower development factors on the paid and incurred later in the triangle, right. And so that's some of the subjectivity that's coming through now where we're seeing that speed up early. And then the question is, how much of that do we think will materialize later on where it backs off as it develops to ultimates. Meyer Shields : Okay. No, that's very helpful. All right. Thanks. And then second question. This is completely unrelated. I want to understand the thought process of raising deductibles in the health space and changing the coverage instead of pricing for the specific option that the customer would want. Tricia Griffith : Well, part of it is, if you have a 20-year-old roof, you couldn't have rates enough to cover that if someone has a hailstorm and we replace that fully. So we tried to create different coverages that put skin in the game. It's been really difficult with vendors out there. We'll go through the storm process and you can see it as they develop, they'll go through, and you're knocking on the door and you're making sure don't you need new roof, your insurance company should pay for that. So we're trying to always pay fairly, always do the right thing for our insurers but have some skin in the game that you don't just replace your roof every single time there's a hailstorm when there isn't damage. Or when there is slight damage that isn't actually changing the structure of the roof product. So we'll see how it goes. To price to a health state would be no growth, I believe. So we're trying to be creative in our product development. Meyer Shields : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Julia Hornack : Great. I'm actually going to take a question from the webcast. So it's about policy life expectancy, an important topic we haven't really talked about yet, and I got a couple of questions about it. So particularly in direct, what is causing the decline in policy life expectancy both on a 12 month and three month basis? Tricia Griffith : Well, a couple of things. We had gone over a process that we changed a while back, and occasionally we have that happen. There is another one that we're doing that I don't want to talk about for competitive reasons that will actually negatively affect PLE but we think it's the right thing to do to have the right customers on the book that are actually we can make money on. And also, it's been very competitive. So rates have been really stable and there's a lot of advertising out there, and it's really easy to change. And there is a lot of consumers that are just price sensitive, and they shop all the time. So they're going to shop the likelihood they can find a lower rate with us or some of our competition. I will say -- and of course this is one data point, that -- and PLE has lagged. The December development has actually increased in both the trailing -- the appeal in the three month and the 12 month. Again, I don't want to say that that's the future. We look at that as a possibility. We look at PLE very specifically with nature, nurture and price. So nature is our mix of business, obviously we want more of the preferred business. Nurture is how can we take care of our customers? We are investing a lot in the CRM organization around sort of N=1 personalization; how can we be there for you, you particular -- communicate with you in the way you want. And then of course price is the competitive landscape and the ease of going back and forth. So those three things we look at from PLE. We continue to have a team that works on PLE. I mean, the executive sponsor for that and we've -- we've changed leadership to make sure we look at all different angles. And in the spirit of question everything, we look at PLE and we'll continue to look at that externally overall. But I think there are some cohorts that we believe that we can increase PLE more substantially than others. An example would be, there are some Sams that we call -- some, not all, that are just inconsistently insured, and we love them. That's how Progressive was born and as long as we can make our target margin, we're great. But they might go. And will we ever really make that go from X to Y. But we'll always treat them nicely and occasionally they become Robinsons. But there are the other cohorts that we say what are other things -- why are you leaving, what are other things that you need from us on the nature, nurture or price. And so that's what we're working on. And internally looking at PLE from very different cohorts, so PLE ex Sam, PLE when you have auto home umbrella, all those things, and we're starting to really gain some traction on how we think about household PLE. Julia Hornack : Great, and unfortunately, we've run out of time today. So I'm going to kick it back to Jason for the closing scripts. Thanks for joining us.

These documents can be found on our Web site, investors.progressive.com. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith will make some introductory comments, Tricia. Tricia Griffith : Good morning. Before we open up for your Q&A, I'd like to make just a few remarks of how Progressive has responded to COVID-19 because I'm extraordinarily proud of my team and the nearly 43,000 people that make Progressive incredible company and culture that we all enjoy. As you know, with our incredible growth over the past several years, I've had the opportunity to welcome thousands of new people into progressive. I take an hour to meet with new hires and talk about our core values in our culture. I sometimes struggle describing our special culture because it is somewhat indescribable. So I usually say that it becomes crystal clear when something really great happens or when there is a crisis. This unprecedented situation has allowed all of our Progressive family to visibly live our core values and completely understand why this is such a unique place. The actions we've taken for both our employees and customers have absolutely created and reinforced their loyalty to Progressive. Let me walk you through a few specifics. We immediately determined the needs of each of our constituents and started to develop plans forming teams to address each party. We've named the program, the Apron Relief Program, a nod to our brand icon it symbolizes protection and strength. Let me start with our employee base. We knew we needed to get the majority of our employees home to be able to work and take care of our customers. We immediately put into play our business continuity plan to protect our people. Currently, 95% of our workforce is working from home and for the employees that need to continue to come into the office, we've adjusted the workspaces to increase social distances, and we've intensified our cleaning measures. We also knew that even though every Progressive employee has a job and many of them have spouses and significant others that aren't as fortunate. In order to help our employees to have financial confidence, we paid our non-equity employees a portion of their annual gain share bonus in April. We also have created and committed $2 million to the Progressive employee relief fund to assist our employees experiencing hardships. Our employees have really appreciated the communication from every level of leaders at Progressive. I send a weekly video from my home and have literally received thousands of notes from our employees. I'll share one that will give you a sense of the sentiments. In a time of uncertainty, I want to let you know your videos in Progressive had been so encouraging and uplifting. I've never been prouder to be part of our Progressive family. I bleed blue and orange, but all that we are doing during this most difficult time to help each other and others is inspiring. Thank you for taking the time to be so honest and for opening your home and family to all of us. It's refreshing seeing you and your family's experiences are similar to ours. I love your journey through the years at Progressive and how approachable and friendly, I've always been. I know we try to be not what you expect an insurance company for our customers. But I'm very grateful and proud that is also for our employees. And I received so many of those. The customers that were privileged to serve need us now more than ever. We are providing premium credits of 20% to personal auto policies in force at the end of April and May, which amount to approximately $1 billion. In addition, we temporarily suspended cancellations and non-renewals on personal and commercial lines policy, paused collection activities and have deferred some deductibles. We also provided delivering meals for our 400 trucking customers, first responders and health care providers. I'll share one of the many comments we received from the first responder. I'm so impressed with Progressive and what they are doing about the COVID situation. You guys are really helping our customers and even providing food to our table. Thank you. These kinds of things make you want to stay with the company forever. For our communities we've given $8 million of donations to charities focused on hunger, health and homelessness. I recently received a call from Claire, the CEO of Feeding America, and she was so thankful that we were providing meals to so many who need them now more than ever. I also recently received a letter from Gail the CEO of the American Red Cross. I'll read a short excerpt. I wanted to reach out to you with a personal note to express my most sincere appreciation for the Progressive Insurance Foundation's recent and truly impactful gift to the Red Cross and powering the continued delivery of our life saving mission nationwide and then the Coronavirus outbreak. As our humanitarian organization continues to adapt to meet the new challenges presented by this pandemic, your generosity ensures that Red Cross is there to provide vital blood and disaster relief services to people around the U.S. who rely on us when they win help can't wait. We also care immensely about our partners and helping them get through this trying time. For our body shops and independent agent partners, it's about loyalty, but it's also about minimizing the disruption of our supply chain as we get on the other side of this crisis. For more than 35,000 independent agents, we are partnering with agent associations to provide over $2.5 million in grants to help agents address new challenges presented by the virus, and we're also administering internal fund to provide additional targeted relief to our agents. Additionally, we've made over $40 million available to agents by advancing performance bonus payments to more than 4500 of our agents. While the opt-in period is still open on today, we've had over 1600 agents opt-in for a total of $20 million. In addition, we sent $1,000 to each of our network body shops to use as a soft pad. We saw this is another opportunity to help when they needed it most and show them how much we value them. One shop owner called in tears to tell us how much that was appreciated. Lastly, we aren't sitting still and have our eyes focused on the future. In fact, we formulated three distinct scopes of work outlined under constructs we call resolve, return and reimagine. Resolve, first and foremost, we are addressing the immediate challenges COVID-19 presents to our workforce, customers, agents, communities and other stakeholders. Return, next, we are creating detailed plans to return business back to scale quickly as the virus evolves, lasting impact are more understood and effects become clearer. Reimagine, lastly, we have formed several teams under this category and the goal is to understand how the environment may shift and reimagine the next normal and how we can position ourselves to flourish. All of this to say our shareholders should feel very confident that we've got this covered for the short, medium and long-term. Our resilience is shining brighter than ever and we will come out of this stronger that I'm confident in. Thank you and now we'll take the first question. Julia Hornack : Jake please go ahead with the remainder of the script. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Tricia Griffith : I'm going to give Jake just a moment to allow additional callers into the question queue. But so I'll get started with the first question, which is can you talk about the current shifts in automotive automobile usage and potential shifts in automobile usage as the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and the resulting impact to Progressive? Well, absolutely, let me start with our usage based insurance data because it is continues to evolve as the shelter and place orders are lifted. So we saw abrupt declines in miles driven in mid-March. And by the end of the month and the daily driving for vehicle miles travelled was 40% lower than pre-COVID baselines. And then, in the first few days of May, we started to see some broad based increase in driving and I'll give you a little bit more on that. So last week, and we actually saw driving only down 14% countrywide versus pre-COVID. Now that changes and even up to this Monday we saw around 20%, 25%. So we are definitely seeing in states where the shelter in place has lifted we're seeing driving continue to be to increase and we're really following it on a daily basis. So I would say the level of data I'd normally don't show this level of data, but we're really literally watching it state by state and day by day to understand driving behavior. The reductions we're seeing are almost entirely due to changes in number of trips and not the length of trips. And I think, overall, I can't tell you what will happen in the future because these times are so uncertain. But the fact that we have this knowledge of the driving behavior, I think has been really important for us, as we understand sort of long-term trends. John Sauerland : I will just add to that, obviously, everyone is wondering how fast this company is back? Does it come back to the same level of miles travelled as pre-COVID, and we're obviously trying to assess that as well. We believe there may be some trends around lower usage of public transportation over the longer term. They're also think there must be some substitution effect from air travel to vehicle travels for longer trips. And we'll be watching this carefully over time. And if we continue to see opportunities to give credits to our customers, we'll do that. But we are going to take it on a sort of a month by month and a geographically specific basis. Obviously, our product managers at Progressive are a huge competitive advantage for us, while we've taken a broad swath to date. We think the right path forward is likely a more surgical approach to any further credits. Tricia Griffith : Great. Thanks for that date. Jake, can we please go to the first question in the queue, please? Operator : Our first question comes from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Tricia, you guys have done a great job over the years, this is a non-COVID question. A great job over the years of kind of becoming more efficient and lowering this -- your non-acquisition expense ratio. And I guess just curious over the longer term, how much juice you think is left in that, so you can improve that? Tricia Griffith : Well, it's hard to give a certain percentage Michael, but we will care deeply to continue to care about costs because, this is a -- it's a competitive environment. That has always been one of our four pillars when we talk about our strategy of becoming consumers' number one choice, so we'll continue to care about cost. And from a media perspective, we will spend media when we think it's efficient. This has been sort of a strange time because a lot of our media spend has -- is normally in live sports, et cetera. So obviously, in March, it went down a little bit because of that. But from an efficiency perspective, we are constantly thinking of ways to take unnecessary costs out of the system, to be able to have competitive prices for our customers. Can't tell you the exact amount but we talked about it all the time on my team. Michael Phillips : Follow up is just, I guess curious to hear your thoughts on how you think just the overall market, personal auto market pricing arm would be once we get out of COVID and kind of back to normal, maybe 2021 or whatever that is, but what you think the impact of this would be on a normal state back into the auto pricing market? Tricia Griffith : I wish I had that crystal ball. I think all the good companies are thinking about right now, getting consumers back, some of the money from the premiums because of the reduction in driving. Again, we're seeing that reduction go to less levels and we saw initially in March so we will price it. And one of the reasons that we did credits was because the fact that, we care a lot about segmentation and making sure that a lot of variables that we use, were price try and so we didn't want to kind of mess up that and I think all the good companies will do that and we will be competitive. And we will think about all the things that are important in terms of continued segmentation. So even during this time, whether it's on the personal line side or the commercial line side, we have been focused on continuing with our product models understanding right to risk, understanding our cost structure, making sure our brand has evolved and all those things together, I believe I can only speak on behalf of Progressive. I think we will come out of this stronger and be able to continue to capture share as we've had in the last 3, 4 years. Operator : We have a question from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mike Zaremski : In the last earnings release and I believe in the Q2 you talked about a 200,000 policyholders electing the billing leniency option. As of March 31, do you expect that number to increase a lot? And I assume that number was correlated with the kind of uncertain, I can't believe -- I can't recall you called it but a kind of maybe the potential bad debt expense you also charged you took in your March results. Tricia Griffith : Yes. So a lot of that is from the leniency and then we through March 15, we didn't cancel for non-pay. So, that we will expect that to increase, we're not going to share the exact amount. But here's what we're really trying to do. I think this is an important piece, Mike. In John Murphy's CRM organization, they're really working closely to personalize it with each customer. And we're trying to make sure that if they couldn't pay for a certain period of time, how do we get them back on track, we want people to be legal, we want people to have insurance, we want to be really flexible with each and every customer that happens to. So we have those 200,000 customers, that -- the payments will start to come due, we'll work with them to try to design coverage that they're able to stay, insurance insured with Progressive. And John Murphy's team is working literally many, many hours in many days, it's just to think about this in his team. And in fact, the CRM organization has been quite busy because we're doing a lot of personalization, a lot of consultation with our customers at this time, when they really need to understand how they can stay legal. And we actually have a couple hundred people from our claims organization who had worked in CRM at one point moving over to be able to counsel those customers. So retention is going to be as important as ever, we don't know how many people we will lose or that won't have insurance for a while. There's so many different variables in terms of what is happening in our customers lives, but our goal is to keep as many as we can and we are going to do that as much we can. And put so much work into that to make sure that our retention stays the same. John Sauerland : Mike, I will just add. Clearly the 200,000 is through the end of March and leniency goes through May 15. So we won't cancel anyone for non-payment or renew them through May 15. Starting May 15, customers will be getting bills that will be for the balance outstanding for the period in which we planned our leniency as well as the upcoming months. So, we will be working very hard as Tricia mentioned, our customer relationship management organization to make sure we keep those customers. If you're trying to estimate what bad debt write-offs were being through April through May that's a fair thing to do for sure. We're not providing numbers in terms of additional people that we are providing leniency to at this point, but it's safe to assume that it is more than 200,000 as of end of March. And it will be -- a difficult challenge, frankly, to estimate what portion of that we won't collect. This is unprecedented. Of course, we normally have bad debt expense routines, unexposed premium, those really don't apply in this case, it's very different situation. So we will be making some estimates. And the good news is, due to our monthly releases, you will have clarity around that for April and just a couple -- Tricia Griffith : May 20. Yes, I mean, we watched the hardships kind of unfold. And so, I mean, we care a lot about that. I have to tell you a story that just came to me yesterday. And this is back to my culture comment. Mike, so woman from CRM was talking to one of our customers that couldn't pay for May and we're talking -- she was talking through leniency and our CRM rep and I don't always want this to happen, but I think this is a beautiful story. Our CRM rep paid a premium for May out of her own pocket, which to me is like, that's an incredible tribute to our culture and having somebody listening to a customer and doing the right thing. Now, of course, I don't want that to happen all the time. It's an extraordinary example. I think is a good example of our culture. And we're going to do whatever we can to make sure that we understand the hardships going forward. And the most important thing is to make sure that people stay legal and have insurance and we hope it's a Progressive. Mike Zaremski : Tricia that's helpful. It's amazing that your colleague did that. Lastly, Tricia, I think you mentioned the gain share factor earlier. It's clearly a very important metric for your colleagues, when they think about their potential bonuses. It's also been an important metric for investors to gauge Progressive success, and I don't think it's disclosed anymore kind of curious why is that the case? Tricia Griffith : Well, we disclosed it publicly because it was correlated with our dividend policies. So we've had it internally forever when we change the dividend policy to have that reflected in our gains share score is a piece of the formula. We shared publicly. So we started not doing that when we changed the dividend policy last year. So what we did this year was we looked at the gain share for the quarter, we took in conservative estimates. So we didn't go to the full number that we thought it would be on basically to make sure that we gave the employees that needed most some of their bonus that we believe, is not at risk. Of course, again, we don't know what'll happen at the end of the year, lots of things can happen, but we won't share the gains share publicly going forward, especially since we have monthly earnings release. And we've also even gotten more disclosures on that in terms of caps and in our approach to how we look at caps on a monthly basis. Operator : We have a question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question is on new business. When you guys reported your March results, you had pointed to a good slowdown, kind of in the back half of the month as individuals weren't shopping on, even, during kind of the COVID situation. Have you seen any change in April? And then I guess, maybe combined with that question, because it's also on new business, we've seen others in the space kind of elect to give their refunds related to COVID in different ways, right, some just, sending money in the mail and some waiting till business comes up for renewal. Do you think that that kind of difference of, kind of refund, when it's given will also have an impact on new business, not just for Progressive, maybe that's more just industry comments as well. Tricia Griffith : Those are good questions, Elyse. So we have seen I'll have Pat Callahan, add in a little bit on this and John Barbagallo, if he want too as well because it's a little bit different during depending on the business marketing tier in commercial, but we have seen some uptick in shopping. Usually during disruptive times, you'll start to see that. Again, there's so many variables going on. So we know that a cohort of people in America have gotten some portion of their tax refund or their tax benefits from COVID. We've always seen shopping in times like this and we're watching it closely on the private passenger auto side. And in commercial, it's very different, if you're talking about business auto versus trucking, and I will have John Barbagallo talk a little bit about that. But the uptick hasn't been extraordinary, but we are seeing it, so we're taking every day to point to understand how during this disruptive time, we can have competitive prices. Pat, you want to add in some more detail on that. Pat Callahan : Sure. We definitely seen a rebound from the immediate lows during the shutdown or the shelter in place. We have seen a different recovery by channel as well, where we've seen a faster recovery on the direct side of the business than we have an agency because we expected agents offices are still somewhat disrupted. And, we do see just a lower recovery from our agency channel. Tricia Griffith : John, you want to? John Barbagallo : Yes, sure. Elyse on the small business side, the demand function is pretty well correlated with what's going on in the economy. So we saw very definite demand shocks. And similar to personal auto, we are starting to see that come back nicely. We're still on a year-over-year basis below where we'd expect to be, especially given what is normally a peak season, this is somewhat seasonal business, but we are seeing recovery. The other thing is, and Tricia alluded to this, different businesses were affected very differently by COVID. So, I'll give one example in our truck where we have good telematics data through our smart haul program. About a third of our truckers actually saw an increase in miles driven. And then they tend to be kind of drive freight agriculture, livestock calling, but about 7%, 8% of them completely shut down. So, if you're an auto hauler, you're not real busy right now. And, so we monitored kind of not only kind of on a state level, on a BMT level, but we even go down to kind of industry class codes. And we see things very differently. And they will respond to that, the data continue to emerge. Tricia Griffith : And for your question on sort of policy credits in our customer accounts, obviously, we have those April and May and we're always assessing, I went through the UBI data, we're assessing that more now on a state-by-state basis because of the different shelter in place orders and what will happen. And so going forward, I think that'll -- it'll be key for us to do what we do best in terms of by state, by channel, by product to understand the differences that have happened from COVID-19 and then react to those. It's hard to say what will happen from an industry perspective, because I think different companies handle it differently. But we'll go back to -- I'm really trying to understand it on a more granular level, depending on the state, the channel the product. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, you guys gave some good data in terms of seeing, miles driven by down around 14%. Last weekend, I think you said relative to kind of pre-COVID levels and then Monday 20 to 25, right? So still varying but not down as much as I guess like the tail end of March. You did see April kind of in line with the end of March, or did you start to see, I guess some of this not like returned to pre-COVID levels but a little bit of a bounce back and driving levels. Did you see that towards the end of April, or is this something that you just started to see in May? Tricia Griffith : That bounced back started about mid-April, mid to late April started the bounce back to about 25%. And right now, we think we're between 20 and 25. That 14% was specifically just to kind of show you like the detail that we look at for a weekend. So take Monday's data of this past Monday that was 21%. So we're right around that point. And again, it varies wildly depending on the states in terms of their restrictions. So if you look at a New York, it's very different than a Georgia. And so that's really how we're looking at it. The New York Times puts out sort of what's happening with restrictions being lifted. And we look at that and it seems to mirror some of the things we've seen. Of course, we don't have all the data that's in there, but we believe that's a correlation. So we think this next, two weeks, three weeks will be really interesting because so many states are starting to live, starting to open up and of course, depending on what happens with cases and testing that may change but I mean, just anecdotally, I was talking to Dan Mascaro, our Chief Legal Officer on Monday, and he went to hike in the metro parks in Cleveland. And he said it was so crowded. So you start to see this rare sunshine in Cleveland and people get out and they start to drive. And like Mike Johnson, we have a lot of theories that we play around with on my team to think about, okay, this summer, will people -- will you drive to grandma's house or to wherever versus fly? Could there be an increase in those longer trips? And of course, that has different frequency as well. So yes, I would say anywhere between right now we're seeing 20 to 25, but we started to see that mid-April. Operator : Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : I had a question about the premium median fees because I remember, in the past tracking non-payment of premium was itself an underwriting tool and I'm wondering whether that visibility is being dampened by obviously, I think necessary grace period extension? Tricia Griffith : Not sure if I understand your question. John, you wan to take that? John Sauerland : I think that I can try. If I'm off-base what are you trying to get to please redirect. So we do perhaps look at payment patterns on current and incoming customers as a portion of a set of data that we look at when we are underwriting both new business as well as renewals. Is that the direction you're taking the question? Meyer Shields : Yes. In other words, is it less predictive now? John Sauerland : Yes. So that's a great question. And similarly with our snapshot data patterns have changed dramatically relative to fairly normal and very predictable datasets over time. So, yes, that will be a challenge for us. We are making exceptions in our underwriting today around new businesses, especially where we can pull data sets from common sources that the industry contributes to look at previous insurance ownership patterns. And, yes, that's been disrupted. And in the near term, I think it's fair to say, there will be a period where we probably have to exclude over the longer term run. I think the snapshot or vehicle usage based data will fall into the same camp. So it's really difficult to read right now. But you're right that is a underwriting variable that we have used and I would say in the interim, we are redirecting a bit. But in the long-term, we think we will continue to use that -- the underwriting we've done we think, has been a huge benefit to us in terms of avoiding new business that we probably are going to price accurately. Tricia Griffith : Yes. Sorry about that Meyer. I wasn't sure about it. But, yes, I think we'll continue to use that. And I think it's also only one variable that we use when we look at the sort of holistic rates to risk. But again, during these times, there's going to be a lot of data that will skew things that we'll have to kind of understand as we think about pricing and risks going forward. Meyer Shields : Thanks. That was clear. So that's very helpful. The second question, as we seen the claim frequency decline, is there any offset in terms of maybe the gap between pre-virus average speeds and how people are driving now? Tricia Griffith : I've seen a lot of data around speeds and anecdotally driving here today, there was a lot of people that were going really fast because there weren't very many on the highway. So I kind of made a note of that. What we've observed is, so we looked at hard brakes for 100 miles driven and the percentage of trips with time with their phone in their hand, we've seen that increase about 10% to 15% after the post-COVID-19. So it could suggest that the miles are riskier. We are not seeing that in the claims data yet. So we're going to be watching that closely. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Couple of questions here for you. First, I'm curious, I know it's a real new product here for you. But the Atlas product, does it have business interruption coverage in it? And if so, do you have virus exclusions in there as well, and this situation at all, make you think about the design of your product and potentially changing it? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think you'd refer to as our Bob product Atlas service, yes, behind it. Yes. Well, so for Bob products, we have less than 200 of those policies that have business interruption insurance, and we have an exclusion for damages caused by virus or bacteria in those. We use ISO verbiage. So we feel like our risk is very, very low, less than 200 policies and we have an exclusion. I do want to say as long as we're talking about this, as a leader in the U.S., P&C marketplace, we're very actively involved in ensuring the COVID pandemic doesn't result in legislative or regulatory actions that permanently damage the voluntary insurance market and slow our nation's economic recovery. The U.S. markets heavily regulated and we want to ensure carriers provide essential products that comply with the applicable regulations. So when they're developing and filing these program, the voluntary insurance market relies heavily, we rely heavily on contracts sanctity, and that's a really important piece that we believe in. And we have to ensure that so that we have adequate prices for all included exposures. So when you think about the economic damage that is, is tragic for small business, we don't believe that fabricating coverage that doesn't exist on insurance policies is the right solution for this problem. That said, we have little exposure if any but as an industry, we feel very passionate about the fact of contract sanctity. Brian Meredith : And then another quick question here, with respect to your homeowners product and just curious, how do you deal with a situation where the insurance payment is tied with a mortgage and with respect to mortgage forbearance, so it may not be your decision with respect to -- when ultimately the insurance payment comes in. Could be that just the bank extending mortgage prevents? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I don't know if I have a specific answer to that. Normally, when its part of the mortgage, it's less likely to not be paid because it has to be part of that and so it's just a pass-through. John Sauerland : Yes. It's generally paid up front, in the mortgage. So while, the forbearance might postpone payments to the bank, generally speaking, the insurance hasn't paid upfront in that situation. Brian Meredith : Now I get that but I mean, if it's part of you would get -- you wouldn't necessarily get the mortgage forbearance and you may not necessarily get your premium? John Sauerland : While the premium again is generally speaking, paid upfront, so then the payment from the customer to the bank, the bank would be in that case, short on the money because the bank is generally recorded the entire insurance premium to us at the inception of that policy. John Sauerland : Yes. They would have collected via escrow and put a year of homeowners insurance aside exactly for these types of either late payments or forbearance, to escrow directly. Brian Meredith : Perfect, perfect. And just one quick one. How do you think about [indiscernible] in these types of situations? Tricia Griffith : Well, I'd have to watch it. I know we have a lot of history. But no history is like this. And so we look back and times like -- during the financial crisis, et cetera. And so we'll just have to follow the trends and then we're after them. Julia Hornack : Yes. If you let Yaron Kinar into the question please. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Yaron, your line open. Yaron Kinar : A couple of questions. One, you mentioned that frequency has started to pick up from its mid-March to mid-April trough. Have you seen any change in severity corresponding to that change? Tricia Griffith : Yes. The severity has been a little bit different for us. First of all, we report encouraged trends instead of paid trends. So for frequency, the incurred is more responsive and for severity both incurred and paid are more impacted by sudden changes in data. And so that may not be a true reflection of our trends. So, my opinion on severity right now, I can't necessarily tell, partly because the incurred counts distort the severity trends. Let me give you an example. So our property damage for the quarter was about 14% on severity trends. We think about 9 points to that, how to deal with trends that we've been seeing in the past, total loss repairables. What we think of the other 5% is really applied to supplement dollars that came in March from prior months, subrogation dollars from other companies from prior months. And when you apply those to March, they increase the encouraged severity. So we think that trend is a little bit different during the times where we have less incoming volume because the mix changed. So we do think that distorts that a little bit. John Sauerland : At the bodily injury severity even more generally speaking, as our inventory ages are reserving factors are such that we increase the expected cost of an injury claim, the older it gets. And we put those dollars into the current loss dollars each month, we're dividing by the incurred accounts for that month. So, to the extent new volume coming in is lower and we continue that inventory ageing on bodily injury and current severity trend is going to look higher. Tricia Griffith : Right. If you look at the quarter for bodily injury, it was about 9% and through February was 5%. We know that in March fewer incoming which increased the age like Jon said, there were more attorney but less lawsuits. So we think with our average age increasing the encouraged severity would be better than February. Yaron Kinar : Okay. So maybe I'll try else for a different angle, as miles driven or increase your number of trips is increasing again from the mid-March trough. Are you seeing speeding decreasing and maybe distracted driving decreasing? Tricia Griffith : Well, we talked about the hard braking and the phone in hand. So we have seen that increase, about 10% to 15%. But we have not seen that result in greater claims costs. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then my follow up is on new business that you mentioned in the Q that you saw a significant drop off in new business in, even the direct channel and in the COVID environment. Does that surprise you? And would you expect that to maybe pick up as people -- maybe as the environment stabilizes? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I didn't surprise us. We didn't really know how deep the initial decrease would be. But we've already seen it pick up from pre-COVID and specifically in the direct channel. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Mead with Anchor Capital Advisors. Stephen Mead : What do you see in terms of post-COVID from the standpoint of distribution, either direct or through the agency channel? And do you see that this period is going to in a sense, hurt the agency in spite of distribution and what kinds of adjustments are you looking at? Tricia Griffith : And so we are a big advocate of the agency challenge since half our business on the auto side more so on the commercial side, you're part of it, part of the decrease and then a little bit slower the increase in agency channel, just has to do with a lot of times people want to go in, sit knee to knee talk with their agents. On the small business, it's -- a lot of the society what's going on with COVID-19. But we're very supportive. And that's why we've been trying to find grants for the industry and then grants for individual agents that, that call us. So because we obviously have social distancing, our sales reps are making calls daily to our agents making sure they have what they need, we've responded to get some of them computers and printers and things they need to work out of their home. So I think, that they will try to get back to business as soon as the shelter in place are lifted in their areas. I can't tell you, if there'll be people that don't actually last through this. We certainly hope they do. And we're going to do everything we can to support that channel and all of our 35,000 independent agents. John Sauerland : On the direct side as we pointed out in the Q, advertising was up a lot for January, February, I believe 28%, down a bit in March. And Pat can maybe comment a bit more. We are a large advertiser on live sports. And obviously spend there dropped to virtually nil, overnight. And so that is part of the reason our advertising spend for marches are recorded less than 2% relative to previous March. That said, the desire to grow and the direct channel and we'll spend, what we call allowables and I think are continuing to find opportunities. Pat Callahan : Yes. I would build on that and just say that in the direct side, specifically, we are constantly evolving our media mix and testing and measuring into what's efficient and effective driving demand. So while we did see that that [trough] [ph] appropriately so focused on other things in car insurance, We are shifting to some more over the top in streaming services that people spend more time at home, some more digital than necessarily the mass media and finding select programming that we see significant spikes in viewership that we want to have Progressive brand position well. Now, on the agency channel, I think everything that Tricia said is absolutely spot on. The other thing to recognize is that that agents for the most part are small businesses. And the disruption to small businesses can't be overestimated and we do expect that the agency channel will come back just as strong as it was previously. And I think some of the digital capabilities that Progressive has invested in to help agents, both service customers and in the case of our snapshot usage based insurance program control their costs or match their costs to their driving will potentially position us well, to benefit from that rebound in the agency channel over time. Tricia Griffith : And a great part of Our CRM organization is that they take service calls on behalf of the agents. So even if they're at home, we're able to talk those agent customers through the same sort of situations as our direct customers. Stephen Mead : And just shifting gears. Any change or what's your sort of view of the investment side of your portfolio in terms of asset allocation or your approach to the fixed income side of investment? I'd be curious what you're doing, if anything? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I'll let Jonathan Bauer, who is our the PCM, President talk a little bit more about this. So, we talked a lot about their ability to protect the balance sheet and to get a total return that is compared to our index group. So that has not changed. Our philosophy on investing hasn't changed. Jonathan's been able to take advantage of sort of what's been happening in the economy and I'll let him give you a little bit of detail. And I will say risk, it's slight any risks that we've added during this situation. Jon? Jonathan Bauer : Yes. Thanks very much for the question. So, as Tricia mentioned, for us, the focus is always number one to protect the balance sheet, so that the operating business can grow as fast as it wants to grow. And then after that, to earn the best total return that we can, we were fortunate to come into the year with a very conservative portfolio. The group one measure that we use for our riskiest assets, which is things like stocks and high yield bonds was at its post crisis lows. So when this started to happen, in late February into March, we began to invest in things as you saw in 10-Q, high quality corporate bonds, the municipal bond market, which we do to tax changes in the corporate tax rate, have not very attractive over the last two or three years, as that market faced some outflows we're able to buy some very high quality municipal bonds and then sprinkled in some securitized products as well. So we decided to add within what we would label as high quality and the fixed income throughout the month of March, starting in late February. We think our position is still incredibly conservative in our portfolio, but we think that we got some great total return opportunities. And I think we stand in a really strong place as we head in through the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Philip Stefano with Deutsche Bank. Philip Stefano : Why don't you talk a little more about the operating expenses maybe we can put aside the advertising expenses, it feels like a pretty well covered. But are there just discretionary expenses in the business or levers that you can pull down at a time like this to maybe help support the expense ratio improvements that may come back next year or at least to offset some of the increases in allowance for doubtful expenses or other things like that to maybe neutralize the upside expense pressures, you might be seeing. Tricia Griffith : I think we always have different levers. And I think you've seen in the past when things have happened, where we've gotten closer to our 96, we've done that we're really not in that position now because of the margins. And like we talked about, we have the expense for 28 points for the doubtful accounts. And we'll watch and see how that continues to impact us through April. We are always looking at expenses and how to do more with less, et cetera. This is an odd-time, but I think once we get through this and things are back to normal and claims frequencies back to normal we will continue with our expense management. A lot of this, we learned about how many people work from home. And so initially, before the COVID happened, we probably had maybe about 10,000 of our employees or 43,000 employees working from home now we have 95%. As we think about returning, there could be an advantage for real estate, because many of those people will be very efficient and effective working from home, it would be better for them. So those all the things like that we will look at. And when I talked about that, sort of that third tranche of how we think about the future, we have five different teams working out what we call reimagine. And one of those is based -- it really talks about expenses and people and the workforce. And so we will look at all these things that happen and then figure out how to come out on the better end. As an example, when I was -- when during the financial crisis, I was the President of Claims and we have same situation were the frequency had diminished during that timeframe. And that's when we started learning about being able to do things virtually that you didn't have to be sitting necessarily in every office and we really started to consolidate and have right file, right rep right time. I believe we will learn a lot from these to continue to be more efficient. We care about that immensely. Philip Stefano : Interesting here is a bit of picking up the ride sharing business, have there been any interesting lessons that have come out of the decline of frequency broader, had the economics of the ride sharing business changed at all? Tricia Griffith : I have to let the people that run the ride sharing companies talk about that. We continue to be very happy with our relationships. And as you saw -- we had decrease in net premium written over about over 110 million on the commercial side. That wasn't surprising because we look at miles driven during a given policy period, and then we kind of trued that up with extra miles. And it's just clear right now, in fact those companies are saying you shouldn't necessarily drive. So I think, we'll watch and see if that comes back. And it really all depends, I think on how quickly once the shelter in place orders are lifted and people feel comfortable and more importantly vaccine. So I can't predict the future. But I'm not surprised that the decreases based on the restrictions in the States. Julia Hornack : Great. So Jake, we'll go ahead and take our next question from Mike Zaremski. Operator : Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Zaremski : My question and if I missed this, just please tell me, was on telematics, are you seeing any changes in adoption rates. And also does your telematics data give you any kind of potential competitive advantages with filings as we kind of come out of this, in certain states that might allow you to take in telematics data to kind of be more precise or agile in your filings in the future? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Pat, you can weigh in on this and John B even on your with your smart haul. We've seen the adoption, I think people are more willing to adopt UBI because they realize they may be driving less and that would be a good program for them. So we're hoping that continues, because we believe this is a really very powerful variable. There are some states that we are not able to use it, but those it's only a few. So we'll continue to have usage based insurance and we will continue to learn from it. So we're not sitting still and saying, we're going to stop at, UBI 2.0. We're going to continue to evolve that as we do everything. On the commercial side, it has been great like John Barbagallo said, we're able to understand that a third of our truckers are driving more summer driving number able to work with them to kind of get through this. And we're able to help support those truckers, and give them the discounts they deserve with that program or continue to evolve that program as well with something we call PROVIEW. That will be rolling out in this quarter. So we were very bullish on telematics across our entire company on both the private passenger auto and commercial side. So do you have anything to add, Pat? Pat Callahan : Sure. On the personal line side, exactly, as you mentioned that we have a lot of monitoring that's in place and we've seen some survey data that indicates that people are now more open to usage based insurance, so that potentially will drive adoption and help primarily in the agency channel where we still lag behind our direct channel adoption. But beyond that, we've also seen a higher take rate within our quoting funnel. So not surprising that people are looking to think a little more about getting a benefit from driving less and if they are thinking and looking forward to working from home for an extended period of time, they may think of Progressive as a leader and usage-based insurance as a good choice for them as they think about their future insurance needs. Now, from the state level filing perspective, one of the toughest decisions we have to make is with the uncertainty how we're pricing policies on a going forward basis. And I think Tricia highlighted some of the detail level data that we have. Our snapshot program gives us hundreds of thousands of daily monitored drivers across the country. And what that gives us at the state and DMA level is visibility into not only how is the recovery actually taking place, but then correlating those miles travelled with our actual claims data. And that's a really important thing to understand because the ramp down of miles was so quick that we saw them highly correlated when they ramped down, what we need to watch is on the recovery side, does the time a day and day a week of those vehicle miles travelled correlate with higher frequency events, so that we can price policies accurately going forward. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Pat. And Jon will you talk a little bit about smart haul and? John Barbagallo : So Mike, I would say on the commercial side, we're still fairly early in the adoption phase of both of our telematics products, smart hauls been out there longer. It has been very well received and had been doing very well. I can't at this point say has the adoption rate increase due to COVID. But I think one of the things we're learning with this pandemic is, truckers are affected very differently by what's happening. And this actually gives us the ability to kind of proactively have a conversation with them about making use of space adjustments their rate. We think that's something that has the marketing power beyond just what we're going through right now. So excited about that. Snapshot PROVIEW very early in the adoption phase that's more than just telematics base pricing and brings with it a host of additional services. We're pleased with how that's going as well. Of course, overall demand has dropped, as I mentioned earlier, but again, nothing there to suggest it would interfere with the adoption on that program. But, again, I couldn't tell you it's going to accelerate at this point in time, but we'll be curious to see how that plays out. Julia Hornack : That would appear to have been our final question, actually. So that concludes our event. Jake, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing script. Operator : Thank you, ma'am. That concludes the Progressive Corporation's first quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's Web site for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to The Progressive Corporation second quarter investor event. The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website, and we will use this event to respond to questions.  Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive's Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I will turn the event over to Mr. Constantine. Doug Constantine : Thank you, Jason, and good morning. Although our quarterly investor relations events typically includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use all of the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for a question-and-answer session with members of leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions may be found at investors.progressive.com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and our first and second-quarter's quarterly report on Form 10-Q, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of challenges we face. In particular, note that our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first-quarter includes discussions of the risks and uncertainties that we face, including specific risk factors arising directly and indirectly from the COVID-19 pandemic and these risks are further referenced in our second-quarter 10-Q. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments.  Tricia? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Doug. I really wanted to actually introduce you to everyone. I know this is your first IR call and it's in a weird circumstance due to COVID. But I thought -- I know you've talked to a couple of people over the last month or so, and I've really enjoyed working with you. A little history of this role being really additive for the person in it, as well as Progressive, as you all know, Julia Hornack took her talents to St. Pete for Progressive Home. Patrick Brennan was a prior director of investor relations, who's now our treasurer and Matt Downing is our HR controller. So we pride ourselves on movement around the company. We think this is such a good role for Doug at this time in his career, it really helps both analysts, investors, Progressive and the individual. So Doug, could you tell us a little bit about your career? Doug Constantine : Sure. Well, I've had the opportunity to work throughout the organization in my eight years at Progressive. Spent five years in Commercial Lines, where I managed five different states and included [indiscernible] team for two of our trucking BMTs. Also had an opportunity to work in national accounts, where I worked with some of our largest agency relationships. And most recently, I've been a Progressive Personal Lines PM, where I managed two different states. Really looking forward to working with many of you on this call, and I'll do my best to feel the huge shoes that Julia has left behind. Tricia Griffith : Great. Thanks, Doug. We are thrilled to be working with you. And of course, we do miss Julia. But we're glad to have you here. Jason, we're ready to take the first question. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you, good morning. My first question, I was hoping to get a little bit of color on how you're seeing frequency and also severity trending in July. Obviously, the trends in the second quarter were pretty favorable. And just as individual start going back to work and perhaps we see a rise in miles driven just due to folks driving for summer vacations, etc. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of how the trends are, and if they started to stabilize in a direction toward pre-COVID level? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. I won't talk about July, but I will talk about when we think about frequency, I'll state that June was lower than the full quarter at about 24%. So we are seeing them stabilize. We still -- it's very different depending on the state as well. So you can see vehicle miles travel go up. And then immediately, if things close down, they go back and forth. So we formed sort of a macroeconomic dashboard. We have a lot of data to look at that, and we react to that. And of course, I'll go into severity because the calendar period severity is very distorted by the drop in new features. So the mix difference compared to last year is very distorted as you see, unlikely with a lot of our competitors. They talked about this last quarter with PD. And remember, we report incurred versus paid. And some of our competitors report paid, as well as PCI. Same story on PD incurred, it's -- the supplements drove PD up about nine points. So when you look at those payments from prior quarters that were we're paying supplements on that frequency, the supplements in the numerator. And so those dollars are increased, where the incurred accounts are the denominator, and so that's where you'll see the difference. Same thing with BI, it's age inflate -- incurred severity about nine points this quarter. Average age of BIs are up about 7%, a little bit higher. So we look at the accident year trends being about 6 to 7%. PIP incurred is really reopens on supplements from PIP. And It accounts for about 25 points of frequency from -- again, from prior periods when frequency was normal. Now the oddest one in this quarter is really our collision incurred [indiscernible], and that is a -- the severity is negative on that. Mainly because when you look at Quarter 2 '20 -- or Quarter 2 '19, the frequency is down about 36%. And then as we thought about our plan because we had excess capacity in claims, we redeployed many different claims individuals. I think I talked last quarter about giving Ohio 100 members of our claims organization to adjudicate unemployment claims. We've also deployed claims people in our CRM organization as people are trying to kind of get their arms around their bills. We also redeployed about 100 people to our subrogation unit, which means that money is coming in. We have kind of full-court press on collecting money when we have liability disputes with our competition. And so that money has come in this quarter because we have 100 extra people actually doing that. And so that's really the -- how the severity trend has gone negative this quarter. So frequency, in June, we saw it abate a little bit to 24%. We'll watch it closely as things go, and we'll just react accordingly. Elyse Greenspan : That's helpful. And then my second question, it seems like players in the space have kind of responded differently in terms of rate changes, right? I mean we've seen rates slowing, but obviously, there's a degree of magnitude between the different players. Are you seeing the difference in rate taking and obviously, part of that -- part of that is impacted, right, by the rebates, which all depends on the different company. But are you seeing the rating environment starting to have an impact on your new business trends? It seems like new business trends started to rise in the second quarter kind of from some of the COVID lows, kind of that we saw at the start of the quarter. So I'm just wondering if the rating environment was having an impact or it is more just folks there just see more shopping going on independent of that? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean we're seeing more shopping, I think, specifically in the direct part of our business. And how we look at rates, when we took the -- when we had the credit, the $1 billion credit in April and May, that was sort of a, hey, we're -- this thing happened very quickly. COVID happened very quickly. We wanted to react. And now we're in the mode, really, we're back to grow as fast as we can at our target profit margins. But we're really trying to leverage, we believe we have, and that's industry-leading segmentation. So we are looking across the country, each product manager, state by state, channel by channel, product-by-product and being much more surgical when we're thinking about our rates. So as an example, in quarter two, we lowered rates and states that made up about half of our auto premium. And if you want to go from the beginning of COVID, take April through August rates that are in play, we'll -- we'll have reduced rates in 35 states that make up more than three quarters of our auto premium. That 35 states, that doesn't mean it's 35 revisions. It could be a few more because maybe we take smaller bites of the apple. I always think about -- think about segmentation and especially increasing rates, unless it's something where we need to react very quickly. I think about my predecessor, Glenn Renwick, who always said, three ones is better than one three. And so we are very, very surgically looking at each state and trying to determine the best rate to continue our growth and make sure that we also have our target profit margin. Does that help, Elyse? Elyse Greenspan : Yes, that is helpful. Thank you for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey, good morning, thanks. First maybe, Tricia, you did mention Michigan auto reform in your letter. Maybe you can kind of give us an early preview of kind of how you see it playing out? Like directionally, do you expect pricing to fall a lot? Are direct writers like Progressive maybe in a better position versus the agency writers as you guys can kind of blanket targeted customers certain discounts, just curious how we should think about that [Inaudible] does move the needle, and it's very profitable for Progressive. Tricia Griffith : Yes, Thanks, Mike. What I can say is we know it was -- it's a herculean effort to get ready for that event, and we were ready. I will tell you -- and this is, of course -- this is really early because it went into effect July 2nd. I can tell you that we are very pleased with results in terms of growth. Again, we're going to have to watch this closely because individuals are going to choose to have PIP as it was before and not. So it's a little bit early to tell anything. We'll have a lot more data next quarter. What I can say from just looking at the early results, from a growth perspective, we are pleased. Mike Zaremski : OK. So I'll put that maybe next quarter. Moving maybe to Telematics. We're hearing industry some participants talk about an increase of a take-up rate. And those industry participants are typically on the agency side. Have you seen any increase in uptake in either direct or agent for your Telematics program? Tricia Griffith : Yes. Mike, we have. We've seen it actually more on the agency side. So our direct side went up a couple of points, but leveled out. And of course, we already have a high percentage of take rate on our direct side -- and direct side. And our agency side, yes, it did tick up. And I think that makes a lot of sense because this is a great time to understand your rating equals one, and it's up about 12% on the agency side. So overall, about 40% on the direct side, about 12% on the agency side and so a little bit more than 20% overall. John Sauerland : And Mike, I would add that we have UBI in our commercial business as well. And take rate there is very strong. And we're seeing great trends around our for-hire segments in terms of their take rate and their own renewal rate as well. So we are broadening our UBI deployment and really pleased with what we're seeing in commercial lines. Mike Zaremski : And then, could you give us the kind of the recent take-up rate like Tricia gave us on personal or commercial? John Sauerland : We have not provided our take rate on Smart Haul and our commercial business. But I would just tell you, it's exceeded our expectations out of the gate. And the other thing I would mention is that these truckers are required to have the recording devices in their vehicles by federal law. So we don't have the barrier of getting a device into the car or getting an app downloaded. We get the information directly from third-party providers of those devices in the trucks. So it is a pretty good proposition to a trucker who can get a significant discount on a premium, which is a pretty significant premium. So again, I would point to those items without pointing to a number and say, we're pretty pleased with [indiscernible]. Tricia Griffith : And I would say, I think, John, we a few quarters ago talked about -- or maybe as Karen talked about insurance being like the top -- one of the top three costs for those truckers. I think that that is really important. And we've seen trucking increasing based on COVID. I will also add, John talked about Smart Haul. We also have Snapshot Preview, which is available for our business auto and contractors. And although we don't have the data, it gives same upfront savings and fleet management. But we're encouraging -- we're encouraged, I should say, with the demand, and we think that will only increase. And we have that in about 40 states in our agency channel so far. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hi. Good morning. Just a question on just the bundled business, the Robinsons. In the 10-Q, it sounds like you had some pretty good growth in the Robinsons, particularly in the direct channel, but it also looks like you had some good growth in PIP in the agency channel. Just wondering where we're at in terms of the mix, what percentage of your book is now bundled policies? And where do you expect that to get to? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So we're happy with our Robinsons growth. The agency channel is up a little bit over 18%, and the direct channel is up about 46%. I think our mix there is right around 10%, maybe a little bit lower. Our goal is to continue to have more bundled customers and so the goal is to have as many as we can. We want every auto customer in our book to be able to bundle when they have either a rental or a home, should that be other demographic. So we continue to push hard. You can obviously see it in our advertisement that we talk about protection in home. So our goal is continue to increase our numbers of Robinsons because we know they're stickier and give them reasons to stay based on the products and sources that we're able to provide. John Sauerland : And a little bit on that percentage. So a little higher in direct. We've been at it a little longer in the direct channel, but we've been really pleased with the Robinsons growth we've been able to achieve with Progressive Home, but that's behind where the direct channel is today. But if you blend them together, you come to a number, a little below 10%. David Motemaden : OK. Great. And then just my other question is just a higher-level question on -- just in terms of how you guys are thinking about miles driven and accident frequency. I know there is a lot of uncertainty, but just wondering what you guys are thinking about, will -- do you think that will ever get back to a level of miles driven and accident frequency that we were at pre-COVID and I guess, just how are you thinking you'll adjust given whatever environment you think we'll be in? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I'll start, David, by the caveat being, we really don't know because of all the different things that go into it. So schools reopening, cases going up, cases going down, vaccines, unemployment, work from home, all those things. So I'll start with that caveat. I will say with our Smart Haul data, we did see signs of congestion kind of flattening more recently. And we're starting to sort of look at data with that. And so we have some initial trends. And again, we're going to have to fine-tune these. So these are -- aren't perfect, but we're continuing to understand the measures of congestion, both on our Telematics on the commercial side, as well as our UBI on the auto side. So I'll give you a quick example. And again, these are going to change, but this is kind of how we look at it. So we've got -- vehicle miles traveled are up, not as up as much as they were this time last year. And obviously, losses haven't followed in particular. So we're trying to figure out the delta between those two. And what we have seen from a congestion perspective is that that does tell some of the delta. So on the UBI side, on the auto side, we believe that that congestion, the gap is about one point during morning rush hour and about nearly two and a half points on afternoon rush hour, which would take into account some of the differences in actually miles driven and accidents because less accidents happen when there's less congestion. Again, we're just digging into this as we have more and more. And the data changes and is very influenced about what states do depending on their rise or fall in cases. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great, thanks, good morning. Tricia, you talked in the past about how Progressive responds really quickly to frequency. And I was wondering whether there are any constraints. I mean, obviously, we're seeing frequency swing around a lot more than ever before. And from an internal perspective, are there stability considerations that would minimize the amount of rate change that you would pursue based on frequency? Tricia Griffith : Yes. It was a little bit hard to hear, but I think what you were asking was how we would react to frequency from a rate change perspective. I think we take all the data into account. Frequency right now is just so hard -- it's always hard to predict, but it's even more difficult now with all the different inputs with COVID. Again, I'll go back to our stated goal, and we're going to try to grow as fast as we can. We'll look at all the trends and try to understand surgically, by channel, by product, how to continue to put our pedal on that growth mode while making sure we have our profit target margins. We never want to grow and just -- and not also have that profit come with it. So that's an important part. We want to make sure that we have competitive prices and growth. So the predicting frequency is going to be a real challenge for us in the near term just because of all the different inputs that are in a constant state of flux. Meyer Shields : Yes, that's helpful. I was just wondering whether there is a limit to how much embedded frequency change you'll include in a rate filing just because of how rapidly it could fluctuate? John Sauerland : I can elaborate a little bit there. So a rate filing, depending upon the size of your state is going to look at data, sometimes going back a year, sometimes going back three years. But you're trying to project the trend going forward because you're trying to price to a point in the future. So you can look backwards, which we do. But ultimately, what we're trying to do is price forward. So it's a little tricky at this juncture given the anomalies we're seeing due to COVID. So it's a great question as to how much of that we actually include on a going-forward assumption basis versus exclude because we think it's a one-off that will not be in plate down the road. So it really depends upon the robustness of the program we're pricing to and I look forward as to what we think we're going to be experiencing when those premiums are in effect, which can be for the next year to two. Meyer Shields : Follow-up question on the homeowner side. I know in the past you talked about correcting maybe the pricing for non-cat weather. And obviously, weather has been pretty bad this year, so if you could tell us internally how that progress has -- or how that's been progressing? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean you saw the results. So we're -- we need to make sure that profit is a big part of what we're thinking about in terms of property. And so as you know, we have our new product 4.0 model that we're rolling out. The hail and wind that's happened from a cat perspective has been pretty -- very high. What we're concentrating on right now is to continue to have segmentation. So we continue to roll our 4.0 product out. In addition, we're making changes to the products. And that includes minimum deductibles and ACVs on roofs because that's what we see, especially in hail-ridden states. Underlying ex-CAT, we feel better about our movement in property. We feel pretty good about it, as well as the growth. But again, we want to make sure that we continue to roll out our segmentation. We want to continue to roll out minimum deductibles. And more importantly, make it easy for people to shop. So we have property in 45 states. Now in 17 of those states, you can buy through a tablet or a phone. So we're pretty excited about our investments in technology around that. John, do you want to add anything? John Sauerland : Sure. Yes. Unlike the vehicle programs, especially personal auto, where we've been getting rates more competitive. We're taking rates up in home. So the segmentation is really important. And I think we've got about 18 states out with our next-generation 4.0 product, which is fantastic. We're also increasing rates. We're taking them up almost 6% year-to-date. And we're obviously not hitting our profitability targets. But you also recognize that if you're looking at cat losses year-to-date, we changed from the aggregate stop-loss agreement that we employed last year, which was essentially a cat loss plus LAE ratio to a retention of 375 million of hail losses, effectively hail, wind, a nonnamed storm, and we're yet to hit that retention level. So if you adjust that, and if you assume that we are under the same agreement we had last year to a combined ratio that would be below 100, but still well above our target margins there, so we are taking actions, as Tricia noted, and we're also changing rates. Meyer Shields : Great, thank you so much. Tricia Griffith : Yes. In those 18 states on 4.0, I think 16 of them have the mandates that I referred to in terms of min deductibles in ACV. So we feel good about where we're going. We need to continue to concentrate on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open. Greg Peters : Good morning. My first question is around technology. I know you guys have been innovative with technology, but there's also been some new platforms that have hit the market like Root with usage-based insurance and lemonade and renters. Can you talk about your competitive position relative to some of these start-up companies that are gaining a lot of attention in the marketplace? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I feel like we're in a really nice competitive position for a couple of reasons. And we've had usage-based insurance for literally decades. And they've come in different forms, and we've continued to evolve as technology has evolved. So we have a lot of data to really understand that variable. And we continue to evolve. That's the best part. And it's not something that we sit still on. So we continue to evolve. I will say that start-ups are good competition because they're doing things that the consumers want. And we've always believed in the ability to rate a driver on their individual driving behavior. And so I think competition in that aspect is good. I think also where we have the benefit is in acquisition costs. If you are start-up, those acquisition costs are very expensive. We have a good base of auto customers, for renters in home, etc., and we're a known brand. So I feel like we're in a great position and we continue to add technology advances in our UBI, and I don't think you'll see that abated. John Sauerland : I'd just add a little bit to that. The usage-based model today that we predominantly employ applies discounts in the personal space basically at the first renewal point. We gave a participation discount upfront. Increasingly, we are getting that data upfront. And in Commercial Lines, we're always getting that data upfront and that's really the Root model. You might recall that, I don't know, five years ago or so, we rolled out what we called Snapshot Test Drive, which was a model where you get the driving behavior before you price the policy. We are doing that now with third parties that are -- such as OEMs, such as other app providers. And we are now deploying what we call Snapshot Road Test, which is a model where you download the app, we see your driving behavior, and we employ those discounts at new business, similar to our Commercial Lines model. So I think you'll gradually see migration to employing the driving data where available upfront and we think we're very well positioned for that transition. On the property side, I will point out that we have for a number of years now been the No.1 provider of homeowners quotes and the No.1 provider of renters quotes online. And as Tricia mentioned, brand is a big driver in all of the insurance space, and we think it is a key lever to have acquisition costs in a place that are feasible to make money over the long term. Greg Peters : And my follow-up question around your comments on acquisition costs. I realize you have the Snapshot product, the dongle, but then there's also a lower cost alternative of having the app on the phone. Can you talk to us about how the mix has shifted within your auto business from heavily Snapshot to more blended, where we are in that cycle and where we're going to get to? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think as we introduce the mobile device, that has continued to increase. I think it's easy. I think people get it. They can see their information more readily. We still have a fair amount that we're on the Snapshot dongle. I think as we continue to look at the model of senior information upfront, and we're very early on in that, and we haven't really even advertised that, we've seen a really high take rates. I think people -- I think a couple of things. One, we're trusted brand that understands UBI 2, the situation with COVID. I think people are going to -- want to give their data more and more, especially if they're not driving, and they're working from home more often. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you, good morning. Maybe a couple more questions on Telematics. First, when you look at the dongle versus the mobile app, do you find that they are equally precise and accurate? Tricia Griffith : I'll take the last part. John Sauerland : I think you're asking about the accuracy of the data from a dongle versus the mobile app, you're breaking up a little bit. There are differences, for sure. Technology, as you can imagine, continues to evolve in the mobile space and pretty quickly. So there are definitely differences, but we are very confident that we can adequately price folks based on the mobile data. And the data that is coming directly from vehicles is growing as well. And that's obviously as robust as you can get. So we're very comfortable between mobile and dongle in terms of ability to price accurately. And like it was just discussed, it is a lower cost option, and can afford also continuous monitoring, if we so chose to do that as well. So a little different, but not materially. So it's way I would characterize it. Tricia Griffith : Yes. I would agree with John. I would say when we look at the data we have for dongle also versus the mobile device is a little bit different as well because we're able to understand handheld versus hand free and not just -- in addition to the time of day, miles traveled and hard breaking. So we're also getting a little bit more data, but there's a little bit of a difference, but nothing that we're concerned about. Yaron Kinar : Got it. And then for the customers who do use UBI to [indiscernible]. John Sauerland : We're having a lot of trouble hearing you or understanding. Can you say that one again? Yaron Kinar : I'll try. I'm asking for the customers who sign up for UBI, what weighting do you assign the UBI data in the grand scheme of pricing those customers? John Sauerland : Sure. Sure. Some commentary there. It's very powerful rating variable. However, today, because not everyone takes the Snapshot option, we solve that last in terms of our algorithms. So we solve for all the other rating variables because all the customers will be rated on those rating variables and then we solve secondarily for Snapshot. So even though we would see it being our most powerful rating variable, one could surmise that if we solve for it first, it would be an even more powerful rating variable. But again, because we don't require everybody to take that option, we solve it last. Does that answer your question? Yaron Kinar : It does. But can you also maybe offer like -- does it account for like 5%, 50%? How important is it? John Sauerland : That will vary at the customer level. So based on where you live and the other demographics of the household, as you can imagine, for more preferred households, it's going to be different than for more nonstandard households, young, old, etc., and urban and rural as well. So we don't provide an absolute percentage for you. Yaron Kinar : Got it. Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. I was hoping, could you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape right now in personal auto? And particularly, as I look at your largest competitor on the direct side, they're offering discounts to kind of new and renewal customers instead of these credits. Do you anticipate that having any impact on your ability to kind of grow new business in the near term? Tricia Griffith : I mean I think everybody took a decision when we went through COVID on what to do and no one company had it perfect because the data was ever changing, it was very new. So I feel like GEICO is a great competitor. They took a different stance than we did in terms of taking the two credits in April and May. I feel very comfortable in our ability to continue to grow. And especially as the end came to the second quarter. So we've increased our advertising in auto about 12% this quarter. So that kind of tells you that we're very much in play for new business. We believe times like this, where there's disruption is really when we win in marketplace. And so we're -- although we hate the fact that this is happening to our country, we believe a lot more people will shop. And our goal is to have very competitive rates and great service once you're with us. Brian Meredith : Great. And then my second question is with respect to the Commercial Lines business, you continue to have some adverse reserve development in that area. Is that related to some of the shared economy business? And kind of what is your experience on that business? Is there any changes going on? Tricia Griffith : Well, the severity and the development is really -- it has been based on similar topics that we talked about before in terms of increased medical cost in the marketplace, higher attorney rep and newer features and then our mix of business going to for-hire trucking, which is a higher severity than business auto and contractors. And when you look at the quarter two reserve development in Commercial Lines, about 44 million really came from about four states, those states being big states. And so when you look at our overall -- year-to-date development overall, you can see Commercial Lines is the biggest part of that 116 million at 98 million. So we continue to watch that from the Commercial Lines perspective. Frequency is down as well. But we -- it's very much like I've talked about in prior quarters with specific states and those variables in terms of medical costs, attorney rep and our mix of business changing. Brian Meredith : So it's not specifically related -- it's not necessarily the rideshare-type businesses, it's just generally? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, T&C, we talk about our T&C, and we took our premium down by 29 million this month. So we're definitely seeing less driving, but in terms of the development piece, that really is about higher BI limits and our adjusters' reserve going up as well. It's a thing we talked about before. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Tricia, I was hoping you could share with us an actual average rate number for the quarter and also through the year so far? Tricia Griffith : I don't have it with me, but it's been -- it's pretty flat. I think our average written premium. The rate, you mean or rate of increase? Ryan Tunis : Average premium. Tricia Griffith : Between 1 and 2%. John Sauerland : Minus 1%. A little over minus 1% [indiscernible] for personal auto. Tricia Griffith : Yes, personal auto. John Sauerland : We've taken commercial up a little over 2% and property I mentioned was almost 6%. Tricia Griffith : Yes. Sorry. Ryan Tunis : Perfect. And then my follow-up is, I guess, looking through the 10-Q, in direct, you've got quotes up, but conversion rates down. I'm curious how you guys are interpreting because it sounds like you guys are being proactive in terms of making your rates more competitive. How are you interpreting your lower conversion rates? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean I think that when we look at -- we also want to add in new apps there. So our new apps in direct are also in conversion, we had some increased ad spend as well. I think conversion is down about 2% with quotes up 6%. It's -- the data is ever-changing because we do believe more people are shopping. But like I said, we spent more in the direct auto. And we feel comfortable with our new apps being up at 4% on the direct side and especially increasing toward the latter part of the quarter. John Sauerland : As Tricia noted, we are taking targeted rate decreases. So we have product managers generally who are managing a state or two, and they are very focused on where they sit competitively or watching conversion in their markets, and they're taking targeted cuts largely at this juncture where we think we should be more competitive and have room to take the rate again on a longer-term basis. Tricia Griffith : And again, I'll reiterate. For the majority of the states, the 35 states where we're taking targeted rate decreases, they're small bite to the apple to kind of see what happened. Some states needed deeper decreases, but we're really looking at, like John said, the average is between 1.5 to 2% decreases. We're looking at all the data that could be changing. And what we know from the past and what we've always talked about with rate changes overall is our customers want stable rates. And obviously, that can always happen when you need to get rate like we do in the homeowners product, but that's really our goal here to understand the data as it changes and just be lockstep with what's needed to be competitive and grow. Ryan Tunis : Thanks for the answers. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Phillips : Thanks, hey Tricia, I'm just curious on your thoughts on given the -- maybe the longer-term implications of the pandemic and stay-at-home and online shopping on how that might change the mix longer term of agency versus direct? And maybe, I guess, what used to be agency customers maybe more willing to become a direct customer? Tricia Griffith : Yes. It's hard to say, Mike. I think that we're obviously seeing more now and the recovery is faster in the direct business on both Personal Auto and Commercial Auto. I think about it almost like I would have never bought groceries online before because I go to my little suburban town grocery store where I see my friends and it's comfortable. Well, now I'm doing that. I see where people, one, because it is -- a lot of these customers, a lot of these agents, I should say, are small businesses. And so they're reacting to get themselves set up and socially distant, and some people might not be as comfortable coming in. So I do think it's definitely changing now. I think it depends on how long this goes and how comfortably -- how comfortable people are. But it does show, I think, especially on the commercial side, that people are getting -- and then the majority of our business, by the way, in commercial has been through the agency channel. People are more comfortable buying small business insurance, etc., on the direct side. So we have seen it change. I can't commit that it will be a long-term change, but I do think it could be one factor in having people be much more comfortable buying insurance across the board in direct channel. Michael Phillips : OK. And then separately on the bundled product topic that's talked about a lot by many companies. Can you say, if you've been approached more by other -- other insurance companies, monoline companies, have you been approached more today than in the past to partner with them to offer home or to offer auto when they don't have auto? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think we're approached a lot in terms of that. And in our HomeQuote Explorer and our BusinessQuote Explorer, we work with a lot of different companies, unaffiliated partnerships to sell our home to our auto customers through, not just Progressive Home, but many different carriers and the same thing on the commercial side. So yes, we obviously want -- we want to care about the values of those companies, the brand of those companies to make sure when we partner that we feel good about it. And we always want to expand those, if we think it will be better for our customers, to be able to bundle their auto, even if -- auto and home, even if it's not with us. So yes, I think -- we're approached very regularly. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Just one follow-up. I hope you can hear me better. I think in the June results, you said you were positively surprised by the renewal auto applications and lower policy cancellations. Can you maybe -- now that you have a month of hindsight, can you maybe talk about what happened there? What's led to the surprise? Tricia Griffith : Well, we're happy with retention. I think, obviously, during the COVID period through May 15th, for the most part, there were moratoriums on any cancellations and we had leniency going into play. And so we knew at some point, our customers on both the commercial side and the auto side would either have a big bill coming due or need our help to really kind of get through what could be a big hump and kind of get on course for their future payments for auto. So we had a process a really very detailed process in both our CRM organization on the commercial side and the auto side to personalize those things what our customers called, knowing that they would have what we call kind of big bills coming up and how we could help them to get through that payment plans, forgiveness, etc. And we were really happy to say that through that plan that we started in May 15th and has wrapped up more recently, on the private passenger auto side, we were able to salvage over 50% of those people that might have canceled. And maybe they would have canceled because they were shopping anyway, maybe they would have canceled because of finances related to COVID, but we were just happy that we were able to personalize that process and have those individuals maintain their coverage with Progressive. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey, thanks. Can you hear me? Tricia Griffith : Yes. Mike Zaremski : Okay great. Just a follow-up question, kind of along the lines of thinking -- starting to think about whether there's any kind of secular trends post COVID. Anything you guys are seeing on the efficiency side, whether it's LAE or expense ratio directly that you think might be done differently, maybe consumer preference, too, that could lead to some kind of benefits for Progressive or just broadly the industry going forward? Tricia Griffith : Well, I think the efficiency automatically go to claims, which is the big organization, that's really our product once it happens. And it can be -- you got to balance it with accuracy. So we've been testing photo estimates and video estimates from our customers for quite a long time. And this really -- this fast forwarded it because we weren't going to body shops. And so we have a much larger amount, much larger percentage of our auto claims going through, what I would call photo method of inspection. Some of it is from our customers, giving it themselves and they may or may not get it repaired. I would say, that's about 25%. And after COVID, post COVID, it's been about 55% coming from our network body shops. And so of course, you want to balance that efficiency of reps not having the windshield timer going out with accuracy. And so as we're starting to kind of come through the first wave of this, we are seeing some accuracy trends that we want to be able to have our people eventually site of car. So although it's not as efficient because they're going out, we think it's more accurate. So as an example, recently, we -- a lot of our managed repair reps that got into nonnetwork body shops to do the estimates, really want to be able to get out there. When you have a really hard hit incoming -- I was a claims adjuster, so you have a really hard hit, doing it from a photo or video are really tough because underneath that sheet metal, there could be a lot of damage. And you can see a little bit, but you can't really get there. So that causes more supplements, which, of course, is inefficient. So we've just recently talked to our managed repair reps because they've been asking, can we go back out? We have given them all the materials they need to be safe, whether it's mask or gloves and both. And it's completely voluntary. So if you do not feel like you want to go out, that is no problem. We -- our first protection is our employees, but they're going out to some of the nonnetwork shops to do the estimate by the car, and we think that will be a good balance of the efficiency with the accuracy. And of course, we have it set up where the car is outside, no one's with them, etc. So we're really protected. And if they go to a body shop and they see the people aren't wearing mask. We ask them to turn around. So I think we'll learn more about the efficiency of how many estimates post COVID can we do with technology? And we're always testing technology and artificial intelligence to understand that we have so many years of millions and millions of photos. Could we ultimately have very simple estimates actually almost ride themselves and so we've been testing that for a while. Again, I hope I'm answering the question, but it really is a balance of accuracy and efficiency. We're having a lot of learnings from COVID, which is you always want to take advantage of something that's not good to say, what did we learn from that? And how will we come out better and more efficient? And overall, we have goals for LAE and NAER. During this time, there's so much noise in the data because of excess capacity at this juncture and etc. But we care deeply about efficiency and care deeply about our cost structure because we know that in order to have competitive costs, we have to be very competitive on the expense side. Doug Constantine : That appears to have been our final question. So that concludes our event. Jason, I'll hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : That concludes Progressive Corporation's second-quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the investor relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to The Progressive Corporation\u2019s Third Quarter Investor Event. The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website, and we\u2019ll use this event to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive's Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the event over to Mr. Constantine. Doug Constantine : Thank you, James, and good morning. Although, our quarterly investor relations events typically includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions may be found at investors.progressive.com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our first, second and third quarter's quarterly report on Form 10-Q, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of challenges we face. In particular, note that our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter includes discussions of the risks and uncertainties that we face, including specific risk factors arising directly and indirectly from the COVID-19 pandemic and these risks are further referenced in our third quarter 10-Q. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. It was an extremely close and not yet decided election. I thought I'd open with a few words before we get to your questions. I know that the elections are on everyone's mind, including those at Progressive. I think it's important that our shareholders know that we live our core values, specifically the golden rule, regardless of the candidate we support. I'm very proud that in the end, we're all united in our commitment to caring for our customers, our communities, our shareholders, and most importantly for each other. As you know, we feel strongly that our people and our culture are a significant competitive advantage for us. They're one of our four strategic pillars, and we rely on our incredible culture to get us through challenging times, and come out more focused and united than ever. This year has been no different as we move forward together. I thought I'd share a note that I received on Monday from an IT Group manager Scott, regarding a video I did on Unity last week. This really exemplifies who we are as a company and why we win in the marketplace. He said Tricia, I have so much to be thankful for in this year and month and there is a literal pile of things for which I'm deeply appreciative for you and your team, truly, and I know I speak for so many others I am grateful. Then he went on to share the communication that he sent to his team and these are words that are echoed by so many leaders at progressive. His note said, it's the last Tuesday in October, which means that next week marks the national election and another end to political yard sign season. Here's the sign we placed in our own yard. And the sign started with love your neighborhood it talked about loving your neighbor regardless of race, who you love, et cetera. Conveying what we've hoped for our neighborhood, that regardless of next week's outcome, we hope that our common bond as neighbors can prevail over the differences, really an extension of the golden rule. That's not to say that it's not easy or that we\u2019re not strong in our political convictions, but it's also to say that we strive to respect, care for and even love our neighbors regardless of their vote or other differences. The same applies here at work with Progressive culture rooted in our core values. My DRG is committed -- direct reporting group is committed to support the diversity of our people. Please work to grow and sustain that spirit of collegiality and friendship with each other through and beyond the election. And these words really truly reflect who we are as a company and you know, being up late and in the middle of the night and this morning, I will end up after this call shooting another video today to ensure The Progressive people who may feel stressed, remain calm and focused, even though there'll be delayed results. Also, tomorrow marks our Eighth Annual Keys to Progress, where we give away cars to deserving veterans. Due to restrictions on business operations for the program participants and social distancing requirements, our giveaway events will be small, but still very meaningful. All-in-all, this is another great example of giving back to our communities where we've donated over 750 vehicles in the past eight years. Being a successful business starts with our people and this quarter continues to exemplify what you can do with the right team and the right culture. As I stated in my letter, we're extremely pleased with our Q3 results. We're also acutely aware that these times are tumultuous and that we have to remain nimble as events unfold. That's really always been our strong suits. Thank you. And with that James will take the first question Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please, your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess, first question, I'd love to learn more about the automobile severity trends. They seem to kind of -- be kind of staying higher for longer by -- I know there is a lot of -- there's been some noise and distortions during COVID, you called some out in the Q and in the quarter, you've called some out to about subrogation. I'm trying to -- kind of just learn more. So we can kind of understand whether the underlying trend might be a little bit lower or if this is kind of the new normal, especially in the bodily injury and pip sides? Tricia Griffith : Thanks Mike. Yes, let me give you some insight and it\u2019s a little bit difficult to compare with PCI because they haven't reported Q2 yet. They're not as volatile as Q2, but let me go through a couple. So, when you think of PD -- it's sort of the opposite of what happened in Q2 in terms of inbound subrogation. Our supplement payments, which is inbounds sub are coming from a period of lower volume applied to a period of an increase in current volume. So, we report 3.9%, PD incurred. It's a little bit higher, if you remove that inbound sub, about four points higher. So, right around 8.5 points. So, it's a little bit higher, but clearly less than Q2 when we were at 12.7. On collision, again the outbound sub mix is no longer driving trends. And that's of course, the money we receive in. And if you remove that sub percentage, this 6.2 goes up a little bit, that was negative in Q2. So that was very different. And it's all really about the numerator and denominator when you're having frequency changes quarter-to-quarter. You talked about BI, our incurred severity is similar to Q2. So, we have some aging, which we believe accounts for about two points. And then we have another one point to two points that relates to facts of loss -- loss shift. So, what we did was we took a look at quarter two of 2019 facts of loss, and then we compared that to quarter two of 2020 facts of loss. And what we're seeing, we think this is likely because of less morning congestion commute, that there are less rear end accidents. So, think I'm kind of a fender bender, that wouldn't cause much damage from a severity perspective or an injury perspective. There are more intersection accidents, which are always more severe. So our estimates take into account the aging inflation and the facts of loss, mix shift, we believe is around 7% to 8%. So while we are reporting the 11.6%, we believe it's a little bit lower based on those two issues. So PIP so difficult because there's so many different state mix changes. And in the severity \u2013 the higher severity space account for about two points of with those mix shifts. So we think that aside from New York most of the PIP states are around 6% to 7% severity. So it's not as volatile. It's still different just because of the situation with COVID and vehicle miles traveled and different loss patterns. But hopefully that will give you some insight into our severity trends. Mike Zaremski : Okay. Yes. That's very helpful. I guess, lastly, I'll move just more broadly to the direct-to-consumer segment of auto. It feels like there's been an acceleration of PIP. And I think the only question we get whether is \u2013 whether this is kind of the new normal or if there's kind of been a temporary bump during COVID. I'm trying to \u2013 I know it's a high-level question. Just trying to better understand is do you feel that there's something helping you guys that's kind of one-off that could kind of kind of taper off a little bit or is there third-party marketing technologies you guys are using and just will continue to help you? Anything to kind of get us better? I think we understand from your letter Tricia you guys feel great about growth. Just trying to get a sense of whether the double-digit growth in direct-to-consumers is sustainable? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean on the auto side in the private passenger auto side when we market, we're marketing for the direct side but we believe that our agents are reciting to that. So when the stay-at-home orders happened, a lot of our agents weren't able to actually work or open their branches, some of them obviously were able to do it from their home but we saw applications go down. And now we're seeing them increase a little bit as things start to open. So that could be volatile for a while depending on what happens with rates of infection. What I will say is that the direct-to-consumer side really has increased on the commercial side. So our commercial business has always been the majority from the agents. It's a more complicated product and we are seeing more direct-to-consumer on the commercial side. That trend likely would have been happening over time as people felt comfortable with the products they're buying it really depends on complexity. But I will say that in our for-hire transportation, it's the strongest our direct channel where those new ventures are coming in directly to Progressive. So it's hard to say if it will continue. It could be what's happening with pandemic, it could be what's happening with younger truckers for example, starting new ventures and they're more comfortable going direct. But what I would say is we're glad that we've invested in the direct side of the business. We continue to feel like we want to have broad coverage for where when and how customers want to buy and just be available for everyone depending on that need. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. John Sauerland : I just might add Mike, you use the new normal in both the severity and the direct questions. And we aren't thinking there's any new normal to point out right now. It's a very dynamic environment obviously, but we think we're playing a well. So in the direct space, as you noted in the Q advertising is up a 29% for the quarter. So when you see us spending more in advertising you should know that we are seeing opportunities to spend efficiently to bring in business. That is what we call the prospects side of the equation and prospects are up as we noted in the Q about 8% for the quarter, but conversion is up as well. And that was a quarter where some of our competitors had lower pricing in effect because of their approach to COVID rebates or credits and some of those have come off now. So from a competitiveness standpoint all else equal, we think we're in a pretty good place. Conversion is up 5% for the quarter. We may even be getting more competitive. So again all else equal, our advertising especially being even more effective. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thank you. Good morning. My first question was just in the Q, you guys did pointed out that miles driven went up in the first half of the third quarter, but then back down in the second half. So I was just wondering if we could get some color on what you think might have driven that? I'm not sure if it was pickup in COVID cases or partial lockdowns in certain states? Or anything -- any other color that you think would apply to that dynamics within the third quarter? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. Good morning, Elyse. We do think that's what happened. We think that is reflected pretty when something changes in a given state. We look at this from state-to-state. There's really a variety of vehicle miles traveled and ranges. It\u2019s still now much obviously higher than the trough of 40% right around 10%-ish 10% to 15% across the country. We're really digging in to kind of understand it. We do see the congestion is still a very different in the morning to me where there's less congestion. We're starting to dig into how we look at the types of job you have, and so we can try to understand people that might work-from-home for a longer period of time versus people that have jobs where you need to be on about. And in fact we're really looking through our UBI data that are Robinsons or people that are 65 and older their features fell in line with their vehicle miles traveled and we just think they're driving less during rush hour or they're working from how more they have roles that can work from home they might be retired. And the younger demographics what we would call the spends and dines and wrights their features fell more than the VMC, although the gap is narrowing. And they had a small drop in mileage. We believe that these are jobs that can't be done from home. So we're watching that closely. I think a lot depends on what happens in the next several weeks with infection rates and what specific states do. So again what we'll do is we continue through our product group watching those states and those areas very closely to understand those frequency trends and using data both on the Snapshot side and the smart hall side in commercial where we're not seeing that change. So the truck drivers are on the road more because of moving goods back and forth. So we see a little bit different on the commercial side. And even though the congestion has decreased, we know that they're on the road more. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. It's changing always and we're thankful that we have a lot of data in our usage-based insurance across many of our products and we'll keep watching that and react as necessary. Elyse Greenspan : That's helpful. And then my second question is on Snapshot. So I was hoping that you could give us an update on kind of the take-up rates within both the agency and the direct side where we sit today. And then have you guys noticed a greater take-up rate for your Snapshot devices during this kind of COVID slowdown, I guess is folks are potentially driving less right, with potentially want to use a device that could potentially lead to some savings to them? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So immediately, we've always had a pretty good high take rate on the direct side. So immediately, when we had the shutdown, we saw an uptick in that. And that sort of leveled off. On the agency side where we haven't had historically a great of a take rate, we saw that go up, and it's continues. So I think, agents and I've been -- I probably talked in one of the great things about COVID is that, I've been able to get out and talk to literally thousands of agents in the last couple of months, virtually, of course, and they understand that they need to be competitive, and they've been talking and selling Snapshot to their clients, to our mutual clients. And so that has increased and that has continued to kind of maybe level out, but it's increased much more than before COVID. On the commercial side, September was the biggest Smart Haul enrollment ever and the monthly take rate climbed to about 24%. So we're seeing that definitely on the commercial side. John, do you want to add anything? John Sauerland : Yeah. So that's definitely seeing that take rates go higher, especially in the for-hire transportation segment that Tricia was noting earlier. So that is, you can think of sort of delivery trucks, as well as interstate trucking. And we're very excited to see especially the take rate on what we call new ventures. So a lot of truckers are going out on their own these days. And truck insurance premiums are pretty high. So they're very open to offers that might lower that premium. And it's great that the take rate there is even higher than the overall. And we feel that segment is very well priced, especially when we have the Smart Haul insights that we have really from day one. So the other thing, I would mention on Snapshot more generally is that we are -- well, we haven't marketed a lot, we have something called Snapshot Road Test in market now. And the take rate there is encouraging. And this is via mobile devices whereby you can do what we used to call test drives. So if you drive for a while, we get your driving behavior, we deploy that at your initial quote. Today in Snapshot, we give you a discount for participating and then give you the fully developed discount at renewal with Road Test. You get that up front. So we're excited by the early take rates there again, we have a marketed it, but we think we're ready to do consumers will be very interested. Elyse Greenspan : That's helpful. And will Road Test, thank you to proceed follow-up, will Road Test be available in all states where you have the traditional Snapshot product? John Sauerland : Yeah. So it's available today. We just haven't marketed it. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar, with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi. Good morning. I just had a question on the competitive environment and you just discussed sort of pricing conditions in the personal auto business and your outlook for margin, because it does seem like the more and more companies are trying to be more proactive and trying to either gain share or recover the share that they've lost over the last few years? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, we feel really great. We've added 2.4 million policies compared to last September. So we feel like we were well positioned coming into the pandemic. And then we reacted very quickly. So we knew that vehicle miles travel has been down. We immediately gave to 20% credits for two months to our auto customers. We feel that that -- it could change, so that helped us with retention, because those customers were able to say, obviously, there were some moratoriums as well and they'll have to play out depending on what happens, if there's stimulus, et cetera. And then we started to do what we do best and surgically look at state by state, channel by channel, product by product, because we want to balance that growth and profitability. And we've really enjoyed gaining share across the board and we want to continue that. So what we're doing now is, what we call, taking small bites of the apple in terms of rate decreases. If we see conversions going down or we're less competitive and we get a lot of intel from other companies and our agents, we will take rates down slightly. So we talked about taking it down about 1 percentage for the quarter and 3% April through September. We did that in about 37 states and when I say 37 states, there might have been two rate decreases, maybe 0.5% maybe 1%. We really watch this and we're able to react so quickly, which keeps us really competitive when people are shopping. And then, April through December, we will have taken some form of rate decrease in about 42 states and that is about 84% of our country-wide net written premiums. So, again, surgically being able to react to rate, be competitive. And we do that going both ways, depending on the product. But we feel like we're positioned well, like John said, and everybody had whether they took credits or discount, everyone's trying to make sure that we are competitive. This is a very competitive industry and we feel like we're in a really good position, which is why I started the letter off the way I did. I'm very pleased with our results and our reaction to COVID and what we've been able to do for our customers when they need us the most. Jimmy Bhullar : And when you think about this balancing growth and profitability, is there a level on either the loss ratio or the combined ratio to where you're comfortable taking it up and continuing to push for growth? Like, I think, in the past you've talked about mid-90s would be a level where you've sort of slow down your growth and focus more on margins instead? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So we've had the same objective in the company since we went public in 1971, that to grow as fast as we can and make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit. And so, we always try to balance that. That said, we have five core values and one of them is profit. So if we don't believe we can be profitable then we'll start growing, profit comes first. So, here's the deal. We don't want to give away margin. So if we believe that we can grow and still grow at that 96 or less than a combined ratio, we'll do so. If we don't, we'll keep the margin and understand that again, that is as such, we do it at such a surgical level, that the 96, grow as fast as you can, is our job objective for the overall company but we look at it very different across our portfolio. So, yes, we're going to continue to try to aggressively grow, gain market share all while making sure that we achieve our profitability goal. Jimmy Bhullar : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Greg Peters : Good morning. So the first question will be around retention. As you know, there was another insurtech company that went public groups. It's also an Ohio-based company. They disclose their retention rates, Allstate discloses their retention rates. And I'm just curious if you could give us some color about how your retention has been this year, relative to last year? Tricia Griffith : Yes, so retention for us is really the Holy Grail, you want -- you spend the money to acquire customers, they come in, you want to make sure we give great service and they reward us with the retention. So, we look at retention for what we call policy life expectancy. On the trailing 12 months, it's up to 9%, up 10% of agency, 7% indirect. Now, the caveat is we're getting a benefit of the billing leniencies and moratoriums and so we would say -- we would say that those are the numbers, but they may be conservative, depending on what happens with people and jobs and unemployment, etcetera. Our trailing three is a little bit lower and a little bit more volatile. Trailing three is 7% up, up in 6% in agency 8% indirect. And on the commercial line side, of course, we look at a 12 month basis because those are annual policies; PLE is up about 4%. So, we're very pleased with that, but we also know that there's a lot of volatility going on right now. And we'll do our best to keep our customers and to work with them, our CRM, our customer relationship management group on both the direct side auto and commercial lines auto, work very close to the customers if they need to make changes to their policy in order to keep their coverage available. So, I would say the PLE numbers that we state that we stayed in the queue are very positive. But we also know a part of that is because of the lenient scene moratorium on based on COVID. Greg Peters : Got it. The second question is around the expense ratio, a number of your competitors are laser-focused on reducing their expense ratios to bring them down closer to your level. And I'm curious about the initiatives that you have ongoing within your company to keep your expense ratios low and possibly to get them lower. Tricia Griffith : Yeah, we talk about expense ratios all the time. And we're pretty proud of our results. It's a balance, of course, making sure that we're investing in things like digital that our customers need. I think the one of the silver linings of the pandemic is that we learned that we can write really good estimates from photos and videos and we were working on that prior to the pandemic. But obviously, it was exacerbated based on the fact that we all you know kind of went into our homes to do the work. So, we continue to experiment and see what type of vehicles that we can look at and not be side of car and understand, is that is a quality estimate. Because you don't want to have such a as an example such a low loss expense ratio or loss expense adjustment ratio, if your accuracy is not good, because that indemnity is the biggest part of what we pay out. And we continue to work in our CRM organization, understand how customers can get things they need without human intervention. John Sauerland\u2019s Group is working on, some RPA process. And so there's, we have a lot of things going around the company, we're actually we had, we had completed a five year plan for a Board of Directors last year. And obviously we're redoing it this year, because a lot of the changes and that's actually been a topic of what we're what we try to achieve.  We have internal goals that we work on together. And we balance that with investments of like John said, advertising, digital, but we constantly try to look good. How can we absolutely do more with less than not affect our customers? And we know that this is a competitive industry, and that competitive prices are really important. So that expense ratio is a big part of it whether it's on the overall side or decline side. John you're the first string holder you want to add any color? John Sauerland : Yes. Certain many competitors are aspiring to our level of cost structure but there are some competitors who have better cost structures than progressive. So we've been focused on continuing to get more competitive in terms of cost structure for years. As Tricia noted, we think of it in two buckets. So we think of what we call non-acquisition expense ratio and acquisition expense ratio. In the acquisition, we put advertising, as well as agents commission, so I just mentioned earlier, advertising for the quarter was up 25%. It was up 20% year-to-date. We think that's good growth in expenses because we're acquiring customers we're going to have for a long time. Similarly on the agent side, we have to pay competitive commission in order to continue to grow there. So we think growth in expenses in that portion of the expense ratio is good. We focus on the non-acquisition expense ratio, where we are trying to drive what we think of as our infrastructure costs lower. And if you go back around five years, as Tricia noted, I think we've taken out maybe close to three or four points on our non-acquisition expense ratio and we \u2013 our site set on reducing that further is as Tricia noted, price competitiveness is not the only thing that matters in the marketplace but it is a very big part of the consideration set for auto and home insurance as well as commercialize especially. Greg Peters : Thank you for the answer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Michael Phillips : Hey, good morning. So we've all heard Elon at Tesla talk about being aggressive with hiring actuaries and starting on insurance company to use his proprietary real-time data and \u2013 well maybe that's only for is captive fleet I guess just your thoughts on how you view the competition from connected car companies like that that do have really access to rich data from their own fleet to offer insurance to complete fleets? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean I think that we \u2013 from a talent perspective, we feel really positive where we're at. We do \u2013 we have been investing in understanding how to have functionality to gather data from third parties whether it be OEs and we call it Express data quote. So that will be something that we're working on now. I mean I think the question is \u2013 or the answer is that yes, the talent is important. We believe that at some point we'll have to answer who owns the data but we've been working on this with a lot of partners over time to understand how to get quotes our way and understand that data to better understand trends. Does that answer your question? Michael Phillips : So I guess, I was looking more towards your view of just the competitive landscape from companies like that that have access to their own data from fleet are trying to offer insurance and even there aggressively offer their insurance. I know how we speaks but that was really what I was trying to get at. Tricia Griffith : Got it. Yes I wasn't sure if I answered that. Yes, it's great competition. We have had \u2013 they have shot in data for a long, long time. And so we feel very comfortable. The fact that I could be able to tell you today, I think when Elisa answered the question that our Robinson cohort, the feature is sell in line with vehicle miles traveled, et cetera, we're able to watch that real time. And especially, now I'm very excited about what we're doing now on the commercial side and I talked about that with the floor higher transportation to be able to give these discounts to those delivery trust, those trust drivers interest and understand the best drivers are really important. That will help with retention. That will help with loss cost. So the competition is great, because it allows us to never stop evolving. So years ago we only had the dongle and you had to plug it in and then you could do a wireless. Now we have the mobile device. John talked about our road test. We have Snapshot Proview. So it forces us in a really good way to continue to invest data and collecting data on our 24 plus million policyholders. So we feel like we're in a really great position and competition only makes us better. Michael Phillips : Okay, thanks. I guess part two then is, you alluded to it here and we talked a lot about UBI and Telematics now. I guess, what's the lifeline of credit score specifically as a rating variable on personal auto? Are we looking at a couple of years? Do you think that thing dries up or decades? Or how long does I think have left in runway the pricing Varel? Tricia Griffith : You know what? That's -- I'm glad you brought that up, because I -- we've been thinking about that a lot. And I know there's been -- there will be challenges because of the pandemic on regulatory issues. So Michael this would be a lot longer answer than you probably want. But I think it's really important for me to make a couple of points. Basically on risk based pricing and then on kind of what's happening in the world. So first and foremost, we've been getting questions on the usage of credit specifically, does it affect race. And race is never used in pricing insurance projects. In fact it's illegal. A few people have the exact same risk profile. If there's a person that's just like me, same driving, same credits, and we happen to be different races, we get the same rates. Basically we are risk base and race lined. And I also want to make sure that it's clear that progressive supports legislative and regulation that enables insurers to leverage all the available data technology and advanced analytics to price insurance risks when it reflects the insurance cost. And that's really key, we want to have a rate for the specific risk. And for me it's -- for us it's about accuracy, and it allows people and consumers and small business owners to fulfill their American dream and achieve their economic opportunities that they desire. We've talked a lot in the past about the virtuous cycle. If you've got rating accuracy at least a broader consumer availability and affordability, which leads to growth and financial success not just for our shareholders but for the company and for job creation. We've been able to create so many jobs in the last several years, that leads to innovation and segmentation and then goes back to rating accuracy. So we've had that the virtuous cycle that we've been very proud of. And in the past, we've talked about \u2013 it\u2019s the regulator's role to work with us closely in the industry to ensure solvency, ensure compliance and facilitate healthy and competitive markets that provide a wide variety of options for consumers. So key elements that I've mentioned before to focus on is ensuring that at prices for insurance are not inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. So we're strong advocates for healthy, competitive volunteer insurance and broad distribution. And for the U.S. insurance industry, we want to be able to continue to facilitate the risk taking in transfer that drive economic growth through delivering products that are both available and affordable. So for us we --in the industry we believe ,we want to preserve the sanctity of contract and the continued support for risk-based pricing. Now all that said, we do recognize that for some individuals mandatory insurance protection can be a significant financial burden. We're very open to collaborating with regulatories and other regulators and other industry leaders on solutions for those individuals versus creating massive and unnecessary market disruption that will likely have a negative outcome for certain segments. So that's sort of my feel on, why we've continued to support risk-based pricing which credit is one variable of many. I think how we think about affordability challenges and we just have to think about where we're at in the time of history and decisions that we make that affect the future for consumers. So if you go back to our route in 1937. I'm very proud of Progressive. We started out as the nonstandard insurer allowing people in Cleveland Ohio who couldn't get insurance be able to do that. And then of course you know they're rust eventually countrywide. And we're able to have access to affordable protection across many segments. We have a critical role, I believe in inviting innovation segmentation and the use of technology and data to provide greater access to competitively priced insurance for all. We shouldn't confuse affordability challenges that many face during this unprecedented pandemic with our long standing and solvent model of providing affordable and widely available protection. I think the issues that have arisen regarding social injustice couldn't stem from the insurance industry they've been looming for decades and the events this year brought them to the surface. And now I think we need to really get together and ultimately solve the root problem of opportunity and equality for all not just during the pandemic, but ongoing. So from my perspective and this list could go on and I'll shut up, but very short term after the elections decided we need some form of stimulus to get us through this next wave of infections. And my hope is that, we're able to distribute it more surgically this time to those that need it most. I believe that we need to raise the minimum wage over time to $15 per hour. I will note that all active Progressive employees already make over $15 an hour and we're proud of that. And as a country our focus should really be on additional funding. So the schools can safely reopen and deliver effective online communication. You can't get ahead. If you don't have the ability to learn online which requires infrastructure investments like access to broadband coverage. So I could go on and on, but the message here is that, we as a country are facing a really great opportunity to make substantive changes. And as an insurance company we'll continue to play a role in focusing on rational and risk-based solutions so that everyone is able to achieve the economic opportunities they desire. I've been obviously thinking about that a lot Michael. So I'm glad you brought it up. I think that credit is a powerful variable. It is it is not race related. We do not believe it's race related and we'll continue to hold firm on them. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Gary Ransom : Yes, good morning. Tricia you mentioned in your letter the creative ways of treating customers and we also saw how ad spend is up and direct quotes were up. And I just wondered in looking at the success of all that's going in and getting customers into the funnel and successfully getting a new customer. What are the actual key elements of success in attracting those customers either today in this COVID environment or what you're seeing over the longer term? Tricia Griffith : Well I think ultimate success Gary is to be able to acquire customer at/or below our targeted acquisition cost. But more importantly, as we look at and expand our product line, we're able to do so with our creatives. So for years we had flow inside the superstore, the whole message is savings, savings, savings. And now we have obviously and entire network of characters that talked about savings, but also talk about protection for your home. And we're seeing that work. An example is, I don't know if you've seen it or not, we have had this campaign for a few years and we've settled it on a character called Dr. Rick which is Parentamorphosis as you become your parents when you buy your first call. I think that a lot of people can relate to that. We're seeing the results of that do really well. We've done a couple of good campaigns with the Cleveland Browns quarterback and market to guys that due the 10-yard line chains that we are able to play during the live sports wishes, which is what everyone's watching now until we go back to regular television. So we look at what we call new prospects that haven't shopped us in the last six months. And then we look -- from that we look at do they convert and at what cost. And all those things lead us to understand when the creative works, when it doesn't, when it does we double down and get deeper in the campaign. When it doesn't, we move on and get more creative. So during COVID, I'm really proud of our marketing department, because everything is shut down. And initially we did some nice campaign stories that were softer, because everyone was sort of just nervous about what was happening, because it was so new. And now we're really doing a lot that we're kind of moving forward. But even in the meantime we did really creative opportunities where we had flow and her whole squad, that we call it, on a Zoom call, et cetera. We really got creative to make sure that we didn't miss a step. We know this is a competitive environment and we wanted to continue to be on consumer shortlist, out and available, thinking of Progressive when they go to shop. Gary Ransom : Maybe extending that into the agency channels also, where I think your conversion rates were up as well. Usually that just means your price is lowest on the comparative raters there. But is there more to it than that as well? Are they -- are you seeing more coming into the agents? Is there -- are there agents\u2019 incentives or other things going on there? Tricia Griffith : Yes. We occasionally do agent incentives. It may be, based on things like UBI and if we see something that we want them to do more. We, over the years, have changed some of the agency commission structures depending on if you're selling preferred, Robinsons, auto, home bundled those agents to platinum agents get more commission. They're allowed to have 12-month policies on the auto side, so we're giving them that. And we've done a lot in our platinum agency to have incentives based loss ratio and other things. So we didn't always do those in the past. Our relationship with our agents has really changed in a very positive way. Like I said at the beginning, I've been able to talk to a lot of agency agents. Just not long ago I had our top 25 platinum agents. Usually we do something with them. We obviously couldn't this year. So while we'll keep our overall commission level about the same rate, we have bifurcated and we'll give you a different commission based on the incoming type of customer, which we believe is the long-term value of that customer. So, obviously, cost matters a lot, brand matters a lot, commission matters a lot. And probably the last thing I would say and coming from the claims organization, agents are always so happy to not have to deal with any complaints, because our claims organization is so stellar. So there's a lot that goes into it. Clearly, cost is one of them. They benefit from our brand. But, yes, we have -- we do incentives and we have different commissions based on the type of customer that we get in namely preferred. John Sauerland : I just elaborate on Tricia's last point Gary to say ease of use. So, price competitiveness is extremely important. Ease of use is almost as important in my perspective. So, as Tricia noted not having to deal with hassles on the back end with a claim for sure, but front end as well. So, we've invested heavily in technology to make quoting and now quoting the household in our agents easier. And that will definitely help drive business to Progressive as well. Tricia Griffith : Yes, I think this month or last month we finished full rollout of portfolio quoting. So, the agent feedback is extraordinary. Just you got to make it easy. Thanks Gary. Gary Ransom : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please, your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Hi, good morning. I actually want to continue on this last line of questions. With regards to the kind of creative ways to reach out of consumers beyond the ease of use and quotes and the innovative ad spend in the traditional channels are there any new ways to get to market? Any ways that you're exploring maybe Internet social media and then relate to get our customers? Tricia Griffith : Yes. When I usually speak about marketing I go to sort of the mass media and that's one portion of how we market media. We're on streaming. So, we advertise on Hulu. We advertise on most of the social network, channels, and affiliates on Internet. So we -- and we have generic search. So there -- we have a variety of ways to make sure we get our message to you and do everything we can to get our message to you the right number of times not too much not too little because we don't want to bog you down. So, yes, there's -- besides the creative also many different ways. And there's sometimes on a digital platform that will have characters that we don't even have on mass media. And it's usually the specific demographic that we're looking for in that channel. So, yes, we a variety of ways. And as things change with how people watch TV or watch streaming, we'll continue to play a part of that. And the great part is we have access to so much data to understand pretty quickly if it's working so we can remove it or double down. Yaron Kinar : And are there any metrics you can share on that in terms of are you increasing your spend in those kind of non-mass media channels? Is the take-up greater or improving there? Tricia Griffith : I think John wanted to say something to be yes. We're increasing the spend in those channels for sure because many people have cut the cord and don't watch any TV so we need to have access to them through those different channels. John do you want to add to on? John Sauerland : Yes, the growth in spend in nontraditional media has outpaced traditional for years now and we're constantly testing into new media where we can. We have a group that entirely focuses on new ways to reach people. And the overarching philosophy is where when and how consumers want to buy. So, we are definitely investing. And normally I think relatively speaking on the forefront of trying new channels and ensuring that we can actually measure the success of those new channels. So, we are very disciplined that we're out spending new money that we find ways to measure its effectiveness and I think that differentiates us relative to a lot of other marketers. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then my second question it goes to one of the arguments that we hear from insurtech, which is that traditional insurers even innovative and successful ones like Progressive ultimately face an innovator's dilemma in the form of how much you push telematics based scoring and pricing because of the legacy blocks. And that these insurtech as a result could have an advantage over the incumbents over time because they're not encumbered by legacy blocks. So I'd love to maybe hear a little more about how Progressive looks at the innovators dilemma and how it handles the right balance between pushing these creative and innovative ways to price in and score versus maintaining the legacy block? Tricia Griffith : And I talked a little bit about that, when I talked about the virtuous cycle in terms of when you have a segment, you innovate, et cetera and you do that. I think that insurtech are serving a great purpose in terms of ease of use and it would be I think, easy to be able to or nice to be able to I should say start without having legacy systems. That's said we have them, we work around them but we don't say okay, we're just going to be here in time and try to work around. We're constantly innovating from a technology perspective, ease of use perspective. And we believe that part of our DNA is really innovation. We've been first in a lot. I won't go into naming that and we don't intend to change that. And the great benefit that we have that the insurtechs don't is the cost of acquisition. And for us we're going to continue to hone on in \u2013 hone in on that. And that's why we were able to increase our policies $2.5 million in one year. That's the reason we're able to do so and make our target profit margins, which are also very important. We have shareholders that are \u2013 that own us because they know we're committed to our 96th growth fast you can. We don't have the \u2013 the availability to say we're going to test things, regardless if we make money or not. So we're very innovative. We're always going to do everything we can to make a profit one of our core values and we're able to leverage our size to have lower acquisition costs. Yaron Kinar : Got it. Thanks, and congrats on a good quarter. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hi, good morning. Just sort of following on along the lines of this \u2013 the unique ways of \u2013 or new ways to acquire customers. I was hoping maybe you could expand a bit on any distribution partnerships for the personal auto business that you may have with the OEMs or online car sites like vroom.com that you have or that you might be exploring. I know that Ford has just entered an agreement with Veris Data Exchange to help offer insurance. I'm wondering do you have any of these relationships? Is this something that you're exploring as a new way to acquire customers? And just sort of how you view that I guess subchannel of the DTC market? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, David. Yes we've worked with many different OEs over the years and I talked a little bit about that Express a quote that will give us the functionality to work with OEs and other aggregators. We do \u2013 we have many relationships and we have some in the works that I'm not liberty to talk about right now. John? John Sauerland : Yes. So we've worked directly with OEs over the years. We started a relationship with GM. I can't remember how many years ago now, probably four years ago. As you know to get the data directly from vehicles and offer rates that are reflective of driving behavior at the point of quote and the point of sale. We have also worked with aggregators of that data or third-party gatherers of that data. So there are apps on your phone that are tracking where you're going and how you're driving and we've worked with those entities as well. It is a funnel as we think of it. When we talk about funnel economics, the number of people that come in the top there versus the number that come out of the bottom meaning actually buy a policy has been challenging. That is not to say we won't continue and are continuing to test in that space. And in new media, we normally see funnel challenges at the outset and we work through the experience to continue to refine it, and continue to make it better and to get to the point where the funnel economics work for us. So we've been testing into the data direct from OEs in numerous manners for a number of years now and have shown some success but not to the point that it will be a considerable portion of our media spend anytime soon frankly. David Motemaden : Got it. And so it sounds like those are interesting, but the conversion rates are still below your other direct channels. Is that correct characterization? John Sauerland : That's a fair way to think about it. And think of conversion not only as you got to quote and you then bought the policy, but getting folks from interested in the whole process even to get to the core process. So it's a longer funnel than just got the quote, bought the policy. Then when we talk about in conversion percentage that's what we're talking about there. This is we think of the entire funnel efficiency. David Motemaden : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. That makes sense. And then just switching gears just more broadly it's obviously been a profitable year for you guys, notwithstanding, the credit and other actions that you've taken. Just wondering, how we should think about the variable dividend? And I guess how you guys are thinking about that as we approach the end of the year? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. So we meet with the investment committee John and I and Jon Bauer, our Head of Progressive Capital Management throughout the year understanding our capital strength, which is very strong and always thinking about some dry powder for anything that might come up. We've had a couple of sessions that we have a range that we're thinking about. Obviously the Board will be the one that decides that. We meet with them at the beginning of December and we'll talk through something and get more in line with what we believe the dividend will be payable next year. So obviously that's an unknown because it will be a Board's decision. We feel really great about our capital position. We feel great about our growth and our profit. And we -- in the past, we've been able to share that with our shareholders. Again, we don't have any specific amount I can share with you, but we feel really great about our year. Anything can happen. There's still a few months left but we feel good. John Sauerland : We have approximately five minutes left in the call and still have a handful of people in the queue. We will go through the last handful here and go a little bit long. However, we will limit everybody to a single question. if you have additional question, you may contact the Investor Relations group at the contact information on the website. With that, I'll hand it back over to James. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great. And thanks so much for accommodating us. I was hoping that either Tricia or John, could talk us through sort of the monthly volatility in the commercial lines expense ratio and what's been going on there? A \u2013 John Sauerland : So whenever we're looking at results, you should expect volatility. Let me start there in terms of loss ratio, as well as the expense ratio. In our commercialized business, we talked about non-acquisition expense ratio previously. We have actually been growing our expense ratio in our commercial business and that's been intentional and plan-ful because we're investing for future growth. Specifically, business owners program, we're now in 13 states and are feeling great about our progress there so far. We would like to get basically to the entire country with that program because we think it effectively triples our addressable marketing like commercialize business. We've also invested heavily in what we call our small business insurance initiative, which is essentially the direct platform for commercialized business. And our BusinessQuote Explorer, which -- HomeQuote Explorer makes it very easy to get quotes from a variety of carriers through our direct platform there. So we have long-term plans to bring that expense ratio on a commercial lines business back down. But in the near-term, it's going to be slightly elevated from where we've been. That said, on a relative basis relative to our competitors, meaning we're very competitive cost structure in a commercialized business. But if you're looking for commentary, specifically on the expense ratio, loss ratio for the month, we encourage you to look a little longer term, at least for the quarter. A \u2013 Tricia Griffith : And what I would say Meyer is that this was very specifically planned several years ago when we set forth the three Horizon concept. We saw some opportunities in Horizon to mostly around commercial Auto and BOP and TNC and small business and fleet. And so, we knew that in order to invest there we had to have some money -- put some money into it. And now we're seeing the fruition of that investment. So we believe it will come down over time as we have more broad coverage with these products, but we feel very good about that spend because we felt like there was an opportunity in that addressable market for us to do many new and different things to solidify. Again our commercial auto with even more products. And the pandemics been a little bit odd for small businesses, but we feel positive about that going forward in our ability to win and with that bought product on both the agency and direct side. Meyer Shields : Excellent. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Brian Meredith : My question. Chris if I look at average written premium per policy for your personal auto business it went from plus 1, 2Q to minus 2 in 3Q. Just curious is that, all due to the rate actions you've been taking or are you seeing any changes in customer buying habits i.e. higher deductibles, lower limits those types of things that may be having an impact on that as well? Tricia Griffith : I would say the majority of that is our reduction in premiums. I haven't seen too much of a change in our business mix profile. Q \u2013 Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Josh Shanker : Thank you for taking my questions, so late in the call. I'm just wondering if we can compare shopping and JV right now when compared to where it was three years ago. I've tended to believe that when prices are going up, Progressive's seasonal shop, ever, because people are unsatisfied. But now that prices are going down, maybe people widely know that there's progress to be had in auto insurance and so it might stimulate a decent amount of buying. And if you can add, is there a difference between the shopping behavior, people seeking just an auto policy and people seeking an auto and home policy? Tricia Griffith : Yes. That's so hard, Josh, to look at and compare it three years ago. I do think that, even when prices are going down in this environment, it might be different. And this is -- I hate to use the word, it's still unprecedented. It really depends on the situation with the consumer and what they're looking for in terms of, did somebody get furloughed or waived off, et cetera. So I think it's hard to know. And what we really focus on is making sure that have the message out there that we have that broad coverage that we have. The ability to measure our acquisition costs and now that they're under our targeted amount to get the customer in there. So it's really hard for me to say. I think what we've tried to do is just, when they are shopping regardless of the reason, we're available, we're easy and we're competitively priced. Do you want to add anything? John Sauerland : Yes. So I agree with Tricia. There are many different metrics around shopping behavior and they don't always agree. As Tricia noted, we're most concerned with is that we are spending efficiently to get the prospects we are getting as we know prospects are up. In terms of prospects we are getting in the behavior in terms of auto or auto home, we are increasingly being positioned as the bundle provider for certain. And we do measure consumers' perception on that. And certainly, our quotes for bundles both in the direct channel as well as the agency channel have been growing faster than in the mono line. Josh Shanker : Thank you very much Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi Research. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Suneet Kamath : Great. Thank you. I wanted to circle back to Road Test. It sounds like you have had the technology for a while, but maybe haven't focused on it or marketed it. So just curious why the decision to make a push now? And are you planning on rolling that out to existing policyholders, as well as new customers, or just new customers? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Yes. We had something called test drive years ago. I want to say five or six years ago maybe. And at the time there were some complications, because the way it was up, they need to put in some data. So we think that that was probably one of the reasons we did a little bit of advertising not a lot. So we've been working on-road tests, just to give people the ability to still have their own coverage and test what it would be with Progressive. And again, we've been working on this for a while. We want to make it very worthy of our customers. So I'd say we've been working on this for over a year, rolled it out a couple of months ago. Data is really early, because we want to continue to learn as we spread -- as we broaden that coverage. But, yes, so you wouldn't do it if you're for a customer for -- so you'd probably have snapshot already. These are for customers that have other coverage. Again, we're going to work through the funnel economics on that and then likely roll it out more broadly in the very near future. John Sauerland : That appears to have been our final questions. So that concludes our event. James I'll hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : That concludes The Progressive Corporation's third quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to The Progressive Corporation's Fourth Quarter Investor Event. The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its Annual Reports on Form 10-K and the letter to shareholders, which has been posted to the company's website, and we'll use this event to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive's Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Constantine. Doug Constantine : Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon. Although, our quarterly investor relations events typically includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions may be found at investors.progressive.com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2020, where you will find discussions of the Risk Factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia? Tricia Griffith : Good afternoon and welcome to The Progressive's fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. As we stated during the past few quarters, 2020 was an extremely trying year for many reasons, from the global pandemic to the emotional toll caused by social unrest. As I reflect on the year we just closed, I couldn't be more proud of the way Progressive rose to these challenges by delivering fantastic results, while supporting its customers, employees, communities, and partners during these unprecedented times. The Annual Report theme of resilience truly defines how we approached every obstacle during this past year. As of prior quarters, the fourth quarter profitability continued to benefit from reduction in frequency, which was partially offset by an increase in severity. Miles driven continued to be lower than the fourth quarter last year. We continue to react to the changes in driving behavior caused by the pandemic. In addition to the over $1 billion given to customers in the form of credits early on in the pandemic, we also filed personal auto rate changes that averaged a decrease of approximately 3% between April and December in over 40 states that represented approximately 85% of our countrywide premium, thereby providing our customers an aggregate annualized savings estimated at about $800 million. There's much uncertainty about reopenings, vaccine distribution, and if and when we'll return to pre-pandemic driving patterns. Our product teams are staying abreast of the situation and continue to adjust rates to related risks, which include risks such as weather. We continue to recognize both policy and premium growth in the fourth quarter, which combined with the rest of the year resulted in 2020 having an increase of 2.4 million policies in force and $3 billion more net premiums written over the prior year. This was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit PIF growth. While all of our segments contributed to this growth, our agency auto business was more heavily impacted by the federal, state, and local social distancing, and shelter-in-place restrictions that were put in place to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19 which resulted in a decrease in new applications year-over-year. Our commercial lines business saw significant growth in the for-hire transportation business as the demand for shipping services grew as a result of the pandemic. On the other hand, our Uber and Lyft premiums took a hit during the year as the miles driven decreased with restrictions in place and our premiums are based on actual and estimated miles over the policy term. Our property business had a profitable fourth quarter, but with a 2020 Atlantic Hurricane season being the most active on record, it recognized an underwriting loss for the full year. Growth continued to be strong with our bundled Robinson business growing faster than any other segment. We're confident that we have the pricing and product enhancements in place to get closer to our target margins, and we will continue to make changes as we grow. Despite the challenges faced in light of the pandemic, our combination of strong growth and profitability in 2020 suggests we're managing the situation well. Throughout the year, we continued to invest in our personal auto product. Our first sale was elevated to our newest product model in January. As part of our Apron Relief Program, we also launched a temporary change to Snapshot that allows existing non-snapshot customers to receive a Snapshot adjusted rate after just 30 days of monitoring as opposed to the normal six months. This, in addition to Snapshot road test, which we had available for several months, gives consumers the ability to see their Snapshot rate before purchasing a policy. While not available countrywide, where it\u2019s available, we believe this is a perfect opportunity for some customers to lower their rates based on either their driving behavior or frequency of their driving habits that have changed as a result of the pandemic. We're also investing in our commercial lines business. Our BOP product is now active in 18 states, Illinois went live last week, and during the fourth quarter was added to our BusinessQuote Explorer platform in the direct channel. Also Smart Haul, our UBI program for truckers, continues to see excellent adoption rates and is a great asset in the for-hire trucking market. And Snapshot ProView, which expands our UBI offerings beyond truck is now available in 45 states. Looking to 2021, I'm happy to report that we're well positioned for further growth as reflected in our January results. We continue to make investments in pricing segmentation, cost efficiency, accurate claims handling, and expense management. Most importantly, we\u2019ve supported our people and retained our culture, which we know will pay huge dividends going forward. Another exciting thing about 2021 is that in April, we'll celebrate our 50th anniversary of becoming a public company. A Fun fact, if you bought 100 shares at our IPO in 1971, it would have cost you $1,800. At the end of 2020, that initial investment would have grown to be worth over $19 million, a 20.5 compounded annual return. Not a bad investment especially if you compare it to the 9.9% return by the S&P 500 over that same period. I just want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all of our shareholders, both past and present for investing in us over the years. Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to express how pleased and excited I'm about the agreement with Protective Insurance Corporation. We've been very impressed with Protective's products, employees, and culture. As we said in the past, commercial lines is our greatest opportunity to grow and we're excited to expand our capabilities with the expertise Protective offers, a larger fleet and affinity programs and by providing additional breadth of product lines. As you know, the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, and I'm sure you can appreciate that we're not able to share additional information at this time. We will provide additional information thoughts after the transaction closes. Chris, I think we can open it up for questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey, great. Good afternoon. I guess I think first question maybe on Telematics, and Tricia I listened to some of your comments, you used the word kind of reacting to changing driving patterns. You talked about uncertainty, I think about future driving patterns, and I think we all know that people's workplaces settings will probably continue to adjust into the coming year or so. So just kind of curious, is there any ways or initiatives in the company to kind of scope more all in on kind of Telematics given it feels like it could be more important than ever in order to better understand how to price risk? Tricia Griffith : It\u2019s a great question, Mike, and actually what I just talked about when I did my opening remarks was something that came out of a discussion that John Sauerland and Pat Callahan and John Murphy and I had when we were talking about the desire to have people -- have the rate be really relevant to people that are driving less. And so, we really in record time created the Apron Relief Snapshot Program, and because time is of the essence, and maybe people are going back to work, maybe they're partially in work, partially not, we wanted to be able to provide our UBI program with a shortened monitoring period. So that 30-day period is really important. So we've sent out to our current customers, millions of emails, and for those where we don't have an email, we're sending out actual USPS mail to alert our customers of this offering and make sure that if they are driving less and they do want to receive a discount or their frequency and severity of driving those down, they can opt for this option. We think that's a fantastic addition to the credits that we gave early on, the rate reductions and our road test option for consumers. Mike Zaremski : Okay. I'm happy to flush that out. Okay, my final question is specifically on direct-to-consumer advertising. I think we get a lot more questions these days about kind of insurtech firms and even incumbents' kind of pushing into that sandbox, and Progressive is clearly a leader, you guys are growing fast. But curious if you're seeing any of these kind of new entrants\u2019 marketing spend influence any of the economics in the marketplace and how to think about kind of influencing Progressive's ability to win in this space, at least incrementally? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean I think over the years, we've seen not just our competition that we've had for a long-term, but a lot of the insurtechs going into the space where we feel like we have an advantage, of course, as we buy a large portion of our media in-house, and we make sure that when we acquire a customer that it is under our allowable cost, at or under our allowable costs. And so, I can't go into a lot of proprietary ways with which we do that. But we believe that allows us to have very reasonable acquisition costs, which we believe are much lower than in insurtech. John Sauerland : Mike, to that I would add, you\u2019ve noted our advertising costs are going up, meaning our spend is going up, and we only spend what we believe it is sufficient. So we have an allowable acquisition cost by segment, and we spend up to that. So generally speaking, if you're seeing our advertising spend go up, you should assume that it's continuing to be very efficient in getting us to the customer set we're after very effectively across all the mediums. So I would say in aggregate at our spend level, we really haven't seen much impact from those newer entrants in the advertising space. Operator : Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jimmy Bhullar : I had a question first just on personal auto pricing and frequency trends. And it seems like many of your competitors, especially the larger ones, are much more focused on sort of reviving growth and market share because margins have been good for everybody. So what are you seeing in terms of pricing? And are you concerned that maybe pricing continues to soften as frequency begins to pick up as we go through the rest of the year? Tricia Griffith : Well, I think all of us try to do the right thing by consumers initially, and so whether it's credits or giveback, et cetera, I think that was an important part. And now for Progressive for sure, we went in surgically to give the discounts I talked about on average 3%, realize that is on average. So we\u2019re looking very surgically at each state, channel, and products to give the right discount to make sure we manage that tradeoff between growth and profitability. So, I think that, I'm assuming our competitors are doing similar things. For us, it really is about that balance of growth and profitability, and so we're pretty proud of the fact that in 2020, even with the reduced rates and shopping down substantially during the first part of the pandemic, we were able to grow both in prospects and sales on a full year. So, that's really our concentration. We obviously look across our competitor set to see if prices are down. John, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this last February, we look at a few big competitors price rates -- prices are still down, premium is down about 1.7%. And so, yes, I think it will continue to be a challenge to grow, but we are up against that challenge as you can see by our January results. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then you highlighted Protective in your comments, but where should we see more of an immediate impact on your business from the deal? And sort of what are your longer-term aspirations on what you can do with the business? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I'm sure you can appreciate that. I can't go into a lot of details until the transaction closes. But suffice it to say, it gives us access to a larger addressable market and affinity programs, and we were impressed with the culture and the people of Protective. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then maybe just one more, on Texas have you disclosed anything or are you able to disclose anything in terms of your exposure? Tricia Griffith : Well, the losses are coming in, and obviously, it was a big storm. And what I can say is that, Gary Traicoff\u2019s team is working to kind of understand our ultimate reserves, but I'm confident at this juncture with the data I have that it will pierce our $80 million retention threshold on our reinsurance. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning or good afternoon. I guess it's just non-commercial lines. Can you talk about your either given what you currently have either your need, or maybe your willingness to do more acquisitions to continue to expand in the commercial line space? Tricia Griffith : We always look where we have not been a big acquirer of companies; we always look at both in terms of do we buy, build or partner. And for the most part, whether it's in private passenger auto, or commercial lines, we've tried to build or buy; depending on if you got to something faster, we prefer to grow organically. Obviously, the ARX acquisition had a lot to do with access to customers; we wanted to be able to have those Robinsons in the agency side. When we looked at acquisitions across the commercial landscape, we thought the Protective 1 got us to a larger addressable market that that we may or may not have gotten to at a certain point. We have a lot of irons in the fire right now, though, on commercial as well in terms of growth. And in fact, over the years, I think we've talked about the horizons. And Horizon Two is our biggest growth opportunity. And so right now our focus is really to continue to grow with our bought product, which I talked about, we just rolled out in 18 states, we went from fleet of less than 10 vehicles to 40 and that continues to grow, small business. And then of course, our relationship with a few different companies and transportation network companies. So that's really our focus. We have so many exciting things going on in Horizon Two to grow. If we see something that makes sense, we'll obviously look at it obviously, I can't talk about that if we would but we really do prefer to grow organically and have done so for the past 80 plus years. Michael Phillips : Okay, thanks, Tricia. Second one for me is on homeowners and property business, you mentioned in the introductory comments, I guess can you talk about how I guess how satisfied you're with results there in terms of profitability, and then related, somewhat related can you give us an update on the reception in the market for your HomeQuote product? Tricia Griffith : Yes. Let me, look, well, I was very satisfied with the property results in January and the fourth quarter. That, of course, does not take up the whole year. And if you take out weather-related, including cash and other weather, we feel like we're in a good position. So we've taken rates up substantially, we've changed our product model; we continue to have deeper segmentation. February is not going to be a great -- February is not going to be a great month for the industry because of the winter storm and we try to obviously put a load in for those events. And last year was another unprecedented year of hurricanes. So I'm happy with the product. I'm happy with our continued ability to segment, I'm happy with the fact that we're growing Robinsons across the board in both direct and agency channel, we've increased our Platinum agents. And I think you're referring to the HomeQuote Explorer, very happy there. So we saw Progressive Home along with many other unaffiliated partners. And that's been higher growth than even the agency channel; we're very excited about that. It's our highest growing segment. And when you think about having customers for life that was really our basis for acquiring ARX is to make sure that we have those auto home bundled one to allow us to extend our auto policy life expectancy. So our retention, of course, is the Holy Grail, but also have those customers for life, so as their needs change, we have them. We didn't want to be the train wheels when people want home. So those customers we see out on toys and life and other products that we're able to offer either on our paper or not. And I'll tell you, although we don't talk about this externally, the policy life expectancy on Robinson versus some of the other segments are extraordinarily higher. And so we're very happy with that growth. And we'll continue to invest in that area. John Sauerland : And we're taking action, Progressive Home team on profitability. So last year, we took rates up for our property products a 11.5% basically those are annual policies that all hasn't earned in. We've also taken steps to better balance where we're writing homes to ensure our storm risk is diversified. We've taken actions in terms of policy coverage, as well to ensure that our interests are more aligned with our insurers when it comes to storm losses. So I think we've taken a lot of actions that should show benefits coming into this year. I expect we'll continue to take upgrades this year. But as Tricia noted, it's not surprising to know that February would be a tougher start for the year. But again, I think the Progressive Home team has taken the right actions to get profitability where we wanted for home. And as Tricia noted, we're writing a lot more auto because we have home in the agency channel. You know, think of over a billion of very profitable auto insurance that we believe we would not have had through agents we're now for the opportunity to bundle with risk. Operator : Our next question is from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open. Gary Ransom : Yes. I wanted to follow-up on Robinsons and I saw that you increased Platinum agents. And I saw that the -- well it's actually the 12-month policies are up to 12% of the independent agent channel, which I assume as a proxy for the bundles there. But I guess I was trying to get a sense of what's going on in the direct side, because you're apparently growing bundles there also how is that? Can you give us a sense of that? Tricia Griffith : Yes. Well in fact, we're growing bundles even more rapidly on the direct side. And remember those bundles, some of them are with Progressive Home and some are with unaffiliated partners. So we continue to grow both Robinsons and rates in the direct channel. We continue to invest and having the right partnerships to make sure that like John said that we expand our ability to have Robinsons throughout the country and not be so concentrated in the states that -- where there when we first started the acquisition. But we're happy with the growth in the direct side, very happy. John Sauerland : Gary, just to clarify, you're right to think of the annual policies, just being written by Platinum agents, those are not exclusively Robinsons. They are by far enough away predominately Robinsons, but patients who are Platinum can write annual policies with non-Robinson customers, but it's certainly not part of the majority there. And in direct channel, we do not offer the annual policy for auto. Tricia Griffith : We called out that segment. If you recall, we had the Sam Diane, Wright's and Robinsons. The Wright's are where it's our auto policy and another home on affiliate partners. Gary Ransom : Right. Okay. And can you talk a little bit about the Platinum agents too? And I think you've disclosed that for the last three years now. And it's been kind of a steady increase, is there a continued interest among the agencies, agents that you deal with, I'm just trying to get a sense of the underlying trends that are going on there for you? Tricia Griffith : When we first rolled it out, we really sort of went in it with a scarcity model. And as we've grown and developed, we realized that and we want to make sure that when we make the effort to give you the ability to write annual policies and more commission et cetera, that you're able to have Progressive Home and Progressive Audit be like the number one or two choice in your agency. What we realize though, is around the country, there are some places that and some agencies that are really willing and wanting to write Robinsons, but we didn't necessarily make them Platinum agents, because they might be a smaller agency. But what comes in the door, they want to write often with Progressive. And so that's really been the reason and desire, why we've expanded the number of Platinum agents. John Sauerland : And Gary, we are as you saw close to 4,000 Platinum agents, added a couple 100 this year, probably a bit lower than we would have otherwise, had we not had COVID going on. But if you're wondering if Platinum agents are growing faster than the rest of the agent population, the answer is definitely yes. We won't be able to share that number regularly. But I believe we shared that in a previous Investor Presentation. And I would tell you the trend on terms of relative growth has continued for Platinum agent -- agents excuse me. Operator : Our next question is from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Your line is open. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Could we talk a bit about your targeted 96% combined ratio, which is thinking about risk adjusted returns on capital? I would assume that's not static across business lines, and you just provided some color on homeowners and commercial lines. So how would you characterize your targeted combined ratios for businesses that are of higher severity? Tricia Griffith : We lead obviously our 96%, we've talked about this, a fair amount is in aggregate. So we look at the 96% across products, across new and renewal business, across different channels, because the acquisition costs being different. And then we also look at the ROE on every one of our products as well and try to understand how those two interact together. And so although we don't share anything other than the 96%, we keep -- we think about their risk adjusted rate of return as we develop our targets for each of those combined ratios. John Sauerland : Yes, just to elaborate a little, we have shared previously in Investor Call relative ranges and combined ratios that we're targeting by each product line and your correct it's not only the severity of claims, but it's generally the volatility and results that drives what relatively speaking the amount of capital, we need to hold against that product line. And we also take into account that there's longer tails in some of those lines. So there are different investing returns across lines of business and bring all that together and generally speaking, target a common ROE. It's not perfect. But those combined ratios that we target by product are definitely driven by our perception of ROE by product line. Tracy Benguigui : Okay, thank you. Yes, I'm familiar with that slide. I guess, looking for some, I guess, underlying guidance, but you said you don't disclose that. So I'll move on. I know that you don't really want to talk about Protective. I'll dance around it a bit and recognize that that does bring in workers comp business. I'm just curious more broadly, what your risk appetite is when looking at workers comp? Tricia Griffith : Yes, again I'm excited to talk about that once we close this transaction and what'll commit to all of you is I'll have in a subsequent quarterly call Karen Bailo, our President of Commercial Lines coming and talk about it. But, we talked about Progressive strengths are in complementary lines of business and coverages for the transportation industry, where we have been successful in the past. And that was a big selling point for us as well as their affinity programs. And that's really all I can say until the transaction closes. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Looking -- John Sauerland : Go ahead. Tracy Benguigui : Oh, no, go ahead. John Sauerland : I was just going to offer generically, we are in complementary lines, in order to write more vehicle business is the way to think about it, right? So for a long time, we said, we weren't going to go into home, we recognized the opportunity through independent agents, where we found that we had to have our own product in order to penetrate the Robinson market and independent agents. So that probably wouldn't have been our preferred route. And we didn't take it until we absolutely saw the necessity to do so to continue to grow rapidly in that vehicle line. So I think you should think about other lines of business to some degree, being complementary in order to continue to grow the business as fast as we can. Operator : Our next question is from Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. Did you say in your prepared remarks, what the take up rate has been in terms of the 30-day snapshot and relatedly, how far through the book, are you in terms of offering that that feature? Tricia Griffith : It\u2019s pretty new. We started offering it in February. I think it's been sent out to maybe 5 million customers, I want to say, so far we've had 9,000 that have gone through and gotten just kind of might be off on a little bit of a number. So it's relatively new. Again, we had to file that. So we're through every state regulators to get that approved. And in some states, you can't do that, we don't have UBI. But we're pretty excited about that because I think really did put, in the hands of our customers, the ability to lower their rates, if they're driving less. We'll have more on that next quarter once it kind of flows through the system. Suneet Kamath : Got it. And then my second question is, I believe on one of these calls last year, you guys spent a lot of time talking about some updates to your homeowners, sort of predictive models. I know 2020 was kind of an odd year. But just any sense in terms of how the new models held up. If you can say anything given how odd last year was? Tricia Griffith : And when you're saying models, are you talking about like the models we look at for weather or overall like our segmentation models internally? Suneet Kamath : Yes, the former, related to weather. I think that was what you guys were highlighting? Tricia Griffith : Yes. In a sense that actually, we have hired a new risk and reinsurance leader, who was really going to be focusing on, looking at our risk appetite and being more holistic across the enterprise. And then he, what is his big opportunity is to look at is assessing our reliance on models and our usage so a little bit more to come on that. And I think being more planful and coordinated with our placements of reinsurance. So I know it's a little bit off of that, but I know we rely on the Karen Clark model these storms have been pretty unprecedented. I hate using that word again. But the Hurricane season last year was immense in terms of numbers and the numbers that made landfall. And then of course, rarely do you get a winter storm like we had a few weeks ago. So the models generally take those into account. Having somebody with Brandon's depth, I think will really help us to understand and fine tune our reliance on those models. Do you want to add anything, John? John Sauerland : No, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Klauber with William Blair. Your line is open. Adam Klauber : Thanks. How's the BOP rollout coming? Are you at a point where you can get more aggressive with it? And at what point will that actually start moving the needle? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So we just rolled out our 18th stay. And I would say yes, we're at the point where it's our thought process. I'm working with Karen and her team to get more aggressive with because it's an exciting new product. We've obviously invested in it over the last couple of years. So while I can't give you the exact state rollout, I think the word you use is accurate. Would you want to get aggressive with our rollout of BOP as the year progresses. Last year there's so much going on, so much noise in the system we have a lot going on our commercial side, but I know Karen's really excited to move on now. Adam Klauber : Great. And then TNC was obviously down last year for various reasons, have miles driven started picking-up in that more recently? Tricia Griffith : Somewhat not to where it was pre-pandemic and we're watching that really closely. And of course, we have great relationship with both Uber and Lyft. And we work with them on the race and watching that driving behavior. And of course, it differs by state as well, but it's not up to pre-pandemic level. Adam Klauber : Okay and then sorry last question. You do a lot of digital, digital marketing, you get a lot of customers that way, is the amount of customers whether it's auto or through home, actually doing the full from quote to buying is that increasing or is it still mainly more of a shopping vehicle? Tricia Griffith : No, that's been increasing over the years, I don't have the exact percentage, I don\u2019t know if you do John, but that's been increasing over the years because I think a lot of people shop that way and want buying that way. In fact, we've invested a lot on that with our quoting on HQX and we have more ability than ever to be able to bind and buy online, both auto and home and also on the agency channel. We've had portfolio of quoting, which allows them to do that as well. So one of our strategic pillars is broad coverage be where, when and how customers want to shop. So if I'm on my phone, I want to be able to bind or with an agent or online, so that continues to increase as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from James Bach with KBW. Your line is open. James Bach : So just looking beyond the obvious growth drivers like the favorable rate environment, can you explain more specifics for Progressive, how important the product launches and the sustained investment in those launches is to growth and possibly enhancing that moving forward? And also how immediate is the payoff for those kinds of investments and those product rollouts? Tricia Griffith : Well, I think, as we talk about our rollouts, whether it's been in Horizon One or Two, I think the product launches are really important. And when we look at what we believe is a strength of ours in industry-leading segmentation, we believe that we'll continue to be a strength of ours. And so we just -- we're finishing our 86 product are in the midst of that, I should say, we rolled out on the auto side 87 in January. And that gives us greater segmentation which is again the right rate for the right risk. And so I think the product models have always been our strengths. We feel the same way on the product side; we're rolling out our NextGen 4.0 product model. And it's always in flux. So we never -- we never say here is a product model, we'll roll it out and not try to make it better, we try to make it better. So there's little we can have, things along the way that will add into the product models once we see if it adds value to get more consumers that are profitable consumers. So that product model period is really important. And it's one of our -- when we think about competitive prices, which of course, this is such a price sensitive industry. Cost and segmentation are a big advantage for us and very important. John Sauerland : And just to add to that, we see the change in customer mix as an example, immediately. So we've been predominantly enhancing our segmentation towards the preferred end of the marketplace. And every time we introduce a new product model, we're seeing a furthering shift towards that more Preferred Customer set. So it is a huge part of our business. It's a huge competitive advantage. We believe we've invested a lot to ensure that we're very fast to market when we find new rating variables or underwriting approaches. And again, we see the benefit very quickly in terms of who we're writing and who we're converting at a higher rate. Tricia Griffith : Yes, I'll add into that with the Robinson a few years ago, we had an internal goal to at some point get a million Robinsons on the book and we're well in excess of that and it just continues to gain momentum. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Robert Cox : Hey, thanks for taking my question. So I noticed that the percentage of commercial lines premium into the agency channel increased a bit in 2020. And I was wondering how you would characterize the demand you're seeing from small business owners purchasing on a direct basis? Tricia Griffith : The direct basis is pretty new. So it's on a lower base. And the history would tell you that the majority of our commercial lines have been through the agency channel. We did see a shift in 2020, based on the fact that a lot of agencies were closed. And with our investment in BQX BusinessQuote is for on the direct side, so we have seen a little bit of a shift, the majority of it is still through agents, some of the products can be complex, and people want to be able to have that guidance and that counseling. But we're also innovating and investing for the future to again fulfill our strategic pillar of broad coverage, where, when and how consumers want to shop, including commercial consumer. So while it's still the majority in the agency channel we've invested in and we\u2019ll continue, we believe to see increase in small business BOP GL on the direct side. Robert Cox : Okay, great. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : In my opening remarks, I said we had added BOP in the direct side and that happened in fourth quarter last year. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. My first question, you obviously you guys report monthly results, even look at the policy trends that I know you often say right not to put too much of a focus on one month, but if I look at your policies in-force in December trends were kind of flat and then we saw I'm talking about sequential December versus November, we saw good pickup in January. So I'm just trying to get a sense of like, the underlying trends within both new business and renewals as you think about the impact of the pandemic and not as much thinking in the market, and how we could think about potential policy growth from here? Sorry, I know, that's a kind of a couple part question. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. I'll talk a little bit about the calendar effects and then go into how we think about growth. And then John, you can add anything you want. So remember, we have a different calendar, we don't go by the Gregorian calendar. In 2019, if you're looking at new apps in particular, it was a 53-week year and quarter four was a 14-week quarter. So when you look at new app growth, year-to-date or I should say in agency, the fourth quarter was down maybe 1% but it was up on the direct side about 3%. If you look at last year, for the quarter, for quarter three, it was down in agency about 4% and up in direct about 8%. These are new apps in particular. You've seen our retention statistics, we're very proud of the fact that our retention continues to increase. We also know part of that is because of the moratoriums are non-canceled. So we know a portion of that has to do with the pandemic. But we also believe that both what we're doing on the nature and nurture side will continue to reap benefits on the retention side. When I think of growth, we look at obviously PIP growth as our preferred measure because trends are going to change up and down depending on things obviously, the pandemic was dramatic. And we can't, we have to react to our trends. And like I said at the beginning, even though no one took rates up last year, we continued to be able to grow new sales and prospects. How we think about it on the auto side and of course, on both the commercial lines, that I've talked about is we're really going to focus on our four strategic pillars. The first one, our people, our culture, we're going to make sure we have the best work environment ever. People that want to serve our customers, and in turn, they reward us with their loyalty. We're going to focus on our brand. So whether it's mass media, digital, making sure that we send out a message of savings and protection and we continue that this year. I've talked a little bit about competitive prices; we care deeply about costs and taking costs out of the system. So that when people do shop us because they love our brand, we converge. And of course the industry-leading segmentation and I talked about the broad coverage. So we're going to continue to focus on that. And -- we -- this year is going to be again another year where it's going to be really hard to compare because the odds are the denominator in March and April because there was relatively no shopping is pretty low. With that, might come and I don't know exactly when the timing will hit income tax returns more stimulus payments, and we're ready and able to write those consumers. So there's going to be a lot of change. I think what we have to be is well positioned, and nimble as things change. And naturally, what my team and I talked about at time, are we ready for this? And so we'll constantly adjust our rate levels to make sure we're competitive, but also profitable, which is one of our core values. We talked about the different product models that we rollout and some of the other items that we've done, like our Snapshot, Apron and other things to do to make sure our customers are taken care of. I know our CRM organization has something in place right now called more time to pay, where you're really trying to personalize that experience if someone just needs a little bit more time or needs some adjustments on their pay plan, because we know retention is important and we know it's important for our customers. So that's a longwinded answer. And I think there's going to be a lot of variables this year, and a lot of it will depend on as states open, if frequency happens. I mean, you don't know what's going to happen and I think of the last pandemic and when will the roaring 2021 to 2022 see, will people be out driving more? We just have to watch the data, and we're going to react really quickly to it. Elyse Greenspan : How much on -- of the book has moratoriums are non-canceled on it? Tricia Griffith : How much of the book has moratoriums that are non-canceled? John Sauerland : Well most states have lifted the requirement to have moratoriums, I think all states have lifted that, there may be a couple less. But by and large to the extent we're accommodating people who might be behind in payment plans that is our own choice. And it is a fairly small portion of our book at this time. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up you guys are looking to make any changes to your reinsurance coverage this year? Tricia Griffith : I talked about having a new leader in risk and reinsurance. And, partly our property cap program in particular, we were considerate of the minority shareholders in ARX and because upcoming renewal, that's no longer a consideration. So we'll take that in consideration. And as you've noticed, over the years, we've been moving up our retention, we expect our retention in this year's renewal to be at least $100 million. So I know that's a change that is on the books. Other than that, I know Brandon's working with our reinsurers as we come on our renewals. Do you want to add anything? John Sauerland : Yes, if you look in the K, you'll see a deeper description of our reinsurance and we did raise our retention this year on the aggregate as well. So Tricia was referring to our retention on named storm coverage. And we also increased our aggregate retention to $475 million, up from $375 million last year, they're also adding to the top of our tower. Some of this is simply because we're growing our total insured value. But we're also as Tricia said, with our new risk and reinsurance leader, getting a little more holistic in terms of our risk appetite, and making some changes upcoming to recognize a little more holistic perspective there. As you might recall, we retained much of the reinsurance program in our property business for years because we had a minority interest there remaining. And their buyout was a function of book value. So there were some interest there in not raising that retention. And obviously at our size and balance sheet, we could raise that and not incur any material risk to our balance sheet. Doug Constantine : That appears to have been our final question. So that concludes our event. Chris, I'll hand the call back over to you for closing scripts. Operator : That concludes The Progressive Corporation's fourth quarter investor event. Information about replay of the events will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for next year. You may now disconnect.",

The company will now make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its annual reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which has been posted to the company's website. Although CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make a brief statement. The company will then use the remainder of the event to respond to questions.  Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive's Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. Constantine. Doug Constantine : Thank you, Tamara, and good morning. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events typically include the presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions may be found at investors.progressive.com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and supplemented by our 10-Q report for the first quarter of 2021, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Doug. Good morning. Welcome to Progressive\u2019s first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. Now with the first quarter of 2021 behind us, we look forward with the optimism that the vaccine rollout brings and the hope of a return to normalcy. Our people are showing tremendous resilience in the face of hardships and a willingness to react to whatever comes next for the positive attitude, which allow us to continue to deliver fantastic results. This quarter, our net premiums written growth was 19% and we reported a healthy combined ratio of 89.3. All lines were profitable with the exception of Property, where catastrophic weather loss is added 30.6 points to the combined ratio. Policies in force growth continues to be strong at 12%. And I'm most excited to report that we pass the milestones of 17 million Personal Auto PIFs, 5 million special line PIFs, and 25 million company-wide PIFs during the first quarter. I also want to point out that this is the first time since the second quarter of 2004, that we reported double digit growth in personal auto, special lines and commercial lines policies in force. We couldn't be proud of that so many people trust Progressive to protect some of their most important assets.  I\u2019d like to take some time to address the effects that pandemic will have on our year-over-year comparative results for the next several months. March was the first month where we saw the effect of the pandemic in our previous year's results. So, it feels like a good time to give some further insight into our March, 2021 results. And to remind everyone of the actions that we took in 2020 that could affect our year-over-year comparisons. This quarter, we reported 14% new app growth in Personal Lines and 29% new app growth in Commercial Lines. The year-over-year growth reflects two items : the effect of the stimulus package and the denominator that includes the onset of the pandemic in which shopping, virtually stalled. Even considering the effects of that pandemic growth is robust. We've often said that PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth. This is a great example, why since the denominator was only nominally affected by dependent. Last year's new business metrics continued to be affected by the pandemic well into the summer of 2020. So not always negatively. In mid-April, 2020, the first wave of stimulus checks, were released which restarted new business shopping. We expect the uptick in shopping last year will affect our second quarter, 2021 year-over-year, new business growth. Also starting in April of last year, we took actions to support our customers, including our Apron Relief Program, which we believe will have an impact on many key metrics, including our expense ratio. At the end of April and May of 2020, our personal auto customers received monthly premium credits of 20%, which provided substantial financial assistance to our customers, but also increased our expense ratio. In addition, as part of the Apron Relief Program, we initiated payment and billing leniency, which temporarily increased our bad debt expense, but also increased our positive retention. Both, policy enforced counts and retention metrics, were affected by billing leniency. In Commercial Lines, our TNC business saw a sudden and dramatic decrease in miles driven and estimated future miles to be driven in March of 2020, which contributed to the significant Commercial Lines, net premiums written increase in March of 2021, as noted in our March release. Miles driven in those premiums slowly recovered over the course of 2020, so we anticipate the effect on the denominator will decrease over the remainder of 2021. Our property results continue to be rocked by catastrophic losses. In the first quarter, which is normally a relatively quiet quarter for cat losses, property business suffered significant losses. Further the hail storms in Texas and Oklahoma that occurred in late April appear to be another large event. While it's too early to assess our ultimate exposure, I'll take this opportunity to remind everyone that we have an $80 million retention threshold from a single storm under our occurrence excess of loss reinsurance program. We'll more details on the late April events and our April release, which is currently scheduled for May 19. I'd also like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the perception study we commissioned at the beginning of the year. It was encouraging to see all the positive comments we received and it was helpful to receive feedback on ways we can improve. One opportunity that we heard loud and clear was a desire to return to the quarterly call format we had before the pandemic. One in which senior managers from around the organization will present on various aspects of the business. We intend to return to this format during at least two of the calls each year, starting with the August call, where we will highlight commercial lines. Looking forward into the rest of the 2021, I'm filled with a sense of optimism. While the pandemic is far from over and we still have many challenges ahead of us, I think, pride in the strength of our business, the resilience of our people and have confidence that the plans we have in place will likely continue to deliver great results in the coming quarters. Thank you. And I'm ready to take the first question Tamara. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first response is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was on the frequency disclosure in the 10-Q the frequency was down, but all coverages except collision in the first quarter. I was just interested on knowing why is it setting more color on what was going on. Tricia Griffith : Yes, we are actually assessing that right now. When we look at the gap in PD and collision, at least one other competitor has similar results. We believe in part it is due to our CWP rates being different in PD and collision. So right now, Elyse, we're having a Gary Traicoff group and our Claims Control group dig in a little bit deeper. The reporting is similar CDP rate is different. So, we're trying to discern exactly what that is. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the raft on you saw some pretty strong new app growth on there and you also saw strong renewal growth as well. So, I guess my question is, is the new business penalty is significant. And is it being mapped by the increase that you are also seeing within on your renewals business as well? Tricia Griffith : I think whenever we acquire new business, we're obviously going to spend more for it in terms of both advertising which you saw increase 25% in the direct sliding commission. So, I don't know that the penalty is extraordinary, John, you can weigh in little bit on that. The renewal, one, we're proud of our service and our rates. So, we know that some of the retention gains are likely due to what has happened during a pandemic in terms of non-cancellation, et cetera. But I wouldn't say that there is a big penalty. John Sauerland : I would agree. The new business growth is certainly a function of the dominator. We recognize that, but it's also a function of 25% more advertising spend. And we always like to reiterate that we are only spending when we believe it to be efficient. But in terms of a penalty, the mix in terms of policies and premium, new to renewal is fairly stable, even when you're growing your business a lot and the business are as mature as our businesses are. Elyse Greenspan : And then just once quick follow-up on my first question. When you said CWP, I just want to make sure is that claims with payments when you were discussing on the collision question I had to start? Tricia Griffith : I'm sorry about that Elyse we have a lot of acronyms here. It's claims without payments. So, claims that come in and then we close them because we no longer see an exposure. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. Extremely thanks. John Sauerland : I was just going to clarify this trend for close without payments for collision has been going down. It's actually predates the pandemic and for property damage has been going up. So that obviously affects the total frequency number. Tamara next question. Operator : Your next response is from Greg Peters with Raymond James, please go ahead. Greg Peters : Good morning. My first question will be on commission rates. I know some of your competitors have lightened up on the commissions that pay their agents. This has happened in the auto business. But also in the property business, a lot of the regional carriers have been slammed with high combined ratios and underwriting losses, and we're also hearing them apply pressure on commission rates. Can you talk to us about your view on commission rates? Give us a synopsis of the history and then what do you think is going to happen to 2021? Tricia Griffith : I mean the history of our commission, right, so we try to look at in aggregate right around 10, 10.5. And then it's different depending on the type of customer that comes in, if things are bundled, we obviously have several thousand Platinum agents to get a higher commission because they are bundling the auto and home those Robinson's customers. And so, if you bring in a group of customers that we believe are going to be there short term, the commission might be less. Again, the aggregate is, we try to keep around 10%, 10.5%. And we also do have some preferred programs and bonuses for agents depending on their loss performance. It's not across the Board, it's with specific agents. Do you want to add anything John? John Sauerland : The 10.5% that Tricia is siting is generally where we run in our auto business. On the property side, we have a higher commission rate. But the overarching objective here is to ensure we have competitive prices, that means we have to have competitive commissions as well as competitive other costs when we call non-acquisition expense ratio or costs. And so really, it's the combination of go-to-market in terms of having a competitive, aggregate expense ratio, both of those come into play and obviously a condition in which we think our agents will thrive. So there has been downward movement from competitors. You are right. I think we have seen some positives to that to some degree, because our commissions are more like competitors these days than perhaps, they were previously, but we couldn't really tease out any specific impact of that. That's where we're going. Greg Peters : Thank you for that answer. My next question will focus on the property business because it does stand out for its underwriting results, which is very unprogressive like. I'm wondering if the view on the property business at this point in time is more of a loss leader to drive retention in the Robinson's. And so, you're willing to sacrifice your margins in order to drive up retention or alternatively, do you also have this overarching objective to eventually get that business down to, I think, your corporate target is 96 combined ratio maybe it's lower because it's property. but some color there would be helpful. Tricia Griffith : Yes. No, we do not want to be a loss leader. Profit is one of our core values. We have a very specific target margin for our property business that, as you stated, rolls up to our 96. We have just been riddled with a lot of catastrophes. It's also a fairly newer business for us in terms of segmentation. So, if you look at over the years, how much we've improved and continued to improve at a really quick rate, our segmentation, in auto, we anticipate we'll do that in homes. So, we have new product models, we have our R&D group working on the right product models, which could be your roof. And we've also have some restrictions for customers in they hail prone states to have them buy relatively higher deductibles for wind and hill because we've seen that that really causes a lot. In addition, we have done a lot of rate increases. So, in 2020 we took about 11.5 points, another close to 1.5 in Q1, and we have another 4.2 expected in quarter two. So, we continue to raise rates to ultimately get to that goal. Now, what we're happy with, and I wrote it in my letter, is the fact that we are getting a high percentage of a bundled customer on both the direct and agency side. And what we know on the agency side is without having a property product, we would not have gotten, likely we would have not gotten most of those autos. So, we want those. But we want to make our target margins across the Board period. So that's what we're working towards. We really have \u2013 along with the industry, have been rocked with catastrophes. And of course, we also have, re-insurance, heavily re-insurance on the property side to protect the downside. But we're not thrilled with those results and we're going to continue to chip away to get to our ultimate goal. Greg Peters : Thank you for the answer. Tricia Griffith : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Your next response is from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. MichaelPhillips: Thanks. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. First question on Telematics and outside of pricing. We've seen some competitors talk about increasing Telematics and claims. And I guess, I'm curious if you could talk about \u2013 excuse me any value that you are currently getting from Snapshot and claims. And then related, is there any opportunities maybe outside of price and segmentation for Snapshot to, I guess, extend the period of time that you collect data from Snapshot to help in other areas besides, for instance, segmentation. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Michael. We've been testing and looking into claims and Snapshot, understanding the facts of loss, fraud, other things for quite some time. I think we've had 150,000 customers that we currently have access to claims information, should they have a loss. And we'll have more to come on that. We've been working on that for a while. But we think it is an important next step for the use in our Telematics. And we've talked often on too about do we have continuous monitoring? Would that help, not only with understanding the likelihood of changing driving behavior, but also can help with other necessary things that customers have grown accustomed to in terms of added services like tows, and gas stations and things like that. So that is on our list as well. Currently, obviously, during the pandemic, our big effort was to try to understand vehicle miles driven and how that relates to work-from-home versus not work-from-home, et cetera, as well as some of the other items we've talked about the Apron Relief. So, I've talked about in terms of actually a shorter monitoring period to give people who believe that they are driving less the ability to prove that through data and give them a lesser rate. But we've been on the UBI bandwagon for a couple of decades, we'll continue to do so, we do so on both the personal auto and the commercial outside, really happy with our smart hall results very successful. And the program is very profitable on the commercial auto side because that's a big expense for truckers. I mean all of those things are on our agenda and we continued to invest a lot in this area. John Sauerland : The other thing, I don't know if we call it Telematics or not, that is evolving is dash cam video. So especially in the commercial space, those devices are frequently one in the same and the higher limits in the commercial space if you have a video, it can be extremely helpful in resolving claims because some of those vehicles are targeted because of the limits. And if you have video that clearly shows in which staged it resolves the claims very quickly. So, Telematics is certainly a benefit, obviously profitability and rating side, as Tricia mentioned, evolving for claims for personal and evolving for commercial as well, including dash cam video. MichaelPhillips: Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Second question is you got some kudos this weekend from the friends in Omaha on your lead you have in Telematics and with those pricing. But I guess if we look at \u2013 and they said, they are going to start to do more. So, I would think that that gap could, narrow possibly if we combine that with if we look at some states where the use of credit score and use of Telematics has been limited, if not all, about bans and these aren't small states, Mass, New York as examples, they're the lead from that competitor is pretty significant over you in terms of market share gains. So, I guess if we combine those two things and credit score may start to fade away in other states and then their use of Telematics may start to pick up. How do you think about that competitive dynamic between you and them in states as market shifts away from credit, and they start to shift more towards Telematics? Tricia Griffith : Yes, great question. I'll use the G-word. So yes, GEICO did, Berkshire talked a lot about it and they are a formidable competitor. And we liked the competition because it makes us better instead for customers. Here is how we think about segmentation. We've had an edge on a lot of our competitors for many, many years now, and we're not going to stop. And we believe rate to risk has a lot to do as many different variables. Insurance, credit scores being one of them, usage-based insurance being one of them, but there are a lot of other variables. We will comply with the regulators. We believe they help to match rate to risk, and they're correlated to ultimate losses, which is really important for all consumers to keep the rates competitive. So, I'm not surprised that they are going to spend more money on that. We also will be spending more money on continuation of our many, many billion miles of Snapshot data on both the auto side and the commercial auto side. So, we like the competition we think it was great. And now ten years ago, I might not have said this. But now we have head-to-head brands. So, you may like her, or you may not, but you know who flow is, and we're very proud of flow, the network and all the different characters. So, I think going head-to-head on all those things is a good thing. I've always been a competitive, and we like that. I think it makes us better. It makes sure that you don't just rest on your laurels. So, we will react to whatever we need to react and continue to invest in segmentation, especially in usage-based insurance, but other segmentation variables, as well as our brand, our broad coverage, and the people and culture at Progressive. And we think all those together are really winning formula. MichaelPhillips: Okay. Thank you, Tricia. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Your next response is from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Hi, good morning. I had a question Tricia in your letter you spoke about Robinson PIF growth up 20% in the direct channel and up 16% in the agency channel. I guess, I'm wondering if you could just sort of level set us here and just think about what percent of the book now is bundled customers? And also, maybe just talk a bit about margin differential and policy life expectancy differential where that stands today? Tricia Griffith : Yes, so we're very happy about the increase in Robinson. That's really what our goal has been to have those bundled customers. We've added some platinum agents on the agency side. I would say, our total book of Robinson right now is right around 10%, which is a much higher than it was many years ago. So, we continue to kind of gain that momentum in Robinson. And what was the other part of your question? John Sauerland : Profitability. Tricia Griffith : Profitability. Yes, they are preferred customers, so we believe they are more profitable. And on the retention side the retention is dramatically different not just on the Robinson side, but as you have, more and more policies with us. So that's why it's so important for us to continue to give people a reason to stay for decades and decades, to be able to have products that can all come from the same care, whether or not we write it on our paper or not. So yes, so that's the preferred customer, and we want wider margins there and the retention is longer. John Sauerland : The target, just for clarification, across the customer segments for auto on a lifetime basis is consistent. So obviously our loss costs vary at times. And frankly, during the pandemic more preferred customers who have the ability to work-from-home have been driving less than other customers whose professions require them to drive to the office. So, while we might have different margins by segment in the near term due to extenuating circumstances, our target margin across those customer segments is consistent, it\u2019s 96. David Motemaden : Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just switching gears a little bit just over to the severity side of the equation just thinking about loss costs, it didn't look like you saw a big increase in severity this quarter. Property damage severity was flattish, collision up a little bit. But obviously hearing a lot about supply shortages, chip shortages, just wondering how you are thinking about severity as we go forward combined with the mix? Maybe claims coming back a little bit. So, the mix of claims might be somewhat of a tailwind for severity where you have a bit more fender benders and that could potentially bring it down.  But sort of just maybe at a high level, just want to get your take in terms of where you expect severity to go, just given everything that we're seeing in the macro environment right now? Tricia Griffith : I wish I knew the answer to that question. That is such a tough one. We are seeing some losses come back, especially now, it makes sense on the special lines side, we'll watch that closely. We haven't been affected yet from the semiconductor shortage. We watched those things closely. Some of the severity, we'll look at in terms of our average premium is down a little bit, and we've had a lot of cat losses. So, all those things play into it. And then of course it really does, like you said, it plays into it in terms of what do people do as different states open. So, will there be more highway travel because you are packing up the kids to go see grandma and grandpa, that may cause less volatile accidents we've been seeing. Obviously, the congestion is less in the pandemic than it will be. So, we are watching all of those things closely. And we're going to be able to react to those. And we've never been in this situation. So, we will watch closely with not just our UBI data, but some other data that we're starting to gleam in terms of understanding when more people are starting to work from the office. And so, we have some occupations and some data that shows some people are already there, some people are there a little bit more often. We're going to continue to watch that because, we think that could creep up pretty quickly and we want to be on top of that. David Motemaden : Thank you. That makes sense. And maybe just following up on that point, was any of that just sort of, I guess, caution or uncertainty did that come through? Because it looks like you guys after decreasing rates last year, it looks like you increase rates in auto, obviously not a little bit by a little bit, hundred percent, but did that have any influence on that rate change? Tricia Griffith : Well, we look at all the trends in terms of what we do. So, after we took to credits, then we looked across the Board and we looked state by state, product by product, channel by channel, and our goal was always to take small bites of the apple because our customers, we know they want rate stability. And so, we felt great at the end of this year and now we're doing the same thing. We're taking a look and different states have very different attributes in terms of increases in frequency and severity and driving behavior. So that less than 1% is just based on us, looking at the data and making tweaks. And we'll do that the rest of this year as we see things unfold. So, it's really using the data and then saying, okay, we need a little bit more on in this product, in this data, in this channel. And that's why, I think, the way we're set up is so good because we're a machine that can react pretty quickly to those trends as they unfold. David Motemaden : Got it. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Operator : Your next response is from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Josh Shanker : Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a clarification, please. On the March 17th Shopping Day, the biggest shopping day you've seen, when people got their stimulus checks, are these Sam with discontinuous coverage who have come back into the insured population along those lines. I mean, yes, I know you are \u2013 you go through certainly right that business, but it obviously doesn't have a lot of persistency. I'm just trying to understand the surge related to the stimulus and what that means maybe for April or May? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Josh. And actually, for years, if you go back, we presented this in IR meeting probably maybe seven or eight years ago. We saw that shopping when people get their earned income tax stimulus from the government. And it is largely Sams. It is other people that I think other constituents that have lost their insurance or couldn't afford to it. But in the large part Sams, and our theory in Sams, we grew up with them. We love them as long as it can make our target margin. So, the stimulus just exacerbated that. These are people that are trying to do the right thing and maybe lost coverage and want to get back in the game and be legal and do the right thing. So, we see this and other stimulus that started in and will continue to be something where we'll increase shopping behavior for the industry as a whole, but yes, in large part is it is predominantly Sams. Josh Shanker : Okay. And then just follow-up on David's severity question. We've obviously heard a lot about lumber prices going up and we've heard about rental car issues and whatnot. Those issues that seem very, very close to what might be a severity inflation related issue for Progressive. In your current pricing, are the inflation issues that are sort of kitchen table issues that everybody knows about that captured in how you're pricing right now, or is that \u2013 is that kind of contribute to future rates? Tricia Griffith : We look at all the macroeconomics that are going on and react to that on a severity basis. I would say on the rental coverage, especially for our first party, we have contracts in place to minimize the amount that you pay per day on a rental. So, we feel good about that. We also believe on the rental side that, if you get out there and see the car, customers want their car back in their driveway. So, we really do try to compress the time with which to get the car back into at or better shape than before the accident. So, we've always pride ourselves on the actual time that takes, which of course affects rental. On lumber, we will start to see that unfold. And if we believe that it is a piece of the severity, we will price that in future rate increases. John Sauerland : Yes, Josh, as you know, our insurance is an interesting product because you truly don't know the cost of goods sold until a year from now in case of home. But the rate indications is what we call them forward looking process to say, what should I price level be over the coming 12, 18, whatever months. We are selecting trends for frequency and severity, and they are informed as Tricia said by macro and economical views, but also a little more specific views such as the cost of lumber. But obviously, that is a near term spike over the long term. We're not sure where that goes. And we would have taken a little more holistic approach to selecting in that case, the severity trend for the price level going forward. Josh Shanker : All right. Well, there's lots of digesting there and I appreciate the answers. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Thank you. Your next response is from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Gary Ransom : Good morning. I wanted to ask about quoting and conversion. I think, I see your conversion is up a lot. That probably is explained by accurate matching of price and risk. But on the quote side, you're doing something powerful that gets people in the funnel in the first place. And you have a big flow of customers. So, if I'm sitting at home, whether I have a stimulus check or not, maybe I'm a Robinson. And simply I decide I'm going to go shopping. Just wondering what's some of the key ingredients of being successful at getting that customer into get a Progressive quote? Tricia Griffith : Yes, Gary. I think a lot of it is our brand. So, we started out \u2013 I started out one of the answers with 10 years ago, 11 years ago, our brand would be different. It's about awareness and people know who Progressive is. They know our brand is a solid brand, is a reputable brand. So that's kind of awareness gets you on the short list. And then when you're on the short list and you shop our competitive prices and our broad coverage gets you in the door. So, we believe that \u2013 we've obviously spent a lot more on brand and other 25% increase in this quarter. And again, we were spending a lot in expanding our broad coverage. So, if you're sitting on a couch and you're a Robinson and you want to buy an auto and home on your phone or your iPad, or you want to call in, or you want to go to your agent, we try to be where, when and how you want to shop just to make it easy for our customers. And then you have competitive prices. So, I think that is really important and that goes, of course, into our segmentation and understanding rate to risk. John Sauerland : Gary, to that I would add, much of our advertising is mass media, but a massive portion of our advertising spend is in digital media. And that can be sort of displaced up, but it is increasingly what we call digital auctions. And there are multiple digital auction marketplaces on the web these days. And I would give huge kudos to our digital media group, because they use the analytical powers that are inherent in Progressive people and make great real time decisions, meaning where should we spend more? Where should we spend less? They also do it recognizing the lifetime value of the prospects that are looking to quote. So, you can imagine if we have a longer retaining customer that\u2019s direct, we can spend more, if it's shorter, you get the whole concept there. So, I think we are pretty good in that space. And that has been a space that has been growing for us a lot for a number of years now. The other important thing to do is once you get the person in the front door, you got to get them to the price. And that is not as simple as you might assume. There are multiple avenues where customers can decide to quit quoting process. And we optimize continuously to make that funnel that starts at the top of the flow, as you said get as efficient as possible to get them a quote and then obviously to translate that quote to buy it. So, I think a lot of this is our great people, great analytical skills, massive data sets. And I think we're doing some impressive things there. Tricia Griffith : And the only thing I would say, this is a little bit off. But once they're in and you do have an incident or an accident, I believe we have industry-leading claim service. We're out there. We care. We're there when you need us the most. I talked about that a lot when there\u2019s cats that we can't control the weather, all we can control is how we treat you as a customer. And we've always gotten really high marks on that. Did you have another question, Gary? Gary Ransom : Yes. I just going to follow up on the 25% ad spend to, based on what you said is that, is it reasonable to assume that a lot of that growth was more in the digital space? Tricia Griffith : Yes. When we look over the years and we look at, take the last 10, 15 years, and we looked when people bought on phones, so now when they're buying a digital, it is the highest rate of growth. Gary Ransom : Yes. And just one a little more on the same topic just is, if I look at the body of science that you're putting into this in terms of the quoting process and all of that, and kind of compare it to the body of science you have for matching price and risk, are they both just as robust? Tricia Griffith : I think so. I mean, I think, when you look at our ability to continue to have new product models coming out where we can even more accurately price rates or risk and get to that preferred customer. We just continued to excel in that. And then on the buying analytical side, I'll concur with John. We have an incredible team. We do a lot of our buying in-house. So, it's proprietary to us. We have an incredible team that understands both the art and science around branding, and then getting in our customers at or below our allowable costs. So, both are highly analytical teams of people that we continue to invest in. Gary Ransom : I appreciate that. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Gary. Operator : Thank you. Your next response to the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please go ahead. Adam Klauber : Thanks. Good morning. Excuse me. Commercial \u2013 the commercial auto is clearly growing cars comparisons, but I think you called out that the \u2013 for hire is growing rapidly. And again, that makes sense with the economy taken off, but I guess, what are you doing different in that line of business? And in particular is more of that business being distributed through the direct and digital? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I think we know we were ready, not intentionally, but when the pandemic happened and more truck drivers decided to go from big firms to their own by their own tractor trailer, because spot rate coverage went up. So, we were ready and we're priced well. And we look at that very closely because we've grown substantially both on the direct side and agency side. We \u2013 for many years, we sold the majority of our \u2013 all of our commercial auto on the agency side. But again, we want to be where, when and how our customers want to shop. So, there was, for commercial auto overall, not necessarily for hire trucking. The highest growth in the direct commercial auto ever came in March of this year. And that's when we normalize for four- or five-week month. It only bested by January of this year and then August of last year. So, we were ready to kind of make hay when the sun shines, we are ready for when this happened, we feel great about the trends and the underlying costs. We also are careful about that because it is high limits coverage. And so, we have selected a 12% severity trend making us very comfortable with our reserves. I think we're in the right place at the right time. We feel like we're more than actually reserved. And we're excited about this new business on both the direct and agency. Adam Klauber : Right. Okay. And then my follow-up in your letter, you mentioned that VMT is down 8% to 10% versus prior years through the end of March and the first week of April, you say that frequency of claims compared to last year is coming up, but in end of March, early April, but it's frequency of claims. How does frequency of claims in the end of March early April compared to say 2017 to 2019? Tricia Griffith : Well, compare it \u2013 let's go first and compare it to what's happening now. So VMTs were down about 10% to 12% March early April. Then it went down to 8% to 10%. It\u2019s back up to 10% to 12%. Claims has not caught up yet. We are starting just in \u2013 really recent data starting to see features grow, hasn't caught up yet. Not surprising compared to 2017 through 2019, what would you say, John? John Sauerland : Well, so we don't actually provide our raw frequency numbers. So, I'm sure you're trying to do that math yourself. And we're not giving you the exact data for. Recognize as well that overall frequency trends for a number of years now have been negative. Obviously with the pandemic, it took a step function down. We look at the frequency, we looked at a lot of things not only versus 2019, but sort of a range of 2017 to 2019 and frequency is still down from we'll call that generally that area, but recognized as well, but before the pandemic frequency was dropping. So, I'm sure we're trying to do a look through to what it was April, May, June, et cetera, look like, and it's even difficult for us to know. But I wouldn't forget those long-term frequency trends for a lot of reasons. I have been negative and of course over the longer-term offset, more than offset by severity, and that's why the industry has been growing. But I would think through that when you're trying to project that frequency is going to look like for the rest of the year. Adam Klauber : Thanks a lot. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next response is from Tracy Benguigui of Barclays. Please go ahead. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Just a follow-up on loss trends. Are you anticipating any delays in seeing claims as the economy reopened? I'm thinking about medical procedures that might've been delayed during a pandemic. I mean, are you booking extra IBNR for that possibility? Tricia Griffith : Well, when we get an injury claim or a PIP claim or a medical claim, well, specifically injury we are \u2013 we have an estimate on what we believe will be the cost depending again, how long that claim is open and what actually happened. And then the adjusters can come in and see if they believe it's less or more, and it can be influenced by data as it unfolds. I think early on, we saw sort of a stall not necessarily in treatments, but more importantly, I think surgeries and of course, there's not a huge amount of surgeries in BI. A lot of our injuries are soft tissue injuries. And so, on a lot of those can even heal on their own. What we did see was a closure of course, and so we can see that open up as well. But I don't \u2013 but with that data that we have years and years\u2019 worth should already be priced in. Tracy Benguigui : Got it. Also in your view, what is the quality of drivers in the for-hire space as folks are looking for employment? Tricia Griffith : I think that varies. I think that really varies. We feel great about the business that we are putting on our book. We watch that very closely. I think a lot of it depends just like an auto on driver maturity. And right now, with the driver shortage, we can see \u2013you can see that changing overall in the industry. We have not seen that, but we'll watch that closely to make sure again that we price rate to risk for that segment. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Tracy. Operator : Thank you. Your next response is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Thanks. I know, Tricia, you talked in the past about how severity is reasonably predictable in auto and frequency left though. So, you have to respond to that. I was hoping you could talk about how you do that in the context of the property book, where policies are 12 months rather than six? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I think we \u2013 largely in property, we look at the age of the structure or the age of the roof. The location is in a hail prone stay, et cetera. And that's right now. We're going to continue to understand deeper segmentation in the property space. And so, I think that will change over time and we'll have more variables that we look at, even on the property side, really the property \u2013 the outcome, the CR has been really solely on catastrophes and freely a lot in Texas. I mean, there has been several things in Texas that have happened, but we look at that. And because of that we \u2013 I talked about the rate increases we put into place last year and next year. We will also look at making sure that we have certain restrictions where we believe we may or may not want to grow. Do you want to add anything John to that? John Sauerland : No. I think it's very similar. And obviously the models use what we call a trend to date with those trends that take into account durations of policies. You mentioned property as being 12 months. The commercial business is predominantly 12 months as well. And we have I think it's close to 10% now and our agency book on 12-month policy somewhere around there. So, it's the same process. It's just a further out trend to generally. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's helpful. If we can switch quickly to the small, I guess the BOP size of commercial. Does the current competitive environment change the timeline for Progressive wrapping up there? Tricia Griffith : Well, when the pandemic initially started, we'd rolled out BOP in a few states and we kind of took a pause, to reassess not whether we're going to go in, but just reassess sort of what states we want to do audit, our computer system, et cetera. And we're now rolling out very quickly, many, many states. We're very excited about it. Remember when we think about small business, we think about employees of 20 or less almost micro businesses that is growing very rapidly, albeit on a very small base. So, we're excited about what we're learning. We feel good about where we're at from a rate perspective. And Karen can talk about this more in August. I mean when we have our conference you know, there's a lot of questions on commercial. And I'll have our outline where we're at on all the VMTs and especially BOP in small business and fleet. But no, we're very excited to continue to roll that out aggressively. Meyer Shields : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thanks. [Operator Instructions] Your next response is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Tricia. Tricia Griffith : Hi, Brian. Brian Meredith : Quick question here for you. Could we [indiscernible] rate or the average written premium per policy decline a little bit here. How much of that is rate-driven, the minus 3% versus how much is just rising deductibles or changes in coverage is that the customers had been implementing during the economic downturn? Tricia Griffith : I would say the majority of it is our rates \u2013 are reduction in rates. We had several customers call in sometimes they were delaying payments, but not huge changes in coverages. I would say rate would be the primary reason behind our reduction average written premium. Brian Meredith : Great. That's helpful. And then my second question, I'm just curious. So, I know a lot of homeowners and policies have we'll call it an inflation card, your inflation protection within them that both in that kind of gradually raise your premiums over time to account for inflation. Does your auto insurance policies carry that as well as that perhaps a potential offset here if we do see some rising in severity? Tricia Griffith : We have some things that we hadn't placed for years. That actually take a factor into place every month for inflation on the auto side. John Sauerland : Yes, to a certain degree that transpires in home generally the home is driven predominantly by the replacement cost inflation. So, something like lumber would be factored into how we would assess your replacement costs at your renewal. On the auto side, we have built in what we call monthly rating factors. So, this is just an acknowledgement that generally speaking over time. Trend in average losses is positive. And so, we bake that into the pricing algorithm so that every month we see modest increases in premiums in those states. We don't have those in all states. It's not a huge impact on average premium. It does help ensure, all else equal a positive trend in average payment in auto. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Your next response is from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Josh Shanker : Thank you for taking more than one question from me. I appreciate it. I noticed that sequential policy count growth in property was the best in March 2021, since I guess going back to September 2018. I know there's a lot of new housing starts and now people are moving out and whatnot, but also there's the amount of appetite that Progressive might have for warning those risks. It does seem that your growth in property slowed down in the last two years and maybe it's accelerating right now. Can we talk a little about appetite? How it relates to both your desire to convert to Robinson and in general? How it related to cat aggregation and whatnot, and is the funnel opening up for property compared to where it was a year ago? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I think, it depends on [indiscernible] a couple of things, one, we've invested a lot on the direct side with our HomeQuote Explorer HQX, so having Progressive property and other third-party not affiliated companies we work with. So, we've continued to do that and continue to have more and more of those companies have a buy button, which makes it really easy to be able to combine the auto home and buy it online.  On the agency side, we've increased our platinum agents have a little bit over 4,000 platinum agents now. So again, more ability to divide us. We want to make money on the property side. And so, we have been, I think we're in 47 states now. We want to go across the country. And for years, we were \u2013 we had a lot of density in Texas, Florida, that area, and we continue to do, but we also want to grow out of those and do the right thing in terms of segmentation. So, our appetite is we want to grow as fast as we can. But our other part of that of course is we want to make our target profit margins. So, we look at those days, we look at x cat to try to understand where we believe the underlying price is accurate. And as I said, we are increasing rates and trying to understand segmentation a little bit more deeply. So, we want to grow there. We want to grow Robinson that's one of the reasons why we've made so many big investments but we need to make money on that product. Josh Shanker : Can you give us any sense about how did the percentage of auto policies you have that are bundled whether by a Progressive property policy or a HomeQuote Explorer policy? Tricia Griffith : Yes, the HomeQuote Explorer. So, I would say overall in Robinsons take that we're about 10%. Josh Shanker : 10% of your auto market shares drop at this point. Tricia Griffith : Yes. Josh Shanker : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And next response is from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Hi, thanks for taking another question from me. Tricia, I just wanted to just maybe talk about the road test offering in a bit more detail and just see where that stands. If you have plans to roll it out on a broader scale and how much \u2013 how traction has been there? Tricia Griffith : What we've been \u2013 we continue to be challenged a little bit with the economics on road test. So, we're redefining some of the metrics and I would stay on that more to come. We continue to develop there, but we need to make the economics work. David Motemaden : Got it. And what is it about the economics? Maybe flush that out a little bit like, what is the sticking point that you see that make it hard for the economics to work there? Tricia Griffith : There's several different things. I'd rather have us outline exactly what's working, one is working and hopefully that'll be soon. David Motemaden : Okay. That's fair. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next response is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. My first question, you guys obviously just announced the Protective acquisition and I recognize, you're waiting kind of, so that closes to give us more details there, but just since you brought me think about additional M&A from here, I know obviously Progressive as often shied away from M&A except in a couple of unique circumstances. So, can you just provide us kind of your current view and anything that might cause you to pursue additional transactions down the road? Tricia Griffith : We have corporate development department that is under Andrew Quigg and our strategy group. It always kind of like searches a landscape to see things. Acquisitions are hard and it's hard for us specifically, I think because of our culture. And that's why the limited number that we've done, we have felt have great products, great culture fit with us and can be cumulative. So, I've talked a few times about the ASI acquisition. We didn't have the ability to bundle customers in agency channel that gives us that. We talked a little bit about the Protective and thank you for allowing us to talk more about that after the transaction closes. So, I will always look at what does it bring to Progressive that we can't grow organically, or that will help us get to market faster. And that's kind of how I see it. And we're always thinking of look, but again, I want to be able to doesn't give us access to customers, access to technology, or the ability to get the market faster is kind of how I look at acquisitions. Elyse Greenspan : Right. And then my second question you had mentioned that Snapshot Apron Relief product last quarter on, and then there was a little bit of color within your letter in the Q. But I was just wondering it seems like it's still early, but are there any like observations that you've noticed kind of some switching like that shorter driving period relative to other products and just in general observation? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So, we haven't in 43 states and we, again, like you said Elyse, so I could unfold. We sent out communications to about 14 million customers and about 40,000 of those enrolled so to have that 30 days. So far 9,400 have reached that 30-day point and a pretty small percentage about 4% have called us to join the program. And we still feel very proud of the fact that we did that because it does allow people to reduce their rates if they're driving lives or their behavior of driving differs. So again, we still have some time before all the customers roll out, but a relatively small percentage has actually joined the Snapshot program. Elyse Greenspan : Is the idea to keep this going like, obviously it was tied right to the pandemic and the impact that\u2019s had on driving behavior? But the idea to keep an option of a shorter driving monitor period available indefinitely, or is there kind of normally might have this for a certain time period. Tricia Griffith : Yes. We have this program in place till July this year. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the color. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. Doug Constantine : We've exhausted our scheduled time. So that concludes our event. Tamara, I'll hand the call back over to you for closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation\u2019 first quarter investor event. Information about the replay of the event will be available on the investor relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Doug Constantine : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for Progressive\u2019s Second Quarter Investor Event. I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations and I will be your moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided and its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders which have been posted to the company's website. This quarter marks the return to our typical format, which is a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions-and-answers with leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as supplemented by our 10-Q report for the first and second quarters of 2021. We will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements, and other discussions of challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website @investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments, Trisha. Tricia Griffith : Let me set the stage for this session. As a reminder, these are construct we call the four cornerstones. This construct allows us to focus and make investments that drive value to the organization and all of our constituents; who we are, which are our five core values. Peter Lewis wrote these back in 1987 and they have served us well over the decades. Specifically during this past year and a half as we've navigated completely foreign waters and have made decisions on behalf of all of our constituents, we have used our core values as a guide. I won't go into all that we did because I've publicly written about much of it but suffice it to say we believe all along the way, we did the right thing. Why we're here? Our purpose statement, which is true to our name, Progressive. We believe this statement is about forward progress, innovation and never resting on our past performance, where we're headed, our vision, which is to become consumers and agents number one choice and [Technical Difficulty] assurance needs with us now and as those needs evolve. We know that we must earn their trust every day in order to achieve this vision. How we'll get there? Our strategy, and more specifically our four strategic pillars, which is how we think explicitly about investing to ultimately achieve our vision. I'll briefly give you a high-level overview of how we think about each pillar. People and culture, our goal is to ensure our people and culture collectively remain our most powerful source of competitive advantage, including attracting and hiring new talent, retain the people we have and developing everyone. So that we can all have long and prosperous careers. We will support our people and culture by ensuring our people can bring their whole selves to work through our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Broad needs, we will meet the broader needs of our customers throughout their lifetimes by being available where, when and how our customers want to interact with us, helping our customers select the best insurance for their current needs, as well as their evolving insurable needs throughout their lifetime. Leading brand, we will maintain the leading brand recognized for innovative offerings and supported by experiences that instill confidence with messages that resonate. Competitive pricing, we will offer competitive prices by pricing rate to risk through our industry leading segmentation, balancing efficiency and accuracy and claims and finding ways to continually drive costs down through process changes in technology advances. Our agenda will be in three sections and we'll cover the commercial auto market and trends in the industry, including our performance relative to the market. We'll do a market overview that will outline our long-term growth plans, and finally an update on market capabilities and expanding our product offering. Before we begin our deep dive commercialize agenda, I do want to acknowledge that we're highly cognizant of the fact that we reported a 100.5 combined ratio for June and are and have been taking steps to ensure profitability as we come out of the pandemic. Commercial lines is a huge opportunity for Progressive. So I don't want to draw attention away from the very important agenda Karen and Jochen Schunter have for you upcoming by offering prepared comments on results. I expect we'll have the opportunity in Q&A to share steps we've taken and are in the process of undertaking to ensure we achieve our calendar year 96 or better underwriting margin objective. Let's kick off the first section by talking about the addressable market. When we began these webcasts many years back, we started with showing the property and casualty addressable market and we discussed our plans for both personal lines and commercial lines. Our commercial lines offerings have evolved over time and of course, we recently acquired Protective Insurance. So we thought this was a good time to give you a more detailed update. To summarize the entire market, you'll see in the center of the slide that the total property and casualty market is 730 billion. The Progressive share 5.7% is reflected in both the blue section of the doughnut and the blue percentages. The gray reflects the industry. On the personal line side, we have a 9.6% of the 366 billion market split between personal auto at 12.9% share and homeowners at 1.7% share. We've had massive growth here but still plenty of room to grow. The commercial lines addressable market is 364 billion and includes a wide array of opportunities. The commercial auto opportunity alone is a $46 billion market, where we hold the number one position with plenty of room to grow at 12.1% share with a large other commercial addressable market of 318 billion. At this point in time, the market that we believe we can both play and win in is approximately 78 billion. If you start near the top of the circle and go clockwise, that entails monoline commercial auto, small fleet, transportation network companies, commercial auto bundled with GL and BOP, small business with GL and BOP, medium and large fleet with Protective and workers comp with Protective. The addressable markets that we aren't currently in include public transportation, larger commercial multi-peril businesses with over 20 employees and products like mortgage guarantee and marine just to name a few. We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and that we started investing in many years ago to set us up for future growth. We've shared these two-by-two charts a few times. As a reminder, the X axis is the combined ratio on an inverted scale, so you want to be to the right of 100. The Y axis is net written premium growth, so you want to be above the black line showing positive growth. Together, you want to be in the top right hand shaded area where we're growing market share at or below a 96 combined ratio. The blue dot is Progressive, the black dot is the industry and the gray dots are the others in the top 10 each year since 2015 through 2020. As we reflect in the past six years, we've consistently been in that area, growing market share and achieving at least a 96 combined ratio. In fact, on both profitability and growth, we frequently beat the industry in any individual competitor by wide margins. I'd like to get into the meat of their program. But before I do that, I'll give some background on our speakers. I think many of you have met Karen before. Karen Bailo is our Commercial Lines President. She's been with Progressive for over 30 years with her most recent role as General Manager of Acquisition and Small Business Insurance. Karen has held several other significant leadership positions including personal lines GM, commercial lines controller, and most notably, she spent nine years building our agency distribution, organization, and positioned Progressive as a preferred supplier in that channel. Karen started her career in customer service as a management trainee and like others on our executive team, she was a claims rep early in her Progressive career. A graduate of the University of South Carolina, Karen earned a bachelor's degree in psychology with a minor in Statistics, and she went on to earn an MBA from Case Western Reserve University. Jochen Schunter began his career in Progressive in 2006, after moving to Cleveland, Ohio from Southern Germany. He's an alumnus of both the University of Dayton where he earned an MBA and of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, where he earned bachelor's and master's degree in the arts. After doing rounds in both the accounting and Alice rotational programs at Progressive, Jochen joined commercial lines in 2008. He started out in various pricing and control functions and then moved into product management. First, he managed several states including California and our market entry into Hawaii and then took on big responsibilities as the leader of our truck product. During his tenure, he significantly contributed to increasing our market share by rolling out numerous product enhancements and also improving segmentation. Now as Commercial Line Controller, Jochen leads the organization responsible for ensuring we run a profitable business. This includes strategy and performance monitoring, risk analysis, data and analytics, rate setting compliance and recovery as well as finance and accounting. I'll now hand it over to Karen to outline our commercial lines trends. Karen Bailo : We'll be sharing a number of charts and graphs to highlight our business performance during this presentation. While our June results include Protective based on our closing date of June 1. For the purposes of this presentation unless otherwise stated, the numbers exclude Protective. I'd like to begin with a look at our performance relative to the industry. This is a 20-year time series of Progressive commercial auto net written premium growth rate versus the rest of the industry. During this time period, our results have really diverged from the industry. There are a couple of observations around growth that I'd like to highlight. First, commercial auto has some cyclicality to it and tends to move with the larger economy. And second, when the market grows Progressive has historically grown at a faster pace. In fact, since 2016, we've doubled the business and gained almost four points of market share. And that equates to more than 20% compounded growth rate and achieving more than 12% market share. The more significant divergence from the market has been an underwriting profit. We've outperformed the industry by 8 to 10 and as much as 20 points over those 20 years. Our objective is to grow as fast as we can at target combined ratios. And we've had a track record of success and outperformed the industry on both growth and profit over those 20 years. There's a number of contributing factors. But perhaps most important has been the intense focus on commercial auto as a core line of business for the company. We've shared this information in the past and wanted to provide a brief refresher on how we approach our auto business. We segment our business into what we refer to as business market targets and we introduced these business market targets for commercial auto in 2014. Since introduced by BMTs are now operationalized across virtually every aspect of our business. That's important because we see meaningful and actionable differences between these BMTs. For example, the demand function is different by BMT and how that demand function responds to changes in different economic conditions is different. We also see that losses present differently and how they develop, attorney representation rates and litigation outcomes differ by BMT. Certainly frequency and severity trends and other factors change at different rates and at different times by BMT, all of which are critical inputs to determining rate level. This granular focus allows us to develop insights faster, be more responsive with strategies and tactics to profitably grab market share. I want to talk about what we're observing in shopping, loss trends and how we're positioned for continued success. We have the benefit of over 10 billion miles of driving data with our telematics data. This chart shows patterns in driving miles highway congestion and highway speeding pre- and post-pandemic. You can see that as stay at home orders were issued, there was a significant decrease in miles driven and congestion on the highway. At the same time, there was an increase in highway speeding. Now while the impact from COVID on small businesses was severe, when we look at our business class level data, it's also clear that different businesses were affected differently. For example, in the truck space, fully a third of our smart haul customers saw their mileage increase, while about 8% were shut down completely. Landscapers and most construction trades were still working and other service businesses were not. Looking at more recent trends, while we see mileage and congestion back to pre-COVID levels, speeding events haven't dropped back to where they were. This raises the question around whether COVID brought a permanent change to truckers driving habits and it's something we'll keep a close eye on in the months to come. In addition to our own data, we look to other macro economic trends to develop a deeper understanding of shopping and small business trends, especially during challenging economic conditions. This chart shows our insurance shopping trends in this case, agency quote growth, for businesses that tie to goods and services sectors index to 2019. Progressive quote data is in the solid line and consumer spend data is in the dotted line. Our experience tracks closely to the rate of consumer spending on goods and services. So this is data we have and we'll continue to monitor. The macroeconomic data shows spending on goods recovered more quickly, while the services sector has lagged and has been more depressed relative to good sectors. Some of that is because services sectors were more affected by stay at home orders and good spending has been supported by federal government stimulus. That intuitively makes sense and we see that in our underlying data. Businesses that were considered more essential, plumbing or sanitation services are those that tied to the transportation of goods, like agriculture, hauling or livestock hauling responded differently versus those that are tied to services industries, like airport shuttles, food trucks and entertainers. The positive news is that as the service businesses reopen, we're seeing a recovery in spending toward 2019 levels. This increase in spending on services should drive a rebound in insurance shopping for businesses related to that sector. Again, food trucks, restaurant delivery airport shuttles just to name a few. In summary, different businesses have been affected differently. And this is important in terms of how we think about trends, the implications for frequency and severity and ultimately rate level going forward. In our last update in 2019, we shared a historical perspective that provides a good illustration of how we will approach today's environment. Back in 2016, we saw a marked increase in frequency between May and November, at the same time, some prior year reserve development was contributing to an already positive severity trend. We responded quickly to address those trends raising rates by more than 10% and made a series of underwriting changes in about three months. And we've continued with a series of changes and adjustments since. Fast forward to recent trends, you can clearly see the impact of COVID on frequency. We saw a sharp decline in frequency as stay at home orders went into effect. And as I shared earlier, driving miles from our usage-based insurance data shows driving miles and congestion levels are back to pre-pandemic levels. And the services sectors are also rebounding. Given all of those conditions, we're seeing loss frequency rising relative to COVID lows when frequency fell dramatically. And at the same time, we continue to see a steady increase in severity trends that we've been accounting for in our rate level indications. Given the variation and how businesses were affected by the pandemic, some slowing down and other seeing an increase in business. We have been and plan to continue to be cautious in our actions. We haven't lowered rates and we've been conservative in our pricing and underwriting decisions. The trends we're observing now are lining up with what's forecasted in our rate level indications. We've planned for frequency recovery and a continued steep severity trend and have kept pace with net trends with a combined rate increase of 29% from the beginning of 2016 through the first half of this year. The additional segmentation we've built into the product over the last five years has proven effective and driven better than industry underwriting results and growth. And I would suggest having a granular approach to the business and reacting decisively to what we see while much of the market is slower to react has been an important part of maintaining strong underwriting margins and growing the business over the years. So we continue to advance our product segmentation and underwriting capabilities and we plan to continue to respond appropriately to loss trends going forward. I'd like to shift to a discussion on expenses and efficiency. Now we know from experience that companies that can achieve a lower cost structure gained share at a greater rate than the overall industry. We've seen that in the personal lines market and believe it matters in the commercial lines market as well. The correlation of efficiency aiding and growth isn't lost on us and we're well positioned on this chart. Now 2020 results show that we're nearly 11 points lower than the industry average in LAE and expense ratio. In a very price sensitive industry that 11 point advantage is significant. But there's a balance. We don't necessarily want to be the lowest because we believe in also investing in what matters, quality outcomes for customers that earn loyalty and investments that foster great work environments for our employees. To that end, I'd like to highlight where we're making investments to improve on both those fronts. This is a view of our expense ratio track record over a 10-year time period. And over that time period, we've seen a 7 to 8-point expense advantage compared to the industry. That advantage was 6 points in 2020 due in part because COVID credits flowed through expenses rather than premium, resulting in a slight elevated expense ratio. While we've had an expense advantage over this time period, we're prioritizing initiatives to extend our leadership position. There are a number of levers that drive expense ratio advantages and while we don't have enough time for a comprehensive review of all the efforts underway, I wanted to share with you two examples that demonstrate active cost management efforts to drive expense reductions and improve experiences at the same time. These both highlight our focus in managing expenses related to our growth and improving our operational efficiency. We maintain a disciplined focus on managing overhead and growth in headcount as we grow the business. This chart is designed to represent a few things. The solid blue line represents overall net earned premium growth. The solid orange line represents employee costs and real estate costs are represented in the solid black line. You can see that while employee costs and real estate costs have gone up, they've grown at a lower rate relative to net earned premium. And there are a couple of reasons for that. One is being disciplined and judicious in decisions to increase staff. We've added the dotted lines here to represent volume driven and non-volume driven employee growth. And while we've grown, our volume driven counts in line with our net earned premium pace, we've been very targeted in adding non-volume driven resources and our non-volume driven employee count has grown at a much lower rate. This discipline has resulted in growing our total employee costs, the orange line less than net earned premium growth. The second is related to real estate, like personal lines prior to the pandemic, our customer and agent services organization enabled real estate expense savings by implementing a home-based consultant model. This model has a number of benefits. It provides broader access to talent and improved our ability to increase staff to support our growing business, especially last year and it's also provided flexibility that employees value. In addition, this model allows us to grow our business without a commensurate growth in space. In 2019, almost 40% of our commercial lines agents and customer services consultants were working from home. Now we're still working through our plans as we transition back to the office post-pandemic. We expect the portion of our customer and agent services consultants that work from home to grow materially as people make the decision to remain working from home going forward. This will support our ability to grow without significantly growing our real estate footprint. The second example of our cost management efforts highlights investments in systems and technology to deliver the products and services our agents and customers value, while focusing on increasing operational efficiency. We've been investing significantly in systems to support our core auto business and in expanding our business with our BOP product and direct small business capabilities. Despite significant investments in technology and systems, we've been able to maintain our expense advantage. Now we acknowledge and expected this relatively short-term increase in technology costs to lower our costs in the long run with gains and efficiency and new lines of business. Now improving efficiency to push our expense advantage is a key objective. Two examples of progress are shown here. We've shared in previous annual report commentary that we're transitioning to a new policy administration system. And this new system is a significant driver of our technology expenses and rolling out the new system is a big part of our ability to drive more efficiency. The new system introduces more modern functionality that enables faster delivery of our products and enhancements and the ability to improve customer experiences and self-service capabilities. The initial launch of this new system in a state brings consumer online buy capabilities. The chart on the left shows the total lift in direct online sales yield with our new system. Now completely isolating the effects of the online buy capabilities is difficult but we're seeing an 80% improvement in online sales yield after introducing this new system. And that would translate to more than a 20% increase in direct auto sales. Now, while direct is still a relatively small portion of our business, we expect this added functionality to bring long-term economic benefit to us in terms of improved sales yield and lower acquisition costs for that part of our business and that's very important as this business grows. A second way we're gaining efficiency is via process automations. On the right is a representation of improvements that we've already made reducing the manual work associated with millions of documents we receive every year via fax, email or paper mail. Until recently, each document had to be manually reviewed and categorized for action either to be attached to a policy and sent directly to storage or put in queue for additional processing. Over half of these documents are in that first group. They don't require any action beyond archival. We have a project underway to automate that workflow by the end of the year using optical character recognition technology to review those documents automatically and attach them to a policy and send them to storage without human intervention and this reset resources to focus on other more value-added work. These are just two examples to illustrate how we will focus future investments. Now while we're pleased with our early progress, we're just getting started. And we have a robust roadmap ahead of us that will target more efficiency improvements and self-service capabilities designed to meet customer and agents expectations. Investments in product, experiences and more efficient workflows combined should enable us to reduce the drivers of costs to service our customers. We anticipate that by lowering our costs, we will be able to further extend our expense advantage and position as well for any market conditions. Now moving on to the other part of our expense advantage. We believe our claims organization provides us with a significant competitive advantage on commercial auto vis-\u00e0-vis our competition. We've doubled the core auto business while maintaining very competitive loss adjustment expense ratios and good quality. Our claims advantage comes from a surgical focus on claims accuracy and efficiency. And back in 2019, we shared how our claims organization leverages the scale of our broader personal lines claims organization with a focus on specialization for high impact and complex claims. We continue to push commercialized specialization as we grow our business. And we also see significant potential in leveraging technology and analytics to increase productivity and claims handling segmentation along with improving accuracy. I wanted to share a brief example to illustrate how we're leveraging data, data science and advanced analytics to monitor and react to claims activity and exposure changes. The image on this slide represents a homegrown tool developed to inform leaders of claims that need review. The tool is powered by a file intervention program that uses analysis and data science to populate the tool and is designed to improve leaders focus on at risk files. This helps improve claims accuracy through better coaching and supports timely claim handling efforts. We know handling delays can result in unfavorable outcomes and the alerts are prioritized and trigger on the best date for the leader to intervene for the most favorable results. In this example, you see a code FS13 with a description potential for delayed total loss resolution. In this example, an alert triggered on March 19, with a message indicating a potential delay in resolving a total loss settlement. The leader intervenes by providing guidance to the claim rep on the open activity on the file. And since the leader intervened, the trigger is programmed to return two days later to make sure the claim rep is following up on the guidance provided. The next alert triggers on March 21. The leader reviews the file and sees that the claim rep followed up on the direction provided so no additional intervention is needed at this point in time. The leader indicates no to the intervention question in the lower left and once no intervention is selected and alert is programmed to return eight days later if the total loss is still not resolved. In this case, the total loss resolved on March 25. And so the alert didn't return for the third time. This is a powerful tool that helps our claims teams efficiently run the business of claims and contributes to more timely and accurate claims handling. A final point on our performance relative to the industry is related to reserving where our philosophy is to be as accurate as possible with minimal variation. This chart shows our commercial auto reserved development versus the industry. We have a much tighter variance and we see two primary reasons for this. One contributing factor is the claims organization we just talked about. Leveraging technology and advanced analytics to increase productivity and get the right claims to the right resource more quickly leads to more timely and accurate claims handling and better outcomes. The other contributing factor is the highly segmented approach we take to loss reserving for commercial auto as we do with our other products. We've operationalized that BMT structure, in addition to the usual loss cost cuts and it allows us to see pattern changes sooner and react appropriately. Having more consistent and predictable loss cost estimates through accurate reserving, lets us understand our true ultimate cost faster and be more responsive with pricing and product refinements. So that's a little background on what we've been seeing in our commercial auto results recently and why we've been able to produce some different outcomes relative to the industry. I'd now like to turn it over to Jochen Schunter who will share a little about our plans for extending our leadership in commercial auto, including how and where protective insurance fits into those plans. Jochen Schunter : Thank you, Karen. I'd like to spend some time talking about our track record of extending our commercial auto leadership position and investments that we continue to make. Let me start by talking a little bit about our two telematics programs that we have in market today. Smart Haul and Snapshot ProView. We're proud to say that we have recently surpassed $500 million of commercial auto premium in force from these telematics based programs and that we've analyzed over 10 billion miles of data. Smart Haul is our truck focused telematics program that leverages the data from federally mandated electronic logging devices or ELD for short, through the federal mandate most over the road truckers need an ELD to managed hours of service. Smart Haul uses driving data from a trucker's existing ELD in exchange for a discount on the insurance of up to 18%. And while conversion is nearly double our normal truck conversion, we continue to see a sizable loss ratio advantage for this book even after applying those steep discounts, which average about $1500 per policy. It's clear this is good business and it's all incremental and verifiable segmentation that we're able to apply at point-of-sale. To demonstrate how powerful the segmentation has proven to be, I'd like to draw your attention to the chart on the left. Telematics is the most predictive variable in our for-hire transportation segment. The depicted bar includes the power of new variables enabled by telematics in addition to variables that can be derived from telematics, such as territory ozone. As you can see, telematics is by far our most predictive rating variable, and we have plans to further evolve the model by adding even more predictiveness to it. Our continued research of driving data is allowing us to constantly evolve and improve the model. Switching over to our other telematics program, Snapshot ProView. We have a program that provides discounts and complimentary fleet management features to our non ELD customers. While this program is much younger, we already see the segmentation power of telematics, especially in segments where driving patterns vary significantly from risk-to-risk. The chart on the slide shows an average drive time for select business classes and a variance around that average. Let's pick the restaurant business class as an example, we have insureds that used a vehicle close to five hours a day, likely to deliver food. At the same time, we have restaurants that used our vehicle less than one hour a day, you can imagine lost cost may look very different for those two used cases. That's just one example how telematics data can help us create new segmentation as we create new insights from the 10 billion miles of collected data. Next, I'd like to highlight some of the most significant milestones we've been able to achieve in commercial auto over the years that we're especially proud of. First, in 2008, we became the largest writer of truck insurance in the United States. In 2015, we became the number one writer of commercial auto overall. In 2019, we became the number one writer of preferred truck in the non-fleet space, I'll talk more about that in a minute. And lastly, this year we passed $6 billion in net written premium making us more than two times the size of our next closest competitor based on trailing 12-month statutory data. As mentioned on the prior slide, we've made big strides in growing our preferred truck book enabling us to become the number one writer of non-fleet preferred truck in 2019. We define preferred truck as motor carriers that have a track record of being financially responsible with three or more years in business and a strong safety record. Based on our analysis, we grew our estimated share of non-fleet preferred truck from 5.9% in January of 2016 to 15.4% in May of 2021. On a direct written premium basis that reflects an annual growth rate of 29.5% over that same five-year time period. We did so by launching product enhancements that improved our competitiveness, while hitting our annual calendar year profit targets each of those yields. Those investments have helped us improve consideration amongst the most preferred trackers shopping for insurance. In fact, of all the non-fleet preferred motor carriers that require our federal filing that switched insurance carriers in 2021 without a lapse in coverage, we got quoted on 48.2% of them. That number is up from 35.3% in Q1 of 2016. With this success, we continue to pursue a robust roadmap to enhance our product and coverage offerings, along with improved segmentation, allowing us to offer even lower rates for the best service. Another exciting opportunity to grow our business across all BMTs is targeted at businesses with 10 to 40 vehicles. The small fleet market is about a $7 billion market, where we have low penetration and only began increasing our focus on and investing in over the last couple of years. As we increased our focus, we saw opportunities to improve our pricing and add fleet specific segmentation to provide more competitive rates to the best fleet risks. In addition, we expanded our underwriting team to support new underwriting capabilities, ensure appropriate pricing and accelerate the underwriting process. Today, we have the segmentation, assets and capabilities to compete effectively in this attractive market. As you can see, on the left chart, we've been able to more than triple our fleet book over the last five years with a meaningful acceleration in the last year. The right funnel chart shows the impact of improvements we've been able to elevate just in the last year driving that growth. While we've been able to increase quotes by 19% in the trailing 12 months, we've been able to increase find the book quotes by 85% and ultimately sales by 92%. Let me cover some of the specific improvements that have allowed us to achieve those results. First, we brought and continued to bring automation and technology to the quoting process helping us to increase efficiency. Specifically, we've automated the review of the supplemental application intake of this data into our database, underwriting review processes and related agent follow-up. We've also been able to improve the quote turnaround time by simplifying the quote process and leveraging our distribution organization to educate agents which in turn is driving agent engagement, more completed quotes and increased conversion. With our continued investments, we believe we're well positioned to continue our growth into small fleet space. Talking about investments in small fleet that's a great transition to highlight our plans to move even further upstream in the fleet markets. That's where our recent acquisition of Protective insurance fits in. Before we get to talking about how Protective will help us grow fleets, let's spend a few minutes and talk about Protective, the products Protective offers and customers they serve. Let's start with some background, Protective insurance is located in Carmel, Indiana, employing about 500 people. The company has nearly 100 years of experience of providing innovative insurance solutions primarily for the fleet trucking operations. Protective operates several statutory insurance companies which are collectively licensed in all 50 states. While Protective will benefit from Progressive strong balance sheet and financial strength. Progressive will benefit from many of Protective's unique capabilities, allowing it to successfully serve the fleet market. Let's talk about some of those capabilities and the Protective product suite. Protective sales many of the lines we're very familiar with, including commercial auto physical damage, commercial auto liability, non-trucking liability, cargo and general liability. In addition and very critical to fleets coverage needs, Protective office workers comp and occupational accident to coverages that are very additive to Progressive suffering. In fact, workers comp reflects the largest statutory commercial coverage in terms of premium, even bigger than commercial auto. As mentioned on the prior slide, this is done through a variety of statutory entities and distribution channels. Next, let's cover what customers protect themselves. While we just talked about Progressive's number one position in truck overhaul, it's important to note that we've achieved that position primarily by dominating the less than 10 vehicle space. Only recently have we begun investing into our fleet product, becoming competitive for fleets of up to 40 total vehicles inclusive of trails. We're early in that journey and while we've hit some major milestones and seen some encouraging growth, we realize that they are needed capabilities we would have to build to effectively compete for medium and large fleets. Protective delivers those capabilities allowing us to move upstream. Those include sophisticated risk retention mechanisms, allowing fleets to participate in the risk and indemnity, safety and loss control programs along with underwriting expertise, and lastly rating by mileage and revenue. Independent contractors in the FedEx affinity program are amongst many of Protective's other customers engaged in the rapidly growing last mile delivery space, a sector we expect to continue to expand over the coming years. Switching to profitability, Protective has had a long track record of generating excellent results meeting their respective profit targets over decades. Similarly to Progressive in doing so they were able to outperform the commercial auto industry consistently. While the last few years have been challenged from a profitability perspective, we strongly believe that the right actions have been taken to return to those industry leading combined ratios. Specifically Protective has refocused on its core business which is transportation insurance. In addition, significant rate was taken to account for the industry steep severity trends. We believe this focus on core products and retake already proving to be successful with the last few quarters showing constant improvement of underwriting results. In addition, Protective has reinsurance in place to protect from significant adverse development from prior accident years. Those reinsurance treaties ensure that retains severities and tails are consistent with Progressive's established risk appetite. Finally, I'd like to talk about how Protective is additive to Progressive's product offering and allows us to expand our addressable market. Clearly, while we're both heavily focused on the commercial auto line, we do so with minimal overlap. Progressive is the market leader in the small transportation space. While Protective is a leader in the medium and large transportation fleet space. Together, we're able to serve that market in its entirety and with Protective's workers comp capabilities, we're able to establish a foothold into that critical coverage. The coverage that is considered an anchor product in the small, medium and large fleet space. We look forward to further complementing each other's product offering enabling both entities to grow market share collectively. Lastly, while we're still early in this acquisition, we look forward to what we call preserve and learn for the remainder of the year. Before focusing on further integrating all commercial offerings under the Progressive commercial lines umbrella. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight that we intend to maintain the Carmel, Indiana operation. This acquisition has always been about growing addressable markets, and therefore revenue collectively beyond what each of us would be able to achieve individually. With that, I'd like to go back to a slide Tricia shared earlier. This slide shows our addressable market, which has grown to $78 billion with this acquisition, which reflects an increase of more than 25%. And with that, I will turn it back over to Karen who will cover our investments in the Small Business Insurance space. Karen Bailo : Efforts to meet the broader needs of small business owners are focused on building products and capabilities to support our agency business and to meet the growing demand in the direct channel. We believe customer choice is important and our goal is to continue to work toward customers having options for how they shop for insurance with us. Our plans include both adding products we develop ourselves, as well as offering other carrier products in our in-house agency. In our experience, developing products ourselves works best in our agency business and we will continue to focus on investments that enable us to continue to grow and succeed with our agents. We're pursuing a different strategy for consumers that come to us directly. In addition to developing our own products, we're offering other carrier products through our in-house agency. That approach is working well for us and it will remain a part of our strategy for that part of our business. In the end, expanding our product offering is all about having a broad enough product portfolio that agents and customers never have to look elsewhere for their insurance needs. In 2019, we expanded our product offering with our own business owners policy and general liability product. This line of business opens up our addressable market with a product that fits with our customer set and creates an opportunity to extend relationships with our customers. Similar to commercial auto, our goal is to have a streamlined intuitive quote flow and competitive pricing derived from expense discipline and price segmentation. We initially limited our appetite to the first five categories in this table, they are big enough to matter, allow us to develop pricing and segmentation skills and allow for a straightforward streamlined quoting and binding process. We've since added a sixth BMT lessors risk. We've limited our appetite in this category to those commercial rental properties that meet our underwriting criteria in the other five. The six categories depicted on this screen account for about half of the 31 million small businesses in the U.S. with fewer than 20 employees. As we did last year with lessors risk, we will continue to expand the categories over time as we gain experience and identify additional opportunities to automate the quoting and underwriting flow. Today, this business is in the agency channel and agents continue to add real value in small business insurance. We chose to deploy our BOP product in the agency channel first and have designed the products systems and experience to succeed with agents. At the same time, we kept an eye on requirements for the digital channel. And last year introduced our product in our in-house agency and our online quoting platform for small business owners. We officially launched our product in May of 2019 and finished the year with four states. Last year, all things considered, we finished strong launching 13 new states and introduced an updated product model. And building on the momentum from 2020, we launched four additional states through the end of the second quarter and four more in July. So we're now in states representing just over 50% of the commercial multi-peril market. And we expect to roll out another nine to 10 states this year and that would result in a state footprint that represents about 67% of the commercial multi-peril market. Feedback we've received from our agents supports our assessment that we have an easy to use quoting and underwriting experience and competitive products. We're happy with our momentum and we'll continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our progress where we can continue to grow profitably. I mentioned earlier that we're pursuing a different strategy for consumers that come to us directly. We built an in-house agency to sell other carrier products and we're having terrific success and growing our direct to small commercial business. In September of 2018, we introduced Business Quote Explorer, which is our online quoting platform for small business owners. With that edition, consumers have a full range of options for how to shop for their small business insurance with us. Going forward we will work to optimize the experience in both of these paths. There will be times when the self-directed online path is the best option for a customer and others when calling in for phone support will be the best option. We're happy with this approach as a strategy to meet the demand from consumers who are coming to us directly for their small business insurance needs. Our small business direct efforts are going well. We've been selling direct to commercial insurance for more than a decade and have made investments in assets and capabilities to meet the growing demand from commercial prospects as well as our own customers. Now pandemic-related shopping patterns do appear to be accelerating the move to online shopping in commercial insurance and we're well positioned for that move. Our marketing efforts are maturing and generating demand and we have a good stable of carriers including our own manufactured BOP and GL product and we've got an easy-to-use quoting platform. As a result of our investments and an increase in online shopping growth has accelerated considerably. And with the investments we're making to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we have every confidence in our ability to continue to accelerate growth within the small business direct channel. Now the ultimate goal is to extend relationships with our customers and provide more reasons to stay. We know customers who have more products with us retain longer. When looking at our business auto and contractor commercial auto customers with multiple products, we see that those with another personal lines product stay with us 5% to 7% longer and those with a BOP product stay about 11% longer. Now we expect policy life expectancy to further extend with more targeted efforts to grow our multi-product customers. Beyond launching new products like our BOP and GL product, we're also working to make it easier to bundle more with us. Our aspirations include making it easier to purchase multiple products across commercial lines and personal lines that new business and to add products as insurance needs grow. You've heard us describe our aspirations of relationships with our customers lasting for decades or longer. We're making significant progress and expect over time our commercial relationships will contribute to increasing the number of customers that have chosen to stay with Progressive for a decade or longer. This is all part of our broader vision to become consumers and agents, number one choice and destination for auto, home and other insurance. And we're excited to have considerable under penetrated addressable market in front of us, where we have the people, skills and assets to succeed. Thanks for your time today. And now we'll move on to the Q&A portion of our session. Doug Constantine : This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions including Karen Bailo and Jochen Schunter who can answer questions about our commercial lines presentation. The Q&A session will be audio only. To submit a question or online audience can use the Ask a Question tab located at the top right of the webcast, phone participants can press star one on your keypad. In order to get as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We will now take our first question from the phone. Operator : Our first question coming from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question. I believe there's been some regulatory pushback, in some states including Nevada, Texas and Ohio to some rates that you guys have filed for. So how does Progressive respond to the situations where you're not getting the rates that you need? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. This is Tricia. We respond with data. So we have data that is showing on steep trends and severity and our need to get rates on the street. And we provide that and try to work with our regulators to get those push through. In the long run, we want to make sure we're available for consumers. And we can only be available if we're able to reach our objective of growing as fast as we can. But more importantly, at a 96 combined ratio or less. So we continue to work with regulators, we've had some good success in Texas, as you mentioned, every state has little nuances. But we're going to continue to work side-by-side to do the right things for our collective consumers and customers. Elyse Greenspan : And then, in the presentation that we just heard, I believe you guys were talking about, seeing beating at higher levels and not going back to like pre-pandemic levels. I don't know is specific to commercial auto. But it sounds like that's perhaps something we're seeing within commercial and personal auto. So do you think that this is a new normal? Because if there's higher levels of speeding, right, and there could be much more severe accidents? And do you think some of the higher severity trends within both commercial and personal auto are perhaps here to stay even after we fully come out of the pandemic? Tricia Griffith : That's a great question. On the commercial side, we're seeing both congestion and speeding up, on the personal line side, we still haven't seen commuting congestion back to pre-pandemic. I think we're just going to have to watch that. I think we thought we were sort of coming out of the pandemic and now of course, with some of the new local ordinances, will that change, will people stay home and work from home longer? We imagine that might happen. So that could continue to have speeding at a higher rate. I think miles traveled as well. When you think about, we opened up, people were excited to get on the road, go on vacations with their family, go see grandma and grandpa, but you're right on the severity of accidents. And we're just going to have to watch that trend and see what happens when we get to some normalcy post-pandemic on commuting and congestion as well as speeding. Elyse Greenspan : And then one last one, in terms of like you mentioned, you haven't seen, drive to work miles fully go back. If you were going to look at your book between the non-standard and the standard on the personal auto side. Have you seen on the drive to work miles perhaps pick up more of the non-standard side with maybe there's less work from home flexibility? Tricia Griffith : Yes. When we look at our UBI miles, we sort of compare it to some occupations that would be more available to work from home. And that wouldn't and so we do see differences in those as well as even age groups in terms of, if I'm retired and I'm able to stay home. So we watch those closely as well. But remember, we price all of our customers to a lifetime 96 and that's what we work towards. Operator : And our second question coming from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Follow up question to the first question that you just answered. Tricia, you said that you respond with data, higher level question that. I guess the regulatory question is, what's the question is, is it tougher to push for rates today than a normal environment? And what I mean by that is, I think there's a pretty clear contrast today, unlike in other periods where the experience period you use to do your rate filings is pretty profitable, unlike the projection period where there's clearly some deterioration and not only deterioration, but questions on how long that deterioration might last is the severity, short lived, is frequency short lived as well. So some questions around that against the backdrop of a pretty profitable experience period that you're using for your rate. So does that backdrop make it harder to push for rate volumes than normally would? Tricia Griffith : I think it is more of a challenge, but remember, we aren't looking in the rearview mirror, we're looking ahead and looking at the severity of trends, because we price for those, in the future. So while it's been a challenge, in some venues, we continue to work towards that, and again, we'll watch it closely. And just like we did during the pandemic, after we gave the over billion dollars back on the private passenger auto side, for the credits, we looked across, because we knew that, consumers were struggling, there was layoffs et cetera. We looked across states and channels and products and took rates down a little bit. And so that's really the conversation we're having with regulators. We're going to always try to do the right thing to grow as fast as we can but we have to make our target profit margins. And what we're seeing now is some pretty steep severity trends. And again, we'll watch for that we'll watch for any macroeconomic inflationary trends and the like to understand what our future rate should be. Michael Phillips : Okay, thank you. Second question kind of goes towards whether the personal auto margin deterioration is -- are there certain pockets where it's worse than others. And what I mean, there is you mentioned in the Q a couple things that might make one think so, reduce marketing spend in certain areas. Number one, number two, tightening the underwriting criteria for certain consumer segments, those two things combined, make you think that maybe there's certain pockets that it's worse. And I guess, is that true? Or is it more just certainly across the board because of what's happening with driving levels going back to normal levels? Tricia Griffith : Yes. It's really the margin erosion is really across the board in terms of frequency trends, getting closer to pre-pandemic, severity trends up whether it's injury or used parts. And then, of course, our average written premium was down. When we look at media, when we talk about that we look at our less efficient media. So it's not necessarily based on a certain customer, we look across the board and say, okay, this is our, our cost per sale, et cetera. And here's, what we believe we can get for that. On the other side, we really tried to avoid what we believe could be under priced risks. And so we developed an underwriting program many, many years ago, just to ask a few more questions to understand how to appropriately rate each of our customers to the appropriate risks. So a little bit different viewpoint from when we look at media and we look at bringing on risks that we believe are underpriced. Doug Constantine : I just tag on that to say, in markets where we're struggling to get right back to the previous question, we're more likely to push harder on the underwriting levers. So in markets where profitability has struggled recently, and we've yet to be able to raise price, you'll see the underwriting levers tighter than in a market where we're more confident about profitability. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. David Motemaden : Just another question just on the rate filings and just wondering if you could share, what you're contemplating for future frequency and severity from second quarter levels? You assume that those continue to get much worse or at the same levels? Or, is it going to take some time before you get more actual experience and more results that you can include in the filings before you get data to justify the rate changes? Tricia Griffith : Well, I mean, I think the fact that we're going to continue to take rates up means that we expect some future positive trend. It will be tough to say so we'll watch it and our belief is that long-term trends from a frequency perspective, we believe that there's a chance that could go up to pre-pandemic levels, but if you look at over the last 50 or 60 years, frequency trends have gone down based on safer cars and more strict laws, et cetera. Severity has more than offset that, whether it's injury, attorney reps or components of vehicles and we believe that can continue. We hope that it abates a little bit. But, if you look forward a couple of years, we would hope that they would have be more normalized, so we could have that sense of normalcy. Now, it's been -- there's the comparisons are often also difficult but we watch those closely. And we believe that, as of now, obviously, we talked about the rate filings that we have done in quarter two that will continue to be fairly aggressive with rates. David Motemaden : Got it. Thanks. And just thinking about, I think you said you were looking at 5% rate increases location specific in the second quarter. Is that of the amount you think you need to take across the entire book. If I look at it, I think last costs versus '19, were up a couple percent in the second quarter, versus 2Q '19. And it looks like you took maybe three or four points of rate. So is the intention to get back to sort of the '19 loss ratio level with the 5% rate increase. Tricia Griffith : So the 5% is the average increase and it was an aggregate of 2%. But we do look very specifically across states, across channels, across products. So there won't be a flat rate across any one of those venues, we will look at where we needed the most to get to our target lifetime profit margin. So we'll give you the averages because we're not going to go into specifics. But I will tell you that it's very different depending on the states and what we're seeing both frequency and severity. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Josh Shanker : I want to talk about a year ago, or 18 months ago when the pandemic came on, and you made decisions to refund money to customers to cut price to increase advertising spend, in order to getting a new pool of customers and certainly the growth was very strong during the pandemic, to what extent are those customers that you put on and brought on the book, achieving the lifetime value of 96% or better? And to what extent is this period of compressed margin following with what you expected to happen as you put these customers on your books and frequency came back to normal levels? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, I think we did the right thing during the pandemic and things have been very volatile and very fluid. And so in terms of -- our sort of Holy Grail is retention. So we're going to do what we can to keep those customers at the target profit margin -- the increases will flow into renewal business. And we expect that could cause people to shop and we get that. But what we want is, in our choice of growth is policies enforced, we want to continue that growth, we know that we need to have the right rates on the street and then we've talked about that a lot. Our objective for many, many years, many decades has been to grow as fast as we can, out to below 96. And profit comes first in that order. It's one of our core values. So we'll continue to look at that. How we treat these circumstances are things that we've done before and so, not to this extent, because we don't -- this is we've never been involved in a pandemic, but we've been in these circumstances before. In fact, if you go back in time, 2012 we had similar circumstances where we found that we needed rates at the time, actually, John Sauerland, our CFO was the Personal line President and I was the President of Claims. And we set forth to get the right rate, keep it as many customers as we could, that's really important. And that worked and we were able to grow. But probably the most important example would be in 2016, when we found ourselves over our 96 goal and we reduced expenses and a little bit of marketing and really positioned ourselves well for huge growth. And in fact, in the last five years, we have grown policies in force on the private passenger auto side, greater than 70%. So how we're looking at today is, we believe we did the right thing for customers during the pandemic, we have seen trends steepen at a pretty quick rate, we're going to get the rate we need to get back and be well positioned for that growth that we believe we will calm should we head into a hard market. Josh Shanker : And then, I think you said that March 17, was either the best, or the second best shopping day in the company's history. I think you've probably put on a lot of Sam's or inconsistently in the short customers, to what extent is a huge growth over the past 18 months and really, even just a few months ago by having a new customer penalty on top of your overall book. Tricia Griffith : Well, we have had a lot of Sam's, we've had a lot of growth overall. And I talked in my most recent letter about our growth in Robinson's. And again, comparisons are tough as well, because of the large growth we've had in Robinson's and some of our preferred, but yet we've brought on a fair amount of Sam's in again. We are fine with Sam's coming on the book as long as we are priced to our target profit margin. John Sauerland : I will answer that part Josh, so we have what we call cohort targets, by segment by segment. We call them our consumer marketing tiers. But we also think by channel direct versus agency, new versus renewal and obviously, geographically. And our product managers are constantly looking at their performance relative to those cohort targets. So for example, the new Sam direct customer has a target, obviously new business, we're going to spend a lot to acquire Sam, we're going to want to recoup that quickly on renewal to make sure we were in that lifetime 96. So regardless of the climate we're in, those product managers are monitoring their performance versus those targets. And where we're not meeting them, they're going to take action to make sure they meet him. So we do manage to the calendar combined ratio as a company for sure. And that's what we say our goal is, beneath that product managers are managing to those segments to those cohort targets. Does that help a little? Josh Shanker : Certainly. Thank you very much for the answers. Operator : Now our next question coming from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : I had couple on severity and one on growth. The first one is, I mean, just thinking about this. So frequencies, almost back to pre-pandemic levels. That make sense was bound to happen originally, in any event, we're going to get back there. Severity was plus seven in 2019, plus 10 in 2020. And this quarter was plus eight. So it's not exactly clear to me why this severity numbers all that surprising. I'm just trying to square all this and understand why we only started taking rate in this past quarter. Tricia Griffith : Well, so we've seen severity trends go up in injuries, what we probably under predicted on severity was the used car valuations and not just the magnitude, but the length of time, the duration. And we did look at that for future trends, not to the extent that of what we're seeing. And again, that's something that's been very different during the pandemic in terms of supply and demand and what is happening with new cars and the lack of available chips, et cetera. So I would say that was probably a miss on our part slightly just because we hadn't seen that we did we did see it going up but not to the extent or the duration of time. And then, the injuries we continue to look at, attorney rep rate continues to go up. And we're seeing attorneys earlier in the claim sort of across regions and across limit profiles and there could be a lot of theories on that. It could be that there's more advertising on the attorney parts, it could be that if you're working from home or that you're not working, you're seeing more advertising in order to call that attorney but we are seeing attorney reps earlier in the claims than we have in the past. Ryan Tunis : Got it. Yes, it's not like what you guys were reporting numbers last quarter, people are talking more about the property inflection but I mean, clearly we're seeing some social inflation on the BI side. Is that one that you'd say you're more concerned about, kind of a casualty type lost trend versus property lost driven auto. Tricia Griffith : I mean for the casualty trends, obviously you want to get your arms around attorney reps because those claims are more expensive take longer, not necessarily great experience. We've seen on the private passenger auto because we've seen speeding up there's been more severe accidents. We've seen, labor hours increase and number of parts increase. So that's a little bit different.  On the property side, we had 25 points of cat exposure and so I think, we are looking at a little bit different geographic expansion to make sure that we -- in a sense, derisk a little bit of that book. And then, in addition, on the property side, we want to be able to continue to get rate as we've since last year, and have a more segmented product. So it's a little bit different way we're looking at it, ultimately to get to the same endpoint of a 96 combined ratio. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then, just lastly, will you describe these trends is broad based across all states and customer segments? Or is it more localized, is it more Sam's, is more Robinson's that type of thing. Tricia Griffith : The trends of the attorney rep have been across all regions and they've gone up in different rates upon -- with limit profiles. So that's been across the board. Property really is much more specific in states where there's more weather volatility. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : I don't mean to beat a dead horse here. But is it your impression that regulators are discounting the 2020 year as an anomaly, but relying on 2019 data for indicated rate needs, which may be problematic given their higher premiums at the time and less elevated severity? At least that's what I saw in Texas, explicitly mentioning 2019 data. Tricia Griffith : Yes. It was hard for me to be in the seat of a regulator. I think they're trying to do the best thing they are trying to do for their constituents as we are. And so that's why we share data, we talk it through and we try to do the right thing, which again, is availability for the consumers, whether it be Texas or any other state. So it's hard for me to say what a regulator is looking at, I think they always want to make sure that there's affordability for the consumers that they represent. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Yes. I just want to know, if there's any way that you could make headway or there may just be a difference of opinion, just given you're looking at different parameters? Tricia Griffith : Probably a little of both. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. I've been just thinking of rate increases. I mean, also you took a 6.1% rate increase in Florida. And I'm just wondering how much that has to do with PIP. Understand there's a debate going on right now, if insurance could pay 80% of the claims regardless where it lies on the fee schedule. Can you just remind us your conservatism on that spectrum? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I had a lot to do with PIP a lot to do with injury increases as well, that we've talked about in terms of severity. But, Florida has always been volatile with PIP and interpretations of PIP and plaintiff attorneys. And so we are we're pricing to that. And we've seen a lot as you -- as we've told you have -- reopens based on recent decisions. Tracy Benguigui : So any concerns over prior period that could result in adverse reserve development? Tricia Griffith : For Florida PIP, I think we've seen less late reports, and we've anticipated in 2020, which is on the PIP side. I don't know that there's any prior, I think it's been the last couple of years. I think prior to that, I would say '19 and 20, not as much '18. John Sauerland : That's a great characterization. And frankly, Florida PIP even going back further than that has been a challenge to price accurately because courts decide what they decide and that changes a lot of the past claims decisions that were made, and a lot of files get reopened. So as we pointed out, we have had adverse development in Florida PIP past couple few years. And if you go back a decade, we had similar. The good news is over the longer term, we've been very successful in the Florida market. We have great share there and we want to continue to grow in Florida as long as we're in that 96 right now, as you pointed out, we are taking actions to address the combined in Florida. But again, over the long-term, we're very confident and happy to grow in Florida. Tricia Griffith : And the last thing I'll say on that is, we were very happy that the governor vetoed the latest PIP reform because we thought that would not be good for consumers of Florida. And so, we always work with regulators to make sure we have the right rates there and it is a complicated state but one with which the long-term we've done well. Doug Constantine : We do have a question on the web, asking about Texas and commercial and personalized loss trends and what actions we are taking to improve profitability in Texas. Tricia Griffith : We are taking rate. Doug Constantine : Very good. Livia, next question. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Greg Peters : Good morning, thank you for fitting me in to your schedule. My first question will be on your comments around the targeted 96 combined ratio. You're talking about growing into other lines of commercial and the capital requirements for some of these other lines embedded in commercial are going to be different than the capital requirements, you have with other parts of your personal auto business. And it also, frankly, is applicable to your property business as well. I'm just curious, if your 96 targeted combined ratio changes depending on the capital requirements on the type of business that you're in. Tricia Griffith : Yes. And remember, our 96 is the aggregate. So 96 is slightly different. And it's not for public consumption, but slightly different in different areas, depending on that. What we look at, also is what we want that ROE to be in any part of the business and we work towards that. Anytime you have a new business, obviously, you have a big learning experience when we went into the direct private passenger auto, we didn't make money for many years as we learned and grew. And so we expect those, that to happen as well as we learn new businesses and have our arms around trends. And as we grow, that's one of the reasons why, except for the Protective acquisition, which is very different, because they know what they're doing on larger fleets. We sort of try to grow into that. So a great example is fleets for many, many years, we did zero to nine power units, we felt we had our arms around that we were a leader in that, and now we've gone 10 to 40. So we try to learn along the way. Same thing with small business, we're starting with micro businesses, less than 20 employees to make sure that we learn as we grow and expand that addressable market. Greg Peters : Just like to clarify your answer on that, on the property business, you've been running about 100 combined ratio for five years now. How much longer will it be above 100, before you get -- before it stops being a drag on your consolidated results. Tricia Griffith : Hopefully not long, because we're not happy with that either. I talked a little bit about the geographic footprint and how we are taking actions to be not have such a high percentage in states that have much more weather volatility, because as we said, that's those 25 points on the property CR. It takes time. It doesn't happen overnight. And we've had just a lot of headwinds from that perspective. So I can't tell you the length of time, but we're working aggressively towards derisking geographically, even if we need to slow down on getting the right rates on the street and making sure that we continue to segment our property models as deeply as we segmented our private passenger auto and commercial auto. John Sauerland : I might elaborate briefly there. We are not intending to run property above 100. And in fact, as Tricia was noting, we look at ROE across our business lines and as you note required capital we also look at expected investment returns because the duration of claims is different across lines as well. But we target ROEs across the businesses that are equal to or better than private passenger auto and we back into target combined ratios. So for home as you would expect, given the higher capital requirements, the combined ratio target is going to be richer. We took 12 points rates in home last year. We're on track to do similarly this year. And as Tricia noted, we're taking a lot of actions to get a better geographic footprint that we think reduces the impact of storm losses going forward. If you look back at our recent history, the primary driver of being over 100 has been weather losses. And here it's been difficult to model difficult to price. We're into newer markets. We're learning and we are taking -- we think aggressive actions to get that combined ratio where we want it which is well below 100. Greg Peters : Thank you for clarifying that. My second question, and I know it's really small relative to your overall book, but you did spend a portion of your presentation talking about it and that's Protective. And how you plan to use that as part of your commercial lines expansion strategy. And, if I look at Protective's results, over the last three years really hasn't been able to grow at all, they saddled with one large customer and their combined ratio results have certainly been well above what Progressive likes to target. So I'm just curious, if you could just give us a sense of what you see within Protective that helps you gain confidence that it's going to fit well within your overall strategy. Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think first of all, if you look at Protective and the rates they've taken, as they've seen their steep severity trend since 2019, they saw that and they've been working towards that. And we're seeing the fruits of that. But more importantly, that addressable market that we saw, so there, they put us upstream into larger fleet, workers comp, which is a really important piece for small and medium fleets. So although we didn't talk a lot about what we believe we can do together long-term and we're going to spend this next six months since we literally just closed in June. We're going to spend this next six months, understanding synergies, learning from each other and then getting a very firm game plan together on what we think we can achieve in the next five years. Operator : And the next question coming from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Going back to the -- I guess, capital requirement and combined ratio constraints by line of business, if we're still at 96, overall, and other lines of business probably has to come in lower, should we understand that auto on its own to go above 96 and still be within the company constraint? Tricia Griffith : You could understand that what we look at is very different, how we expense it as well. So on the direct side is front loaded versus more variable on the agency side. It's different depending on the venue, et cetera. But again, the aggregate is 96. And now we look at each of those different areas, whether it's product or channel to get there. Meyer Shields : Okay. I think it's like the related question. And again, it's on Florida, with the rate filings actually requested an increase that was below the indication. And I was wondering if you could talk to the considerations of when that would come into play? Tricia Griffith : Would you repeat the question? Meyer Shields : Looking at a recent Florida rate filing, there was a requested increase, that was about half of the indicated rate increase. And I was wondering if you could talk through the considerations of when you make that sort of filing? Pat Callahan : Sure. This is Pat Callahan, I\u2019m the personalized president. So typically, in some states, there will be a templated indication, and then there's our indication. And when there's a lot of uncertainty, as we look at our future trends, we'll fill out the template as required to from a filing compliance perspective. But then we apply a lot of judgment to kind of how much we actually want to take to balance growth and profitability for the business. So we recognize that in states that are relatively open to file, and then use rates like Florida, we want to take smaller bites at the apple over time to ensure that we're not bouncing our customers or increasing rates faster than necessary. So in the Florida specific case, I expect we're in there frequently, and we will be in there at least once or twice more throughout the remainder of the year. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Gary Ransom with Dowling & Company. Gary Ransom : I wanted to ask about small commercial and specifically, you were talking about more activity in the direct side for the BOP product. Is there anything you can talk about on the propensity to buy online? I've thought about it is somewhat of a slower moving demographic trend, but are there customers that have been through an agent for 25 years and now suddenly that they like online and starting to buy it that way? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think what you're seeing is one of our strategic pillars in place and that's a broad coverage. We want to be where, when and how customers want to shop. And so there are customers because it's a little bit more complicated and especially if this is your dream, your first business venture, you want to make sure you're protected, you have a lot of questions. And so typically and it continue to be the majority of the business have gone through agents in that coverage. We've opened up Business Quote Explorer for those customers not unlike we did years ago on the auto side, when we opened up direct, that feel comfortable with what they need to get there. And as you see the that's gone up a couple percentages, increasing on the direct side, which we are not surprised that and I think especially with the pandemic, where there was less availability, even though a lot of people weren't necessarily opening small businesses, but there was a less availability of agents versus direct just based on shelter in place opportunities that we saw that change. I would expect that more and more customers that have not ever worked with an agent will continue to go online, and that that percentage would increase, we're going to have to continue to get savvy with our investments on the business, quote, explorer side. But that's, we believe a really great opportunity. We love the fact that we have a big agent presence, but there will be customers that want to go through direct and will be there for them as part of our strategic pillar of broad coverage. John Sauerland : Gary, I would add to that. One part of it is demand, the other part is fulfillment. And across auto overtime property and now commercial, we've gotten a lot better online, meaning a far better experience. And we're starting to roll out the ability to buy online. And we see as we continue to improve the experience, make sure customers can get smoothly through quotes and actually buy online, the fulfillment piece of that equation is improving a lot. And in a direct business, to the extent you are making that side of the funnel, if you will more efficient, it's really powerful in your ability to continue to grow that business because the more efficient you are in fulfilling, the more you can spend upfront to acquire customers. Gary Ransom : Is there any specific item you would identify as important to that fulfillment piece? Is there your questions or things along those lines? John Sauerland : Well, the ability to buy online is very, very important. So if people go through an online quote, their expectation generally we think is and some people want to call for clarification, assurance, et cetera. But many people expect to be able to click a button and buy. And we find when we elevate that in a state and this goes back to when we were doing this long time ago and auto we're now doing a property. And now in commercial, when we elevate that ability, the conversion rate goes up. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Just one quick question here. And I think kind of a follow up to previous question. Tricia, I know the personal auto care recently did take a reserve charge and related to participating versus limited, rate scheduled in the court decision in Florida. How did you interpret that decision? And does that factor in at all how you think about your reserve position in Florida PIP? Tricia Griffith : Yes, Brian. Thanks. So I think you're referring to the limited charge and that we have. We accrue for that, as well as a couple of other that has happened over the last couple of years. And so we you know, we look at that we work with the claims organization to understand even though we don't necessarily disagree with the decision that the DCA agreed with that and, we are still challenging that. That said we want to extinguish those exposures and move on because by the time it gets to the core system, possibly to the Supreme Court, it takes many years and so we have our reserves, and our unfavorable reserves have taken that case into account. Doug Constantine : We've exhausted our scheduled time and so that concludes our event. Livia, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Progressive Corporations [first] (sic) second quarter investment event. Information about replay of the event will be available on Investor Relations section of Progressive website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

In addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the latter to shareholders, which have been posted to the Company's website, although CEO - will make a brief statement. The Company will then use the remainder of the event to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the event will be progressive Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I will turn the event over to Mr. Constantine. Doug Constantine : Thank you [indiscernible] and good morning. Although our Quarterly Investor Relations event typically include the presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes schedule for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. Dialing instructions may be found at investors.progressive. com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements.  These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first, second, and third quarters of 2021, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements, and other discussions of the challenges we face. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO Tricia Griffith will make some introductory comments. Tricia. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Doug. Good morning and welcome to Progressive Third Quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. During our second quarter call, we discussed the challenges we were facing as our customers returned to normal driving habits, as the country open from the pandemic and as supply constraints contributed to an unprecedented increase in vehicle valuation. In the third quarter, those challenges continued with the added effect of the most expensive storm in progressive history, hurricane Ida. The result of these challenges is our first quarter with an above 100 CR in 20 years. And through Progressive fashion, we're facing these challenges head on to do what's needed to meet our publicly stated goal of a 96 combined ratio on an annual basis.  As part of our efforts to ensure we meet our 96 target. We're taking rate increases across our product lines. While objections and regulators scrutiny our part of the revision process. The pressures on the insurance pricing, are real. The entire industry has been buffeted by the headwinds of higher severity, post-pandemic increased frequency, and weather-related catastrophes. Regulators take their mandate of adequate rates seriously. And as such, we've been able to work with regulators to increase rates to meet the rising costs.  Year-to-date through the third quarter, we've placed in-market increases in aggregate of 5 points in Personal Auto, 3 points in Commercial Lines, and 8 points in Property. In Personal Auto during the third quarter, rate increases were effective in 20 states, which had an average increase of about 6%. So we're taking the changes in the environment seriously and reacting decisively. We have more revisions and process across our suite of products, as we work to ensure the rest of 2021 and 2022 meet our calendar year objective. Underwriting is another lever that we're using to address profitability.  We continue to use this level in Commercial and Personal Lines to ensure we write exposures accurately and they meet our underwriting targets. In Personal Auto, our 8 dot 7 model, which is now in states representing about 40% of our premium, further advances the science of underwriting. And Homeowners, where profitability has been under pressure for several quarters, we are taking additional steps to hasten our progress to meet our profit objective. In the state with high CAT exposure, we've changed our underwriting rules to reduce our exposure, including targeted non-renewals. While non-renewals are not our preferred path, there are times where we need to use nontraditional methods to meet our targets.  While we take steps on the profitability side of the business, we continue to see strong growth. Personal Lines written premiums grew 7%, while Commercial Lines and Homeowners both saw double-digit year-over-year written premium growth in the 3rd quarter. Personal Lines and Homeowners recorded PIF growth of 8% and 13% in the quarter respectively. Commercial auto continues to capitalize on the macroeconomic environment with its third straight quarter of double-digit PIF growth, largely due to growth in the for-hire trucking segment. Though our underwriting actions often have the unfortunate side effect of reducing growth, our product managers continue to scour the competitive landscape to find profitable growth opportunities.  Finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again, thank Mike Seeger, our Claims President, and Jeff Cherny, our Chief Marketing Officer for their contributions to Progressive and to offer my congratulations on their planned retirement. While I'm confident that their replacements are up to the task, Mike and Jeff presence will be greatly missed. Thank you and I'm ready to take the first question. Operator : [ Operator instructions] one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Mike Zaremski : Hi. Good morning. I guess as an insurance geek, I kind of missed the deep dives you guys do. But -- So first question, I guess a lot of -- I know there'll be a lot of focus on and you gave a lot of color in the past about Personal Auto, the severity side of the equation. I was hoping to maybe get some of your insights on the frequency side. Maybe any color on the rate increases and actions Progressive is taking. Does it -- Is it some of the predicated on the potential for accident frequencies to continue increasing? You think they are kind of plateauing? I know they're nearing pre -pandemic levels, I guess I feel like that's kind of, an odd -- one of the bigger uncertainties out there. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Mike. Yes, that is a big uncertainty and we watch it closely, especially because we have so much data from our usage-based insurance on Snapshot. And there's a couple of interesting trends that I'd like to share, we're going to watch this closely again. There's been so many dynamic shifts since the pandemic that we really do have to watch, and then react swiftly to the data. So if you look at vehicle miles traveled, they haven't really changed since the last call.  There is still down about 6% to 8% from our 2017 and 2019 baseline. The bigger news that we've watched is frequency has picked up. And we've noticed that in each quarter, specifically in PD and collision. So let me give you a little bit of color of the things we watch for. So, during quarter 1, collision frequency was down about 10 points more than vehicle miles traveled. In quarter 2, that narrowed to 7 points, and in quarter 3, that narrowed further to 3 points. So we look at day parts. During quarter 3, that narrowing was across the whole day. During quarter 3, we saw that frequency narrow more during the morning rush hour, so think of 6 AM to 9 AM.  While we see some evidence that there's congestion as well, it's a little bit surprising to us because people haven't fully returned to the office. We read the headlines in most companies because the Delta variant have pushed off a full return to the office till January. So could it be that kids are going back to school so we're taking our children at school. So there's other variables that we're watching really closely. I think what will be interesting is to see what happens first quarter 2022, when many companies have stated they're going to return to work. And of course, what would that mean? It certainly won't mean full return for every single person, since I think there's going to be a lot of flexibility built in based on the pandemics. We think that'll be an interesting data point. We also have observed frequency up sharply in the overnight hours. So think of like 1 to 6AM, both weekends and weekday is not correlated with the March reopening and that frequency is above pre - Covid levels by about 10% to 20%. Again, a smaller amount of people driving. So we're watching BMTs closely by day-part, each state, etc., and will be very interesting to see how frequency continues to close the gap on vehicle miles traveled or not. But we're going to watch that closely. So we were able to get a lot of interesting information from our telematics data and we're going to continue to watch that. Does that help Mike? Mike Zaremski : Yes, thank you for that. My last follow-up question, if I may, if from -- if you look at Progressive's overall paid to incurred boss ratios, I know this is Company-wide. And if we exclude catastrophes, they seem to be down and a lot of the -- for a lot of the commercial cash tensures, we're seeing paid loss levels be down too and some of -- I'm excited that the codes being clogged are running slower. And I guess any color on what's -- anything that's going on there that points to maybe some conservatism in Progressive 's picks? Tricia Griffith : Well, we think of our reserving, in any time frame, we want to be adequate with minimal variation, and that has been consistent for as long as I can remember. I think it's really hard to rely on historical metrics when we're looking at the data. So when you look at case IBNR or paid-to-incurred, whether you compare it to companies or even our own historical data, it's really hard without having the underlying data. So we have changers to our closure rate drop, and then rebound in frequency, increase in severity. All those ratios change when you look at that. What I would say about Progressive is that we feel very good about where we're at, again, with adequate -- with minimal variation. We're about a half point unfavorable for the year, and the majority of that can be attributed to Florida bit. So we don't believe there's conservative and we have not changed our model. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning. Tricia, I preached in the comments in your letter about how you see two forms of risk from the regulatory environment. The first was the kind of risks around mandatory of rebates or just regulatory rebates or mandates around the profitability from 2020. I guess, on that one, are you referring to the possibility of more refunds that might happen and I guess that's -- and if so, how real is that risk? Tricia Griffith : I was referring more to the asymmetry and the fact that we had this unprecedented event that hopefully none of us will have to live here in our lifetime where we had excess margins. And as an industry and certainly Progressive we swiftly gave that back to our customers and our 20% decrease over the 2 months. And then of course, when a decreased rates by another 3%, which equated to another $800 million on top of the $1 billion we gave back. So what I was referring to was now we're in a much different place. Severity trends are up 10 points, and we need rate. And we want to make sure in the end. And we believe that regulators are rational. They want to make sure that we're open and available and have competitive rates, because that's good for all of our consumers. And so, what I was referring to there is when things change swiftly, it's got to go both sides. And in many of the states that we work with, and again, the majority of the regulators we're working with are really rational and get that they want to see the data which makes sense. They want to make sure the rates are adequate for their constituents. But we definitely need rate that is real. Michael Phillips : Okay. Stepping feels real. I guess the second risk was just in line with that prospective rate increases. If -- are there concerns there from when you talk to regulators that maybe what you're seeing on the severity side isn't long lasting and therefore, we don't want to give rate increases if that's the case? Tricia Griffith : Well, it is either because we're state regulated, and there are different ways with which rates get improved. And so different states look at it differently. So as you look at a state like California, their Department of Insurance requires us to look backwards to fill up the templates. So, while California was a little bit behind in frequency, it has picked up and is actually outpacing countrywide at this point. And so, when you fill up those templates, those rate indications are going to be distorted based on the data from last year. What we believe will happen is -- it's not reflective of the claims activity we're seeing. So as frequency and severity trends earn in, we'll be able to put that in the templates and show that we will -- we're rate and adequate and then we'll be able to increase rates in California. For now, we're going to reduce our marketing spending in California to slow our growth, and continues to be able to update that department. So we work with every department, and every department is a little bit different. You can have file and use. You can file prior approval. We work with each department to make sure we give them the data they need to feel good about putting our rates on the street. Michael Phillips : Okay. Good colors. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi. Good morning. So, first I had a question just along the line that have been asked on the Auto business. Where are you and you mentioned California already, but where are you overall through the country in terms of your prices, catching up to what's happening with frequency and severity, and your margin sort of getting to what your long-term goals have been. Is this something that you think happens in the next three to six months or could it be even longer as you go through the whole process with states like California? Tricia Griffith : Yeah, I think it could be a little bit longer than that depending on states. We think will continue to need a little bit more rate, and we're watching the trends carefully. We've talked often in the last -- actually probably 10 years about wanting to take smaller bites of the apple. So we're watching the trends closely, especially because they changed so dramatically since March of last year. And so we're going to watch those trends, and we'll react swiftly. What I would say is that there's a lot that goes into a premium, including average written premium, and that can change.  And it reflects differently depending on states. So you might have a high average written premium in a state like Florida, and if you don't have the right rates and you don't grow there, that would affect countrywide. So there's so many different inputs, including our consumers. So if you -- if you shrink in Sam's versus Robinson's, that will also affect average written premium because they have a higher average written premiums. So we're getting there, we believe will need more and then we'll continue to watch the trend again as they unfold. And I shared the opening question about how we're seeing the trends changed with our usage-based information. And then we'll react swiftly to those. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then just on the Property -- the Homeowners business, I think margins --obviously, you saw gaps recently, but margins have been weak as far back as I could remember. I realize that you're trying to build the business, but is this a business that you think can be profitable on underwriting margins on it's its own or is it subsidizing auto or providing you other benefits that you're willing to continue to underwrite at a 100% plus combined ratio? Tricia Griffith : So, we're not happy with writing it at a 100% combined ratio. We want to make an aggregate 96% in all of our products there. We have different but none of them are over 100, I assure you that. We don't want to subsidize. We do think it's great for our customers at Robinson's that want our brand, our home and auto bundles, so we'll continue to do that. But we know what we've done has started to work, but has not fully worked. Again, if you look at what has happened this year, a lot of it was based on catastrophes.  If you look at and compare it to the industry in more of the non-volatile states, we're actually very competitive. So we knew we need to do something different. So last year, we took up rates, a nearly 12 points this year, 8 points, and then we've talked about cost sharing with our customers. And more importantly, a couple of bigger things that we're doing to get us closer to our profitability is we're going to shift our portfolio of property over the next year or two. We have legacy states where ASI was really strong, and think of Texas, and Florida, Louisiana up through some of the hail alley.  We've had a lot of catastrophes. We have more exposure there because more of our book of business is there. So think of the rest of the state non-volatile. I mean, the rest of the country, non-volatile state, is a little bit over 50% of our portfolio. We're going to shift that over time to be more in the 60% to 70% of our portfolio, so shifting away from the volatile catastrophic coastal states. We are going to appoint more agents in those non-volatile states, reduce our agent footprint in the volatile states and make that movement to have a more balanced portfolio. And I talked in my opening remarks about some targeted non-renewals. We will start to commence that, specifically in Florida. And we're going to work really around that focus on making sure we have more of a balanced portfolio. We both -- we are -- we still are very happy that we purchased ASI now Progressive home, we believe that's in our future, but our goal now is to get to profitability. We believe in the things that we're doing besides the rate increases, and I should mention continued segmentation. So that is a big piece of it. We're going to continue to enhance our segmentation like we have an auto product. And we believe those levers will certainly help us get to where we want to go. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden of Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Hi, good morning. I had a question just around PIF and conversion rates. Wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what's going on in the direct segment. I saw the conversion rates were down only 2% in the quarter, which is a little bit less than I would've expected given some of the rate actions that you're taking. Maybe could you just talk about why this is down? Did that surprise you that it was down that much and not more? And I guess, why -- is that more of reflection of some of the price changes that you're putting through just haven't hit yet? Or does that really just speak to the competitive environment and peers increasing rates like you are? Tricia Griffith : It's a great question, David. There's a bunch of different things including some timing of what was happening in quarter 3 of 2020. So when I think about conversion, I would go back to our decline in new app. So on the agency side, they are down about 14%. We think that prospect denominator was elevated in 2020. So, in 2020, there was virtually no shopping in quarter two. That move to quarter three, and then this year in addition, we pulled back on advertising. So we think conversion was stable, so we do think we still have a fairly competitive product on the direct side. On the agency side, In ups and down about 20% prospects were down slightly, but conversion was down a lot.  That was really due to material tightly underwriting restrictions we put into place, rate increases, and there's like 3 big States where we have material drops in conversion. Again, the timing-wise that may be overstated, even a bit based on the fact that there is a lot of stimulus going on at this time last year. And we also had high conversion in Michigan based on some coverage reform. But you talked specifically about the direct side. I think a lot of that has to do -- the reduction has been -- has to do with advertising from the new apps. So we feel good about our conversion, that could change as more rate come in, and as we reduced more advertising. Do you guys want to add anything? John Sauerland : I would add briefly that the other thing that could influence countrywide conversion is the mix of quotes we're getting across geographies. So with direct advertising, you have the ability to generate quotes at a very local level. And if we have concerns on profitability in an area where we previously had higher conversion, we will shut off or reduce the ad spend in that area, and that would then show the decrease in conversion just by that mix change. When we're adjusting ads spend at the local level, you can see changes in conversion in total simply by that mix. So rate is one thing for sure but interestingly on the direct side, you can also influence conversion based on your marketing spend. Doug Constantine : I would add just one further thing, that when our prospects fall because we spend less, then your conversion naturally goes up simply because you've got more engaged consumers when you're spending less; because they're motivated to come shop. So that will have a counteracting effect on conversion that will offset some of what rate increases would be doing. David Motemaden : Got it. That makes sense. So it sounds like we need to think about just quote volume as well in combination with just the conversion rate as well when thinking about that. That's helpful. That makes sense. And then I guess just for my follow-up, I guess I just had a question on the 5 points of rate that you've taken so far this year. My understanding is some of that is on new business, some of that's on the renewal book. I guess, when I look at the policyholder life expectancies, those were also a bit more resilient than I would've expected. I guess, maybe, could you just talk about how much of the 5 points that you've gotten this year has been -- I guess, how policyholders, existing policyholders seeing a lot of that 5 points yet? Or is that still on the come? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I would say, and Pat, you could add anything. I think that it's still yet to come because think of -- think if we had a rate change on the streets that's starting today, and I renewed yesterday. I had the old rate, so I've got that for 6 months. So I have -- we have some inflationary measures that work into their monthly rating factors. But then, I won't get that new one until that 6th month, and then, it earns in over that 6th month. So it really depends on timing and each state. And remember, it's 5% in aggregate, so it's different in different states depending on our needs, so that rate will continue to earn it. And that's one of the reasons why we continue to have the majority of our auto policies -- our private passenger auto policies on at 6 months position so we can be nimbler when we need to get rate. Thanks, David. David Motemaden : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters of Raymond James. Greg Peters : Good morning. I know you've commented in the past on this, but given the changing moving parts within new business versus renewal, maybe you could just revisit your comments around the loss ratio, or combined ratio performance between the different cohorts. Because I suppose if new business is a little softer, theoretically you should get a corresponding lift if there is an impact in new business penalty. Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I mean, I see -- I think I get your question. You guys could add on anything. Your new business has historically had a penalty when it's put on the books and it's different in agency and direct. That's why it's so important. We talk a lot about our holy grail being renewal business because we start to understand our customers better. On the direct side, we're loading all of our marketing costs on that first 6-months policy in the direct side. So I think when we look -- when I look at that, we look at -- attest differently, new PIPs versus renewal PIPs. Our renewal PIPs are still up. That could change.  I think David asked the question about PLE. We're still up 4% across both channels on trailing for PLE. So we hope that continues. That could fluctuate depending on how much rate we need. And then again, with new paths, we're down slightly maybe 10%. But again, that is very dependent on different commercial or tiers -- marking tier though we're down much more on some, so that affects that as well. So there's a lot of different factors that go into both the new and renewal. And -- did that answer your question or do you need more information? Greg Peters : And while it does answer the question, but I'm always -- I always welcome more information if you want to provide it. John Sauerland : The one thing I would add to that is that, you talked about the new business penalty. Of course, as Tricia mentioned, on direct business, there's a huge expense load difference. So as we're writing few hundred customers that flows through an advertising spend as well. So there's certainly a benefit on spending less and getting fewer new customers in the direct set, in terms of costs. In terms of loss ratio, we see a bigger differential between new and renewal on the Sam end of the spectrum than on the Robinson end of the spectrum. So to the extent we are reducing Sam's coming through the door relative to Robinson's, it would it would have a bigger benefit on the loss ratio side. So there's some of that coming through, but you also have to recognize that our book is heavily, heavily weighted to renewal customers, so it can have some benefit. But in aggregate, we need the benefit of the rate flowing through the book, the new and renewal customers. It's going to flow through renewals sooner, and there's far less elasticity in the renewal book. So you will see average premiums rising sooner and more likely on the renewal side. On the new side, customers are shopping, and it's a highly elastic market. We'll see some of that rate. We'll see a little slower, or we'll probably see a little less of it simply because there are other options in the marketplace. And we move faster than others when it comes to taking rate when we need it.  So we think, and we've seen historically at least, that competitors are seeing the same trends we are. They will need the same price changes. It may take them longer. So we might see a bit imbalance on the new business front for a while. But again, our experiences, competitors see the same thing, they catch up, and by the time they do, we're in a very good position and very confident in growing more and turning advertising back up and the other growth levers we have. Tricia Griffith : Yeah, I think that's great. And as long as, Greg, you want more information? If you go back to the last time we needed rate like this, it would be right around 2012, and we did the same thing. We have a great pricing organization, they're able to get the rates on the street relatively quickly usually before our compensation. So when the market turns hard, we believe we're more competitive and that's really what we're positioning ourselves for right now. Greg Peters : I appreciate the color. I guess, the second question is more detail-oriented because you've mentioned that -- I'm talking about Florida PIP. You've mentioned that we heard it from others. Maybe you could just take a minute and provide us your perspective of what's going on with that. When we see charges for a specific issue, it's my perspective that it's never 1 bite at the apple fixes that. It takes us a couple of bites before it's -- you finally got it resolved. And so I'm left wondering with Florida PIP if we're not in third or fourth inning and we're going to have a couple more adverse hits from that specific issue before it resolves itself. So just some history on what's going on there and what you think about going forward. Tricia Griffith : Yeah, I mean Florida PIF is such an anomaly in terms of what can happen with plaintiffs\u2019 bar there. So you can -- if something can go through the system, it can seem really good, and then it's challenged. And if it's lost in a one part of the state, and then appealed and lost your one in one part of the state. Different things are always happening. With what we have currently, we feel very good about our reserving for PIF and where we're going. That can change any time because plaintiff attorneys in Florida, specifically, can challenge anything, and then you have to make sure you are thinking about the future.  Do you have to reopen? We try to do in anything like this happens where a case of loss by a competitor and usually when a case of lost by us or any competitor it affects the majority of the competitors. And then we determine, is it worth fighting? How long? What does that mean exactly? And we work towards getting it wrapped up and that's really what we're doing right now. We are trying to wrap these up we're trying to do some bigger global settlement of maybe a law firm that has many of our insurers with its litigation to get it wrapped up quickly and as inexpensive way as possible. I can't tell you that something won't be challenged next year. It will tell you that we've talked about it more internally because Florida PIP goes with these ebbs and flows of what happens depending on what happens with PIP perform or not. And so, we're starting to think. More with Florida PIP almost like you do a cat load in some of those other states. And because this does -- this does come more often so I can tell you is we're looking at more like that which is differently than we've done in the past. Greg Peters : Got it. Thanks for the answer. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler. Paul Newsome : Good morning. Thanks for your help. I have a couple of questions on the home business in particular. And first 1, how impactful is the home non-renewal on growth of the new product? I think it's been a long time since you've actually done non-renewals, but bundled product. You've -- obviously, auto piece is really important to you guys. Is that something we should see in the numbers or is it pretty small? Tricia Griffith : Well if -- we have a number of what we believe will be non-renewals. And then we take it down to each customer to say, are there customers that have maybe something has changed with their home, that they've updated their roofs that we can continue to have on the books? We look to see if some of our unaffiliated partners could help if they wanted to take the customers. And it's going to take a while because there's actually a time frame with which we need to work with the Florida Department to make sure that we give a lot of notice. So you're not going to see those first non-renewals happening till May of next year. But we think it will be significant because this cohort of customers are really, really, really unprofitable.  And so we need to get there in addition to moving our footprint more towards non-volatile states. So there's a lot of work to be done before we know the exact number. We obviously have a number of where we think we start with and then we're going to try to work with our customers. We also -- we'll give the customers an opportunity to stay with Progressive if they opt into the new roof payment schedule, which is where there will be some -- a coverage options to share the cost of the replacement with us. So a lot going on there.  And no we don't do non-renewals very often it's -- and usually, you try to get the rate for it, but these customers are very unprofitable. We couldn't get enough rate to have them ever be close to profitable, and that's why we need to do that. It's never something we want to do, but as we looked at our whole portfolio and our strategy going forward, we realize this is an important piece to start as -- to start to set as ship straight. John Sauerland : And while we -- we don't know exactly how many customers we'll have to, now, renew, and as Tricia said, we're trying to work with customers for options to stay with us. You should think of a very low single-digit percentage of our policies enforced countrywide. But this is not a huge shift, but it's a shift, as Tricia was saying, geographically. So while we want to reduce our footprint in the volatile space, we want to grow in the less volatile space. So in aggregate, our objective is still to grow. It's simply to grow in different areas. Paul Newsome : Great. And I actually want to follow up on just that comment on the move into the non-coastal states, the result of states. I would've thought that mainly I just -- that you would have had a lot of these agents already signed up in the -- you have a pretty growing broad national Carrier Agency Distribution to begin with. Was there something in the process that kept you in earlier years from expanding earlier from an agent perspective or -- because I would've thought that today you pretty much have all those agents you'd want Outside of the coastal areas signed up? Tricia Griffith : It's our original and final purchase. ASI was more of a scarcity model. And so we had platinum agents that or appointed to sell auto and home. So we have a lot of opportunity to appoint more platinum agents in the non-volatile states. So that's what we're working on right now. Paul Newsome : Great. Appreciate it. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Autonomous. Ryan Tunis : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just want -- I think, about ASI. It's been clearly, a successful deal from a growth standpoint, but the value proposition to agents has always seemingly been that. You guys would write good insurance in [Indiscernible] states like Florida and Texas. Ryan Tunis : I guess what I'm trying to think about is -- we've seen good growth of the Robinson's. But most of the ASI book is in those two states. How are we going to continue to grow the Robinson's and kind of given there's geographic move and how our agents reacting to it in Florida and Texas? Tricia Griffith : Well, right now on our non-volatile states it's actually -- we have about 54%. So we have been expanding over the last several years to have less density in those states. We are purposely doing this to make sure that we can take care of the majority of that consumers. There's some like we said with the non-renewals than we can. And I think Insurance gets out. I think agents get bad because they also see the data. So for us to make sure we can protect those states, we need to make sure that we only have so much density in those states. So, for us, Florida and Texas are a big part, but still the non-volatile states are our majority of 54%. We're going to get those to 60% to 70% over the last couple -- the next couple of years. And when we look at that compared to the industry, we outperformed based on that state mix. Again, we got to change that state mix to make sure that flows through with everything. Ryan Tunis : And then, I guess another foll -- sorry go ahead. Tricia Griffith : Yeah, I was going to say something. Ryan Tunis : I was going to say you referenced the majority of the book being in those two states sets. That's a little heavier than reality. And since we became owners of ARX/ASI, we have been diversifying the book. Now, it hasn't always been to the less volatile states, unfortunately, so we have grown in some other volatile states, think Hail Alley, but we have done a lot to diversify the book. We've just come to the more recent realization that we need to diversify more and faster. And I guess one other thing is -- I'm wondering if maybe you guys are overreacting just a little bit to the elevated costs Even this quarter, you guys have done a great job with reinsurance. Accounts are still not a significant part of your loss costs roll into the most insurers. I'm just wondering why this is really that big of a deal, especially because you have the reinsurance. I always thought that home was more -- not a loss leader per se, but the purpose of selling home was to sell well's business and that's been successful. So why abandon that, or why kind of move away from that simply because you have an extra couple of points of costs Tricia Griffith : Our purposes to have -- to having a home, specifically in the agency channel, was to grow more Robinson, but it was never going to be a loss leader. It was to make money on the home and make money on the auto bundle, have great claims service. So, that hasn't changed. So, I might say we're overreacting if we did this a year ago or 2 years ago, we continue to see quarter-over-quarter, where we're struggling to make money and cats is a big part of it. Reinsurance is great, but it doesn't come without a pretty heavy cause. So we want to make sure that we use our shareholders capital the right way. And we believe this is the best way to do it. John Sauerland : We're just -- we're not only reacting to the results. We've been digging harder into the modeling and looking at our exposure for what they could best look like even after reinsurance. So while we are heavily reinsured and we're pretty [indiscernible] relative to our total insured value, especially those cut states, there are still potential scenarios. And that's what we're trying to manage. The tail risk is still there. We haven't seen it. But we want to be proactive in managing that, so that we don't see that down the road. Pat Callahan : And one thing that I would add on top, John, and I think you mentioned it, but it's not about shrinking our book in the volatile states. It's about accelerating growth in the less volatile states while we have a period of time where we're investing in product segmentation, and as Tricia mentioned, product features that risk share with our customers. So don't think of it as abandoning the property business in any way, shape, or form. It's a temporary acceleration of growth in less volatile states until we get to a more comfortable balance between volatile and less volatile. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then just one quick technical one. Of the disclosed auto rate increases that you give us, how much of that is coming from the monthly rating factors? Tricia Griffith : A small part of that. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui of Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : Good morning. Could you help me understand how it works in practice, the process you go through request at rate increase in a filing in new state because it doesn't seem to be that simple, as filing new. We've been seeing back-and-forth objections and iteration. So maybe just to walk through an example in Texas, it's our understanding that the public hearing on your previous set of filing has been postponed due to ongoing settlement discussions. In the meantime, it looks like you've submitted two new rate filings for your independent agent and direct business. So I guess where I'm getting at is how long should a filing be in a state of limbo way past the requested effective dates? Tricia Griffith : Great question. So we use Texas as a file-and-use state. So we put the files out there. We were able to put them on the street. They don't need to approve the filings. However, they can disapprove. They have not disapproved our filings and rather filed objections for that. Objections don't mean rejections of our rates. What that means is they want more information. So we've been working with the TDI on making sure supplement, all the information we can have to support our rate level. In fact, since April, we have done a 3-rate increases, one that's just a couple weeks ago. So, hitting into the fourth quarter, that totaled around 13%. So, we don't have our rate hearing.  In fact, they issued a notice for our July filing, but we're sending because we're trying to work back-and-forth on making sure we do the right thing. Again, we had a good long-term relationship with the TDI and we believe they're rational and they want the data to make sure they do the right thing. And if you look at the filings, there are -- we're in good Company with many of our competitors where they're asking for more information. We want to be competitive, and open and available for the people of Texas. So every state is that it could have a little nuance to it, but that, hopefully, gives you a little bit of light of Texas. Objection is just the back-and-forth of data. Tracy Benguigui : Is there an expiration of those back-and-forth discussions? Pat Callahan : No. Typically, it will reset a clock. So some states will have a dimmer provision where there's not an objection filed, than it will be deemed approved after a certain date. But the ongoing especially in preserving great relationships with our regulators, if there's open questions we want to be transparent and provide them the data they need to do their jobs. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. And also, it looks like you're not the only one, and the insurers are making filing rate increases, but it's not uniform like the largest auto rider is lagging on those efforts. So, how can that uneven in like impact the progress of rate increased discussions with your regulators? And how do you think about increased shopping behavior? Pat Callahan : Well the competitive environment that we operate in has some pretty different business models. So whether you have a mutual structure or a stock Company as two good examples, and as a result, there's different motivating factors, different profit objectives, different targets. So while we can't comment on specific area or action, we operate our business to deliver, as Tricia said, the $0.04, and grow as fast as we can. And that may mean that our growth is a little lumpier, but our profitability is generally pretty consistent. Tracy Benguigui : Yeah. I guess, if I look at the last time the market tried to push rate increases, let's call 2015. It's just seemed like a while for the mutual to catch up. And many mutuals now are taking notice and maybe asking questions, but different Company by Company. But I think that may just present opportunities for shopping in general. I'm not trying to pick on one insurer. So how do you think about that in general? Pat Callahan : We fully expect as rates go up that will create shopping and we enjoy. We believe a larger share of the shoppers than we do of that overall market. So generally, that's been good for us when there is a hardening market that create shopping. We benefit because we're broadly distributed and try to be available where, when and how consumers want to shop for and buy insurance. Tricia Griffith : Yeah, but we're not going to change our model because this is in the model with some of the mutual for many years and the money they make is more on the investment side. We're still going to, with many of our competitors, we want to make a profit on the underwriting side. We want to grow as fast as we can, but we're not going to knowingly put a bunch of unprofitable business on our book. And that's why we're pulling back on advertising and during the rate increases. But again, like I said in a prior question, we believe this really positions us well for what we believe might happen as the market turns, and we'll be positioned where the shopping happens. We're going to get a lot of that business. And when that happens, we don't exactly know, but that's why we are positioning ourselves where we're at now based on the data that we see. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Tracy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Bank of America. Josh Shanker : Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Can we talk a little about in the transition when the business is underpriced and your competitors are raising price. Customers still are likely, they come to you maybe at a margin that's not entirely attract ive. We can have a business that's going to come in the doors the next 3 to 6 to 9 months. Even without advertising, I think people will come to Progressive because of your funnel. How -- what's the stickiness of that business at the current price? How do you think about the margins on that business and what is the long-term value of the customers who are coming in the hair pin transition? Yeah, besides advertising, we really do try to have some tighter underwriting restrictions to not have as much of that business come on the books. Clearly, they are going to come on the books because timing is everything, and so we would get some of that business. Some of it will be underpriced, and I'll get it in renewal. And some of it, if it's overpriced and they shop, they will leave, and that will be okay, especially with what we believe is our industry-leading segmentation, especially if we have data from our snapshot. So it's hard to stay in an environment like this because there's so many variables happening. But clearly we'll get some business on the books based on our brand, and people want to come, and the pricing doesn't hit all at once in the industry. Pat Callahan : Yeah. No, I think that's exactly it. Over the lifetime of these customers, we do expect to hit our targets, and we do price to a lifetime model. Additionally, there's value in selling other products to these customers and establishing a relationship with them now. Even if they may not be priced completely to target, it's not a bad thing for the long-term health and growth of the business. Josh Shanker : And without emphasizing it too much, the Sams, I guess, are going to be looking for the best prices. It feels like you guys are about 6 months ahead of the industry in adjusting your price Can the Sams find a provider with a smaller funnel than Progressive who hasn't raised their price yet, or are you still going to pick up a fairly good share of Sams regardless even while you're raising prices because your customer acquisition capabilities are so strong? Tricia Griffith : Yeah, I think Sams will be able to find a price out there. In fact, I talked a little bit about new business tests being down and they're down mostly in Sams because they're one, inconsistently insured and they frequently shop because it is really about price. So yeah, I think they'll find it and then when the --the Sams is very much about price. So as those companies raise their rates, they'll come back to us. At that point, we'll be competitively priced to make a lifetime 96 on those Sams. Josh Shanker : Ma'am, thank you very much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks. Tricia, I can't disagree with your viewpoint of the regulators as being rational, but sometimes it takes a lot longer than we would hope for that to manifest itself. So I was hoping you could clarify the difference between the indicated rate increases that we would infer from frequency and severity trends in the 5% that you've gotten so far. How much of that is regulatory friction and how much of that is Progressive slowing the increases to maintain retention? Tricia Griffith : Yeah, we're not trying to slow the increases for retention. If we slow increases, it's because, like I talked about in California, the mechanism is more backward-looking than what we're seeing in the claims. So we will try to get the amount of rate we think we needed that time against small bites of the apple. And as we've seen more data, we'll either won't raise rates, or like last year, or reduced rates, or raise them a little bit more. But the regulator timing is really an individual conversation we're having across the country. I gave a couple of examples in Texas and California. California going to take a little bit longer, so we are going to try to reduce our growth there. But I think it's really where we priced our indications and we look at that prospectively. Pat Callahan : Yeah. The one thing I would add is there's just acceleration in our rate takes. So the 5% of the year-to-date number and as Tricia mentioned in Q3, in half the country, we increased rates about 6% cut 3 in that period. So there's 6 months of the year before we saw the real frequency recovery that we were still lowering rates, frankly. And that's factored in there. Meyer Shields : Okay. And that's pricing compared to, I guess, end of year 2020? Pat Callahan : Correct. Meyer Shields : Okay. Second question. Can you talk about what the catastrophe loss exposure in homeowners means for small commercial property? Jochen Schunter : Yeah. The -- so our small commercial property book is very, very small at this juncture. While we are trying to grow our business owner's policy program. And I think we're now in 29 states -- Tricia Griffith : 31 now. Jochen Schunter : 31 now. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : 29, we've been [Indiscernible] at the cue, it's 31 by the time we have this meeting. Jochen Schunter : Yeah. Our property exposure at this juncture, Commercial Lines is very minimal. We aspire to have far bigger share of that business. And at that point, you're right, it will be something we need to manage proactively. At this juncture, it's really not material. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My question is going back to the Personal Auto rating discussion on just said you talked around 6 points of rate in the third quarter. That still does put you below where frequency, for severity are on a combined basis. Tricia, I think earlier in the call, you said that it would probably take more than 3 to 6 months for all these weight to pull through the system. So, when you make that comment, are you thinking that you will at some point get the approvals and get rates in excessive trends or are you also assuming maybe that severity, which is a bit elevated and impacted by the supply chain issues over that time period severity trends might improve, or maybe it's a combination of both. Tricia Griffith : Well, I would say I'll let Pat add what he has. And we will look at prospective need for rate increase, and that's why we're following the trend so closely. And again, they -- there -- it's so volatile based on what's been happening and it could change back and forth. So we'll continue to get that. And we will likely, at this point, if trends continue, we'll see that we'll need even more rate in the fourth quarter and probably into Q1. Pat Callahan : Yeah. We price to our expected cost. And as far out as we can see, the effective date of our revision or the average date of that revision. we're setting our prices based on where we expect trend to be. If trend continues to accelerate, we'll continue to take rate. If trend ameliorates, we'll slow our rate take and not file for additional increases. Tricia Griffith : That's why it's important to be really nimble. And that's why I often talk about our pricing group and what we're able to get to really quickly and decisively. And if you couldn't do that, you might have to take way more rate because it's going to be a big issue to do that. But we're able to be so nimble that we can do that. Watch trends and if we need a little bit more or not, we can act accordingly. Pat Callahan : And that's the key for individual consumers, right? That they get a small increase at renewal which doesn't prompt them to shop as opposed to somebody that waits. And if they wait 6 months or 12 months. And at that point in 88 points or rate are something higher, it creates shopping in your book that's just not healthy, frankly, for the health of the overall book. Elyse Greenspan : And then my second question, sorry, in terms of capital management, you guys shifted to quarterly dividend and going back a few years ago. And then we do -- you have been still been playing a special dividend at the end of most years. This year, obviously, growth is a little lighter given the rate, the rate you're taking. And also, we've seen profitability be impacted by loss trends in auto and cats in home is a prospect for a special dividend still on the table, or how should we think about capital return for this year? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So we're meeting with the Board in December and they will ultimately make the decision on the variable dividend and what we would intend to give throughout the year. We look at all the inputs like you suggest to determine what makes sense. And that's one of the reasons why we changed the dividend policy several years ago because it can from a timing perspective be different from what we're seeing internally, from the gain share program that we aligned it with several years ago. So we're working with the board, and ultimately, it will be their decision in December on how much they believe the variable dividend will be up for this year. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks for the color. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : Thanks, Trish. Back in the personal auto. Just quickly here. So what is your expectations of kind of claim severity here going forward? Do you expect this inflationary environment to persist here for a while? So when you're thinking about filing rates, your kind of assuming these kind of elevated severity levels? Tricia Griffith : Well, we're watching closely because there's so much in play. So obviously if you look at the severity on collision, it's up 14%. And you've been watching what has happened. And as an example was the Manheim Used Car Index. I mean, even the first few weeks of October, it was up 8% over September. And then if you look at October 20 to October 21, it was up 37%. And then pre -pandemic to now, up over 50%. Some of those huge increases we've never seen, so we'll have to watch and see what happens with the supply of chips. Does that open up the supply demand of new cars and used parts? We do have -- we're off a little bit with frequency on salvage returns.  So we're going to watch that closely. What we haven't seen yet in body shops are labor rates increasing. They've been relatively flat. We'll watch that, especially when you think about talent in that area. And we have seen the labor -- I mean, parts prices up right around 5%. Some of that's inflation, and some of that is just inherently expensive parts and more expensive vehicles. So those are the things we're watching, and we have trend meetings all the time, really closely to see if this sort of inflation is transitory or baked into our system. Brian Meredith : Okay. It has to be determined I guess. Tricia Griffith : Yes. Brian Meredith : And then I guess my next question, maybe just to simplify this a little bit. If I look back historically, it's generally taken you all about 6 to 9 months to get enough rate for margins to return to, call it, more normalized levels. Look at '12, it happened that way, '16 happened that way. Is there anything different this time around that we should expect that you'll be able to get enough rate to the system to become rate adequate in the next 6 to 9 months? Tricia Griffith : Yeah, I think '16 was a little bit different because most of the rate we needed was on the commercial side and those are 12-month policies. I think what we've been talking about a lot in this call was regulatory, just some of the objections. It might take a little longer with those dates as we provide more data. But we expect to, as we have in the past, be in that position in that 6-month timeframe, hopefully sooner. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui of Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Thank you for taking another question. Very helpful context to hear that you want to take multiple bites of the apple and be agile as you're thinking about future rate increases, but I'm just wondering, as you're thinking about it, is that 6% that you took in the third quarter? Is that in your view, more of maintaining where you are on loss trend or that be getting more into your long-term combined ratio target similar on improvement of margin? Tricia Griffith : It's on improvement of margins and where we're at with the data we have now that we do look at those prospectively but if we believe we need more and I think the question that Brian just asked makes a lot of sense if we're watching some of the inflationary trends and will launch those closely as we believe we will need those and we'll get more. John Sauerland : I want to offer -- one point of clarification and a little more color. One is that we've heard twice people say we took 6 points of rate in the third quarter. We actually took 3 in our Personal Auto. We took 6 points in about half the country, which gets you to 3 -- 5 year-to-date. And we're going to continue to take rates. So whenever you're taking rate, you are either or both, catching up from what you didn't see when you first priced or you\u2019re pricing for the future. So in a perfect world you're just always pricing for the future, and your previous pricing was perfect. That's normally not the case. You're either a little higher or a little low on your previous pricing. So some of that adjustment is catching up in this environment. It's catching up, frankly. But it is also looking forward as to what we believe frequency and severity trends will be for the coming life of that rate revision be at 6, 12 months. So I just wanted to clarify on what we've taken year-to-date and we say it is -- to some degree catching up, but to a large degree, ensuring we have a very adequate rates on the street going into 2022, so that we're very confident to turn on more advertising and other growth levers. Tricia Griffith : Yeah, I would add that -- so do I. I gave the percentages of what happened with used cars and, obviously, the things that would happen with supply chain. I think the industry overall, missed that because who would have ever thought used parts will go up to that extent. So that -- those are just some of the things we're catching up, and Gary, that 6% was in 20 states? Yes. Tracy Benguigui : Yes. Thank you. I recognize 20 states. Appreciate it. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Doug Constantine : We've exhausted our scheduled time, and so that concludes our event. Deshundra (ph), I will hand the call back over to you for closing scripts.

    "content": "\ufeff Doug Constantine : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for Progressive\u2019s Fourth Quarter Investor Event. I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations and I will be moderator for today\u2019s event. The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q in the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company\u2019s website. This quarter, we will have a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today\u2019s event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations sections of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I am pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia? Tricia Griffith : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. As I stated in my letter, 2021 was a year like no other. We were forced to confront the new normal imposed on us by the pandemic. We faced business challenges unlike those we have ever previously seen, all while continuing to serve our customers at the level they have come to expect from Progressive. Our people are flexible. They can see the challenges coming and react appropriately to ensure we meet our business objectives. Our ability to respond like this is supported by our corporate culture, which is built on our four cornerstones : who we are which is based on our five core values; why we are here, which is our purpose; where we are headed, which is our vision; and how we will get there, which is our strategy. This construct guides us so we are all headed in the same direction regardless of the bumps in the road. To achieve our vision to become consumers and agents, number one choice and destination for auto home and other insurance, we need to execute on our four strategic pillars. In our quarter two call, I spoke in detail about our pillars and their importance to our business and I continued that discussion in my annual letter to shareholders. While each pillar is equally important to support our strategy, today, we are going to focus on a single pillar, competitive pricing. Competitive pricing does not mean having the lowest rate all the time, although we strive to do that as much as possible. Rather, it means having the correct rate to match the risk we are trying to ensure, while at the same time, delivering more value to the customer. We believe that if we could outsegment our competition, settle claims accurately and manage expenses appropriately, providing attractive rates to our customers will come naturally. It\u2019s no secret that the insurance industry is going through a period of immense change brought on by catastrophic weather events and macroeconomic headwinds. Our business is no exception. The changes in Personal Lines results, which is our largest line of business, were especially pronounced. Personal Lines results continued to benefit in the first quarter of the year by lower frequency brought on by the pandemic. However, the last three quarters delivered challenges. Frequency started to rise, returning to near pre-pandemic levels. While the increase in frequency did not surprise us as people started driving more, what was a bit of surprise were the increases in severity, especially the cost to repair and replace vehicles. It was these rising trends that forced us to increase rates. Once we realize these developments were not temporary, our product managers acted quickly, and in the second quarter, started taking Personal Auto rate increases, which were in advance of many in the industry. We have continued to increase rates through the fourth quarter with a total of 8% taken in calendar year 2021. In addition to rate changes, we also had to make some difficult decisions to reduce expenses and increase underwriting scrutiny to hit our profitability goal of a 96 combined ratio, which is the expected impact of reducing growth. While these decisions are tough to make and the short-term results can be difficult to acknowledge, we believe we have built a better mousetrap. History has shown that following times of industry disruption, we have grown our Personal Lines business faster than our competitors with better profitability. Further, it has been after times like this that we have made some of our greatest strides to achieving our vision. Today, we will spend some time talking about the mousetrap that allows us to react faster and we believe more accurately than the industry as a whole. Our first topic today will be on the science of Personal Auto pricing. We will discuss how we take massive amounts of incoming data and apply tools to make risk-based decisions and provide an accurate view of rate adequacy. John Curtiss, our National Product Development Leader, will be presenting this topic. John currently leads our Personal Auto product R&D and pricing groups and has held numerous roles throughout his 19-year career with Progressive. Next, on the agenda is Kanik Varma, who will demonstrate the real-world execution of the science used by our product managers. Kanik has been with Progressive for over 20 years and was recently appointed as the General Manager of the West region. Kanik currently leads a team of about 12 product managers and draws on many years of direct product management experience to lead the team. Kanik will wrap up the presentation by talking about Progressive\u2019s deployment capabilities. Following the presentations, we will of course have our Q&A session. Again, thank you for joining this morning. I will now hand it over to John Curtiss. John? John Curtiss : Thanks, Tricia. Today, Kanik and I will give an update on the rate-making process in our Personal Auto business. We have structured our discussion in a Q&A format based upon common questions we receive from our investors. There are many facets to managing rate level in our Personal Auto business. And today, we are going to focus on two key aspects. First, we will share how we determine our rate need to support our operational goal to grow as fast as we can at or below a 96 combined ratio. This can broadly be categorized into two areas : segment level and aggregate level. Segment level pricing is largely the responsibility of our product R&D group. While very important, we are not going to discuss this in detail today. You might remember that Pat Callahan and Sanjay Vyas discussed our approach to product segmentation back in our third quarter 2018 Investor Relations call. Today, we are going to focus on aggregate rate level, ensuring we are collecting enough premium in total to cover our expected future loss costs and expenses to achieve our 96 combined ratio goal. We will provide an overview on two key aspects of how we do this. The first topic that I will cover is the role of our auto pricing team who is responsible for the pricing indication process and providing product managers with an accurate estimate of rate need to ensure they hit rate revision profit targets. The second topic that Kanik will cover is how our product managers leverage these pricing indications, their broader toolkit, and local knowledge and expertise to set the pricing strategy for their respective states to ensure they hit not only rate revision targets, but also our calendar year goals. We will close the presentation with an overview of our deployment capabilities. In our Personal Auto business, it is very common for us to do hundreds of rate revisions per year, which involves many groups at Progressive. This is an area we have invested significantly in over the years to ensure we have industry-leading speed to market and the agility to adapt our resources to meet the dynamic needs of the marketplace. So, let\u2019s start with the first topic on how pricing and product management work together to determine our aggregate rate need. Before I go into details on our pricing tools, I will introduce six key concepts that we will be covering today. The first is compliance. Our product and rates need to comply with all state regulations, which can vary in each jurisdiction and often include limitations in our ability to use specific variables to rate policies. The second is that we price to cost. Our primary goal is to match the rate we charge with the expected cost to ensure our customers. To determine our aggregate rate need, we need to consider loss and loss adjustment expenses, operating and acquisition costs and our profit load. Third, insurance pricing is prospective. Insurance is unique as we do not know our cost of goods sold when we write a policy. As a result, we need to estimate future losses and expenses and ensure we charge enough premium to cover these and earn our profit load. Fourth, our rates need to comply with actuarial standards. The three primary considerations are to ensure rates are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. And for clarity, when I say unfairly discriminatory, I mean not tied to underlying loss costs. Fifth, when managing our business, product managers need to consider both accident year and calendar year results. Our pricing decisions are based on accident year data, which is determined by the actual timing of a loss or accident as our product offering provides coverage for accidents we expect to occur during our rate revision. Our calendar year results consist of all the losses and premiums for the year, which include the current accident year plus any runoff from prior accident years. Finally, we will discuss our premium earnings convention. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t change rates on our entire book of business overnight. Rather, rate changes start earning in when a rate revision goes live either upon filing or after approval by Department of Insurance and that depends on the state. While new customers see the rate changes immediately, existing policyholders\u2019 rates will change at their next renewal event. As a result, it takes time for rate changes to earn in. Fortunately, Progressive writes mostly 6-month policies, which allows us to earn rates faster than many competitors who issue a higher mix of annual policies. Let me start with the auto pricing group. Pricing\u2019s goal is to deliver best-in-class tools to enable product managers to make risk-based decisions and to provide an accurate view of rate adequacy for our auto business. Think of this as the science behind the ratemaking. Given our beginnings as a non-standard writer and evolution to become a leader in segmentation and product innovation, we have honed our pricing sophistication for nearly 85 years. We continue to invest in attracting and retaining high-quality talent, building systems and processes to make sure we can accurately price a very complex product in a high-quality manner and advancing the science of pricing to improve our assessments of rate adequacy. The pricing indication is the key tool we use to determine our indicated rate need. It helps product managers answer the question how much do I need to raise or lower rates in my next rate revision to achieve the target combined ratio or better on an accident year basis. The indication is based upon two primary loss ratio calculations. The numerator is the projected loss ratio. This is our best estimate of the loss ratio we expect for policies that we will write in the upcoming rate revision at our current rate level. The denominator is the target loss ratio. This is the loss ratio we need to achieve to have enough premium left over to cover our prospective non-loss costs and profit load. The difference between these two ratios is the indicated rate need for the next revision. Let me provide more detail on how we determine the target loss ratio. Our goal is to price policies in a way that we will collect enough premium to cover our expected loss costs, loss adjustment expense, operating and acquisition costs, and have enough left over to hit our 4% profit margin. The chart on the slide depicts the various components to determine this loss ratio. And in this example, as you can see, our target loss ratio is 66%. It\u2019s very important to note that changes in our non-indemnity cost structure can result in changes in our target loss ratio and thus having a low cost structure is very important. All else equal, if expenses are lower, our target loss ratio will be higher and we can charge customers less for the same protection. The other key input into our indication is the projected loss ratio. This is our best estimate of the loss ratio we would expect for policies we are going to write in an upcoming rate revision at our current rate level. As I said earlier, we do not know what our loss cost will be when we write policies. And given our 4% profit target, we need to be very accurate in our projection. So, how do we get there? This requires us to adjust our historical accident year losses and premiums to reflect our best estimates of the future. Let me talk a little bit about the adjustments we make to our losses first. The first consideration is loss development, which is the process of estimating the ultimate frequency and severity of our claims. Since rate-making is prospective, we need to know how much will recent claims change from what we know about them today. We also need to know how many more claims will be reported from this time period and how much they will cost and change over time. To develop our historical frequency and severity, we analyzed historical development patterns using a variety of methodologies to help us achieve accurate estimates. Second, we also need to adjust for weather, which can be highly volatile over time. Our goal here is to price to a longer term average to make sure that we are not over or under-reacting to recent weather events. Once losses are fully developed, both frequency and severity are trended to the midpoint of the rate revision period. The midpoint represents the average cost of goods sold of losses during the revision. There are many factors that can impact our loss trends from macroeconomic variables such as inflation and gas prices to improve safety technology, to law changes and even our mix of business. We monitor these to understand where frequency and severity maybe headed and we update our trends on a monthly basis. On the premium side, we make two important adjustments. First, we adjust historical premium levels and bring them to current rate level to reflect our most recent pricing. Second, premiums also have trends, which are largely a function of changes in our mix of business. We need to account for the fact that our premiums can change due to the segments we write. We do not want to change rates simply because our mix of business changes over time. Our indications contain many inputs to help us project the future. And as a result, there is pricing risk. Let me share a few examples of the strategies we employ to manage this. First, when possible, we would like to rely on the most recent accident periods, which allow us to be responsive to our most recent experience and limits the trending period. Here, our data scale is a big asset as it affords us increased precision and prevents us from reacting to noise. The second is our high frequency of rate revision. This allows us to price to a shorter rate revision length and to be more responsive to changes in our indications. You have probably heard us say that we take smaller and more frequent bites at the apple. As a result, it is common for product managers to complete multiple revisions in a year. This is true in general, but not always as we are currently taking much larger bites in the current rapidly escalating loss cost environment to ensure rate adequacy. The third is our high mix of 6-month policies. As I mentioned earlier, once a rate revision goes live, it takes time to earn into the book, because we need to wait for policies to renew into the new rate level. As you would expect, 6-month policies earn in roughly twice as fast as annual policies. Our high mix of 6-month policies dramatically increases the speed with which new rates earn into our results. As you can imagine, COVID was a massive shock to our business and has forced us to adapt our pricing indications in multiple ways. Today, I am going to use collision coverage as a quick case study to highlight the impact on our loss trends and to share our responses. This slide contains a time series view of our collision coverage frequency, severity and pure premium through the end of 2019. It represents a pre-COVID period. The solid line is monthly data. You will notice that this data can be bumpy, which is largely due to seasonality. The dotted lines represent the trailing 12-month average. As you can see, during this time, our trends are relatively stable. Pure premiums were increasing on average by slightly more than 3% per year, with frequency gradually decreasing and severity growing faster than the rate of inflation. During this time, we were tracking a variety of variables that could help inform where we thought trends might be headed in the future. One thing we did not expect was once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. On this slide, the data has been updated through April 2020 to reflect the onset of COVID. As you are aware, a massive decrease in driving significantly reduced our collision frequency. This also dramatically changed our data and challenged us to think of new ways to project trends. The key question we needed to answer was how quickly will frequency rebound? To help us answer this question, we leveraged a variety of data elements to inform future projections of frequency. This data came from a variety of sources. First, we closely monitor our claims frequency data to understand both monthly changes and comparisons to pre-COVID levels. Second, we leveraged our extensive snapshot data, which we know is highly correlated with frequency. This data provides a daily view of vehicle miles traveled and important segment level data on driving patterns such as time of day and day of week. Third, we utilized input from product managers who brought local knowledge about changes to driving in their respective states. By analyzing this data over time, we could start to quantify with what likelihood, by how much and when frequency might return to pre-COVID levels. This analysis is conducted at a state, channel and coverage level and we update it very frequently. This slide shows the same three graphs through the end of 2021. As you can see, our collision pure premiums have rapidly accelerated to well above historic levels. While frequency has rebounded, it is still below where it was prior to the pandemic. However, collision severity has dramatically increased driven by supply chain disruptions and the soaring prices of used cars. Like frequency, our response for severity has been to leverage new data sources like the Manheim Index to explain the causes of these increases and where they might be headed in the future. In collision, more than half of our lost dollars are from total losses as we pay to replace total vehicles damaged beyond net cash value. This plot is showing the average value of used cars from Manheim in orange and the estimate of actual cash value, or ACV, of the vehicles we write estimates on in blue. Not surprisingly, what we see is a very strong correlation between these two metrics with ACV lagging in Manheim by a few months. Given this, signals of upward movement in car values are a leading indicator of ACV estimates and severity. With this data, we are better able to evaluate scenarios of where severity maybe headed in the future, with the cones representing the fact that there is still a high level of uncertainty. Given there is a high level of uncertainty of where our trends and therefore, our rate need might be headed, I want to share with you how we ensure we are getting our latest views of rate adequacy to product managers in a timely manner. As I mentioned earlier, our goal is to frequently update our trend analysis and pricing indications so that product managers can quickly respond to changing market conditions. Our indications are updated quarterly for each state, channel and coverage combination, which generates thousands of pricing recommendations per year. As I mentioned earlier, we updated our loss trends and premium trends on a monthly basis. Given the rapidly changing trend environment due to COVID, we are now able to update the trend portion of our indications monthly, which provides product managers even more up-to-date data on changes to their rate indications. This allows product managers to adjust their plans as the needs of their business change. And now, I will hand the presentation over to Kanik who will provide an update on how product managers leverage our pricing science to deliver our operational goal of growing as fast as possible at or below a 96 combined ratio. Kanik Varma : Thanks, John. The goal of the product management organization is to deliver profitable growth at our target margin through adapting Progressive\u2019s products to win in our local markets. This organization comprises of highly talented individuals. They are results oriented and were attracted by profit and loss ownership. They want accountability and decision rights and we empower them to make decisions at the local level. Think of them as Chief Operating Officers of their own businesses. There are several aspects to our Product Manager\u2019s job at Progressive. Each product, state, channel is different and our Product Manager\u2019s design strategies to meet our goals within the individual businesses. Compliance is mandatory. Profit is our second priority. Growth at target margins comes next. Managing legislative, regulatory developments and relationships are key levers in order to respond to economic conditions and the competitive environment within their states. Today, I am going to focus on one aspect of their role, tactics to deliver our target margins. And this is especially relevant in the current environment. The first step in consistently hitting our target margins is to give our product managers very clear operational goals. You know it as our grow as fast as you can at a 96 objective. Just a reminder, that\u2019s a composite calendar year target number. Product Managers manage to their respective targets within their channel product or geography down to the line coverage level. Each business fulfills their role within the overall portfolio to meet this composite goal. Our product managers have multiple tools that help us operationalize this goal. We call it the product manager toolkit. Product managers actively monitor results with daily reporting on volume measures and monthly data across all other KPIs. The toolkit affords both diagnostics and informs actions to ensure we deliver segment level results that roll up to our aggregate objectives. At the macro aggregate level, operationalizing this objective is like riding a wave. It requires a very delicate balance, go do fast with rate and you will be ahead of the market in compromise growth. However, if you move too slowly and fall behind on rate, it\u2019s incredibly hard to catch back up and you will miss profitability targets. Product managers continuously adjust rate level to match changing conditions and the capability to be nimble is a source of competitive advantage for Progressive. Our product managers are not just trying to hit 96 at the macro level, but are making sure they are pricing each individual segment the same target margins. That\u2019s very important. We don\u2019t have a bias towards any specific customer segment. We want to drive growth across the spectrum, provided those risks of price accurately. This approach enables us to deliver on our broad acceptance or what we call take nearly all comers philosophy. Our heritage starting out writing less preferred customers required us to align our entire business around matching rate to risk. And as we have expanded our aperture over the past decades, this approach remains foundational to our strategy. We have to make sure we are continuously matching rate to risk. Our scale provides us credible data and to make data-driven decisions at the micro level, which is a competitive advantage versus many industry competitors. Product upgrades in each state allow us to add new rating wearables to our algorithms that feeds the virtuous cycle of risk selection. We have talked about this at length in the past. So today, I will just focus on how product managers manage profitability at the macro level. The aggregate rate level is determined for each state and channel. Each product manager decides how much rate to take and how often to take that rate for the state and channel they manage. This decision-making relies very heavily on the advanced analytics John talked about earlier. Product managers also incorporate multiple local inputs into their decisions. I\u2019d like to group these local inputs into three broad categories : state-specific loss trends; regulatory framework within the state; the mix of business we ensure in each state as that drives the earnings cadence. Let\u2019s walk through each one of these one-by-one. The first category of inputs is state-specific loss trends. Each state is unique and states have different loss trends at any given point of time. There are many reasons for this in the auto product. Coverages and limits offered are based on unique state laws. State laws change often and have a direct effect on loss costs going forward. Example of this would be injury limit increases, fee schedule changes and new case law. States have unique weather patterns that impact loss costs. For example, hill states differ from hurricane states and we use different weather loads in these states. Claims processes are different by state and we keep improving them to make sure we are paying accurately. Process changes like labor rate changes, litigation and fraud mitigation strategies can have an impact on loss costs and LAE. These are all different by state. And during the COVID pandemic, states had different lockdown and reopening laws. Product managers work closely with our cross-functional partners in their states. These partners provide valuable local market input and we incorporate those into our decisions. The second input that impacts decision-making at the state level is rate regulations. At a very basic level, there are two types of rate regulation mechanisms, file and use in prior approval. In file and use states, we could elevate rate changes literally the day after we file. Though approval for the revision in these states can come months and in some cases years after the rates are effective. Prior approval means a state DOI needs to approve their revision before its effective. This framework requires more time to get rates to the street. But even before approval and prior approval states, we typically go through a back and forth with regulators as they ask questions and we explain our data and answer that questions about what\u2019s changing with the specific revision. We call this the objection process. But don\u2019t be confused, these are questions raised to clarify and understand and not fix barriers to implementing our product changes. Over decades, we have built incredibly strong relationships with our regulators as both credible and transparent operators and we continue to work closely with regulators to ensure they are comfortable with what we are doing, why we are doing it and how, what we are doing ensures we deliver rates that are adequate, are not excessive, and are not unfairly discriminatory. When trends changes, usually with a first carrier to share the latest credible data with state regulators. So it\u2019s fairly normal for them to react to new information and ask questions and ask for support to confirm understanding. In practice though, there are 51 different enforcement mechanisms, no two are alike. Each has to be managed independently. We have built the institutional knowledge and dedicated resources to put together filings and additional support, to ensure we get the right price into every local market as quickly as possible. Each product manager has in-depth understanding of the state\u2019s regulatory mechanism. They are on top of the unique deviations which means we have to know how to calculate rate need on the state\u2019s template, how much rate can be approved under a certain mechanism, the flex bands and how often we can file in a year. They also manage the approval timelines, which can vary based on the type of filing within each state. While we price our policies to run consistently at or below a 96 accident year combined ratio prospectively, we also manage our results to a calendar year 96 combined ratio target. In order to do that, product managers need to plan for the time it takes for rate changes to earn into our financials. It\u2019s important to note that because we have a large book of in-force business rate changes don\u2019t affect all policies at the same time. All new policies going forward are written on the new rates, but existing policies don\u2019t see a rating until they come up for renewal. Our combined ratio is a function of losses and expenses divided by earned premium. To put things into perspective, this is a chart of how much time it takes for that earned premium to reflect the new rates on our Personal Auto policies. With a predominantly 6-month book of business, if we increase rates by 5% today, 5 months from now, our earned premium, which is the denominator for the combined ratio, would have increased approximately 3.5%. And by month 7, we will be close to that 5%. So the rate we took in the second half of 2021, around 6%, will have largely earned into the financials by midyear. Any rate we will take now will partially offset the first half and, more materially, the second half\u2019s combined ratio. For comparison, if a carrier had 75% of their policies as annuals, it will take even longer as only 65% of the premium would be at the right rate level 7 months after the change. This is a big reason we\u2019ve limited distribution of 12-month policies to primarily our Platinum agencies, while over 90% of our Personal Auto policies are 6-month policies. And at times like these, we benefit from a shorter lag period to realize rate changes in our book. Let\u2019s use one example to show you how one auto product manager made high-level decisions over the last couple of years. This is a real example from one medium-sized state. The gray line on the chart is monthly pure premium in that state, while the blue line is a trailing 12-month average pure premium. This takes out the weather-related seasonality in the state. In 2019, the state was running under a 96 combined ratio, and our loss cost trends were fairly stable in the state. With stable trends, the product manager was focused on growth strategies, which typically include lowering rates to convert more shoppers or increasing demand generation spend to generate more shoppers. As early COVID-related frequency drop came through our data, the product manager responded, first, by participating in our April relief efforts. That included $1 billion of premium credits during the immediate post-COVID period. That was followed by an aggregate rate level decrease a couple of months later. In early 2021, as this product manager was evaluating their aggregate rate level, based on the data available at the time, they expected trends to start returning to pre-COVID level at a fairly slow pace. The state\u2019s pure premium expectations at the time are shown in the orange line. At this point of time, our tools indicated no immediate rate action, nor did local conditions in the state weren\u2019t anything different. Our ability to review trends and rate level every month allow this product manager to very quickly spot a change in trend shortly after making their rate decision. This change in loss cost trend was supported by UBI data in the state, which you\u2019re driving returning at a faster pace than previously expected. There was enough credibility in the data for the product manager to react and the adjusted rate level upwards to reflect the change in frequency trend. As time went on, severity continued to rise at a faster pace than expected back in May, especially in collision comprehensive property damage coverages. Frequency also continued to see modest positive trend as driving behavior reverted back to normal. At this point, the product manager took another rate adjustment to ensure they would hit the accident year 96 and calendar year 96 combined ratio objectives. Since we\u2019re in the business of trying to predict the future, there is near certainty that we will be wrong. However, our business model is to minimize this error by shortening our future pricing time horizon to provide more frequent opportunities to adjust our future prices to market conditions. Our product managers have the advantage of getting updated indications and other diagnostics often and have the resources to act when needed. This allows us to react very quickly when conditions are changing and when the regulatory framework allows it. As Tricia shared, this approach of taking more frequent smaller bites of the apple continues to serve us well as our rates are more closely aligned with true underlying costs, which enables us to deliver more consistent underwriting profitability and more competitive rates that drive long-term growth. If a carrier either does not have the ability to review data often and/or does not have the flexibility to react quickly, you can fall behind on rate need. The margin of error grows the longer you have to wait to react. This is why we have invested heavily in the tools to evaluate trend quickly, and the systems to react as fast as possible. This chart also illustrates the challenge in states with longer approval times. Our product managers deploy different strategies to manage rate revision length risk in states where we aren\u2019t afforded the flexibility to change rates as often as necessary to accurately match rate to risk. Our product managers typically act earlier and more conservatively to ensure we have adequate rates while making sure they are not excessive. They also have a full toolkit of levers available to deploy, to protect the book and meet their target margins. We just talked about the science and the product manager toolkit. Now let\u2019s talk about how we deploy changes to the market. Having data and analytics to inform pricing decision-making is necessary, but not sufficient to effectively manage a book of business. You must also have decision makers and the deployment resources to file in a timely manner, get regulators comfortable with our actions and the IT infrastructure to get the updated pricing to market. In the example I shared, this particular product manager implemented 10 rate revisions in the state in the last 2 years alone, five each for direct and five for agency. These actions resulted in the state meeting its profit targets, both years in a very dynamic market and achieving 7.4% earned premium growth last year or over 25% earned premium growth over the 2-year period while continuing to keep us ahead of the industry on segmentation. The backbone of our deployment capabilities is our rate revision factory. We have the ability to act multiple times in a year in every state. Our resources dedicated for product upgrades are incremental to those for rate increases. Just to give you an idea. Last year, we deployed over four rate revisions per state in auto, and approximately 60% of our premium picked up the latest product model. It\u2019s also important to note, each tool in the product manager toolkit is supported with dedicated IT infrastructure. These are separate systems and resources that are incremental to our rate revision factory. That gives us added flexibility to deploy our tools as needed in individual states. We have long seen revision deployment and cadence as a potential source of competitive advantage, which is why several years ago, we invested in the factory to increase its throughput and improve its quality to ensure we can continue to lead in both pricing and segmentation. We believe this investment has provided us with best-in-class capabilities. And this is just a view of our auto product. Each business, commercial, recreational lines and property, have, incremental dedicated capabilities. Our ability to react early to changes in market conditions creates opportunities for us. The last time the market hardened, we followed our playbook and reacted fast and decisively. We believe faster response times help us compress the industry cyclicality during both hard and soft markets. That continues to drive our growth during times of change. This market cycle may be different in magnitude but requires a similar playbook. We reacted as soon as we saw trends turned in 2020 in addition to the $1 billion April relief effort. Trends changed direction in 2021, and we reacted immediately. We\u2019ve had a head start, and we will continue to react quickly as we see changes in the results in either direction. While we can\u2019t know if this cycle will play out exactly like cycles of the past, we do continue to have trust in our process and believe it will help us deliver the best possible results. Thank you. Doug Constantine : This concludes the previously recorded portion of today\u2019s event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including John Curtiss and Kanik Varma, who can answer questions about the rate level presentation. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question. Operator : Our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question \u2013 thanks for all the disclosure just on the rating side of things. Given where you guys are now, the rates that you mentioned, the 8 points that you guys took last year as well as just what seems like continued elevated severity, when do you think you will potentially be at your target margins within Personal Auto? If I remember from last \u2013 the call last quarter seemed to indicate perhaps it would take 6 months or longer. I just want to understand kind of where we are in the time frame of you guys thinking we will have enough rate to kind of get back to where you want your margins to be in auto, just in Personal Auto. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. And I think that\u2019s very dependent on each state. So we feel good where we\u2019re at now. So we took the 8 points last year, took another 3 points in Personal Auto in January. And we\u2019ve had some successes with some of the regulators. So let me give you an example. In Texas \u2013 I think that came up in the last call. We \u2013 they had some objections. We went back and forth with a lot of data, came to an agreement earlier this month, and both of those prior \u2013 those approvals are done and effective, I think, on the 24th. And then we\u2019ve put another rate increase in February. So we feel good about states like Texas where we\u2019ve had great conversations with our regulators, and we can get the rates on the street. And that allows us to open up local advertising, our bill plans that we might have restricted underwriting guidelines and \u2013 our underwriting restrictions, I should say. And so it\u2019s a mixed bag depending on each state. So we will continue to watch the trends. The trends in used cars and new cars still continue to actually outpace even pre-COVID levels. And of course, a lot depends on frequency. So we saw vehicle miles traveled down more in January. We think that might have been through Omicron. So they were down about 11% to 14% compared to our percentage of about 7% to 8% since May. Now that we\u2019re seeing more states open, we will watch frequency closely. So we\u2019re watching companies open. And what the new normal is of how people go back to work, I think, is yet to be determined. I know with Progressive, we are just figuring that out as well. There\u2019ll be a lot more people that work from home or work from home part of the time. So we\u2019re going to watch frequency once things stabilize a little bit more. So the real answer is we don\u2019t know for sure. But hopefully, John and Kanik let you understand that the propensity to have the majority of our auto policy 6 months allow us that flexibility to get the rate in more quickly. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my follow-up. Tricia, you did kind of touch upon in your answer. When I look at your results January versus December, typically, there is been some better seasonality in January, but this January saw almost 6 points of better underlying loss ratio relative to December, and severity remains high, as you guys noted. So did frequency drive a net benefit in your January numbers perhaps from Omicron? And then is there anything that you can say about February as Omicron has waned and just the impact perhaps in that month? Tricia Griffith : I think that\u2019s probably part of it. I think there is a lot of seasonality in January. So I wouldn\u2019t read into that too much because we still have a lot of that rate to earn in. What I would say, early results from February from vehicle miles traveled, they are going back to what we saw before January. So we could see frequency go up a little bit. Again, that\u2019s yet to be determined, and we will have those results in a few weeks. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey, good morning. Great presentation. First question, Tricia, to your comments about in the past, during times of industry disruption, you\u2019ve been able to \u2013 the company has been able to make great strides. Just curious, is \u2013 obviously, every cycle is different, as you all mentioned. Is the window of opportunity just very different this time given that it appears Progressive results have deteriorated much more so than peers, which maybe could be due to being overweighted non-standard drivers? Are you seeing kind of a bifurcation of results, non-standard versus standard, which might make other peers less likely to need as much rate? Tricia Griffith : Well, when we kind of strip away at the Q4 results from some of our competitor, we feel like we\u2019re in a pretty good company. It looks like almost everybody needs a similar rate than we do. So we\u2019re monitoring that. I mean as far as our book of non-standard, of course, that\u2019s \u2013 that was our humble beginnings, but we are \u2013 we continue to grow more on the preferred side. When you think about new business, our apps are down more on the Sams, which makes total sense because they are very sensitive to price. We define them as inconsistently insured. And of course, a lot of the PIF growth on the Sam side comes from the new apps because their PLEs are really short. So I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I would say I think everybody in these rates. The trends changed as you saw dramatically. And so I feel like we\u2019re in a really good position. We continue to work with regulators where we don\u2019t have the right rates on the Street yet to prove that out. And if we need to, we will slow growth for a bit until we get there. Mike Zaremski : Okay. Understood. Thank you. My follow-up is just trying to \u2013 maybe if you can try to unpack some of the severity statistics a little bit more. You focus on the Manheim in the deck it looks like. But just curious, we\u2019re also hearing about supply chain issues requiring cars to be taking longer to fix, higher rental car prices. Just curious, are you \u2013 are any of the other issues that have been impacting severity, are they getting better? Are they decelerating? Or is there still a lot of uncertainty? Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Mike, there continues to be a lot of uncertainty, but I think you hit the nail on the head. So we\u2019ve got the supply-demand issues with chips. So we have parts prices continue to increase. Because it\u2019s taking longer to repair those, our rental prices have gone up. We\u2019re watching labor rates in body shops closely and working with our MSOs to understand what we think about that. But when you think about severity, we look at it in a couple of different ways, but I\u2019ve been focusing on looking at it from this last quarter, quarter four of 2021 compared to \u201819. And let\u2019s take collision as an example, and we don\u2019t usually share at this level. But in the aggregate, we are up in severity about 11.9%. Collisions, up substantially more than that. And actually, frequency is down less than pre-COVID, and severity is up. So we\u2019re watching very specific line coverages to understand the trends and how they relate to the increases that we need specifically. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi, good morning. First, I just had a question on the sort of \u2013 if you could discuss what\u2019s going on in California. It\u2019s a small state for you guys, but I don\u2019t think the state has approved any pricing request yet. So what\u2019s the reason for that? And do you think that, that will change as you have more of the sort of weaker margins in your actual experience that gets built into their analysis? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean we continue to work with regulators in California. It can be a challenge, and we\u2019re up for the challenge. We \u2013 how they might look at rates versus we are looking at them prospectively, I think, is a little bit different. And so we\u2019re sharing data regarding what we\u2019re seeing and the trends we need. Here\u2019s the bottom line for any regulators. They should demand adequate rates. And we need to get adequate rates on the street in California in every jurisdiction for that matter. So we\u2019re going to continue to work with California. And there is a handful of other states where we continue to go back and forth. And our goal is to be open and available for all consumers. And if we\u2019re open and available, that helps with affordability in the long run. So in the meantime, we have some levers that we can use to slow down growth, whether it\u2019s local advertising or build plans, underwriting restrictions and some agents incentives, we will do that in the states where we need rate. We do need rate in California, but we will continue to work with the regulators there to prove our case. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then on the competitive environment, are you seeing competitors take similar price hikes? And \u2013 or are some of them not doing the same? And as a result, like as we\u2019ve seen your premium growth slow down a lot, bit growth slowed down a lot recently, but not sure if that\u2019s because other companies are not raising to the same extent or they have more 12-month policies where they can\u2019t implement the price hikes? Tricia Griffith : Yes. There is a lot of variables like that. Some you hit the nail on the head with 12 months, some are not increasing at the rate we are. We are usually first to market, and we talk about that a lot in order to get ahead of trends. We do see competitors definitely taking rates. And so we knew taking action aggressively early on when we saw the trends changed so dramatically. We knew that would affect our new business apps. We\u2019re seeing that, but we feel good about getting those rates on the Street. And as more and more companies see those rates, the competitive environment will improve. And hopefully, as people shop, they\u2019ll come to us and we will be in a good position to have stable rates. So it\u2019s really across the board. Some are taking a different approach because they have 12-month policies, some run their companies differently than we do. We have a very specific goal to make that $0.04 of underwriting profit. And so that is our primary goal and growth a second. So we will continue to watch. We believe that we feel like we\u2019re in a good position for the most part. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay, thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Our next question, Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about your comments on getting ahead of the trends and being first to market and then your comments of taking larger bites. Question really is, do you classify what you took any time in 2021, maybe 4Q, the 6.8 in those 19 states? Was that a larger bite or was that more of the smaller bites? And the reason I asked, Tricia, is curious if you think that 6.8 in those 19 states, was that enough to offset and provide some profit provision in that? Or is there more needed from even that 4Q number? Tricia Griffith : It\u2019s very dependent on each state. So there are some states where there is more needed. I gave you the example of Texas where we had two rate revisions and we put another one in play, a double-digit one in February. So I think it\u2019s very dependent on the jurisdiction. I would say when we define small bites, it\u2019s nice for consumers to have stable rates. So small bites to me, and I don\u2019t think there is any great definition, is 1% here, 1% there. So I never like to take 6.8% or ever double-digit percentage because we see then that, one, it affects our new business and could ultimately affect our renewal business as people get increases. So that, to me, is a larger bite. But again, we saw these dramatic trends, and we needed to get out in front of it. Michael Phillips : Okay, thanks. Kind of a related question, I guess. But some of their comments here where we\u2019re starting to feel good about where we are today, going to wait for that to earn in. What do you think that means for how we should expect to see the marketing spend this year relative to last year? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So we will plan to spend as much as we can on marketing as long as we feel like rates are \u2013 the rates we have out there are appropriate as well as the fact that our acquisition costs go within our target \u2013 we want to have our targeted acquisition cost. So what the levers that we will use in places where we don\u2019t think we have the rate just yet will be to turn off or slow down local advertising. We have some great plans around marketing. Again, we will \u2013 that will be dependent on each jurisdiction and where we feel we are as far as rate adequacy. Michael Phillips : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open. Greg Peters : Good morning. I guess the first question, I\u2019ll go to the projected loss ratio slides. I think that\u2019s like Slide 21 \u2013 20, 21. Well, you know the slides. You put them together. There is two pieces in there. There is the new business piece and the renewal piece. And I\u2019m just curious about your perspective on new business. Traditionally, there is been a new business penalty. And I\u2019m curious what your views are on new business penalty in this environment. And I\u2019m wondering if it differs between, say, the agency segment and the direct segment, etcetera. Tricia Griffith : Yes. Well, I think of the new business penalty, for me, more on the direct side in terms of front-loading our acquisition costs in the first 6 months of the policy. As far as the projected loss ratio, I mean, I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m hoping to answer your question. I mean I think that our new business, obviously, is negative right now in, I think, every single segment. We saw it initially in the agency business. I think they are very susceptible to any price increases based on the fact that they have a lot of opportunity to put business with their customers with others. I\u2019m not sure if I answered your question or if you want to add anything. John Sauerland : I can add a little bit there. So there is really two objectives in pricing the business. One is the lifetime profitability of a customer and the other is hitting our calendar year targets, and we\u2019re trying to achieve both, and sometimes there is a balance there to be had. As Tricia was noting in the direct business, new business runs a lot hotter than renewals. So because of that advertising expense that we incur completely upfront, less so in the agency channel, but we also see differing new versus renewal loss ratio differences across segments of customers. So there is a bigger new business penalty when you\u2019re in the non-standard end of the spectrum relative to the preferred end of the spectrum. So we\u2019re trying to balance the lifetime profitability of those customers as well as the calendar year profitability of the entire business when we\u2019re making those decisions. As we were noting earlier, there are certainly markets right now where the underlying base rate level, if you will, is not adequate. And so those cases, we are restricting as much as we can because we\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019re not going to hit our target margin on a lifetime basis for that business. There are other markets where we\u2019re closer, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re playing the underwriting, the advertising levers to manage that again to the calendar year, but also to the lifetime targets. Greg Peters : Thank you. That was actually an excellent color on my question, which was kind of vague. Thank you. The second and follow-up question and I\u2019m going to go off script here, if you\u2019ll allow me, because I\u2019d like to pivot to the commercial lines business for a second. And we get so few opportunities to talk with you. And the Commercial Lines business continues to, one, grow rapidly; two, produce results that are well in excess of your targets. Can you give us an update on what\u2019s going on there? What areas of the market you\u2019re having success in? And just give us a state of the union on the Commercial Lines business, please? Tricia Griffith : Yes. Absolutely. We feel incredibly proud of our results, both on the growth and profit over the last couple of years. One of the biggest areas in Commercial Lines where we\u2019ve been able to grow is in our for-hire transportation segment, which makes a lot of sense. During COVID, goods need to be transferred across the country. Many of us stopped shopping and ordered. And so we really we\u2019re in a great position to improve and increase our market share in that specific segment. We\u2019ve been writing that for a lot of years. So the good news is we knew the underlying cost structure. We were conservative in our take rate. So we feel really good about that. Obviously, there is a couple of other things. We continue to grow in our TNC business. We added Protective as another part of our fleet. And across the board, we feel pretty good about growth \u2013 really good about growth in all of our BMTs. So just a really great part of the story where we saw an opportunity, we had the background and experience to write a lot more of that, and we took advantage of it. John Sauerland : I get excited talking about Commercial Lines, so I\u2019ll tack on here. We\u2019ve got a number of other things going on there, I think, are not as appreciated in the market as perhaps they should be. So usage-based rating in Commercial is going really well. It\u2019s really predictive. Obviously, those trucks are driving a lot of miles. So the differential across those who are good drivers and those who are less good is pretty significant, and we\u2019re pricing to that. We also have that information for a large group of customers at new business because truckers now have electronic logging devices that have that information, and we can input that into the new business rate. Relative to the Personal side where predominantly, we\u2019re still using the information we gather at renewal versus new business. So Smart Haul is going really, really well. We also have a program we call Snapshot ProView that is also working well for smaller fleets. The other piece of Commercial that I think is pretty exciting is the direct channel. So we\u2019ve all been sort of wondering when Commercial customers will sort of follow the Personal side and start shopping a bit more in the direct channel. COVID certainly, I think helped accelerate that and we are seeing great growth in our direct channel and commercial lines. I could go on into the BOP program as well. So, I think you are right to say, hey, it\u2019s a very exciting segment of the business right now, the core, what we call business market targets, the trucks, etcetera, are doing really well, and we have got a lot of long-term runway to play in commercial lines beyond that. Tricia Griffith : Yes. Our BOP program is now in 34 states. We added 17 this year. So, obviously still small, but something, as I outlined, probably last year, a few years ago, our different horizons, we are excited about helping ensure those small businesses. So, that\u2019s something that we think there is a lot of runway. Greg Peters : Got it. Thank you for the answers. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is open. Josh Shanker : Yes. Thank you. Looking through the 10-K, I was surprised at how much ad spending you did during 2021. And that tells me there is probably more seasonality in there than I am understanding, I assume it was heavily first half weighted. So could you, a, talk about the normal seasonality of ad spending at the firm? Talk about how that differed in 2021. And then the third part is that means that most of the savings that you guys did on the expense ratio really came from the G&A expense. How much of that expense can you save into \u201822 and later? Tricia Griffith : Well, it\u2019s a multifaceted question. I would say, normally, we do spend a fair amount in the first half of any year, but we did dramatically reduce spend because of our profitability issues at the end of 2021. So, we wouldn\u2019t have normally reduced it by that much. We did that as a reactive position based on what we saw with trend. And so we spend depending on when we believe that people are open to shopping, and that can vary. So, we did spend more in January of this year. I don\u2019t know if Pat, do you want to add anything more to what we are feeling about from a media perspective. Pat Callahan : No, I think your response on the seasonality of ad spend is absolutely right. We spend when that will be efficient, media spend, and frankly, when we think we are priced adequately for the new business coming in. So, once \u2013 as Kanik and John laid out, severity started to take off with frequency in the second half of last year. We had some rational pullback there just simply because we weren\u2019t comfortable with our rate level. Now, when we come into this year, as Tricia mentioned, we typically will spend more in Q1 ahead of what\u2019s typical shopping season. And that\u2019s what we saw in January, but it is more state-specific where we are open for business and turning on some media spend. Now, on a year-over-year basis, we had our best quarter ever in Q1 of 2021. So, from a spend and an efficiency perspective, we have got some tough comps coming ahead of us at this point in time. But really, our full year spend is 12 individual months of spend, highly controllable, on and off as we are comfortable with the efficiency of the spend and frankly, the adequacy of the underlying business we bring in for that spend. Josh Shanker : Thank you. And the permits of the G&A expense production in 2021? John Sauerland : So, we think of our non-acquisition spend as what we call our non-acquisition expense ratio, which generally you can think of as G&A expenses, the long-term trend there has been really good. So, we have taken out over the past, I don\u2019t know, probably decade maybe four points in our non-acquisition expense ratio. Obviously, that allows us to be really competitive. And our goal is to continue to reduce that number. So, we obviously have scale at our advantage. We obviously are investing heavily in technology to continue to get consumers to self-service and be happy doing so. So, a lot of efforts around continuing to be competitive in our cost structure outside of acquisition, we would \u2013 if we are priced adequately, we would love to spend more on advertising. Obviously, we are going to have competitive commission for our agents to place as much business as they can with us. But the underlying G&A or non-acquisition expense ratio is where we focus on continuing to get more competitive. Josh Shanker : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you, Josh. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Paul Newsome : Good morning and thanks for the call. Covered a lot of ground, obviously, and very helpful. But I wanted to ask on the home business, how impactful could it be that on the auto business that you are trying to improve the profitability of the home business at the same time? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean I think we like to bundle, but we also want to make sure that we are positioned well for the long-term growth in the property channel. And we have continued to increase our Robinsons. We are proud of that. We want to do that \u2013 we just want to do it in \u2013 spread across more non-volatile weather states, so that we can make our target margin on those bundled customers. So, will we lose some customers from some of the de-risking decisions we are making in Florida on the auto side, likely, that might happen. We will wait to see how that happens. And of course, that also depends on what\u2019s happening in the environment. So, when people shop, are they getting the same or better rate if they go to another competitor. So a lot of that, specifically in Florida, will be dependent on what the competitors do as well. So, I think people that want to bundle, you may take both your auto and home with you. We will work on trying to keep as much of the auto book of the property that we lose. But that\u2019s yet to be known as we continue our plan to de-risk. John Sauerland : And in the direct channel, we do have the luxury of having multiple other companies that we work with, the place property business, and we will proactively work with those companies to try and place business that we no longer want to be writing on our own paper. And obviously, in the independent agency channel, most agencies have multiple options. So, I mean you are right. As Tricia noted, we will likely lose some auto business as we reduce the risk in our homeowners book, but we also expect to keep a lot of those auto customers because of the options that we have in the direct channel as well as that \u2013 which our agents have. Tricia Griffith : Yes. And I should do a shout-out because we have really invested a lot over the years in HomeQuote Explorer, where you can \u2013 we can go online, and now we have 34 states where you can have an online buy, which makes it just easier for consumers as well if they are shopping. So, they may have auto with Progressive, and the home could be with Progressive property, but then they could switch over to another one of our unaffiliated partners. So, John is right on point. Paul Newsome : And then I wanted to read the commercial auto business, but in the context of \u2013 you gave us some wonderful detail and information about private passenger auto and the frequency and severity trends that you have seen. But my sense is that, that result has been quite different in commercial auto. And I was wondering if you might touch upon those differences and why that might be? Tricia Griffith : Yes. The severity on commercial is up. When you look at the trailing 12 over the prior 12, up right around just under 14%, and frequency has come back to pre-COVID levels for the most part. We see a lot with our \u2013 as John said, we have our telematics on the commercial auto side. We see that speeding for some of our truckers are up about 10% to 20%. And we see that sort of correlated when there is more congestion out versus less congestion. So yes, those are higher limit policies. Obviously, we have talked in the past about social inflation around more attorney rep claims. So, we are seeing an increase in those trends in the commercial lines product as well. Paul Newsome : Okay. Thank you very much. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Our next call is from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. First question, going back to the ad spend. In direct, I think we saw over three points of sequential increase in the expense ratio in January. How much of that is from the marketing and advertising seasonality versus other seasonality and maybe just other? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I would say a portion of it, I said \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t take one month, like you said, for much. I think expenses are usually up in January regardless, and a portion of it was media, but not a huge amount. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then in the 10-K, bodily injury severity has been elevated all through 2021. Why would we see the year-over-year increases in \u201821 when I think we already saw the impact from greater speeding and kind of more material accident velocity, if you will, in 2020. So, what\u2019s driving the increase in \u201821? And how much visibility do you have into the bodily injury severity going forward? Tricia Griffith : Yes. A lot of it in \u2013 at least in Q4 would be around attorney rep rate, and so a lot of the medical inflation. We also, as we have been hiring on new claims reps, that \u2013 the propensity to how the handling is done and the accuracy can be a little bit different as those claims reps get trained. And so that was probably a part of it as well. So, that\u2019s what we are seeing in quarter four. But a lot of the inflation is around attorney rep rate. And it will be interesting to see as more and more treatment facilities open up if that changes as well. So, we will watch that closely. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Your line is open. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Good morning. On insurance, I really like your rate-making presentation, super helpful. So, I have a quick numbers question, and then my follow-up is more conceptual on the numbers in your 10-K. You mentioned it\u2019s better to assess 2021 loss trend versus 2019 and year-over-year. So, if I just zero in on your reported severity auto physical damage, what is driving the more muted 8% for \u201821 versus \u201819, then the 9% in 2020 versus 2019? I guess I would assume supply chain disruptions would take a larger toll in 2021 on auto physical damage. Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think just used car parts similar to collision, but you might see it a little bit of a delay. But used car prices, parts prices, rental car increases, all those things are coming into play as well. We just think that it\u2019s good to look at, especially \u2013 I even think not even just year-over-year when we compare to \u201819. We obviously have that data. But there is so much changing right now that I am really looking at quarter-over-quarter comparison. So, that\u2019s where we are at on physical damage. We believe we will see similar trends continue to emerge from \u2013 similar the collision. Tracy Benguigui : So, there is a delay in recognizing that? Is that what you are saying? Tricia Griffith : Well, yes, there is a little bit of a delay in recognizing that. I think on \u2013 I think we see that from our competitors as well. We see that in our subrogation files of getting some of the data in from other companies in inbound sub, so a little bit of a delay, yes. John Sauerland : So, just a little clarity on what we are saying there. So, when we have a first-party total loss collision, we are going to pay that immediately. We are going to recognize the elevated cost of new and used cars right now when we are settling that claim. When we have a property damage claim, some of those claims we pay directly, and we would recognize that expense. Some of those claims \u2013 the parties are going through their personal auto carrier, and then that auto carrier reaches out to us and subrogates us, meaning they ask for the payment, and that is when we will see some of the increase in the total loss rate. We try and project that, obviously, in our reserves to be as accurate as possible in a world where it is moving as quick as it is right now, we don\u2019t always have that perfect. So, as we see more of those demands for total loss settlements from other insurance carriers, we are going to \u2013 we expect to see some similar experience in the property damage. Tricia Griffith : I had mentioned that overall severity was up comparing \u201819 quarter four to \u201820 \u2013 to \u201821 quarter four at about 11.9 property damages. I said collision was up significantly from severity. Property damage is up as well, not as significant as collision, but it is higher than the 11.9. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Thank you so much. And I guess my next question is more conceptual. So, is my understanding that more Midwest states are on-board with the rate increases, and it just feels like the catastrophe prone states are driving their feet more. So, I am thinking that might be a function of regulators being sensitive to higher homeowner rates. So, they are trying to cap the auto rate increases to put a lid on the overall insurance premiums for its constituents. I am also seeing in regulatory filings, some states do not think miles driven is going to snap back to pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a secular shift in a hybrid work environment. So basically, this is my long way \u2013 long and good way of asking you the psychology of rate increases by state and how that may impact your ability to achieve your indicated rate need? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean I think that we are all watching vehicle miles traveled and frequency closely. And it\u2019s not back to pre-COVID amounts. That said, severity is so far outpacing that from all the things we talked about. Whether it\u2019s medical inflation, car price, rental cars, et cetera, that we need rate and I have said this in the last call. And so there is \u2013 each individual like John and Kanik said, there is 51 jurisdictions we work with to try to make sure that our rates are adequate and not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory. I do believe that regulators care a lot about their constituents. And so they want to be very careful as they increase the cost because there is other inflationary things that are happening in each household. So I can\u2019t get into the psychology of it because we are just such a data-driven company that \u2013 that\u2019s what we look at. And so we will continue to do so. And our hope is that we get a handful of states where we still need rate. We get that in short order. So, we can be open and available and affordable for every constituent in the entire United States. Tracy Benguigui : Would it be fair to say you have to almost change the playbook by state just considering each nuanced concern? Tricia Griffith : Absolutely. Yes. That\u2019s the fun part of working in a regulated industry because there is a lot of different personalities of each state. And we \u2013 and that product management relationship that we talked about is so integral to that success. And so we actually think that\u2019s a great advantage. And yes, each state is very different. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hi. Good morning. Susan, you spoke a bit about some of the states where you are feeling good about in terms of what rates you have right now on the Street. Could you give us a sense for how much of the book right now is priced to where you think you can start turning on more ad spend and other growth levers? And also, any thoughts on timing of rolling out more ad spend across the rest of your brokers? Tricia Griffith : Great question, difficult to answer. Like we said, we look at each state, and we were able to turn on local advertising \u2013 turn on and off local advertising pretty quickly. So, I mean as soon as we believe we have the rates right and that we can turn on media to get more new business at our allowable cost, we will do so. But it\u2019s really dependent on each state. We want to do that. We want to open up each lever to do that, but it really is dependent on getting not just in the states that we just talked about, but in every state to make sure we continue to stay ahead of trend. David Motemaden : Got it. Thanks. And then I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the drivers of the deterioration in personal auto PIF growth in January. It took a step down, was kind of around like 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and then it took a step down to 4% year-over-year in January. And I am specifically talking about personal auto. I am just wondering, is that still \u2013 is that just still mainly new business that is driving that deterioration, or are we starting to see some of the renewal book start to get impacted by some of the rate increases, because I did see that the PLEs are still up, but that was obviously for 2021, and I am specifically wondering about January. Tricia Griffith : Yes. We still are seeing new business shrink, and that makes sense with our pricing. And from the renewal perspective, I think we talked about in the K that trailing three was dropping a little bit. And so it\u2019s reasonable to believe that trailing 12 could drop as well. But again, that\u2019s all dependent on what our competitors do as well. When we look at elasticity, it\u2019s not just what\u2019s happening here. It\u2019s what the competitors are doing. And we look at our renewal rates in sort of tranches of if we take plus 5%, 5% to 10%, etcetera, to see what happens. And we are seeing some \u2013 we believe some improvements from slowing down in some of the tranches where our competitors are taking rate. And that could mean we \u2013 there is a lot of variables here, that could mean that they are taking rates as well. So, when our customers get an increase in their renewal rate and they shop, they might stay because they can\u2019t get a better rate. Again, we are not seeing that play through yet in the trailing 12. The trailing three can be an indicator. And that\u2019s why we want to get out ahead of this to sort of get the rates stable as quickly as possible in 2022, so we can all focus on doing our job as an industry and be really competitive, drive down those costs so people have affordable ways to buy insurance. David Motemaden : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. I thought I would ask a high-level one. I mean Slide 26 and 28 seem to pretty clearly show there is a significant range of outcomes here. And that would logically sort of make it harder to lean into your confidence on the lifetime value of customers and hitting the growth pedal. As I think through that dynamic, what would you need to see in terms of the range of outcomes and getting a little more certainty around at least how wide the range of outcomes is to be able to have confidence in that? I would think even at a adequate level of pricing for your base case, thinking through lifetime value still could be challenging with a wider range of outcomes. Can you just talk high level about how you think through that and when we could expect to have enough clarity to kind of lean in harder on growth? Tricia Griffith : It\u2019s so hard to say because there are so many moving parts constantly. So, where we would think, okay, we come into February, the weather is going to be nicer, places are opening up, but then you have the invasion of Ukraine. So, what happens with fuel prices, although that\u2019s usually a small part of our frequency trend. We \u2013 I would say, if you have a couple of quarters of some stability in seeing what\u2019s happening as an example, to see if used car prices and the chip shortage starts to ease up, we would start to follow that and feel better about that. But we \u2013 our math, we believe, is accurate of what we need now, and that\u2019s really what we focus on in order to make sure that we ultimately have that lifetime value of that profitable growth of the 96. Alex Scott : Understood. And then I just wanted to make sure I am interpreting Slide 28 right. I know these cones are probably just rough guides. But in your base case, are you sort of inherently assuming here that the used car prices will go up, and that will have an incrementally worse impact on severity? Is that what\u2019s being embedded in sort of your base case right now? Tricia Griffith : Not necessarily. In fact, we have seen a small amount of data that says they are leveling off and maybe even decreasing a little bit. Again, that\u2019s very early data. And there is a lot of economists that can \u2013 could talk either up or down. But no, that wouldn\u2019t be an assumption. Alex Scott : Okay. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open. Gary Ransom : Yes. Good morning. A few years back, you talked about a feature in your product that increased the rates automatically month-to-month. Is that a product that is still in use today? And if so, is the impact of that included in the 8% that you gave us for the full year rate increase? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I will start, and then, Pat, you can weigh in. We do have monthly rating factors, and they are baked into the rates you are seeing. Do you want to add anything else? Pat Callahan : Sure. We don\u2019t have them in all jurisdictions. So, we would love to, but regulators don\u2019t approve it everywhere. So, I think we have it in roughly half of the country. And as you can expect, we don\u2019t tweak those trend factors as probably as sensitively or quickly as we might. So right now, I think it\u2019s at below what we are seeing with current net future trend. Now it helps because we are picking up every month additional rate without a filing in roughly half of our states, but it\u2019s not set to what we are seeing in this sort of super steep current trend environment, but it is helping. So yes, still on the products, still available, and our product managers are using it. John Sauerland : Well, I would add to Tricia\u2019s comment that December\u2019s take rate for Snapshot were the highest we\u2019ve seen ever. So yes, there were some influence from the pandemic on take rate there. But I think overall, there has been a growing acceptability in usage-based as a rating variable for auto insurance. And I think our December take rate in both channels, as Tricia mentioned, are indicative of that. So, we also obviously see competitors continuing to grow there, their UBI programs as well, which I think in aggregate enhances acceptability perceptions as well. So, we think that is definitely part of our future and even more so as the technology and vehicles allows us to get that new business. I was mentioning our ability to do that in the commercial space. And we have very limited ability to do that in the personal auto space, but we are doing it with data right from vehicles, but it\u2019s a small percentage of what we do. So, I think I would characterize take rate as continuing to grow. And with technology evolving, it\u2019s going to be an integral part of the product going forward. Tricia Griffith : And it\u2019s a great way for our customers that they do see increases and they believe they are driving less to be able to get some discounts. Gary Ransom : Right. Can I clarify the 10% and 40% numbers that you gave, that\u2019s 10% of new business apps in agency were Snapshot and 40% in direct were Snapshot, is that what you meant? Tricia Griffith : Correct. Gary Ransom : Correct. Okay. Thank you very much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Gary. Operator : Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Thanks. Two, hopefully, really quick questions. First, there was a fair amount of exit today on the six-month policies as being away from pointing changes faster and earning them faster. The proportion of 12-month policies have been going up at least in agency. And I was wondering whether we should expect an effort to maybe convince some of those drivers to move to six-month policies. Tricia Griffith : Yes. It\u2019s still a small percentage. It\u2019s less than 10% of our overall auto book. It\u2019s in the agency channel. Basically, we gave it to our 4,100 Platinum agents because many people, when they do want to bundle want to have the dates align. So, we will continue to watch that percentage, but it is something that, as we rolled out for our preferred customers for our Robinsons, it was something that our agents asked for in order to write more of that business. Meyer Shields : Okay. And then if I can go back to the cones on Slide 28. Obviously, I guess you have to select a point within there. Does the position of the point within the cone depend on the volatility of the input? John Sauerland : I can try that. This is simply an illustrative way to say we are not totally sure where the value of used cars is going. It\u2019s obviously been going up dramatically. As Tricia noted, we have seen some recent signs that it might be leveling off. We are certainly not pricing in our indications to anywhere towards the top of that cone. I would characterize our pricing assumptions more so towards the middle of the cone. But the reality is we \u2013 only time will tell where we ultimately fall in those cones. And that\u2019s the challenge of our business, and that\u2019s the point we are trying to get across in John and Kanik\u2019s presentation. And when we are trying to price for the future. The future is unknown, but we are not pricing towards the top of that. I would characterize our pricing assumptions as \u2013 towards the middle of that cone. Tricia Griffith : Yes. Meyer, our hope is, obviously, like John said, it was illustrative. But our hope is that as we have more data and as things stabilize, that cone narrows as well. Meyer Shields : Okay. Thank you. Doug Constantine : We have exhausted our scheduled time. And so that concludes our event. Janet, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter investor event.

The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted on the company's website, although our CEO Tricia Griffith will make a brief statement. The company will then use the remainder of the events to respond to questions. Action is moderation for the event will be Progressive Director of Investor Relations Doug Constantine. At this time, I will turn the event over to Mr. Constantine. Doug Constantine : Thank you, Emily, and good morning. Although our Quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60-minute schedule for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions maybe be found at investors. Progressive. com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements.  These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first quarter of 2022, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements, and other discussions of the challenges we face. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia? Tricia Griffith : Well, thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Anniversaries are natural time to look back on the past, and since this is the first investor call of Progressive's 85th year, I wanted to do just that. We have grown from a scrappy startup trying to find a foothold in the great depression to the tenth largest homeowners carrier, the third largest personal auto carrier, and the Number 1 commercial auto carrier. In just the last five years, our total company-wide written premium has nearly doubled.  Nowhere has growth been more remarkable than in Commercial Lines, which just passed the major milestone of over $9 billion in written premiums on a trailing 12-month basis. We grew commercial auto premiums over 200% in the last five years all while generally achieving a better than average industry profit margin and ended March just shy of $1 million, Commercial Line's policies enforced. It has truly been an incredible run with significant opportunities still waiting to be captured.  Congratulations to the Commercial Lines team, and thank you to all Progressive's employees and customers who have made the last 85 years so extraordinary. Throughout our 85-year history, we've have worked through many hard and soft markets, and we continue to address the hard market we're in today. While some indices suggest the value of used vehicle does leveling or even beginning to decline, used vehicle values are still significantly above those of early 2021. Steady but increasing trend in bodily injury severity has also contributed to the increase in loss cost we've experienced.  Further as a country emerge from the Omicron wave. We saw Personal Auto vehicle miles traveled recover to fourth-quarter 2021 levels, which were in the 9% to 10% range below the pre -pandemic baseline. Our response to these trends have been to reduce marketing expenses, increase underwriting scrutiny, limits bill plan options. And in the first quarter, we implemented rate increases of 7 points in Personal Auto that still in to earn in, which is an addition to the eight points we expecting 2021.  While we're making progress, we still have more work to do to ensure all of our states reach rate adequacy. Our rate and non-rate actions have had the expected effect on Personal Auto growth. While Personal Lines PPIF growth is still positive on a year-over-year basis, sequential PPIF growth is negative. New applications are down year-over-year, and a policy life expectancy is also declining. When we look across all the metrics we track, it seems likely that we're ahead of our competitors and increasing rates, which explains a large part of our slowdown in growth.  As we look forward to the rest of 2022 we're optimistic. As more states reach rate adequacy, we expect to be able to increase marketing spend and re-engage the growth engine. Because of the advantages we believe we have and the way we buy media, we can adjust marketing spend at the local and segment level and in such a way to ensure the new business we write meets our economic goals. And since we believe we are ahead of the competitors in taking right actions, we hope to continue our long-term trend of writing more than our fair share of clubs.  Even as we face these macroeconomic pressures, we have not slowed our pursuit of segmentation superiority. Our U.S. Personal Auto product model is now available in over eight -- in over half the states and is showing early promising results, especially among more preferred segments. We have also further expanded the footprint of our 4.1 homeowners\u2019 product into four additional states in the first quarter bringing the total to 12. Our new normal since the onset of the pandemic has been disruptions in the economy that has buffeted our business. While there are many paths, the future can take, I'm confident in our strategy and our people and believe our greatest successes are still to come in the next 85 years. Thank you. I will take your questions. Operator : To be added to the questions [Operator Instructions] In order to get to as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up The last question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Jimmy, your line is open. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi, good morning. So I had a question first, just on the pricing environment and what your expectations are in terms of getting price hikes through all of the states because I think some of the states like California, obviously, been robust into raised price -- to give permission to raise prices. Are you seeing any changes in that at all, or do you expect changes over the next few months? Tricia Griffith : We still have some challenges in a few states, including the one you mentioned, and we're working closely with regulators to get the rates that we need. Our desire is to be able to be more open, to open up our bill plan options, to open up or to loosen our underwriting restrictions. And once we get that rate, we can start to have that growth engine move. So we've got a couple of states that we're still working with -- a couple of big states that we've had some success in and why we feel pretty optimistic about the future. Jimmy Bhullar : And the reluctance of California and some of the states that have been difficult as it is because of the strong results companies had in 2020 and early '21, or is there something else behind? Tricia Griffith : Specifically, in California, it's a little bit how they look back versus perspective. And so I think the data is showing that these are real trends -- inflationary trends, and the need across the industry is very significant, and we want to be open for Californians, and we'll work closely with the regulators. So let's make that happen. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then just on the claims trends in January and February, do you think your business saw benefit from the Omicron wave at all in the early parts of the first quarter? Tricia Griffith : I don't know if there was a huge benefit. Things open up a little bit more, but still vehicle miles traveled and frequency is still both on pre -pandemic levels or do you want to add anything on that. During the early period we did see vehicle miles\u2019 travel drop a little relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, we've seen that since return in March. So a very modest benefit, if any at all. Jimmy Bhullar : And then just lastly, have you changed anything in terms of how you're investing in this environment, any major classes that you're reemphasizing or conversely, where you're seeing good value? Tricia Griffith : I'll talk a little bit about our investing guidelines and then John Bowers and assigned John, if you want to add anything, let me now. We've had a line standing approach to our investing and that is, we don't want to target a certain book yields or level of investment and income for that matter. We want to earn the best risk adjusted rate of that we're showing on our portfolio. And most importantly, John's team, their most important job is to protect the balance sheet. That way the operating company can grow as profitably and as fast as possible. John, do you want to add anything? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thanks, Tricia. I would only add to that. Obviously, the environment is pretty dynamic right now, and we continue to search out for good opportunities that would create long-term value for the portfolio, but always with a focus on Number 1, protecting the capital, and then getting the best total return that we can in the portfolio. Doug Constantine : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Andrew, please, go ahead. Andrew Kligerman : Okay. Thank you. Good morning. Regarding the underwriting restrictions that you mentioned, could you give a little color on what in particular you're doing there? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. Andrew, first of all, I enjoyed your write-up last week. Welcome to P&C Insurance. And -- Andrew Kligerman : Okay. Tricia Griffith : Yeah. And we have a couple of different underwriting restrictions. So we look at -- we'll look at gathering additional data, possibly, if we have more questions on a customer. So we call it pre -binding verification. So we may ask a little more specifics to make sure we have the [Indiscernible] adjust right and -- things like that. Do you want to add anything, Pat? Pat Callahan : I think that's exactly what we do, is when we want to be certain, we've got all the underwriting characteristics accurately reported, we will have some additional follow-up questions for customers, both at new business and then occasionally at renewal. Additionally, we will put restrictions on how open we are from a bill plan perspective and other things. Just as we look at overall profitability, we want to make sure we're getting the right rate for our new business customers at inception. Andrew Kligerman : And as a results of these initiatives, what percent of your book ends up with -- or has ended up with the rate change over the last quarter and maybe even the last 12 months as you've gone through these underwriting restrictions? Tricia Griffith : I think it's more of the entering in and getting the right rate at inception. So we've had a higher percentage of customers that once we have the additional information, we have blocked and they've likely gotten somewhere else because we don't have the accurate information. Andrew Kligerman : I see, I see. And any sense of proportion on that, Tricia? That you could give us, like, how much of your book you're seeing that on? Tricia Griffith : Probably, I would say of incoming close, probably double-digit low. Low double digits which is from half that when we were more comfortable with underwriting margin. So what we're trying to do here is ensure that every piece of new business coming in the door is going to be profitable for us. We understand that there is a distribution or on our pricing. So on the tail where we're less sure that we are going to make money, that is where we're going to ask a lot more questions and frequently those questions lead to the customer seeking insurance elsewhere. That has more frequently the outcome than an adjustment in the overall premium because frankly, some customers are looking to achieve a lower premium by not answering the questions accurately. So some of these efforts are focused on that segment. By pushing that segment to our competitors, obviously, we ensure that we're profitable. And to the extent our competitors do not employ such methods, it will affect our competitors adversely. Andrew Kligerman : Lastly, our Commercial Lines, you noted in the letter that it was a remarkable 63% growth since their optimism that you can continue to grow in the double-digits. And what would give you that optimism? Tricia Griffith : Well that process significant for a couple of different reasons. So we did grow a double-digits in all of our business marketing carriers, and still are growing significantly in FHT in us for-hire transportation based on still amount. So not good being moved across the countries since the pandemic. In addition to that, about half of that increase came from our transportation network renewals. So we had one of our partners, we went from 6 months to 12-month policies, so that obviously is significant. We increased our projected mileage which is how we compute our premium. So that was part of the increase.  We had rate increases to reflect the inflationary environment and forth, we see this last for us reinsure, so about half that increase wasn't CNCs. So all that said, even if on the commercial that the BMTs that we have now, the five on commercial, even if they slowed down a little bit, the great part about what we've been doing, and you wrote about this, over the last several years, is thinking about the future. So we just are getting going on our BOP, our Business Owners Policy, small business continues to grow. There we have 37 new states are being rolled out and three new states are actually this year.  We have our fleet program where we've expanded the number of power units that we write from 10 to 40. We have the acquisition of protectors from medium to larger fleet. How we think about really, business in all -- at least, Horizon 1 and 2 for now, and ultimately, we will do that and Horizon 3, is, how do we continue to have growth even if maybe one segment of that business may slow down or may fluctuate based on macroeconomic conditions? So I'm excited about all the opportunities in Commercial Lines because we've spent the last four or five years investing in the future. Andrew Kligerman : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I was hoping that you could quantify what percent of premium per state's represents where you think the majority of rate increases behind you. And then, associated with that question, what gives you guys the confidence to make that statement about rate versus forward loss trend given there is just so much uncertainty still with both frequency and severity? Tricia Griffith : I probably would dissect all these days, I would say, that we feel pretty positive that, one, we got ahead of competitors, which we think is important -- is a bit important in the past. And we're watching trends closely. I don't -- the crystal ball, I wish we had, would help us, but we'll watch those trends. We still are watching labor rates and some other indicators that could make us to take more rate. I think the beautiful part is we got out ahead of rate that -- our hope is that the rate we take, if we need to, in some states will be less -- will be the smaller bites of the apple that we like to take. We obviously couldn't do it in this environment because the trends were so dramatically increased. But we think there is a few states we're working on. We think that the majority of the rate actions are behind us, and what we're really thinking about now is when we can pull the trigger on some of that growth. And Pat, and John, and I sit down with the controller from Personal Lines very frequently to talk about return to profit and return to growth, in that order. And what we're looking at is literally state-by-state, channel-by-channel in the auto book and say, okay, if April results come out here, could we reduce underwriting restrictions? Could we open up a little bit of the local marketing? And I talked in my opening comments about how we have the ability to do so in each segment, in each market because of the way we buy media. So it's a complicated question, and there's 50 shades of this and actually a 100 because of the channels and that we're working closely to figure out when to do that. But we feel confident, and of course we had that 7 points to earn in, so more will come to the story, but we're watching things closely. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then my second question, as you've gone through this environment, have you guys noticed any change with your Snapshot and the take-up on your UBI products, and then has there been any change in discounts that you guys have offered are or the time period on -- that you guys are observing with your products? Tricia Griffith : We saw initially a pretty big increase in the take rate and the agency channel, which has been a challenge with us. So right now we sit at about 40% take rate on the direct channel, about 10% in the agency channel, and this of course is excluding California and North Carolina where we can't use telematics. So that blended amount is about 28% take rate. We continue -- we have surcharges and discounts and of course, participation discount, and we continued to learn from those and really try to make sure that ultimately we try to price to the whole curve. And that's so we will continue to do as our Snapshot evolves. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks for the color. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Phillips : I'm sorry. Can you talk about, I guess, earlier lessons learned from -- I guess it's been about a month end since you've gone continuous in one state, but takeaways from that, maybe what we can expect, if -- for that to be a national plan for you guys, one that could be the case. And then, just what does that mean for you? Well, if you do go national for that, what does it mean? Does it -- more accurate pricing and therefore, better loss ratios, better gross, just talk about what that means for you. Tricia Griffith : It's literally been in one state, Oklahoma, for 30 days. We'll have to answer that question of how it's going on -- maybe next quarter or the quarter after that. We'd like to continue it because -- especially as we've thought about the pandemic, it more responsive in changed to driving behavior, and we think we can -- we know the costs have gone down overtime on both mobile and then [Indiscernible], and so we thought it was a good time. And we have high hopes that Oklahoma will be successful, and that we'll continue to roll that out once we have more data. Michael Phillips : Okay, thanks. Second, totally unrelated question, what percent of your new customers -- when they come in the door, start off by going online and then end up switching from online to actually using a call center from you guys. And I'm wondering, is there any near-term opportunity you can take advantage of given the unit\u2019s funds from [Indiscernible] competitor, what they are doing with their [Indiscernible] cars? Tricia Griffith : I think it's a pretty small percentage. It used to be much larger, but I think our technology has gotten so much more sophisticated that more people finished the buy online when they're there. It's a small percentage. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thank you, Tricia. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Phillips. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Gary, please go ahead. Gary Ransom : Thank you and good morning. I wanted to ask about claims counts and claims personnel, and you've had a lot of growth on the commercial side. Maybe it's flat or but I wondered if you heard a little bit flatter on the first line side, but I wondered if you could talk to us about having the right people as things are changing rapidly. And if there's any difficulty in getting the staffing right there. Tricia Griffith : And it's a great question. And over the year as we really spent a lot of time making sure that we think about centralization, and consolidation and having the right file with the right representative at the right time. And we took advantage of the slowdown when frequency plummeted during the beginning of the pandemic to do the same thing on the Commercial Lines side because is it such a different animal. On what I would say is turnover is up, especially with new hires. And we're seeing that game you're seeing across the industry and across with entry-level jobs.  That said, we've had this recruiting machine that is just amazing, and it has enabled us to really continue to hire at a rate that helps us to get out in front of our growth. So we want to make sure that people, are not just here, but they are trained and can do the right thing on behalf of our customers. I think one of the things that I am proudest of that we didn't do, was to reduce our claims for us during the pandemic, we were severely overstaffed for several months. And Mike Caesar, who was the client is President of time and I made the decision that we just couldn't do it, that we knew that this was for the country not for our company.  And that allowed us to have staff waiting and available when things picked up. So we're going to continue to hire in advance of need and benefit claims and CRM side. Make sure we have the right training in both the virtual and maybe sometimes in office environment. We also look at in this group reports to John [Indiscernible] our internal audit group looks at the quality of the files and we have seen continued good results in there in that. Gary Ransom : For just Snapshot, I know you've talked on other times about using Snapshot stuff under the claims process as well. Have you -- Tricia Griffith : I -- you cut out, but I think what you're saying is we -- are you using that in the claims process. That's something we'll definitely consider as we think about continuance, we'll think about other services and claims could be one where we could actually help with the investigation should our customers have that Snapshot device. Gary Ransom : So that's still a future thing you're looking at, nothing really happening now. Tricia Griffith : We're testing all the time. That's what I would say. Gary Ransom : Got it. Thank you very much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Gary. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Josh, your line is open. Josh Shanker : Thank you. During the re-pricing and marketing rationalization. The policy count growth in Progressive property was still fairly healthy. I'm going to guess that you're not terribly interested in insuring someone's home, they're not often going to give you their cars. Can you talk a little bit about the different in hearings and retaining stems versus retaining Robinsons and getting new ones over the past nine months? Tricia Griffith : Yeah, thank you, Scott. I said -- so Sam's have always been defined as shoppers, and so they are very expensive. And so we know that our attention is going to be less when we crank up rates on the auto side, and that has proven to be true. And we've had less of a retention far in the Robinsons side. From the home perspective, we've been clear on our desire to de -risk and to get more of our nonvolatile storm states more in the 2/3 of our book versus the 50% it is now. This quarter we'll start to non-renew the policies that we talked about in Florida, about 60,000 policies over the next year.  And we continue to try to de -risk our portfolio. With property, it takes a little bit of time because there are 12-month policies, and it's also reflective of industry pricing. I think you've seen the storms that have happened in March and now again in April. A lot of it has to do with growth. Could be that right now, it's still a competitive market because everyone has increasing rates. But we're going to continue to increase rates and try to stay ahead of that trend and to de -risk our book a bit. Josh Shanker : So net of the Florida non-renewals, obviously you're growing in 47 other states with fairly desirous appetites. Should we feel that the deceleration and policy count growth overall for property, or do you think that those two things neutralize each other and it will be hard for us, from our perspective, to be able to see that going through the numbers? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, our desire is to grow in the non-volatile state, so we're taking actions to do so with more agents that are able to sell our property book. So it's hard to say. Again, that'll be relative to what our competitors do. And in addition, I talked a little bit in my opening comments about our increased use of deeper segmentation in the property products. We believe we have industry-leading segmentation auto side where our R&D departments were closely together to get that same level of segmentation in homes. I think that'll be really important.  And in many of the states that -- we still have a decent amount of policies and we've been able to have higher deductibles, have cost sharing. And so that -- this was not treated as a maintenance policy that -- just wait for that hailstorm to come and we'll replace your roof. And so those are some of the other things that we've changed. I can't really look out into the future and know how we're going to grow in a non-volatile space, but that is our approach. And I think it will take some time. Josh Shanker : Okay. Thanks very much. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open. Greg Peters : Good morning, everyone. So in your answers, you mentioned eventually returning to growth. And I'm want us to focus on the advertising piece of that. Your advertising spend is down in the quarter or down year-over-year. And I'm just wondering whether you actually need the lowest price to win the customer or put it another way, does the brand Progressive get you to a customer when -- even if you don't have the lowest price and when will be advertising spigot be turned back on if most your rates increases are behind you? Tricia Griffith : Oh, yeah. I do think our brand would have us win in the marketplace and doesn't always have to be this lowest rate, especially for people that have had experiences with us. I remember years ago, when I ran claims, we had really high NPS for those people that had claims because of the way we treated them when they needed us most. So yeah, I think that makes sense. And when we look at the difference between agency and direct, as far as PLE, we see that Direct has gone down a lot, and we think that has to do with some brand. So what Pat and I talked about is really state-by-state, and we'll do some sensitivity analysis of if we turn on local marketing by X Amount X plus X plus, what we think could happen to new apps, etc.  We will only do that if we're sure we're in the position to start that growth again. So we are as anxious as anyone. We did not like having new business app negative. We want to grow. We want to grow as fast as we can, but again, profit is one of our core values, and that will trump growth. But let me tell you, these conversations are happening every day, and when we turn it on, we will feel all pretty confident that we're in a good position to do so. Of course, things can change, and we'll always be -- we have to be nimble with those changes, and we we'll be able to do that based on the data that we look at literally daily. Greg Peters : My second question, I wanted to pivot you. You talked about rolling out the new homeowners\u2019 product. Can you just step back and tell us a little bit about that product and what differentiates from what you were offering before? Tricia Griffith : I'll let Pat say that. Pat Callahan : Yeah. Happy to talk about that. So part of the segmentation that we need to enhance in the property side of the business is on the age of the home and the age of the roof primarily. And we've just got better segmentation that we're bringing in as we expand that product over time, there's also some coverage expansion that agents have asked for, but primarily it's understanding the risk better and recognizing that the majority of our losses are coming from damage to the roof on that home and capturing both the age of the roofs and or the age of the home or in most cases, both, helps us better rate and better underwrite. Greg Peters : And just as a follow-up to that answer, does that mean that the older the roof that you're -- is there a depreciation schedules that you're applying allowing the customer to buy out for roof placement? I am just trying to understand how that fits with what some of your competitors are offering in the marketplace. Pat Callahan : Yes, it certainly varies by state what we can offer. And when we talk about a market like Florida that limits our ability to price a depreciated roof accurately. That's one of the challenges that we see in a market like Florida, but we do offer a depreciation or effectively a roof depreciation schedule for customers, so they're not, I guess, incentivized to have that roof replaced when it's old and there's damage to it. Greg Peters : Okay. Thanks for the answers. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from David Motemaden from ethical. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Tricia, you had said you believe that the major auto rate increases are behind you and obviously looking to turn on the growth. I guess, just saying that the major auto rate increases are behind you. We still have 7 points of rate that's going to earn in over the course of the rest of '22, how should we think about the auto loss ratio? And when that will start to stabilize and eventually improved, do you think that's a second half of '22 event or how are you thinking about that? Tricia Griffith : That's follow-up and data. So we watched as the rates earn into the loss ratio, and we have a couple of big states where we were able to get rate pretty quickly in on mainly, Texas and Florida. And so those are two big states for us. And so we'll watch those states closely to see when we think it's the right time to grow. And again, we're watching all the macroeconomic factors that are going into the inflationary pressures specifically with collision and property damage to make sure those down continued to increase. I think of labor rates and items like that's the will watch those close to make sure we have the right amount of rates to start the growth. David Motemaden : Got it. Thanks. And then, I guess just -- thinking about, maybe, on that last point, just some of the severity factors in trends that you're observing throughout the course of the first quarter and then also your outlooks, could you maybe break down how you guys are thinking about used car prices as well as -- labor is one that you mentioned and the outlook on those items as we move forward from here? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So we've launched we watched the Manheim Index pretty closely, and even though there is a couple of data points that say it's flattened or maybe even gone down, it's still 35% higher than January of 2021. So there hasn't been a step function change and a drop in used car prices. In addition, we know accidents are happening at a higher rate of speed, so there's more damage. We know that parts are up over 12%. Labor is only being up a couple of percentage points. We're watching that closely just because of watching the unemployment environment and how tough it is to hire in the industry and tax in the industry.  And then, because of body shop capacity, we're also seeing rental car extensions of several days. And so all those things go in some play when we think about severity on both collision and PD, and that's why they're higher. I feel pretty good and pretty stable on the BI side. In the last four quarters, it's been in the 6% to 8% range. We'll continue to watch that. We have -- we've seen a little bit of a turning rep rate, increase some of the general damages, which are the non-medical damages increase. But we feel that that's, at least, stabilized over four quarters, but we'll watch that, of course. But those are the big drivers that go into the extreme severity trends in collision and PD. David Motemaden : Got it. And the follow-up, when you say that you're ready to move potentially to more growth, and your rates, you feel like most of them are behind you, what is the severity view that you're making into that statement? Tricia Griffith : The severity view? I think we're just looking to see if we can -- the severity will be what it'll be in terms of what's happening from an inflationary perspective, so we're just pricing to that, and when we believe we can make our calendar year and lifetime target mark -- as the profit margins will start to grow. Unidentified Analyst : It's important to recognize a lot of these decisions are made locally, so we are product managers who are responsible for geography and products, and they are obviously adjusting rates with their view and the pricing team's view of future loss trends. They take the rates up. And while they are fairly confident that the projections are right, normally, you are going to want to see some results come in before you open up the [Indiscernible] on new business side. That said, there are -- in geographies now where we have done that.  But there are also a lot of geographies where we have either not gotten the rate we need, such as some of the large states we mentioned earlier or we're still a bit tentative on understanding if we have taken enough rate such that we can open up the [Indiscernible]. So it really is a day-to-day [Indiscernible] geography level decision on when to turn advertising back on, when to loosen the underwriting. But again, I think one of the strengths we have is that team of product managers who are considering everything locally and making the best call, again, on a day-to-day basis. So it's not something we can predict at the aggregate level. It's going to come down the state level decisions, and we're confident we are going to be making right ones in each state at the right time. David Motemaden : Understood. Thanks so much for your time. Tricia Griffith : Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. And good morning. Excuse me. I was just curious with the situation in Eastern Europe and Russia. Seems like some of the European OEMs have had some supply chain issues. Are you seeing that impact in maybe U.S. manufacturers or priced of cars, used cars, parts or the like? Tricia Griffith : Not really. We see the same sort of bottlenecks in supply chain with kits that happened before what's happening in Russia and the Ukraine, and so there's still some supply issues there, especially with new cars and that has of course increased used car prices, but that was prior to this. Yaron Kinar : Right. Okay. And then I think one of the comments you made around homeowners is that your ability to grow is going to depend on the competitive environment. Can you maybe talk about how you see the competitive environment in homeowners outside of the Southeastern Florida? Tricia Griffith : That's also state-by-state as well because if you got west there's issues in terms of fires, etc. So I think we look at each day, look at proclivity to have a major weather events. Understand our segmentation more deeply. And then we will look around. It's a competition on both direct and agency side, so we've got not just the agency side where we sell Progressive home against some of the captives or bigger players. But we also have the Direct side where we have the opportunity to have Progressive Home as well as many unaffiliated partners. And so we have some advantage to get Robinsons, they're not always on our paper as well. But we look across the country, try to get -- we're trying to get to the more non-volatile states. We believe when we look at our results against the industry and non-weather in those states, we're very competitive. Unidentified Analyst : And we have great and broad distribution network in those non-volatile states that are quite committed to Progressive as a company they use in their offices. So our independent agents across those non-volatile states ensure a lot of Robinsons. So we have access to a lot of that business, and we're going to spend more time going after it. I know you excluded Florida in the south [Indiscernible] in the question, but it's really important that there are solutions in those states that are viable for consumers and the industry.  And it has been very challenging in some of those environments, and so we're working with regulators and legislators to find solutions because Florida, specifically, right now is a very disruptive market. Pat was talking about the liability of depreciating a roof from Florida. It -- you must offer a full replacement value on your roof in Florida. So it's very difficult to find solutions for homes that have older roofs, that are not up to code. So we hope to, obviously, growing in the non-volatile states. We also hope for solutions in some of those cap current states that are, again, amenable to both consumers and the industry. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tracy vendor AG from Barclays. Tracy your line is open. Tracy Benguigui : Good morning. Before declaring victory [Indiscernible] with the exception [Indiscernible] I'm wondering if you're seeing favorable seasonality in the first quarter, like others are talking about. And if so have you taken that into account when you say the majority of your rate increases are behind you? Tricia Griffith : I think our seasonality has been relatively stable as it has been in the past. I'm not saying we're winning, Tracy. What we're saying is that we believe we got out in front of our competitors with rate from the data that we look at. We're watching trends very closely. A lot of caveats to that. And all we're saying is that with the rate we have from last year and the rate that we have on the street. We believe we're well-positioned. Again, lots of caveats on making sure that we have enough and that we can grow in turn on that local media. So and maybe in a quarter or two we can have a different conversation helpful, but right now we're still tentative, but we wanted to just give some color on the fact that we're really proud of our rate-making machine and that we're able to get out in front of that despite a lot of headwinds. Tracy Benguigui : I hear your optimism, but I'm also just wondering, in some states, are you just simply reaching your maximum limit you think regulators will allow you to take, or in theory, you'd choose to take more rate you could do so? Tricia Griffith : We look at the data, and we look at perspective rates in terms of what we're seeing in trends. And if we need more, even states where we have already increased rates several times, we will share the actuarial data to get the right rate, to get to our profit target margin. And that's how we've always worked. And I think regulators are thinking about their constituents because of all the other inflationary pressures. But this industry has been very clear. It needs rate -- has needed rate for some time since last year. And now we feel good that we're starting to get it in many of our larger states.  So I'm just optimistic because we were able to have great conversations, great relationships in a couple of key states and many states across the board with key regulators where they get it. They see the data. They understand it, and they know the worst thing you can do is not give the rate because then, you're not going to have insurance available for their constituents and ultimately, you're going to have to get the rate. So it's going to be, over time, there will be bigger rates in the future. So I think that's how it works. And so I am very optimistic. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. And I know you make local decisions but to any extent, are you taking any cross states up to dates like higher rates of states where you have success to make up for inadequacies in states like California? Tricia Griffith : No. We have a very specific goal of not subsidizing and to have every one of our products in aggregate common to our 96 combined ratio goal. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. I'm sorry, just really quick, you mentioned is 20% take-up in telematics. Is that for new business only? If not what percentage of your in-force uses telematics? Tricia Griffith : The 28% is in-force. It's no -- new. I'm sorry, new. 40% new in direct, 10% new in agency, yeah. Are we going to report [Indiscernible] I'm sorry? Tracy Benguigui : Sorry. What would it be for your in-force, which is a lot larger than your new business. Tricia Griffith : I think we are saying we don't share that. Tracy Benguigui : Oh, you don't share that. Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Tracy. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian, your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thanks. John, first one for you. Just curious. Where do you knew money yields stand right now as of today versus your kind of book yield on your fixed income portfolio and maybe perhaps you could give us just a general sense of how much of your portfolio roles every 12 months. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. I'll take that one. So -- Brian Meredith : Okay. Unidentified Analyst : -- I don't like to give too specific, but I would think in broad swaths, if you look at March, 2022, in terms of where investments were, inclusive of treasuries, there was about 2.5% and taking that out on either side of 3%. Generally, if you think about a portfolio with a three-year duration and our size, I would think about it every 12 months, anywhere from $6 billion to $8 billion of that portfolio rolling off. Brian Meredith : Great, really helpful. And then, second question, I'm just curious, Tricia, would you care to speculate or tell us -- give us some sense of when you think California will actually start granting rate increases? Tricia Griffith : Well, Brian, if I knew the answer to that -- we're -- all I can say is we're working -- Brian Meredith : [Indiscernible] Tricia Griffith : Yeah, we're working with the regulators and doing all that we can because we want to be able to open up, and we want to be able to have affordable, available insurance for California and just -- most populous state, we'd love to grow there, and we'll do what we can to do so. Brian Meredith : Great. I mean, is there -- I'm -- but just curious, is there amount of time that you're willing to wait to get those rate increases? Are you taking pretty -- some pretty significant none underrating actions here to improve results right now? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. We're taking very significant non-rate actions because of the inability to get the rate. And obviously we will work with the regulators to figure out the best thing to do for our mutual constituents and we just need to continue to do so. Brian Meredith : Great. Can I ask one more quick one. I'm just curious. PLE continue to drop pretty significantly. Is that reflective of what exchange in business mix or is that just the pricing environment? Just maybe remind us exactly what that PLE reflects. Tricia Griffith : It really does reflect the pricing environment. And I talked a little bit about the difference in agency and direct with agency being a little bit more elastic. And when we look at PLEs, Texas and Florida, they obviously don't drop as dramatically, which would tell you it's pricing because we got out in those two big states pretty early. I think that our holy grail is retention, but we also have to be priced right.  And we also noticed some consumers are trying to figure out, can they change their coverages or do things differently or as Snapshot and things like that to reduce their prices. So I know in our CRM organization we continue to try to grow what we call our customer preservation teams. So if they call in and they are challenged to pay their bill because of increases. Can we work with them on bill plans, on coverage to make sure they are obviously still covered, but to get them the right rate in order for them to stay? But it is it is reflective on the majority with prices. Unidentified Analyst : Just to reiterate a couple of parts made earlier in response to that question. We do see different use to study bear consumer segments. So on the more preferred end, less elastic and more non-standard or Sanmen far more elastic. So that obviously plays itself through. And for the change. Additionally, as Tricia noted earlier, we do see a difference by channel. So some of that's because our agents have access to other markets and light proactively shop. But we also think there's some brand benefits. So we do see less degradation in the direct channel than we do in the agency channel. Brian Meredith : Very helpful. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, [Indiscernible] Operator : Our next question is from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Alex, please go ahead with your question. Alex Scott : Thanks. First one I had is just on the Personal Auto NPW growth. I think high level when we try to triangulate the PIF growth you're getting in the rate. NPW growth isn't showing as much of the rate flowing through as I would've expected. I'm just interested if there's any makeshift or something affecting that or if there's any nuances to that that I should be considering. Tricia Griffith : Probably point to average written premium growth with the pricing increases coming in. And I think that's reflective of our new business growth in overall growth. Unidentified Analyst : A couple of other comments on that. We did mention we still have seven points of rate to earn in, in our Personal Auto programs, so some of the rate we've taken has not yet affected the policies. We report the written premium change, so the earnings will affect combined ratio, more so down the road. But if you look at the change in new average written premium versus renewal, you'll see renewal is up significantly more. So as we take revisions that are predominantly base rate revisions, those will flow through directly to all our renewal customers.  On the new business side, people shop, so we won't see all that average written premium benefit for new customers perhaps at any time when we are taking rates up. So there are some timing issues there, but we're also cognizant of the new renewal mix and how that flows through in terms of the total average premiums. We think the rate we're taking is definitely earning into the book. It's being accepted by consumers actually at a little higher rate than we've seen historically, which is also reflected. We think of the market conditions. So we think the actions we're taking are absolutely resulting in the outcomes we're expecting. Alex Scott : Got it, and thank you. And second I had been just on competition. You talked about some of the advantages you have in your sophistication with the ad spend, and I'm just interested if you've seen anything as we've gone through the pandemic, which I think was a bit of a wake-up call to some of the more brick-and-mortar type distribution companies. Are you seeing more competition there? Are you able to execute that strategy to the same degree you've been able to in the past, even just thinking beyond where pricing is at the moment and how it appears near-term? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I would direct you back to our four strategic pillars that we talk about all the time we make sure we invest in all the time and I have seen our strength there. So the first one is our people and our culture are our most important competitive advantage. So during the pandemic, we have really made sure that we are connecting even, if it's the virtual to our employees, like continue to do every new hire class. I am out and about virtually and now more in-person, but people and culture are really important. And it's important for people to feel good about being on a winning team. The second we've talked about a lot is our brands.  So we're going to continue to invest in our brands and have some really great creative coming out end of this month or early June. And then of course, competitive prices, we've been talking about that for the last hour, we want to get to where we're really competitive. Some part of that is getting the right rates. But it's also that continuation of our superior segmentation and making sure that we care deeply about expenses. So we continue to create expense goals for the future. And then lastly, and John have brought this up, is our broad coverage, so we're going to continue to be where, when, and how customers want to shop. And I think that's the key. So regardless of the people entered independent agency channel or the direct channel, we've been in both for a long time, we appreciate both. We appreciate the fact that consumers have a choice that if they want to buy on their phone, their iPad, through an agent, through 1-800 Progressive, and we're going to be there as they change, especially if we've invested more in business closed floor on the commercial side of HomeQuote Explorer. So all those four strategic pillars really worked hand and glove to make sure that we stay competitive. I feel really great about our position in both channels and how we think about the future. Alex Scott : Okay thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open. \ufeffQ - Meyer Shields\ufeff\ufeff: Great. Thanks so much. Tricia, in your -- [Indiscernible] earlier question, you talked about the returns profit proceeding, the return to growth in conversations with controller. Is that to a monthly basis or is that a full year? In other words, if you are priced adequately, but having earned in all the rate increases that are in the market now, will that constrain growth? Tricia Griffith : Yeah, we'll look at timing of when to start, when you ramp up some local advertising. Remember, we haven't shut off our national advertising, so it's not like our brand isn't out there, so we still have some ability to grow. But yeah, we'll look at the pivotal time or right time of when we should start that growth, making sure that the rates in each particular state are adequate for us to reach our target profit margins. \ufeffQ - \ufeffMeyer Shields\ufeff\ufeff: Okay. But there's some monthly combined ratio pressure because of lower prior rate. That's not an impediment to growth? Tricia Griffith : I don't understand you. Unidentified Analyst : No, we're obviously managing through a calendar year, '96 or better, so we have that as an objective function for sure, as do big product managers. But if they've taken rates up to where they think the lifetime combined ratio for new customers they are writing is adequate, they will likely air towards growing more. There is the consideration of the calendar year combined ratio for sure as well, but generally, if they think the new business customers they're writing today are adequately priced over their lifetime, they will be happy to go for growth. \ufeffQ - \ufeffMeyer Shields\ufeff\ufeff: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. I apologize for not expressing the question well. Second question, on price sensitivity, is that heightened across various customer segments when overall in place in outside of car insurance is elevated? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. Not really sure if we know that. But I think what John was saying too, in terms of elasticity, our renewals are improving on the elasticity side, which tells us that and we do histogram on decreases or increases, to a certain percentage or buckets of percentages. And we're seeing more people even if they are shopping, they're staying when they get their renewal, which likely means they can't find a better rate. That's the only thing we can look at. What's in data, but it's hard to say with all of the economics is going on in the country. \ufeffQ -\ufeffMeyer Shields\ufeff\ufeff: Looking perfect. Thanks so much. Tricia Griffith : Thank you, Meyer. Operator : Our next question is from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Ryan, please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on operating within Progressive's constraints. So the plan, historically, has always been doing 96 or better and grow as fast as you can. The vast majority of the time, growth is easy because you got usually close to the 96. But whenever you've gotten kind of closer to 96, like the second half of last year, it's been focused on re-underwriting, focused less on growth, all that. I guess I'm just curious -- and you did that before you're even at a 96, but we're getting there. So after having gone through the first quarter when you've been -- and again, somewhere running 94 on a group basis and above a 96 in personal auto, is it safe to say that you have the same risk appetite that you did later in 20 -- later last years? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I mean, I think our standard and our operating policy hasn't changed. And remember for reporting and 94.5%, we're still looking at perspective rates and we're looking at trends, that will be future over 96% if we don't do some. So the data is in a moment in time we're looking at rate need ahead of time to make sure that we put that good business on the books for both a calendar year, '96 and a lifetime '96, I think those constraints, as you call them, I mean, I think I'd call them just our operating plans have worked well over the years. And in fact, the first time we talked about '96 was in our annual report, 1971 and when we went public.  And it's worked really well for us. If you look at our long-term trend, it's nice to have that Governor, it helps keep us disciplined around our pricing, helps keep us disciplined around our expense philosophy. And it has built us to the number three, and our Personal Auto carrier. And I can tell you when I started in 1988, we were nowhere there, so we will continue with that of course '96 is in the aggregate, so it doesn't mean that obviously our new business on the direct side wouldn't come in at a '96 and there's other areas where we aggregate are up to the 96. And I think it's been a great winning business model. Ryan Tunis : That's clear. My follow-up was just on retention. So retention has continued to actually hold up a lot better than I would have expected. And you're seeing how much rate you implemented in the first quarter. Yes, I was just maybe wondering some clarity of what you've implemented and how much has actually been -- I mean, showing you the customers that was that mainly on first-quarter, but I'm just trying to think of like maybe that might be somewhat of a tailwind headed in the second quarter. Tricia Griffith : Well, I think it depends on if you're looking at the trailing three or trailing 12. I think trailing three as more responsive to our rate increases. And so like I'd started to say before, we saw early results with our retention in some of the states where we took increases more quickly. When could still seeing a little bit of degradation again, a lot of that is relative to what our competition is doing. So if you're getting your renewal and you're stopping and rates are going up. And again, that's why we tried to get ahead of rate.  Because if we can be stable, which is what consumers want and they go to shop and now it's much more increased with our competitors, they're going to stay with us then of course, the new business we've been talking about for a while. So we keep a close eye on retention, especially because we've been really proud of the work we've done today over the many, many years. But we'll watch that closely and do everything in our power to keep our customers that we've taken so much to acquire. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Doug Constantine : We've exhausted our scheduled time, and so that concludes our event. Emily, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation's First Quarter Investor Event. Information of actual replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for next year. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Douglas Constantine : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's Second Quarter Investor Event. I'm Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be the moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted on the company's website.  This quarter marks a return to our typical format, which is a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with the leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team.  As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first and second quarters of 2022, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I am pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia? Susan Griffith : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As I stated in my letter, we continue to work through the challenges handed to us through the macroeconomic environment. Uncertainty has been the theme of our post-COVID world, and that has continued into the second quarter. I continue to be encouraged by the way the organization has responded. Flexibility was our theme for the 2021 annual report, and our people have continued to exhibit flexibility into 2022. During the second quarter, we continued to feel the impact of inflation with used car prices still near all-time highs and continued rising cost to repair vehicles. On the other hand, record high fuel costs and the resulting reduced driving provides a modest tailwind to auto frequency. We will continue to monitor the environment closely and are taking proactive steps to ensure we meet our promise to 96 combined ratio. As we stated in the first quarter, we believe our major personal auto rate revisions are behind us. and that's reflected in our slowing pace of second quarter rate changes. In the quarter, we raised rates in 17 states, which had about a 2% increase countrywide, bringing our year-to-date rate increase to about 9% and our year-over-year rate increase to about 16%. While these rate changes continue to have the expected effect on PIF growth, I'm encouraged by recent results. As competitors took rate and we increased our investment in direct acquisition in many markets, we have seen prospect volume rise, and June marked the first month since May of 2021 with year-over-year new app growth in our direct channel. While the path ahead undoubtedly contains many obstacles, I'm encouraged to see our efforts bear fruit. I'd now like to change focus to the main topic of today's presentation, which is our property business. While our state expansion to write property insurance has enabled us to increase our addressable market and accelerate growth in the important Robinsons segment, it's no secret that we have faced challenges. Over the last 5 years, we've been unable to consistently run the business at our target margins. And between 2017 and 2021, have posted an underwriting loss. We were the first to admit that we have work to do to get this business on track. As I mentioned in my letter, our current pricing and underwriting activities do not adequately address weather-driven volatility. And we are in the process of executing a number of steps to turn the business around. We realize these actions will require more time than originally anticipated to ensure consistent delivery of our target combined ratio for the property business. As such, we have revised our expected underwriting profitability over the coming years, which led to a write-off of $225 million of goodwill, primarily related to our purchase of ARX Holding Corp. The remaining $228 million of goodwill is also primarily attributable to the acquisition and reflects the increase in addressable market we gain for our Agency auto product that bundling represents. The team of people working on our property business continues to focus time on improving our underwriting, managing risk concentration and more precisely matching rate to risk at a much more granular level. For the last 5 years, Dave Pratt, our soon-to-be retired Property General Manager, has worked closely with senior leaders from ASI as they transformed our property business from a regional carrier to the tenth largest property carrier in the country, now writing in 47 states. With Dave's impending retirement next year, Tanya Fjare, who has more than 20 years' experience at ASI and Progressive has taken over leadership of our property P&L and is partnering with supporting groups across Progressive from product, claims, IT, legal and finance to ensure we're building the products, experiences and team to create the broadly available and competitively priced and profitable product offering that we've all grown to expect from Progressive. While we cannot change course overnight, today, we will share the steps we are taking today to reach our goal. For our main presentation today, first, Pat Callahan, our Personal Lines President and nearly 20-year Progressive veteran, will discuss our market opportunity and our investments in property product distribution. Following Pat, Dave Pratt will go into more detail on our results, the investments we've made in people and product and a real-world case study on how our actions have resulted in favorable results. Dave is a 31-year Progressive employee who has held numerous roles throughout his illustrious career. Dave has been an important part of Progressive's success over his decades of service, and we will miss him upon his upcoming retirement. Thank you again for joining us. And now I'll hand it over to Pat. Pat? Patrick Callahan : Thanks, Tricia. While our focus has historically been on vehicle insurance, we've always recognized that property insurance is an important segment of U.S. personal lines. And as we continue to grow our personal auto business, meeting the property needs of our growing auto customer base is increasingly important. Over more than a decade, we've regularly shared our investments to meet those needs as part of our Destination Era strategy. These began back in 2008 through our Progressive Home Advantage partnerships. And today, Dave and I will restate the business case for investing in property, share our progress driving market share growth and more importantly, the initiatives underway to ensure that we deliver profitable property growth in support of becoming consumers' and agents' #1 choice and destination for auto, home and other insurance. The U.S. property and casualty market is almost $800 billion in premiums written and more than 90% of that isn't yet insured with us. Today's focus is on the $381 billion U.S. personal lines market, where we enjoy about 10% of the combined U.S. auto and home market share. We're the third largest auto writer with almost 14% share, while today, we write just below 2% of the U.S. homeowners market. Despite many reports of its demise due to technology advancements reducing accident frequency, U.S. auto direct premiums written grew about 4% annually over the past 5 years. And at more than $260 billion, the U.S. auto market continues to represent a growth opportunity. The U.S. homeowners market continues to grow faster than auto, at more than 5% annually over the past 5 years and more than 8% growth in 2021. Recent inflationary forces, loss cost increases and resulting rate increases are further accelerating growth in both the U.S. home and auto markets. Let's break this down by channel and segment. I expect that many of you are familiar with how we think about consumer market segments across channel, protection needs and auto and home bundle status. The rows on this table are the 3 largest U.S. distribution channels : captive agent, independent agent and direct-to-consumer. While all 3 channels have been growing premiums written, channel share has been slowly migrating from captive agents to direct as technology adoption drives continued e-commerce migration across industries. The independent agent channel continues to maintain share due to its strong consumer value proposition, which combines local agent expertise with the breadth of product availability and depth of carrier options that deliver the ease and savings that consumers value. The columns here are Progressive's consumer segments from simple needs inconsistently insured, auto-only households or Sams; to continuously insured renters, Dianes; to consistently insured but unbundled homeowners, Wrights; to our well-known bundled auto and home Robinsons. You'll note that our market share is approaching 20% for the combined Sam, Diane and Wrights market, while we remain underpenetrated with Robinsons at less than 3% share. Note that this Robinson share does not include the more than $1 billion written by unaffiliated carriers through the direct Progressive Advantage Agency. You'll also note that more than half of the combined U.S. auto and home market is bundled. And more than 80% of that is bundled through an agent. The captive agent channel currently over-indexes on Robinson's share, but as more Robinsons migrate to the direct and independent agent channels we'll benefit due to strong market share across each of those channels. Our focus on Robinsons is driven by our untapped potential in this large and growing market segment, which makes up more than half of the total U.S. personal lines market.  We've shared in prior investor presentations that current period financials fail to fully reflect the hidden balance sheet of future growth as our current customers both continue to renew and expand their relationship with Progressive, which delivers both top and bottom line financial benefit for years to come. Investing to expand our offerings to better penetrate the existing approximately $200 billion Robinsons market creates value in 2 critical ways. First, we drive top and bottom line calendar period unit, premium and underwriting profit growth through acquiring customers who bundle their auto and home today. As I shared on the last slide, more than half of the U.S. auto and home market is bundled. So when these customers shop and switch, it's critical for us to have a competitive bundled offer to meet their needs. The nature of these Robinsons bundled homeowners is inherently more stable than other customer segments. And they also have approximately 3x the policy life expectancy of our Sams segment. Acquiring Robinsons drives growth both today and in future periods. Second, for more than 85 years, we've been a leader in acquiring simpler needs, monoline auto customers, and we continue to view this as an important pipeline of future growth. Ensuring we have broadly available and competitively priced renters, condo and homeowners offerings is essential to ensure we meet the needs of these customers throughout their lifetimes. As we nurture these younger and simpler needs customers throughout their life events, we create and capture value for the firm today and unlock future growth potential. Since embarking on our Destination Era strategy, we've made major investments in acquiring ASI, launching new quoting platforms across channels, building our in-house Advantage agency, creating a Platinum offering for our independent agent partners and investing well over $1 billion on bundle and save branding and marketing in just the past 3 years. These investments are driving Robinsons growth across distribution channels, which validates the potential for us to grow in this important market segment. While our property profitability hasn't consistently met our expectations. We also write more than $3 billion in profitable auto premium for these Robinson households across channels. And while some of that would likely have been accessible without the complementary property offering, we're confident that having broadly available and competitively priced property is helping to drive this growth.  As I shared a few minutes ago, more than 80% of the bundled auto and home business we're looking to acquire is distributed through agents. The Robinson opportunity through independent agents alone represents more than $60 billion in annualized premiums written. And as the largest seller of auto through the independent agent channel, we are well positioned to leverage our massive distribution footprint and more than 85 years of experience selling through agents to grow our share in the channel. I wanted to highlight 2 key initiatives that facilitate our independent agent channel Robinsons growth. First, recognizing that Progressive has historically been an industry leader in ease of use for agents and customers, we built a streamlined quote experience for the home and auto bundle, which makes it fast and easy for agents to enter customer information once and quote and sell a bundle of most of the Progressive vehicle and property products, either upfront or over time as customers experience life events and need more and/or different protection products. Second, shortly after buying and controlling interest in ASI, we launched our Platinum program, which affords unique customer and agent benefits for bundling home and auto with Progressive. Over the past several years, we've continued to expand this footprint, bringing our highly competitive nationally-branded and easy to quote and sell bundled offering to leading agencies across the country. Beyond gaining share of the currently bundled independent agent market, close to $100 billion of Robinsons premium is distributed through captive or exclusive agencies. And this is despite lacking the superior consumer value proposition that results from carrier choice or depth that is available through independent agents. As a leading nationally-branded auto and home carrier, we believe we are well positioned to continue to both capture share of the existing bundled independent agent market, while also capitalizing on the ongoing shift from captive agents into the independent agent and direct channels. Despite the majority of Robinsons business being sold through agents today, more than 30% of total auto insurance is sold direct. And we believe as younger auto consumers go through the life events that increase the complexity of their household insurance needs, having broadly available online property insurance will become increasingly important to meet the needs of these future customers. Property risks are complex. No two homes are alike. They don't come with VINs, and as such, property insurance products have historically been built to be sold through agents. Homeowners, especially first-time home buyers, often struggle to identify important property characteristics like roof shape, shingle type, plumbing type, et cetera. And as such, most property products don't easily translate to online or mobile direct-to-consumer quoting and binding. We continue to invest to make it easier for consumers to quote and buy property insurance online through our multi-carrier HomeQuote Explorer platform. This proprietary system guide shoppers through the home coverage interview, leveraging data fill and imagery to simplify the quoting process and deliver a multi-carrier shopping experience. This investment is paying off as we continue to lead the industry in desktop homeowner quote initiations. Additionally, while getting shoppers through the quoting process is half the battle, forcing online shoppers to go off-line and call to complete their sale is an antiquated and poor customer experience. And we've been investing to add online buy button functionality to the Progressive Home Direct property offering with availability now approaching 40 states. Recognizing the market opportunity ahead of us and the critical role that broadly available and competitively-priced property products play in our future success, let's transition over to Dave Pratt for an update on progress with our property product development and exposure management initiatives. David Pratt : Thanks, Pat. I'll review the results in the property insurance business that's underwritten by Progressive, and then talk about the changes we're implementing to position this business for future growth and consistent profitability. Pat described the huge market opportunity presented by the Robinson bundled customers. Since Progressive acquired a controlling interest in ASI in 2015, we have invested to leverage Progressive's brand and distribution channels to attract and retain Robinson customers. We have rebranded ASI's Progressive Home, expanded the Platinum agent program and built online quoting and buying capabilities, as Pat just described. These investments have helped us more than double the size of this business reaching $2.2 billion in direct written premium last year. We're now the 10th largest homeowners insurer in the United States. While we're happy with the growth of the property business, we are not satisfied with its profitability. We've seen a consistent pattern over the last 5 years. Our underwriting expenses and non-weather losses have been consistent with our forecasts but weather losses have been much higher than the estimates that we included in our pricing decisions. In order to diagnose how to address this problem, we'll look at our performance relative to the overall property insurance market. I'll provide an overview of our countrywide performance and then highlight a state case study, focusing on the actions we've taken in Texas. When Progressive acquired a controlling interest in ASI in 2015, 64% of the company's homeowners premium came from Florida, Texas and Louisiana. We have labeled those as legacy CAT states in the map here. Growth in other states has reduced that legacy CAT mix from 64% to 41% in 2021 direct written premium. But that's still a much heavier mix than the 22% that these states represent of the overall U.S. homeowners insurance market. The challenges facing the Florida property market have been especially painful for Progressive since it represents almost 1/4 of our homeowners premium. Our Florida direct loss ratio over the last 5 years is 4 points better than the overall industry. But at 74.5%, it's still much higher than our target for the state. We have grouped the remaining states based on their exposure to volatile weather perils. The yellow states in the center of the country experienced significant hail losses. Our mix of business in those states is consistent with their share of the total industry premium. The red states labeled moderate volatility are exposed to hurricane risk on the East Coast and wildfires in California, but there are less risky areas inland and away from the areas of the high wildfire risk. Progressive was a new entrant in the California market in 2016 so our mix of business in the moderate volatility states is less than their share of the overall industry. That leaves the less volatile states in green. As you can see, these more stable markets represented only 27% of our direct written premium last year, much lower than their 40% of total U.S. homeowners premium. In order to build a more stable homeowners book of business, we will limit growth in the volatile states and work to grow our share of premium in the less volatile markets. You've seen this growth and profitability chart in the past for our auto insurance business. It shows combined ratio on the X-axis and premium growth in the Y-axis. Each dot represents one of the top 10 insurers with the industry total represented by the black dot. We want to be in the upper right quadrant, representing profitable growth. Over the 5 years from 2017 through 2021, the U.S. homeowners insurance market grew at a 5% annual rate and suffered a combined ratio over 100. As we noted earlier, we're happy with Progressive's growth over that period, but we're certainly not satisfied with our position on the profitability axis. I talked before about our heavier than industry mix of business in the legacy CAT states. If we adjust Progressive's results by weighting our state level results using the industry's mix of premium by state, our combined ratio would match the industry. Let's take one more look at our results over the last 5 years before moving on to our plans for shifting the mix to less volatile states. This chart shows our 2017 through 2021 direct homeowners loss ratio for the groups of states described earlier. As you'd expect from the mix adjusted comparison of our results against the industry on the last page, our loss ratios are close to industry results within each group of states. This has been a difficult period for the industry in states with significant exposure to catastrophic weather and our relatively high mix of business in those states has driven our overall property results to be worse than the industry. I should note that California accounts for 45% of total industry homeowners premium in the states that we've labeled moderate volatility. But California is less than 20% of Progressive's premium from those states. While I'm happy to say that our loss ratio was better than the industry in 5 of those 6 states, our relatively low exposure to California's wildfires in 2017 and 2018, exaggerates our relative performance advantage for this group of states. It's encouraging to see that Progressive's loss ratio is very close to the industry average in the less volatile states since we have relatively little experience operating in these markets. We hope to see our relative performance improve as we roll out product model improvements. These regional comparisons simply reinforce the point that we need to shift our mix of business to build a property book that is consistently profitable. I'll talk next about the actions we're taking to accomplish that shift. As Tricia mentioned in her first quarter letter to shareholders, we have begun implementing a plan to shrink our business in Florida and limit growth in the other states with significant exposure to catastrophes. We've taken a number of actions in these states. We've increased rates, particularly for homes with older roofs; we've expanded underwriting eligibility restrictions to ensure that we're writing only business we expect to be profitable; we've introduced targeted nonrenewals in areas with concentrations of risk or segments that are unprofitable; we've introduced cost-sharing initiatives such as higher deductibles and actual cash value coverage on roofs that are nearing the end of their useful lives; and we've improved agency management, including a reduction in our agency force in select markets. While these changes are important, they're not sufficient. We can't shrink our way to success. So we also need to continue investing in product improvements that will support growth in the less volatile states. Over the last 4 years, we've made significant investments to develop the organizational capability to build and deliver best-in-class property insurance products. As you can see in the graph on the right, our product teams have grown from just 21 people in September of 2018 to 134 people at the end of this year's second quarter. We have added auto-like capabilities to a team with significant amount of property experience and expertise. I'll briefly describe the new teams that we've added in the product area. In the second quarter of 2018, we introduced an underwriting analytics team created to advance the science of underwriting and improve our risk selection. In the fourth quarter of that year, we introduced a dedicated research and development organization to focus on product model development and segmentation improvements. In the first quarter of 2019, we introduced a dedicated pricing team. And finally, in the second quarter of last year, we introduced a new rate revision and product delivery team to improve our speed to market so that we can take these new model enhancements and roll them out more quickly. These investments have helped us to improve our product offerings with more improvements still to come. In 2019, I described our 4.0 property product, which added new coverage features and expanded eligibility to meet the expectations of preferred agencies outside of our legacy CAT states. We have since introduced the 4.1 product model, which allowed us to price the water peril more accurately. These 2 product versions are now live in 41 states that represent 93% of our non-Florida premium. We'll move to full by-peril rating with the 5.0 product model. We've completed the research work for this new model and IT development work is in process now. The first state is scheduled to go live during the first half of 2023. We expect 5.0 to offer more competitive rates for a majority of shoppers and allow us to further expand the range of risks that we can accept. We will need these improvements to achieve our growth ambitions in the less volatile states. Now let's look at a case study for how these product improvements can help us improve results. In 2017, our Texas business was too concentrated in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, with that region representing 40% of our Texas business compared with roughly 20% of the single-family homes in the state. We also had too many customers with low wind/hail deductibles, especially in the northern half of Texas that experiences frequent hailstorms. Our customers are often encouraged to file claims after these storms by aggressive marketing from roofers. While a free roof initially sounds appealing, we found that customers with higher deductibles are less likely to file a claim for minor damage. In order to address these problems, our Texas product manager increased rates, introduced higher deductible requirements for new customers, and improved price segmentation with the introduction of the 4.0 and then 4.1 product models. We have seen significant shifts in our Texas book of business as a result. The Dallas-Fort Worth mix is now in line with that area's share of homes in the state, our average wind/hail deductible is up 50% and we're attracting more bundled customers and fewer customers with roofs that are nearing the end of their useful life. These changes have resulted in improved performance relative to our competitors in Texas. In 2018 and 2019, our Texas combined ratio was 10 points worse than the industry. As we've shifted the mix of business, we started to see improvement in 2020 and our 2021 combined ratio was 15 points better than the overall industry in Texas. We were able to accomplish these shifts without shrinking the total business in the state. We now expect to achieve our target profit margins over time or in an average year, but it's important to note that Texas homeowners results are naturally volatile due to the state's exposure to big hurricane and hail events. That's why we have decided to limit growth in Texas as part of our overall plan to shift our mix to less volatile states. Texas is now well positioned for profitable growth but we wanted to represent a smaller share of our total property premium over time. I'll close with 2 topics that many of you have asked about. The first is the effect of inflation on our Property business. The table on the left on this page shows our filed rate changes over the last 2.5 years in our core homeowners product. But that table doesn't fully explain the changes in ultimate premiums that our renewing customers experience. Let me explain that process in a little more detail. When we sell a new homeowners insurance policy, we estimate the cost to replace the home in the event of a total loss. We insist that the agent insure the property for at least that amount to ensure adequate coverage for the customer. We update this replacement cost at every renewal event. If the estimated replacement cost has gone up, we automatically increase the coverage limit to maintain adequate coverage. Until recently, these renewal adjustments typically increase coverage limits by 2% or 3% at each policy renewal. The blue line in the chart on the right shows the average year-over-year change in these coverage limits by quarter. And you'll see that inflation-driven cost increases during the second half of last year jumped from the traditional 2% to 3% to double-digit increases in average coverage limits. The orange line shows the average renewal premium increase paid by customers who renewed with us in each quarter. So that orange line is a function not only of our filed rate change, but also the increases in coverage limit to ensure adequate coverage. And then any mix changes that might have resulted from some segments of customers renewing with us at a higher or lower rate as we've changed our product over time. While we would certainly prefer to keep prices more stable for our customers, this automatic adjustment to maintain appropriate coverage helps us to maintain appropriate rate levels to compensate for increases in claims severity. And finally, I'll provide a brief update on our reinsurance program. We use reinsurance to protect Progressive's capital in the event of an unusually severe catastrophic event in addition to protecting against unusually volatile property results. Progressive is a large and consistent purchaser of coverage using both traditional reinsurance and ILS markets. We've developed long-term trading relationships with our reinsurance providers, and we strive to keep them well informed about our business results and plans. We currently retain the first $200 million in loss from a single catastrophe event with reinsurance coverage available above that amount up to a limit of $2.6 billion for a single Florida hurricane. We also have $175 million in coverage available for aggregate losses from 2022 catastrophe events in excess of $575 million. While the total coverage limit and per event retention will continue to evolve to fit the growth of our business, we expect to remain a consistent purchaser of reinsurance coverage. Consistent with this history, we were able to fully place our desired coverage at both the January 1 and June 1 renewal events. So let me summarize briefly before we take your questions. As Pat described earlier, a competitive property insurance product is required for Progressive to attract and retain bundled auto and home customers. And this segment represents a huge growth opportunity for Progressive. In the direct channel, our multi-carrier property agency and market-leading quote volume, are driving success. We're investing to improve the profitability in our underwritten property business to support continued Robinson growth in the independent agency channel. Through rate increases, coverage limitations and underwriting eligibility restrictions, we have improved results relative to our competitors. Best-in-class product design will support growth in the less volatile states, while a reduction in our Florida exposure and growth limits in our other states exposed to volatile catastrophe risk will reduce the volatility of our overall property, results, and we will continue to use reinsurance to protect Progressive's capital from extreme events. Thanks again for joining us this morning. We'll now begin our live question-and-answer session. Douglas Constantine : This concludes the previous recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Pat Callahan and Dave Pratt, who can answer questions about the property presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, we have uploaded new PDFs of the presentation, which include all maps and match the webcast feed. These can be pulled from the webcast window and the supporting materials tab in the upper right corner. We apologize for the inconvenience.  We will now take our first question. Operator : And our first question will come from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question is on Personal Auto. So you guys echoed what you said last quarter that the rates are where you need to be in the majority of states, but we haven't really started to see your advertising pick up when you look at the expense ratio that was reported over the quarter. So can you just kind of explain how you're balancing advertising and a return to growth relative to where you are on the pricing side of things? Susan Griffith : Absolutely, Elyse. I think the headline for our private passenger auto is we think trends are encouraging, and it's playing out as we had hoped. So like we said, we had the majority of the rates behind us with a caveat of a few larger states. If you look at the 10-Q, our direct prospects are up 5% this quarter. They were down 11% last quarter, and that is with the spend down 7%, as you've identified. So we're spending less per new prospect with a ton of upside because we still don't have local media on in 19 states. That was 26 states in April. We continue to be able to open up with local advertising. So said another way, competitors are less aggressive due to their profitability challenges. We've seen that play out with some of the Qs that have been reported. And that allows us to acquire leads at a more efficient rate. So we'll continue to spend to get more, but we won't spend unnecessarily to create more business. I think -- I don't usually talk about 1 month in a quarter but I think it's important to know that the prospect volume in June of 2022 was our largest June ever. So we're pretty pleased about incoming volume and excited about continuing that, of course, with the caveat of all things that could happen with -- in this last couple of years. I think another way to look at it in terms of are we positioned well, and this might be a little bit further afield of your question, but we want to look at average written premium. So if you look at average written premium over 2021, it was 0. In 20 -- in first quarter, it was up about 6%, second quarter up about 11%. So those are written numbers and on average, take 4-ish months to earn in or hit the denominator for the combined ratio. The numerator is increasing about 7% to 8% based on frequency and severity changes that we've posted. And so right now, with the exception of a couple of states where we need a fair amount of rate, we believe we'll be able to take modest rate increases. We've talked in the past, with the exception of this year, about taking small bites of the apple. We'd like to get into that because we know that our customers want stable rates. So we feel good about our position. I also feel really great about our continued investment in segmentation. So about 65% of our countrywide premium are on 87. We just rolled out a new product model, 88 in Iowa, and we'll have more information on that. But overall, we feel great. We'll advertise more and open up more local markets as we feel necessary when we have the right rate. And of course, each state is different. But we feel pretty bullish. Elyse Greenspan : And maybe a follow-up to that. You just mentioned modest rate increases from here. When you make that comment, like what are you assuming going forward for severity? How things will trend relative to what we've seen through the first half of the year? And I know frequency, right, was negative in the second quarter, and there was a benefit you guys called out from gas prices. So how are you thinking about severity and frequency from here when you make the comment that you only expect to need to take modest rate increases? Susan Griffith : Well, frequency was down about 8%. We're going to continue to watch that. We also look at vehicle miles traveled. And March through May, it was down about 12%. In June and through July, we're seeing it down a little bit more. We're not quite certain of all the reasons behind it. We believe gas prices might be a little bit of that. Gas prices are fairly inelastic. And we also know through surveys that maybe 15% to 20% of the population are still pretty nervous about going out and about. So they still are fearful of COVID and rightly so. So we look at that. And I think what I'm watching closely, and I don't know that we'll know for a couple of quarters, is how work from home settles in. So I know that -- I talked to a lot of my peers in other industries and there's a lot less people coming in. And could that change after the summer? We don't know. So we're going to watch those 3 things, to look at vehicle, miles traveled and frequency. So I'm going to more watch on those. As far as severity, we look at the Manheim Index for used car prices. That's ticked down a teeny bit, but still at all-time high. So we'll continue to watch that as well as sort of secondary and tertiary things like labor cost in body shops. If techs are making more and if there is less of a supply of people fixing those cars, we know that rentals could extend longer. So again, we can't predict exactly what's going to happen from the severity trends. But we do obviously account for every single data point as we continue to go. And we look at -- when we're looking at our increases, we bake that in. Do you guys want to add anything to that? You good? Does that answer your question, Elyse? Elyse Greenspan : Yes. That does. Operator : And our next question will come from Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Two questions on the Home side, both kind of longer-term questions. I guess, first on the distribution of homeowners, you went through the 3, kind of, captive, independent, direct. You didn't mention this, and maybe that's the answer is, do you see any growth opportunities through, I guess, what I'll call, institutional kind of clients or mortgage service providers, homeowners and things like that for kind of longer-term growth in homeowners? Susan Griffith : Yes. I would say we'd look for any kind of growth. So I know that we've talked -- we've worked with construction builders before. And we've talked about mortgage companies. We've had actually some tests and things that we've done with some mortgage companies, Rocket Mortgage as an example. Do you want to talk a little bit more about that, Pat? Patrick Callahan : Yes. I mean I think the embedded insurance into transactions or life events where people are acquiring the underlying asset, be it in auto, be it a boat, motorcycle, RV or be it a home, presents a shopping opportunity where we absolutely want to position our products to both facilitate the transaction by ensuring the collateral can transfer and be protected provided it's got some outstanding loan or paper on it. But we are starting to work more with, as you mentioned, digital lenders as well as more traditional lenders through independent agents. So it is a growth opportunity for us, and we are constantly looking at how to position our products best, where consumers want them, need them and, frankly, are shopping for them so we can participate in those transactions. Michael Phillips : Okay. Perfect. And then second one, again, kind of longer term on homeowners. In Auto, your Snapshot and Telematics have kind of been all the rage and how that could change the pricing in Auto. Longer term, is there kind of an analogy for that in homeowners? It's something to come and make pricing more accurate that companies could start talking about at some point? It sort of analogies to how we drive our car. Susan Griffith : Yes, I think there are several analogies. Obviously, the ones that Dave talked about was age of roof, et cetera. But water damage is a lot. So if you can have systems in place that alert you to something if you're out of the home, there's water damage. So we look at all of those things in terms of let's think water damage, think of security systems, think of number of people in the household. So I think there's a lot of related items that we've looked at in the past several years and we'll continue to look at to understand kind of that same rate to risk in home as we have in our auto product. Operator : And our next question will come from David Motemaden of Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Tricia, you had said that you don't have local media turned on in 19 states in June. That was down versus 26 states in April. Just wondering how much premium do those 19 states represent where you don't have the local media advertising turned on? And could you just talk about how far away you are from turning those on? What sort of metrics you're looking at? And I guess really just wondering how far away you are from turning those on. Susan Griffith : Yes, each state is a little different animal, and it really depends on when we got the rate that we needed and when it's earning in and when we feel comfortable that we want to grow and grow profitably. So although we wouldn't share the aggregate premium or the states really necessarily for that matter, we'll continue to assess that channel by channel, state by state as we get the rate that we need in order to be adequate. John Sauerland : We can tell you it's well known that there are a few key states where we cannot get rate, and those are significant states. So it's not a small percentage of the U.S. households that is not getting the local media from us. So it's a definite upside for us once we get rate adequate in those states. David Motemaden : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then if I just look at the severity, up 16% year-over-year this quarter, and I understand BI as a part of that. But I'm just wondering if you can maybe just break out how much of that up 16% is being driven by used car prices specifically? Susan Griffith : Yes. A significant part is driven by car prices, total losses, cost to repair. And I talked a little bit about the other parts of that, that go along with that. So parts prices are up around 5%, labor rates are up around 3% and our rental cars are up between 0.5% and 1%. So all those inclusive. A lot of it has to do with car prices, both from a total loss perspective and a used car perspective. And obviously, if the used car prices are up and they're up significantly since pre-COVID, many of those won't be totaled, and the repairs become more expensive. John Sauerland : A rough estimate for the impact of vehicle valuation on severity across our physical damage lines is around half. So that's not exactly the cars, but as a walking around number, it's pretty close. Susan Griffith : Yes. And severity is up 16% overall, but up in the 20-ish percent rate in both collision and PD. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Yaron Kinar of Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : I want to turn back to the homeowners business for a second and maybe tying it to the Robinson. So in the presentation, it kind of show Robinsons making up about 11% of your overall book. Is that generally consistent across the country? Or is the weighting of Robinsons greater in the Southeast and the more volatile states? Susan Griffith : Yes, I would say the weighting of Robinsons are greater in the states that we've grown in more historically from ASI, from ARX. And that's also one of the reasons why we want to be able to expand through the country, not just to derisk the portfolio but to growing Robinsons, which is why we will likely add more Platinum agents in those states and reduce Platinum agents in the states we've had before. Do you want to add anything, Pat? Patrick Callahan : Yes. No. I think that's the primary driver, right? We've been in the auto business for 85 years. We've been expanding our property business over the last 5 to 10 to get to the 47% where we write today. So there's still a mismatch between kind of how long we've been in the market and how long we frankly had competitive property offerings to bundle with our auto offerings. John Sauerland : And just for clarity there, that 11% includes our customers that are bundled with third-party carriers. So we started offering bundles in our direct channel well before the agency penetration, which we achieved with, again, ASI, ARX. So the distribution of the home is a little more aligned with countrywide because of the footprint of our direct business was obviously countrywide from the inception of direct, and we had homeowner coverage pretty much across the country on the direct side, caveating. Of course, there are a few markets that are troublesome for all carriers. So it's a little tighter there. But generally, we're pretty well distributed for Robinsons on the direct side, a little more concentrated on the agency side. Yaron Kinar : That's helpful clarification. And I guess my follow-up to that would be then on the goodwill impairment. Is that purely a function of higher-than-expected loss ratio? Or is it also a function of in reaction to that loss ratio slowing down growth in those more volatile states? And I guess what I'm trying to get to also with this question is, I'm assuming that as you're looking to grow in the less volatile states, you're going to encounter separate competition from national carriers that were probably less interested in penetrating the Southeast and in the volatile states. Susan Griffith : Yes. I think I'll start with the latter part of your question. Yes, I think the competition will be greater in those states. The goodwill impairment was based on just the significant catastrophic losses that we've had. And when we purchased ARX, we had certain assumptions on combined ratios. And of course, we have a CAT load. It's far surpassed that, as Dave talked about. So it was that. When we -- we periodically look at goodwill. When we looked at it, we took into account the severe catastrophes where we're concentrated as well as just some recent legislation in Florida.  As you know, we wanted to not renew about 60,000 policies. There's some new legislation that requires us or where we'll ask our customers if they had a new roof or the life of a roof is at least 5 years, we will renew them, which will be good because that means they've got a new roof and it's something we'd want to write. But we -- so we're not sure exactly how many of those 60,000 we will not renew. We took that into account when we were looking at the impairment. Operator : And our next question will come from Andrew Kligerman, Credit Suisse. Andrew Kligerman : Starting with the bundling in the Robinsons channel. Independent agents, just by their nature, have relationships with numerous carriers. And so my question is, how does Progressive break into that bundling effort? Maybe tying in pricing into the equation, do you have to provide a significant discount? And could you give a little color around that? Susan Griffith : Yes. I mean one of the reasons we purchased ARX was to have access to those bundled customers in the independent agent channel. We know independent agents love our service, love our ability to handle claims well. But what would happen is they would have to write with someone else that they wanted to bundle. So that was a big effort. We are very broadly distributed in our independent agent channel, have over 40,000 independent agents. So what we did was really try to have a few -- or more of a scarcity model on the Platinum program with certain agents, that we wanted to have them write the Robinsons, our auto home bundle, be the #1, 2 or 3 carrier in their firm. So that's sort of how we look at that. We also then had to make some changes, whether it was compensation changes in the form of higher commissions as well as writing 12-month auto policies to align with those 12-month home policies. So there's about 4,000 Platinum agents across the country. We work well with them. They consider us very preferred in their firms, and that's why we want to make sure that we're adequately priced on both auto and home to continue to grow with those agents. In fact, I was just with -- we have an agency council that we had an outgoing group and an incoming group, and we talked a lot about efforts to grow, and I'm bullish about being able to do that obviously in the right venues. Andrew Kligerman : So attrition, discounting -- material discounts. And any color on that part of the equation? Susan Griffith : Well, we rate to have our target profit margin. You get a multi-product discount with the -- when you have multi-products. But we don't -- I don't know that we ever really talk specifically about those amounts. Patrick Callahan : No. To win in the agency channel, we have to have a viable value proposition for both the clients of the agency and for the agents themselves. So on the client side, we have to have competitive and stable pricing, we have to have a quality product and we have to have really competitive pricing. And that's where, as Dave mentioned, we've got work to do to expand the perils that we write, improve the segmentation and, frankly, just have more competitive pricing for the agent's clients. And then on the agent side, we have to have great ease of use and competitive compensation for the effort it takes to write a policy with Progressive. And that's where, as Tricia mentioned, the Platinum program has competitive offering of compensation for our agents that pays more based on how much and what quality of business or type of business they're placing with us over time. And then we're known for ease of use through great systems and technology over many, many years. So not explicitly buying market share or, as you said, buying shelf space for a proxy. We are competing based on a quality of a competitive product for the clients in the agency channel and our value proposition for the agents who sell it. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. Very, very helpful. And then just with regard to the auto side. Non-rate actions this quarter, any color that you could provide around that magnitude? What types of non-rate actions you've been taking and plan to take? Susan Griffith : Yes, it's really dependent on each state. So in some states, we've had some underwriting and bill plan restrictions. Obviously, an easier way to go is what I've talked about in terms of turning local media off. And those are, for the most part, what we use to try to stall growth a little bit when we don't have adequate rates. Operator : And our next question will come from Josh Shanker of Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : In the prepared presentation, you made a comment that the average PLE of a Robinson was up 3x that of a Sam. I remember from a presentation maybe in 2013 or 2014, you made the comment that the lifetime value of a Robinson was probably 4x to 5x that of a Sam. You've had a decade of experience now. And obviously, in this period of time, you've seen in disruptive pricing, how quickly the Sams leave and the Robinsons stay. Can you talk about that PLE statistic versus the lifetime value statistic? It would suggest there's a multiplier to lifetime value, maybe there's ticket size or maybe you've updated your thoughts on the value proposition of the different segments? John Sauerland : Sure. The lifetime value calculation would include not only the PLE difference but the average premium difference. So we target common margins across segments of the business. So for -- across the auto program, we're targeting similar margins, but different segments have different average premiums as well as policy life expectancy and you sort of multiply those together, and that's how you come to a bigger lifetime value. Joshua Shanker : And that 4 to 5 is still probably close to accurate? John Sauerland : That's -- probably. Susan Griffith : I think, generally, we have to look -- we have to go back and look at the specific math, but I would say probably generally. Joshua Shanker : All right. And thinking about the next couple of years and looking back to maybe '16, '17, '18, can we talk about the efficacy of a national ad campaign strategy versus targeted paid search spend and whatnot. At the early stages, when your pricing is adequate and the rest of the market pricing is still trying to play catch up, what does that mean for the marketing strategy? Do you need to spend to get customers to come to Progressive? Or is there a period where the customers elect to come because of your brand recognition and whatnot, where the acquisition costs are lower in the early stages of a hard market? Susan Griffith : I think you do a little bit of both. I mean I think a lot of it depends on what the competition is doing. So I talked -- when Elyse asked the question, I talked about efficiently acquiring leads has to do with the competition in the digital space. So we -- the national brand is really important. It is one of our pillars -- our strategic pillars. So we want to be the brand that talks about savings protection. We want to be known that gives consideration. We want to be on the short list.  And then the local marketing really through most of online search. That's a nice lever to be able to turn off and on when we want to grow. But again, that's very dependent on supply and demand and what's happening in the industry with our competition. So I feel like we're in a good position now. Again, we have some states we want to turn on. John talked about a couple of large states we'd love to get adequate rates in so we can continue to grow. But we feel like we're in a good position. We have some levers, and we've had a tremendous amount of growth in the last 5 years.  In fact, we've added 7 million PIFs and grown Auto PIFs 70%. So -- and that was coming off the last hard market. I'm not going to say that we're going to grow that same amount in the next couple of years, but that's always been our playbook to position ourselves, to get out ahead of rate, have a lot of different levers on marketing and then move as quickly as we can. John Sauerland : Josh, if I might add a little bit there. I think that's a great question. And I think the answer is plays to our strengths. So if you look at the percentage of folks coming to shop at Progressive that we would attribute to mass media from the kind of the time frame that you talked about to today, it has shifted a lot to much more specifically attributable media and we are great at analyzing the data fairly real time and making decisions very quickly to be able to redeploy dollars to go to the most effective way of bringing people in.  So I think it's because of technology and the data available increasingly in a real-time basis that is allowing us to get more and more of our media spend really, really effective. Mass media, as Tricia mentioned and our brand are obviously the first step that's crucial to have that brand awareness, but then the agility and the data and analysis that goes into really targeting, again, I think, plays to our strengths and has allowed us to continue to grow advertising spend and be super efficient. Operator : And our next question will come from Tracy Benguigui of Barclays. Tracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. I didn't hear my full name. My first question, 2 quarters ago, you were telling me you have a first -- when you have a first-party total loss collision, you're going to pay that immediately. So you'll recognize the elevated cost of new and used cars in real time. But on a third-party perspective, there's often a delay in subrogation. Can you provide an update on the life cycle of claims? How you feel about the strength of reserves for claims that you were notified last year that may only be settling now? And I guess, ultimately, I'm just trying to understand if you think Auto is becoming more of a medium tail line these days from short tail? Susan Griffith : Yes, I would say it's still a short tail. I think in the last couple of years, when you look at the data on subrogation from a property damage, whether it's incoming or outbound, there's been delays for many different reasons. And probably more recently, in the last couple of quarters has been on staffing. You've looked at the unemployment rate, and I know myself, along with many of my peers have wanted to really get ahead of staffing, and it's been a little bit more challenging. Personally at Progressive, we feel like we're in a really good position right now. I wouldn't necessarily have said that a couple of quarters ago. So the timing depends on when you're able to settle that claim and then, of course, get the paperwork to the other company and of course, for us, either we're paying out to them or they're paying out to us. So I think it's still short tail. I think that will -- hopefully, we expect it will level out at some point when staffing is normalized across the industry, and we get back to sort of claims as usual. I will say that, that is an important piece because anytime that you can get salvage or subrogation settled more timely, that hits the bottom line. In fact, I was talking to our claims President a few weeks ago, and we feel like we are very adequately staffed in claims, and we're actually going to move some people over to subrogation and salvage towards -- in the near future until the end of the year to get some of those closed in a more timely fashion. Tracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. So can I infer from your comments on staffing that you feel good about the strength of your reserves or claims that you were notified last year only settling now? Susan Griffith : Yes, I feel very comfortable. Gary, you can comment on this. We have our head of actuary here. But I feel very good about our strength of reserves. To date, we're about 0.6 points on the CRM favorable. We were favorable in this quarter, and we feel really good. And part of our reserving that we look into, and Gary, you can talk about this, is we have a robust role forward process where we take into account in existing and new features, inflationary factors. Gary Traicoff : Sure. Thanks, Tricia. Yes. So good question. To Tricia's point, overall, we feel very good about our reserves, right? Our goal is always adequate reserves, with minimal variation and our philosophy has been very consistent over the long term. We have developed unfavorably year-to-date, about 0.6 points on the combined ratio; Personal Auto, about 0.3 point; and Commercial, about 2%. That's in line with where we've been in the past at midyear. And if you look historically, we've ended the year generally within 0.1 or 0.2 points.  To Tricia's point -- and we do have a paper that we publish on our investor site, so you could read more detail about our methodology. But we will look at about 25% or a little bit over 25% of the reserves monthly. And then on the other 75%, we have an inflation factor that we apply. So if any new features come in or existing features, they automatically go up with inflation based off severity.  As features age, as they become attorney-repped, et cetera, we have automatic adjustments for those. So we feel that we've kept up very well with the rising costs. And to your point, Tracy, we have seen somewhat of a slowdown relative to closing claims compared to the past, just with everything going on over the last couple of years. But because of that mechanism we have that we can adjust as they age, as they become attorney-repped, et cetera, naturally, we've been able to keep up just as we would have intended. Tracy Dolin-Benguigui: That's great color. Also one of your large competitors is no longer selling auto insurance in California. So I was wondering what your appetite is these days to write business in California. Susan Griffith : We would love to write more business in California. It is the most populous state. Unfortunately, right now, we don't -- we aren't able to get adequate rates. And once we're able to do that, we are open for business and we'll write as much as we can. Right now, there's about 30 auto programs representing close to half the California market that have rate increases pending. We have 1 pending in one of our auto programs from January, we'll likely have at least another one in the near future. So if we can get the rate that we need to be adequately rated, we want to write all the business we can. The moratorium on rate increases in California is unfortunate because we don't think it serves the consumers of California, and you only have a couple of things to do. And there's a couple of levers that we talked about, and we'll use those tactics to slow growth, but we want to be a part of the future California market, and we'll do what we can to get there. Tracy Dolin-Benguigui: So when you mentioned that it doesn't serve California consumer as well, could you envision a full market growing in California for auto? Is it -- if auto really becomes unavailable? Susan Griffith : What? I'm sorry, what -- could you repeat your question? I didn't hear that. Tracy Dolin-Benguigui: Yes. You were saying that the rules there don't really serve consumers well. And if there is lack of appetite by auto insurers to write business in California, do you think there would be a residual market created, let's say workers comp? Susan Griffith : Got it. Got it. Okay. Patrick Callahan : Yes. It may not -- we've seen residual markets come and go in various states over many decades. And as you note, generally, when there's not a willing voluntary private market participation, there has to be a backstop given the mandatory insurance requirements. So could there be growth of a residual market in California? Absolutely. And there, it's up to the regulator to decide if that's a path that they want to go down.  I think we've seen historically states like New York, where it grew rapidly. And then with voluntary participation, there was better options, more competition and consumers benefit when there's availability that brings competition that drives affordability. And carriers compete on both price and service whereas the backstop residual markets, unfortunately, typically provide a minimum level of both. So is it possible? Absolutely. Is there precedent? Yes, we've seen markets where voluntary participation shrinks and residual markets grow. And therefore, it could happen in California. Operator : And our next question will come from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Tricia, first question, I think I heard you make the comment that you won't say you'll grow the next 2 years like you did 5 years after the last hard market we had in 2016. When we think about the mid-teens type of PIF growth you had coming out of that last hard market, could you just kind of compare this hard market to that? Like what are some of the relative challenges? Susan Griffith : Well, I think -- and my point, Ryan, was more of it's a really big ship now. So it's a much bigger ship than it was back in 2016. So as a percentage basis, growth growing 70% in Auto is going to be tough. The bottom line is we will grow as fast as we possibly can at or below our target profit margins. And that's what we're going to do as the hard market continues. It's sort of hard to foreshadow what will happen right now because I feel like we're right in the midst of it. And we have the rate that we're earning in, yet to earn in and more advertising to open up and then, of course, a lot of it depends on what the competition is doing.  So the reason for saying that was just that we have grown a tremendous amount and just any company when you get the size of us, it's harder to grow as quickly on a percentage basis. Ryan Tunis : Makes sense. And then I guess my follow-up is just trying to figure out what I'm missing on thinking about some of the rate adequacy comments. So it sounds like you've got about 7 points of rate earn in and out and you feel like you're done with -- you still feel like you're done in most of the big actions you have to take. But I think you mentioned that repair cost is still adding 3 to 5 points. Frequency is, I think, 8 points lower today than it was a year ago, and we're in a work from home environment then, too. So like is your rate adequacy comment all sort of backward looking? Or like have you started thinking a little bit about what do you think prospective loss trend might be in 2023? Susan Griffith : I mean we're always thinking about the future, but we got out ahead of rates. So if you think about 2021, we had about 8 points and most of that was in the second half. We have 9 points year-to-date with the 5 points earning in. So I feel -- that's why I said we may have modest rate increases. And again, there are a couple of states where we need a lot more rate, and that's on average. So when I talk about the 8 points, 9 points and the 5 yet to earn in, that is very different depending on different states, but on average. So that's where we feel good. Likely, we'll have to take some modest rate increases as we watch the trends, but we will do that as we see the trends unfold. Ryan Tunis : And I guess my last one is just -- and it was a comment in the 10-Q about really focusing on retention, which makes sense given some of the PLE decline. But I was wondering if -- is there a strategy here where you feel it makes more sense to pass through a little bit less rate on the renewal book and maybe focus less on new business? Is that why you feel good about storing the 96% that the strategy is more sort of retention focused than new app focused at this point. I was just -- I just wanted to kind of clarify that comment in the Q. Susan Griffith : Yes. Yes our -- where we want to grow is PIF growth. And so that includes both the new and renewal business. And retention has always been our holy grail. You pay a lot to get a customer in and you want to keep them through stable rates and great service. Obviously, when you have to crank up rates a lot when trends change dramatically, you're going to lose people. So we knew that would happen. And -- but we want to keep everybody we can at or below our target margins for the renewal business. And then new business, obviously, we want to come in because we want to take advantage of a competitive market when others are raising rates after we've raised rates. So both are important. PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth, and that will take a longer time. New business is more precise, more day-to-day. PIF growth will take a little bit longer since we've had some degradation in PLE, and we're looking forward to starting to ramp up PIF growth. Operator : And our next question will come from Derek Han of KBW. Dong Yoon Han : Just wanted to follow up on the last question. How should we think about the time frame for reaccelerating PIF growth, especially as you pull back in property? Susan Griffith : I think it will be a little bit different, likely in the different channels. And I don't want to signal exactly when we'll see it grow. A lot will depend on the caveats that we talked about with states opening up, media opening up and getting our rates stable. I don't want to signal that. I'll let you know as it unfolds. John Sauerland : I'll just offer. It's also very dependent upon the competitive market. So we've seen a few competitors report second quarter, combined with over 100. We have 1 competitor who is reporting their rate increases monthly. We see another place where in large markets, we see very mature competitors taking multiple double-digit increases in very short periods. So it's an environment that's pretty hard. And if competitors continue to take aggressive action, we're going to be able to get back to PIF growth much faster than if they don't, both obviously on the new side. But the retention is not only a function of our rate increases, it's relative to what our consumers can find out in the marketplace when they go shop and if competitors have all raised rates as well, then our retention will improve.  So it's really difficult to project. I think all of our product managers are taking the right actions at the local level. And as we continue to note, if we can get rate adequate in some key markets, we'll be in even better position to grow. Dong Yoon Han : Okay. That's really helpful. And then Tricia, when you say that most rate increases are behind you, does that mean rate filings or implemented rate changes or something else? Susan Griffith : Yes. It just means that the majority of the rate increases that we were able to get, again, the caveat with a couple of states, are on The Street. And then that's why I wanted to try to walk through a little bit about how we think about them earning in. And so when you have the rate, it's going to take some time to earn in. And we feel good about that we're in the heart of that and that we still have 5 more points to earn in as we speak. Dong Yoon Han : Got it. And then if I could just squeeze in one last question. Does your Personal Auto pricing assume that currently elevated overall inflation rates are going to filter into the medical cost components? Susan Griffith : Yes. We look at inflation differently with medical and physical damage. But we see BI trends up a bit, general damages specifically with attorney-repped. And of course, we look at medical inflation as well when we look at our rates for each line coverage, whether it's medical payments or bodily injury. Operator : And our next question will come from Mike Zaremski of BMO. Michael Zaremski : Great. First question, I'm curious, in light of your experience with ARX over the past years, when we think about Progressive's growth strategies in both on the commercial BOP side specifically, and I guess in home as well, has that experience change your view on M&A in terms of kind of large-scale ARX's all in over $1 billion. Does that change your view on kind of where M&A fits in accelerating those growth strategies? Susan Griffith : I think we always learn every time there's an acquisition, and we haven't been a big acquirer over the years, I think we've learned a lot of lessons. I think any new product that you go into, you learn. And so when we went on -- when we went direct, we didn't make money for quite some time because we were learning. We do the same with every new product. But I think -- I look at acquisitions more of is there some technology that we want? Is there some access we want? So ARX was access. Is this an easy way to continue our portfolio? So that's one of the reasons why we acquired Protective on the commercial line side because we knew we had the acumen to look at smaller fleets. They have medium to larger fleets. So that was something that was important to us as we grow into the fleet program. That's really how I look at it.  I think acquisitions, if you don't do them very often, you're always going to learn a lot. One of the things that we have built since then is an area of the company where we look at M&A and we look at what we need in order to be successful in that. And that's within our strategy team. And so we're getting our arms much better around that. I think that's what ARX taught us is that you have to have probably a lot more investments early on in order to get your arms around the product. And we're doing that with Protective. I'm very excited about the Protective acquisition, where we're at. It was much different than ARX just as a learning and how we can leverage that much more quickly. Michael Zaremski : So I guess as a follow-up, Tricia. On the commercial BOP side, given you're entering a lot of new states and some new products, do you feel comfortable with your level of expertise? Susan Griffith : Not at this point. We'll get there. The first, we know -- first, wanted to create the BOP products, and we went really small. So if you think about small business, it's usually defined as 100 employees or less. We're at 20 employees or less. We're very, very surgical to understand that rate to risk and we wanted to expand it out to the states. So we're in 37 states. We're learning every day. As we learn more, just like we have in many parts of our commercial business, we'll be able to expand that. So we get more and more comfort every single day. Michael Zaremski : Okay. Great. And my follow-up is pivoting to the -- to your presentation today. I think you mentioned over $1 billion of home premiums written on unaffiliated carrier balance sheets. Just curious, maybe you could shed some light on those partnerships. And just -- is some of that business in states you'd like to grow in and might be kind of up for grabs over time as you expand your appetite in certain states? Susan Griffith : Yes. We've had what we've called Progressive Advantage Agency for many, many years, and we continue to build a stable of carriers that can serve many different value of homes. And some of those are -- many of those are in places where we're going to grow. But the partnerships are really incredible, and they want to grow with us, and it's all about the right rate at the right time. So we continue to grow there. We've put it online with our HomeQuote Explorer, where we have a buy button in -- I forget how many states. John Sauerland : 38 for Progressive Home. Susan Griffith : 38 for Progressive Home. So yes, we continue to invest in there. It's nice to have the partners to work with. And again, we've always been about choice and we want to make sure if our rate isn't the best, that we have opportunities to be able to have our customers still bundle with Progressive Auto and those partnerships. Douglas Constantine : That appears to have been our final question. And so that concludes our event. Tonya, I'll hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : Certainly. This concludes the Progressive Corporation's Second Quarter Investor Event. Information about the replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Progressive Corporation's Third Quarter Investor Event. The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I will turn the event over to Mr. Constantine. Doug Constantine : Thank you, Austin, and good morning. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60-minute schedule for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions maybe be found at investors.progressive.com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first, second and third quarter of 2022, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements, and other discussions of the challenges we face. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. When our customers interact with us they're often doing so on their worst day, maybe their vehicle was just stolen, maybe they were injured in a car accident or their property damage was analyzed. This fact comes into even sharper focus during a major catastrophe such as Hurricane Ian. While watching the footage of devastation, my heart went out to all those who were affected by the storm. For millions it was truly their worst day. And I'm proud of the part Progressive plays to help people recover from such a calamitous event. Within hours after the storm, Progressive had over 1,500 people ready to help our customers start to rebuild their lives. And while we cannot always replace what was lost, our people are in place to make it as easy as possible for our customers to return to normalcy. Thank you to all the Progressive customers who trust us to make their worst day more manageable. In my letter, I shared some of the Herculean efforts that our employees were making on behalf of our customers and there are many more where that came from. Needless to say, I'm very proud of so many. While, Hurricane Ian was the largest single event in the third quarter, it was not the whole story. Excluding catastrophe losses, our third quarter company-wide combined ratio improved 1.9 points year-over-year and illustrates the significant work we've done to combat the effects of inflation and working towards achieving our goal of an underwriting margin of at least 4%, specifically in personal auto. As we stated after the first quarter, with the exception of a few markets, our major personal auto rate revisions are behind us, so we continue to be vigilant and adjust rates as our loss experience develops. In the third quarter, we increased personal auto rates in 20 states at average of about 5% per state for a total countrywide premium impact of plus 2%. The third quarter rate action brings our countrywide year-to-date rate increases to nearly 12%. We continue to closely monitor frequency and severity trends to ensure we stay true to our stated goal of profit before growth. So we have continued to take rate. We believe we took rate earlier than the industry, which initially negatively impacted volume, but more recently has created opportunities for growth. Consumer shopping and quoting has increased more than 20% in both the agency and direct channels. In fact in both channels we had the best July, August and September in our company's history for quote volume. This prospect growth is despite a lower acquisition expense ratio as compared to 2021, allowing us to be a beneficiary, as competitors have pulled back on marketing spend. This combination of lower competitor spend and our continued advancement of the science of media planning and buying, led to an incredible increase in efficiency in our media spend and has helped propel this quarter's growth. Auto quote growth coupled with continued improvement in conversion, as our competitors raised rates, led to auto new application growth of 20% in the quarter including the highest August and highest September combined to channel new application volume that we've seen in the company's history. Total personal auto year-over-year PIF growth is still negative, but we've now seen several months of sequential monthly PIF growth led by the growth in the direct channel and flattening in the agency channel. The sequential growth has been bolstered not only by new application growth but signs of improving retention. In last quarter's call, we spent considerable time talking about our property business and efforts we are taking to return to profitable growth. The losses incurred from Hurricane Ian further highlight the need to shift our mix to less volatile state. As expected, PIF growth in properties slowed in the quarter, as we make progress in this multiyear goal. Our assets continue unabated with rate and non-rate actions, as we work towards a mix that is more reflective of the market.  Given this volatile backdrop, it's only natural that the insurance industry would be facing questions regarding capital. So we thought it would be useful to quickly summarize our strong capital position. As discussed in our annual report, we view our capital position as consisting of multiple layers. First, in our insurance operating subsidiaries, we maintain adequate surplus to support growing as fast as we can at or below a 96 combined ratio. Our extreme contingency layer includes capital in excess of regulatory capital that ensures on a model basis, a less than 100 and 200 probability that we will need to raise additional capital. We have $4.2 billion that we held at quarter end in a non-insurance subsidiary of the holding company level, which is well access of that contingency layer and is highly liquid due to mostly being comprised of short-term securities and treasuries. While we have incurred temporary losses in our investment portfolio due to the significant move in interest rates, our fixed portfolio is extremely conservative with over half of the portfolio in cash or treasuries and a portfolio duration at the end of the quarter at 2.7 years. Throughout the year, we have taken proactive measures to prepare the portfolio for various scenarios by reducing interest rate, credit and equity risk. Another proactive measure we took was to raise $1.5 billion of 5, 10- and 30-year debt in March at an average 3% interest rate. Due to the highly uncertain outlook, we felt it was prudent to have extra capital at what we viewed as very attractive borrowing rates. As we sit, we have no near-term bond maturities that we have to address in this higher interest rate environment, the combination of the borrowing along with significant interest -- increase in interest rates have been the primary drivers in moving our debt to total capital ratio over 30% at September month end to 30.2%. We expect underwriting gains changes in the value of our bond portfolio as bonds approach maturity and investment income to bring us back below 30% in time. We are currently taking no additional actions to bring the ratio below 30% and have no near-term plan or need for raising further capital. Again, thank you for joining us and now we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The question comes from the line -- our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse please proceed. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on loss adjustment expenses. I know you guys had called them out in reference to your property book in September and not in reference to the auto book. I'm just trying to get a sense and there were some comments in the queue. It doesn't seem like LAE is a high component of auto losses. And the reason I ask is it does look like the underlying loss ratio did trend higher in September and that does run a little counter to some of your comments right that it seems like you're at where you need from a rating perspective in the majority of states. So I'm hoping you can just help me kind of tie that together? Tricia Griffith : Yeah, absolutely. Let me start Elyse with the LAE. So when you think about vehicles, which I would include auto and special lines, there's not much incremental LAE when a catastrophe happens. So for years and years we built up a CAT team and it's now commensurate to the size that we are. So when a CAT happens, really the incremental LAE on that part is travel costs, hotel costs, et cetera. And then during the year those people are able to do other things. So as an example in Ian right now they're in Florida working those files. But then as that slows down, if there aren't other weather related events or catastrophes, they might go work in the salvage department to work through that salvage. So it's not hugely incremental. We called it out on the property side, because that is a little bit more incremental on that $25 million of the $200 million of the reinsurance. And that was because we do use some independent appraiser\u2019s adjusters to help with the property claim. So that's the reason why we called it out. And that will evolve. We wanted to assess a certain point for LAE and a certain point for loss, and that will evolve as the storm developed. In terms of where we're at, I do feel very comfortable. Like I said in most markets there are a few that we don't have the rate we need. And we're going to continue to take smaller bites of the apple, which is what we prefer to do and that's why I wanted to outline that in my letter and opening comments. But here's how I would think about where we're at from the perspective of adequate rates. And this is a very high level. So you\u2019d have to think about this in terms of new versus renewal, channel, et cetera. So our frequency is down 9%, our severity is up 13% in aggregate. So think about a 4% net loss ratio. Our average written premium is up 8%. So you want to think of that maybe about 6.5 points to earn in. So when I think about that I feel good about where we're at again. We're watching inflation very closely. But we do feel, I'm confident that in most venues we have the rate we need to grow and we'll try to propel that growth where we can and slow where we don't believe our rates are adequate. Does that help? Elyse Greenspan : Yeah. But as a follow-up to that was there something in September just because the underlying loss ratio did look like not that it only trended up from August, but it trended up from last September. So was there something just related to losses running hot in September relative to last year? Tricia Griffith : Nothing in particular and this is the curse of releasing monthly earnings. I wouldn't look into one month and put much into that. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks. And then my second question as we think about getting to the end of the year and I know you guys mentioned this in your Q as well, we hear about used car prices coming down and I know that was what started to lead to the elevated severity last year. Have you guys ever broken out what component of your loss costs are driven off of used car prices, or can you just help us think through that, and the benefit that you guys could see as those values come down? Tricia Griffith : Well, we look at the components. But what I would say is, although the wholesale prices are trending down, they're still at all-time high. So we will continue to watch that. And I think especially, we will watch it based on the fact that there are a lot of total losses that have happened in Florida with Hurricane Ian, so that could even increase demand. So, we try to break out as much as we can. When we look at severity, we look more at overall loss cost in terms of size of vehicles, labor rates, parts prices, rental price, et cetera. So, there's a lot of components that go into that. But, we're going to wait and see and continue to watch the Manheim Index and watch what happens after Ian and if we -- and we'll see that in our severity trends. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you for the color. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. Operator : Our next question is with Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Michael, your line is open. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning. Tricia, I wonder if you could peel back some of the layers on the frequency still favorable, in fact looks against even more so than prior quarters. I guess, can you talk about what you're seeing in your book for maybe work-from-home trends and sustainability of that? And kind of what you're baking into current pricing for how much you're baking on that to continue in your current price levels? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Sure Michael. So, in quarter three with our snapshot data, we saw vehicle miles traveled down about 11%. Previously, it was down about 14%. What we're seeing is commute miles have stayed flat. And during the quarter, we saw that traveled miles. So think of those defined as queuing from your home, 100 miles queuing from your home. So we think that might have been based on some lower gas prices, people were doing some last-minute travel because of those prices in their cars in -- during before Labor Day visiting grandma or whatever, and that usually involves less losses. So, come it's more congestion, you're going to have more losses. So we think about it that way. I don't think we'll know where frequency sort of trend long-term, until probably a quarter or two, because I know a lot of companies said, they were returning to work after Labor Day. So you're thinking in September. So what we'd like to do is, wait at least a couple of quarters to see if that sort of bottomed out and look at that pre-pandemic to 2019. And then we'll feel I think a little bit more confident, because I know a lot of companies have gone back and forth on how often their employees need to work. And I think a lot of it will depend too on COVID and flu, et cetera. So we're going to wait a few quarters, but that's what we're seeing right now on our UBI data. John Sauerland : Okay and one clarification to that. So Tricia mentioned frequency or vehicle miles traveled was down 11% that was referencing the pre-pandemic period. So when we think about vehicle mile travel, we continue to measure it relative to pre-COVID and interestingly, frequency is down a bit more than vehicle miles traveled and that's continued for quite some time has not yet come back. And we believe to Tricia's comments that, that is due to some degree to the mix of miles traveled. Michael Phillips : Yes. Perfect. Okay. Thanks for that. I guess, can you talk about -- used car prices coming down and how that impacts, I guess the mix of your strategy of kind of either fixing cars versus salvaging cars and how that -- I don't know if you talked about the impact of that last year when there was just a reverse of that when our prices were so high. So any impact of -- what's the impact of that on the loss ratio last year of changing the strategy because of how high prices were and how that might change as we go forward from here? Tricia Griffith : Well, I don't know that we changed the strategy. It just happened to be that cars were more expensive, so it took more to total them. And then we did total them part -- components were more expenses. So we'll always look at the actual cash value of the vehicle and then the cost repair, which could take into account rental, et cetera. So that's how we always look at it. And then you overlay the actual cost of the cars whether new or used when you make those assessments. John Sauerland : Just a little more clarification on that sense since Lisa had a similar question. When we think about the increase in severity for physical damage coverages, so property damage collision, et cetera walking around numbers about half of that increase is from the increase in used car values. That is both when we total a car but as Tricia was mentioning you total fewer cars, because the car is worth more. So you're going to -- your estimates on repairs are going to go up as a result of used car prices as well. So it's a little tough to tease out but sort of walking around is probably half of the severity increases we've seen physical damage coverages are due to the increase in values. Tricia Griffith : Great point. Michael Phillips : All right. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question is with Mike Zaremski from BMO. Mike, your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey, great. Good morning. Sticking to the auto severity side of the equation, lots of good color, thank you so far. Maybe curious if you could offer any color and whether there's any trends you're seeing on the bodily and reside or maybe just severity ex kind of used car prices more broadly? Tricia Griffith : So on the bodily injury side, Mike? Mike Zaremski : Correct. Tricia Griffith : Yes. We've actually seen the bodily injury has been fairly stable in the kind of 6% to 8% range. And of course it went up after the pandemic that was based on more attorney representation, more soft tissue attorney representation not necessarily litigation and then just the overall social inflation. But we're seeing that level out in the 6% to 8% range. Mike Zaremski : And that's kind of considered kind of a more normal range when you think about versus pre-pandemic levels, there's kind of no secular trend or something that we should be thinking about moving around there materially? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, it's hard to say because during the pandemic, there was little or none and then I think it went up pretty significantly. So yes, I think that would be accurate to say in that range of pre-pandemic. Mike Zaremski : Okay. I guess, just going back to frequency again just curious you guys are now able to give us some great stats on vehicle miles traveled and what you're seeing commuter versus maybe non-commuter trips? And kind of just curious does the data you have today does it allow you to -- Progressive to be any more agile, or do you guys do things definitely when setting rates today versus maybe when you think back to the 2016, 2017 frequency spike cycle that you feel you can take advantage or be more opportunistic, or is it still kind of -- nothing has changed much? It's very tough to figure out frequency and I'm thinking too much about this? Tricia Griffith : No, I think you're thinking -- well, we're thinking about it all the time. The hard part is -- there's so many macroeconomic trends that affects frequency. You saw that with gas prices. And so, I think there's a lot of things that we constantly look at in our models. I think, the best thing, when we think of pricing for our customers, is to encourage them to use snapshot. And that's us a big approach for people, who want to be able to save money, especially if they are not driving. So, we've seen an uptick in the take rate and our mix of business, new business in UBI. And we think that's great because, if consumers cars are sitting in their garages, more often than not, they should get a discount as long as when they're driving that they're driving safely. Mike Zaremski : And are those Snapshot customers, just as my final follow-up, slightly more profitable over time than the non-Snapshot customers? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Yes. No, not necessarily. John Sauerland : We continue to price as accurately as we can with the data we have. So, as our snapshot database continues to grow and we move to a continuous monitoring model, we have an increasing data set to work with and an ongoing data set to work with, because we have continuous monitoring. And I think, in eight states now and are continuing to roll that across the country. Early on with Snapshot, we weren't pricing completely to the curve, if you will. And as consumer adoption, as Tricia noted, has gotten to be really good and growing. We've been more and more comfortable with pricing to the full curve, which is the best accurate segmentation we can get. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Alex, your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi. Question I had was just on the strategy of pivot into growth and pricing. When I think about the timing of when you all sort of looked at it and decided that, you could take maybe the foot off the accelerator on price a little bit, feeling better about your adequacy. Since that time, there's been some benefit from gas prices and frequency that may go away. And there's also, I think been increases to sort of the non-used car pieces of severity and medical costs and wage inflation sort of impacting things, is being able to stick to that and try to drive growth here. I mean, is there a risk that those things force you to change course? I mean, how should I think about that risk of sort of different severity items and getting a little worse, since you started down that road on the strategy? Tricia Griffith : Yes. We have had a long-term strategy to grow as fast as we can at/or below a 96 combined ratio. That will continue. That's something that's worked for us 85 years or at least since we went public in 1971, we first started talking about the 96. So, we will do that. We watch trends very, very diligently and take actions quickly when -- and decisively when we need to. Unfortunately, in this last year, we've had to take rate increases that we normally do to take. We don't like to take huge rate increases unlike we have. Like, we talk about smaller bites of the apple, which we believe we're now in a position to take as things change in each venue. So, our strategy hasn't changed. We're going to try to grow as fast as we can. Obviously, with the hurricane we're over 96, so we have a few months to go and we're going to continue to try to leverage this really unique opportunity to get growth while still maintaining our 96 combined ratio. In fact, in September, we had our lowest cost per sale since 2017. So, we're seeing really the advantage of the -- because our competitors aren't advertising as much and are taking rate, we're seeing some really great ambient growth. So, we're going to try to pull all the levers to do that to grow as fast as we can but we do have the 96 that we believe we always talk about profit over growth. Alex Scott : Got it. That's helpful. And could you help us frame the potential impact from higher reinsurance costs as we think through a hard market in reinsurance? And I guess probably impacts you more on the property side. And just looking through some of the commentary on your how quickly you can non-renew and sort of do some of the pivoting that you wanted to do. It sounds like some of that's had to slow down for regulatory reasons. What does that all mean when we think through reinsurance cost potentially going up? Tricia Griffith : I'll have Dave talk about reinsurance but I'll hit on the sort of de-risking the book. I will say that reinsurance costs we are able to pass on so that is one benefit. But clearly that market is hardening. So, we talked about our goal of de-risking the portfolio specifically moving 60,000 policies out of Florida -- homes out of Florida sort of mitigate that risk. It takes a while. So we talked about that last year. We had a 90-day notification period to our customers. So, in earnest we started non-renewing those 60,000 in May of 2022. And then there was a special legislative session and there was a Senate Bill that allowed us -- allows homeowners to renew their policy as long as they could prove through inspection that they had at least five years of useful life left on their roof, which is great because that's okay with us and at least we know the rate to risk when we know how old the roof is. So, we knew that there would be less than 60,000 policies and it would take a little bit longer. And then, of course, enter Hurricane Ian and there's been a moratorium on non-renews and cancellations from September 28th to November 28th, so we won't be able to not renew any. Until after that is lifted those executive orders are lifted. So, suffice it to say that it's going to take us a little bit longer to de-risk and we get that and we'll continue to update everyone as that happens. I will say that we are not open for new business in A3 DPI or A06, so home, dwelling fire, and condo and we will not be open for new business until the executive order is lifted. The only caveat is we have some new homes with a select group of builders brand-new homes that we will be working with them, so they can close and have insurance on their home. So, I think the punchline is it's a volatile environment but we remain focused on achieving our goal and having our portfolio of homes across the country and not based on all the risky areas. So, Dave do you want to add anything on the reinsurance Unidentified Company Representative : Sure Tricia. Thank you. Good morning everyone. I would just note that we have a long continuous stable trading relationships with lots of big reinsurance providers. And we try to be very transparent with them about our results, and our business plans. And so we feel confident, that we'll continue to have access to the reinsurance that we need. And we believe that we get favorable pricing based on that transparency. It does seem likely that costs will go up, next year and we will pass those through in our rate filings as quickly as we can, to make sure they're accurately reflected in our prices. Thank you. John Sauerland : I'd also add, that if you have some multiyear agreements. So our entire program is normally not up for renewal in any given year, which helps us mitigate the impact of increases and allows us to better put those increases into our primary prices. We do also use some insurance-linked securities, if you will also cap bonds. So we're trying to diversify, our reinsurance and catastrophe coverage program both for time and for the instruments we use to ensure that we are stable as possible. Q \u2013 Alex Scott : Got it. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Our next question is from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Greg, your line is open. Greg Peters : Good morning. I guess, I'd like to pivot for the first question on the Commercial Lines results. And I know in your letter, you called out the unusual items with the TNC policies, that affected the third quarter results. And then you said, the net would have been up around 2%, excluding all the noise. And that certainly doesn't seem to be growing as fast as you can, considering your combined ratio is below 96. So [indiscernible] in the letter you mentioned, the bot policies the other -- some of the other initiatives. Can you sort of map out, how you think growth is going to emerge in that business? Because it seems like it's slowing down not speeding up. Tricia Griffith : Yes, I can map out sort of what's happened and how we're positioned for the future. So, we had such an opportunity in our four higher trucking business markets here, when the pandemic happened. So many people, as I'm sure you did you're having lots of good ships. So obviously, you had the trucking industry grew, and it grew in different ways. So, we had -- spot rates are up. So a lot of owner-operators would leave from a carrier and go on their own to be able to make it on their own. We were there for them. We were there at the right rate, and we had a history of this customer. So, it's a really beautiful growth. So even when you look at that 2%, you've got to look at the denominator because the last couple of years have been unbelievably successful in commercial lines. So now that spot rates have gone down a little bit and softened, some of those carriers are going -- some of those owner operators are going back to carriers, we do have a couple coverages, non-trucker liability and GL where we can keep those pits, when they're not -- when they're away from doing business with the carrier that they're part of. So we think we'll continue to grow. So that's more of a retention piece. What I would say is, the opportunity that we have is because we're so diversified in commercial. So think of -- a few years ago, we only wrote 10 or fewer power units. Now we went to 40 and then of course, we purchased Protective, which could give us an opportunity to be able to ensure some of those medium to large fleets. So we feel really good about our position there. And of course, Smart we have in nearly 40 states, I think 37, and that will continue to grow. Those are things we invested in three-plus years ago, because we know that this -- the commercial lines is very cyclical and very linked to macroeconomic trends. So although, the growth is smaller on a percentage basis, we've grown tremendously in commercial lines. We have a tremendous plan laid out a 10-year plan, Karen Herd your team have laid out to continue to grow and continue to diversify to make sure that we're able to be there when a different economic shift happens. Greg Peters : Okay. I appreciate the detail there. I guess I'm going to pivot for my second question. In your letter you talked about evaluating underwriting restriction bill plans, media spend and this is going to be focused on the expense ratio and the personal lines business. You said in your comments that you're looking at frequency and those type of trends pre-pandemic. So if I look at your expense ratio, pre-pandemic like the 2019-point in time and compared to where it is today. Today it's a lot lower. I guess as you consider ramping up your growth plans in auto, is it conceivable that the expense ratio will start trending back up as you spend more on advertising et cetera? And should we look at the 2019 sort of the base here for where the expense ratio might go to? Tricia Griffith : Yes, it's very conceivable. So we look at expense ratio with the regular expenses and non-acquisition expense ratios. We will spend \u2013 given the takeaway to 96 for a moment, we will spend as much as we can as long as we believe it's efficient. So while our expense ratio is lower now, like I said, we're really bullish on growth for this quarter because of what we being in the ambient shopping and just the environment based on our competitors' spending and our competitors' rates. So yes, you could see it go up if we continue to spend in advertising. I will say that we're constantly looking at our plan on both loss ratio or expense ratio and LAE to make sure we can continue to be efficient because we do want to spend more in the acquisition funnel. So yes, you could see it go up a little bit as we determine what the right spend is. And of course, we have the 96 governor so that is going into play a little bit right now. Greg Peters : Got it. Thanks for the color. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question is with David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David, your line is open. David Motemaden : Thanks, good morning. Tricia last quarter you said that you don't have local media ad spend on in 19 states. And I think that compared to 26 states as of the end of April. I was wondering if you could share where that stands today? How many states do not have local media on at this point in time? And maybe some color around how much in premium those states represent? Tricia Griffith : I'll let Pat take that. I'm not sure of the exact number. I believe it's less than 17 though, but I'm not sure exactly. Again, we look at that just based on our ability to grow and our ability to get the right rate. So in the states where we can't get rate, obviously we'll continue to make sure that we do everything we can not to grow. Some we're just waiting for the rates to earn in and we'll start to loosen up those underwriting guidelines and the local media spend. Pat do you want to add anything? Pat Callahan : Yes, without sharing kind of number of states because your question about percent of premium is kind of the most relevant piece. The other piece that's complex is we say local media, but there's seven different elements of local media, whether it's digital paid social, direct mail lots of things going on in that space. I think what's important is to get back to Tricia's comment about we will spend when we can afford to spend based on the calendar year targets, when the spend is efficient relative to lifetime performance on the media, and frankly when we need to spend to drive growth. And that's where it's pretty dynamic at the channel level and ultimately the split within local media where we decide to spend versus not spend. So right now we have some states, a couple of big ones on the coast where we don't yet have adequate rates on the street and we're optimizing obviously the efficiency of our expenses there given our loss ratios are high because we can't get the rate that we need under the expected losses. So what I would say is, it's dynamic and we make adjustments all the time. And as soon as we get adequate rate we are open for business. And increasingly, we are getting adequate rates in some additional states. It's just taking longer than we had expected to previously. David Motemaden : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And also Tricia, it was great to get the color just on the capital position and the debt to capital. I guess, I'm wondering if you could help us think about how we should think about the variable dividend level this year? And just, sort of, as you guys think about the growth opportunity that's in front of you how you're, sort of, thinking about that? Tricia Griffith : Yes, absolutely. So the primary -- the best use I should say of our capital is to grow the firm. And that's what we're going to try to do, especially, like we said in this unique environment. So we have this conversation every time we meet with the Board, we'll be with them again in December. And if we don't believe we can grow, of course, we give it back in either dividends or stock buybacks we -- at this juncture, I can't say whether or not we'll have a variable dividend that will ultimately be the Board's decision. I will tell you that, I want to take advantage and leverage this opportunity to grow the firm. David Motemaden : Great. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question is with Gary Ransom from Dowling Partners. Gary, your line is open. Gary Ransom : Good morning. I wanted to go revisit the frequency question. Just looking at the actual disclosures in the Q where we have frequency down broadly 9%. That's year-over-year not pre-pandemic. And when I think about the broader environment that's actually counterintuitive to me because I'm thinking about the economy still being a little bit closed down a year ago, and frequency probably I would expect it to be increasing. And in fact when I look at available industry data it is increasing at least through six months. And so you seem to be moving in a different direction than I might have expected. And I wondered if you can add some color or possible reasons for why that might be happening? Tricia Griffith : Yes. And the nine was for the quarter. We're down much more in frequency if you look at the trailing 12 versus the trailing 13 to 24 down more like in the 2% range. So I can't comment on how other people look at frequency, but we are down lower if you look at the time frame I just outlined. Do you want to have anything John? John Sauerland : Sure. Yes. We have done a lot to move to ensure we have profitable business coming in the door. So when you do that you're going to first seek to apply underwriting efforts against the highest frequency business likely that is producing the highest loss ratios. As Pat Callahan mentioned, we've also had some challenges getting price in some very large markets that have fairly high frequency as states. So in aggregate, I get your perspective, and we've noted the same but recognize that there's a lot going on with the mix of our business, due to where we've been growing or shrinking both geographically and at the segment level that is going to drive that number as well. Gary Ransom : All right. That's helpful. Actually, that's a fairly positive statement on what you've been able to do versus what the rest of the industry is doing. But anyway, I had another question on Snapshot too. I noticed in the Q. It looked like there was an uptick in the attach rate for Snapshot particularly in Direct. And I wondered, whether there was something you were doing. Is that part of the advertising? And maybe you just have some general comments about the acceptance of that product in the market? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I'll add some general comments and then Pat, if you want to add anything. We have seen an uptick in new business for Snapshot is now in the low 30% range. The biggest of tickets in direct we have about 45% of our new business using Snapshot. And of course John talked about our continuous model, which we have. I think you said, hey, I'm not sure, if which is about 11% earned premium. So we're excited about that, to continue to gather data. We have a \u2013 in the continuous model, we have a deeper flat discount for participation and then steeper either factors from maximum discount and surcharge. So I don't know, if that's a big factor, but we do believe people see this as something where they can control part of their insurance cost and we're pretty excited about it. Pat, do you want to add anything? Pat Callahan : Yeah. I would just echo the continuous evolution of the experience that we build around Snapshot to make it easier for consumers to find understand their savings, and then enroll in the program both in the direct channel and in the two-stage distribution through agents, because obviously getting agents on board that this is a good thing for their clients is important. We think part of it is process. So on the direct side, we've been continuing to improve the experience and invest there and have seen some recent wins in how we present the offer that's been helping. But we also think, there's some macroeconomic things going on, right? When there's an inflationary environment, consumers are squeezed, and they get a rate increase from their current carrier, when shopping, they want to save money, and we believe Snapshot is not only a personalized way to save money, but to get rewarded for safe driving behavior. And we think that's resonating, with a greater number of consumers, and the agents who sell our products over time. Gary Ransom : Are the \u2013 is the attach rate or you said 45% for direct? Is there a similar number that you're willing to give on the agent at this point? Tricia Griffith : No it's increasing somewhat especially from pre-pandemic. Like Pat said, it's a little bit more difficult to \u2013 we're really encouraging agencies that, as one of the many variables to make sure we get \u2013 we give our combined customers the best rates, if their driving behavior warrants the same. Gary Ransom : All right. Thank you very much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Gary. Operator : Our next question is with Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Josh, your line is open. Josh Shanker : Yeah. Thank you. As we head into 2023, I'm no health insurance expert, but it seems to me that Medicare and a lot of the health insurers they set their rates earlier in the year. And while inflationary costs are built in right now, it may not be in the health insurance costs, which could mean we could see some severity increase on the bodily injury side next year. One I want to know if there's any truth in how I'm thinking about this? And two, given the duration of liabilities in your portfolio, what is the impact that might have on next year's results? Tricia Griffith : What I would say from that perspective, obviously, we watch the cost that we incur for our bodily injury, but we also have inflation built into our reserving. So we build that in based on a lot of data and including what's happening in the healthcare. So those inflationary percentages are build it based on what's going on in the overall healthcare industry. John Sauerland : Yeah to set those inflation factors in our reserves, the product managers who are pricing at the state level will be reflecting those in their prices as well. And I think it's a valid concern. It's something that we are watching. And certainly to the extent we see medical inflation rate picking up, we will be dialing that into our prices as soon as we can. Josh Shanker : And in terms of your experience with distracted driving knowledge where are we at the trends we saw got emerging from the pandemic, is the extent which people are looking at their phones when they're driving, or hard braking, do we see changes in that from where we've been over the last 12 or 18 months? Tricia Griffith : I can't speak specifically to distracted driving. I think we've reached those levels of ties have leveled off. They had an increase I think right win. There was less driving people. Speeds were higher, fatalities were higher. I think that's starting to level off. That might be the fact that there's more congestion because there are more people going back to work but I couldn't adequately give you specific number on that. Josh Shanker : Okay. I appreciate the answers. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Josh. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew Kligerman : Hey good morning. Question around policy in-force growth. I think in the quarter, it was up about 0.5%. Could you give a little color on that August and September have count that you said was at record levels? Could you put some numbers behind that and the potential for policy in-force growth in the fourth quarter? Tricia Griffith : I don't know how much numbers I can put into it. I mean, obviously, PIF growth goes into both new business and renewal business. So a lot of it has to do with obviously our accruals, which we think is positive. It takes a little bit of time period in. And what I will say is our renewal growth looks very positive and we think a lot of that has to do with -- even if our insurers get an increase if they're shopping the likelihood of the leaving is lower. So we're seeing that renewal business increase as well. So we feel like we've reached the bottom from our retention perspective and that PIF growth should start to continue to improve. Andrew Kligerman : So maybe at least mid-single-digit PIF growth? Tricia Griffith : I never like to guess. So you know what, two weeks from today you'll have our October results and then 30 days after that November results. Andrew Kligerman : All right. I won't push anymore. And then one question, apologies for another frequency question. But as I look at the 10-Qs and tell me if my math is right, if I look at today's frequency against pre-pandemic it's nearly up, its went down nearly down 20%. Is that good math? And if so, is there a reason -- and it was a great answer to the question before I get the business mix has changed a lot. But is there a reason to believe that maybe frequency could spike up very sharply and very quickly? I know Tricia you were saying that, you're going to look at it over the next two quarters. So one is my math right? And two, is there any reason to be concerned it could just sharply jump up at some point in the near-term? Tricia Griffith : Your math is accurate. It's so hard to say, because it can change with so many variables. I do feel like it's become a little bit more stable in the last couple of quarters, but you can see with what happens really around the globe thing happens with back and fuel prices has been change dramatically. If work from home happens, if something happens, where we're hearing about flu season or the next variance of COVID those things can happen. We really can't predict those. We do watch those literally on a daily basis. And then, we can react to those once we have them. So we do see, we believe a little bit more stability, but I'd like to see several more quarters of that at least a few. Andrew Kligerman : Thanks very much. Tricia Griffith : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Our next question is from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Yaron, your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Hi and good morning. Excuse me. My first question is on used car prices coming down a bit and at the same time we've seen body shop labor already going up. So maybe it's a two-part question here. One, are you seeing the percentage of total vehicles drop? And two, be honest with the math of severity of used cars and severity of body shop labor. Are there other elements that we should be thinking about any like would LAE be different when you handle a total claim versus a body shop repair claim? Tricia Griffith : Well, each loss is dependent on the severity of what's happening in the car. So, again that dynamic as employees are there, so they're going to handle kind of a mix of harder total losses and some easier hit. So that sort of washes out in the denominator. What I would say is, we have seen used car prices go down the mailing index. We're going to continue to watch that. And again, it takes some time because there's still a supply-demand issue. We're going to wait to see what happens with hurricane Ian. And we are seeing labor are up about 3% parts are up about 4% to 5%, the only other thing that we looked at that have been up it is pretty flat right now are rental severity. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Thanks. And then, maybe one follow-up on the related to LAE, so I understand that it is incremental and I don't know if you can give any additional quantification beyond incremental. But maybe another part of this would be in the LAE that you have for Ian, in September, did you already try and capture potentially additional LAE that you still expect to emerge kind of an got in IBNR if you will, or is that just for the month of September? Tricia Griffith : Well, it was for the month of September, because we wanted to take the $200 million retention and assess the part for indemnity the part for LAE. So 25% is sort of our first assessment and that number will likely evolve over time. Yaron Kinar : Sorry, I meant for the auto piece, not the property piece. Tricia Griffith : For the property piece, in terms of LAE. Yaron Kinar : For the auto piece, the LAE. Yes. Tricia Griffith : Again, so the auto piece for LAE, that we don't actually separate that out. When we report we report loss plus LAE. But that, again, with the exception of some Travel and some hotels and stuff, we already have that baked in, because we already have a certain number of claims people on our books and a certain number of claims that will happen. And when a hurricane happens, that doesn't necessarily flex up because of that. We already have a CAT team. But if they're not handling weather-related events, they're doing other things within the claims organization. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Tracy, your line is open. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Your auto new application growth is up 20%, mostly on the direct side. Can you touch on the quality of the new business you were seeing? I'm wondering, if your quote to bind ratio changed, as you\u2019re seeing more submission. Tricia Griffith : I didn't hear the last part of your question, but the first part of the question is, we always believe that we put good business on the books, because we have so many variables that, as long as we can make our target profit margin, of course, that's different in new renewal, agency direct in each day, we always believe that the business we put on the books should be able to reach our target profit goals. And -- so I wouldn't want to fit in the books, that\u2019s where we have underwriting restrictions and other things. So that, we believe, is a good business. And of course, that evolves and we'll be able to tell you how that underlying is in the next coming months. I didn't hear the second part of your question. John Sauerland : About quote to bind ratio. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Yes. I was just referring -- John Sauerland : I was going to comment just quickly on the -- Tracy Benguigui : Go ahead. John Sauerland : Go ahead. I've got your question on quote to bind, Tracey. Let me just comment on the quality just to build on Tricia's comments. So, obviously, we monitor the quality incoming business regularly and we have seen a significant spike in business coming from competitors, which is great, right? If competitors are raising rates, base rates and pushing customers to shop, we believe the power of our segmentation helps us select the right risks at the right rate for a lifetime profitability. So we look very closely at that quality of the business. We're always paranoid that we're getting business since someone else is shedding, but we're very comfortable with what we're writing. And as Tricia mentioned, we want to grow with the right business and we feel like we have that in place right now. As far as your quote-to-bind ratio question, there's a lot of moving parts in there, because when you have massive increases in shopping, you have different motivation levels of customers and conversion rate is, obviously, dependent on the mix of business that's shopping, how competitive our pricing is relative to where they're shopping from, because they're always comparing for a prior insurance customer what they're paying today versus what they could pay tomorrow. And that's where we think the power of segmentation, particularly in the agency channel, where comparative raters create effectively a transparency of rates across different carriers and segmentation and pricing accuracy enables us to grow in the right places, while avoiding adverse selection that potentially goes to our competitors. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. But directionally has it changed for you? John Sauerland : Directionally, conversion more recently is slightly down as we see prospect -- record prospect growth which is a normal dynamic I see more shoppers some are less motivated aggregate conversion does slide a little. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. And then on a cohort basis, how many policy terms do you think it'll take for that new business to meet your combined ratio target? John Sauerland : So on a cohort basis obviously we look at a lifetime basis and it all depends on how quickly we grow right? We've gotten the question for, I think decades about the growth tax and how we think about new versus renewal. And I think as Tricia mentioned we will spend where we can be efficient in acquiring customers and acquire them at what we believe a new business combined ratio is that we'll produce our lifetime profit targets.  So with that construct as we think about it, if we grow quickly there will be potentially pressure on our calendar year combined ratio and we manage our expenses in order to ensure that we deliver on your expectations. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. And can you comment how many policy terms did you take for that new bit of tax to not be please? John Sauerland : Maybe I can help out. We have different policy life expectancy by different segment of business. So, what we call a SAM and inconsistently insured customers they're not going to stick around long. So, we need to make our 96 in a very short period of time. Robinsons going stick a lot longer. So, we have a lot more time to make up the combined ratio over 100 perhaps on new business for a Robinson. So, it depends upon the segment of business that we're talking about. Lately we've been growing less on the Sam side, more on the Robinson side. So if you think about that dynamic hopefully that's helpful to your question. Tracy Benguigui : It is. Thank you. Operator : Our next question shall be from Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer, your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great. Thank you. Good morning, John mentioned that planned to price mostly to the Snapshot curve. And you see what that means maybe slightly excess profits and faster growth compared to what we saw maybe heading into COVID. And I think about that directionally correctly? John Sauerland : I would say no. So when we say not specifically to the curve, we would balance that on the end of the curve if you will. So early on with Snapshot when it was new for consumers, we weren't pricing to the maximum surcharge. We went pricing to the maximum discount. In fact, we didn't surcharge off, when we first brought out the model. Now that consumers understand it, are accepting of it, we can price to both ends of those spectrum. So this doesn't change at all the aggregate 96 target we have for all segments of our business inclusive of Snapshot. Meyer Shields : Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarification. And I guess the second issue, you mentioned early in the call, not the first time that resis generally reverse to taking significant rate increases. Can you talk to the opportunity to sort of embed inflationary sensitive components into the exposure base that you don't have the same problem if something else pricing? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I mean we tried to do that definitely in our reserving but in our pricing, we look at that and prospectively put that into our pricing model. But this has been sort of an extraordinary few years with the inflationary, especially in our industry with us in new car prices and social inflation. So we do believe those big increases are past us. And of course that could be a well we have to have a bigger increase based on something else other than that, but we feel good about that. Do you want to add anything? John Sauerland : Sure. We do have what we call monthly rating factors. So we have some escalators in our auto pricing. They are not reflective of an inflationary environment in which we have seen recently. So you're doing this prospectively and it requires regulatory approval. So we have call modest factors that inflate prices in many states not all on a monthly basis. On the property side, we also have the value of the home that we are reflecting that renewal which lately for sure has led to higher renewal prices outside of any increases we've taken. Does that helpful with your question? Meyer Shields : It does. I really -- I guess I would ask it more intelligently would that be about the potential for embedding the same sort of things that provide more premium automatically in property getting some of those in auto? Tricia Griffith : I think we are with the monthly rating factors as well as the incremental increases and then the dwelling increases that John talked about on the property side. John Sauerland : Yeah, the piece we're going to ensure, we're more responsive on the auto frequency side is that continuous monitoring. So the more we drive people to adopt snapshot or UBI rating and a continuous rating model, we can adapt more quickly to things that change in how they drive or how much they drive over time. So that provides a little more responsive than we have in today's model. Meyer Shields : Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Doug Constantine : We exhausted our scheduled time. So that concludes our event. Austin, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing sections. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation's third quarter investor event.

    "content": "\ufeff Doug Constantine : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive\u2019s Fourth Quarter Investor Event. I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today\u2019s event. The Company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the Company\u2019s website. This quarter includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CE and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with the leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today\u2019s event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia? Tricia Griffith : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was among the toughest years of Progressive\u2019s 85 years. The continued effects of the pandemic, high inflation and the largest hurricane in our history all played a role in a tumultuous environment. Throughout these challenges, Progressive people came together in unity and delivered once again beating our goal of a calendar year 96 combined ratio while growing both written premiums and policies in force. The pride that I feel in all of the people of Progressive is indescribable. We have met all challenges head on and continued to deliver the best-in-class results our stakeholders expect. Our ability to meet these challenges is embedded in our culture, which is built on our newly updated four cornerstones, which are who we are, which is our core values, why we are here, which is our purpose. We revised our purpose to be, we exist to help people move forward and live fully. Our modified purpose builds on the legacy of our core values and our history of challenging the status quo to accelerate progress and equity. We modify the purpose to better unify and guide our organization. Where we are headed, which is our vision. We expanded our vision to include business owners, so it now provides a more holistic view of all the customers we are privileged to serve. And how we will get there, which is the four pillars of our strategy. We\u2019ve updated these two cornerstones to better reflect the evolution of our company and to ensure our culture adapt to the ever-changing environment we operate in. While our business will continue to progress, we will always seek to maintain the things that make Progressive, Progressive. In today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll once again focus on the strategy cornerstone and specifically, we\u2019ll discuss the pillar of competitive prices. Competitive prices means not just offering the best rate, but also the most accurate rate driven by pricing accuracy, expense discipline and industry-leading segmentation. As we have said for the last few quarters, we believe the major personal auto rate increases are likely behind us. In the fourth quarter, we continued to raise personal auto rates but at a pace slower than in late 2021 and early 2022. While some states are still waiting on filings to be approved by their respective regulators, we believe the majority of states are nearing rate adequacy, and our intent is to continue to increase rates commensurate with future loss trends. Based on public rate filings, we know that our competitors are raising rates to address their own profitability concerns. And as they have done so, we\u2019ve seen our relative competitiveness improve, which has resulted in improving retention strong quote growth and high conversion. We\u2019ve now actually seen some competitors surpass our post-COVID rate take, which should help us sustain those improvement trends. As a result, we finished 2022 with the best fourth quarter for personal auto new application volume in our history, which contributed to growing our personal auto PIFs 3% in 2022 while also running a lower acquisition expense ratio than 2021. We\u2019re continuously evaluating our media budget, and we\u2019ll continue to use media efficiently as we enter 2023, and we will look to capitalize on this hard market. The higher direct acquisition expense ratio in January is indicative of our opportunistic stance, and it reflects the confidence we have of current rate levels in most states at this time. Of course, if the last three years have taught us anything, it\u2019s that the future is unpredictable. So, we will continue to monitor the business carefully and navigate as needed to grow as fast as possible while delivering a calendar year \u201896 combined ratio. As I said in my annual shareholders letter, segmentation is a key facet of our competitive prices pillar, and nowhere is that more evident than in our investment in usage-based insurance products, which will be the topic of today\u2019s presentation. Progressive was a first mover in usage-based insurance. We have had a UBI offering since 1996 when we launched our first product called Autograph. This first effort was limited by the technology at the time and required a professional mechanic to install equipment in a customer\u2019s car at a considerable expense. That first attempt evolved to TripSense in 2004, which was our first self install option. And then in 2008, we launched MyRate, which is where we first employed cellular technology to upload data to our systems. And then in 2010, we launched Snapshot, which we consider the start of modern UBI program. We moved from our discount-only model to one that included the possibility of a surcharge in 2014. And in 2016, we launched the Snapshot app, which allowed the customer to use a mobile phone app instead of the plug-in device. Our most recent addition is continuous monitoring, which began its rollout in the summer of 2022. In parallel to our efforts in Personal Lines, we were developing UBI for commercial auto products. This culminated in our first broad commercial offering of Smart Haul, in 2018, which allows us to provide usage-based insurance to truckers in partnership with providers of electronic-logging devices. We also expanded the Snapshot program for commercial auto with Snapshot ProView in 2020, which includes fleet monitoring services to small businesses. Throughout our history of usage-based insurance, we have collected billions of miles of data and invested in a process of continuous improvement in our UBI products. Today, UBI is our most predictive rating variable, and it provides unparalleled rate accuracy to our customers. Through this, we\u2019ve continuously educated our customers where today UBI adoption is at near historical highs. To highlight our UBI products on this call, we\u2019ve invited two Progressive leaders who\u2019ve played significant roles in our UBI development. First to speak will be Jim Haas, business leader for our personal auto usage-based insurance. Jim is a 20-year Progressive veteran. And for the last five years, he has led our personal auto UBI team. Jim will discuss the advances we have made in personal auto UBI. Following Jim will be Cory Fischer. Cory is a 19-year Progressive veteran. For nine years, Cory has been our business leader for Commercial Lines R&D. And as of last month, Cory accepted a new role to lead our agency distribution group. During his tenure in Commercial Lines, Cory led R&D during the successful rollout of both our commercial auto UBI products. Cory will be highlighting all of the advances we have made in Commercial Lines UBI, once again giving Progressive first-mover advantage in this important technology. Again, thank you for joining us this morning. I will now hand it over to Jim Haas. Jim? Jim Haas : Thank you, Tricia. As Tricia mentioned, my name is Jim Haas, and I lead Progressive\u2019s Personal Lines Telematics efforts. Today, I\u2019d like to tell you about how we\u2019ve built on that long history in telematics that Tricia discussed starting with how we\u2019ve continued to improve our core Snapshot program, then moving on to discuss how we can now bring in data from outside sources to improve rating accuracy during the new business quote. And finally, wrapping up with the discussion of some value-added services we\u2019ll be bringing to market soon. First, let\u2019s recap how our program has worked for a number of years. Individual states may vary a bit, but I\u2019ll describe here how it works in most places. We or the agent present the customer with the offer to enroll a Snapshot during their initial quote. If the customer elects to sign up, we\u2019ll receive an immediate discount of up to 10% for participating in Snapshot that will be applied to that quote. So long as the customer stays in Snapshot, that discount stays on the policy during the whole first term. During the quote, the customer also elects whether they want to monitor using a plug-in OBD-II device that we send them or via an app on the smartphone. The customer then has 45 days to plug in a device or get the app set up. That point, all they need to do is drive. We\u2019ll let them know how they\u2019re doing along the way. Just before their policy comes up for renewal, we\u2019ll use the driving data collected during that first term to calculate the renewal discount or surcharge. That rate adjustment will be included in the renewal quote and will be applied to future policy terms. At that point, the customer can delete the app or send us back to device and they\u2019ll be done monitoring. I\u2019d mention that the rate could go down or it could go up, that is we would apply a discount or a surcharge. But that\u2019s not how our program started. In the early days, the program is structured a little bit differently, but a customer\u2019s rate couldn\u2019t get worse by participating in Snapshot. Customers could receive a discount of up to 30%, but the rate couldn\u2019t go up, no matter how risky they\u2019re driving look. Many companies still employ a model like this today. Of course, no rating variable in insurance only suggests giving discounts. It\u2019s about segmentation and matching rate to risk. So, the data would suggest that some customers should see the rate increase while others should see a decrease. While only offering discounts might encourage more people to participate in the program makes the economics a lot more challenging and limits the accuracy of the overall pricing. And we all know that pricing accuracy is critical in auto insurance. So, starting in late 2014, we began introducing a surcharge. We set our factors so that about a fifth of customers received a surcharge, a share that we\u2019ve kept about the same over time. The surcharge was small at first, but started us on the path to greater accuracy. It\u2019s also when we introduced the participation discount, which is down 10% in most states. Over time, we\u2019ve moved the price closer and closer to what the data would tell us, first, by increasing the maximum surcharge from 10% to 15%, then increasing it to 20%, and finally, to where we are today. We offer larger discounts than we did in the past, now of up to 30%. But we also have larger potential surcharges than in the past too, now up to 40%. We\u2019ve come a long way since the days of only offering a discount, but it\u2019s important to note that about 75% of customers still receive a discount and only about a fifth receive a surcharge. Not surprisingly, we see better retention on customers who earn a discount and worse retention on those were in a surcharge. Renewal rates for the safest drivers who are earning the biggest discounts are about 6% higher than average, while they\u2019re about 16% lower for the riskiest drivers who aren\u2019t receiving a discount. So, the program systematically helps us retain lower risk drivers and shed higher risk ones. And because of the changes we made to our Snapshot pricing over the years, were more accurately priced than ever before on those customers that do stay with us. While these changes have certainly improved the accuracy of our pricing, there is still a limitation to our approach. We only use data from a single term, typically 4 to 5 months to set the price for the life of the policy. This made it so we wouldn\u2019t know about material changes in an individual\u2019s driving behavior would lead to less accuracy over time. We had experimented with a continuous program a long time ago, back in the late 2000s. At the time, though, consumer acceptance of telematics generally was still growing and collecting data on an ongoing basis was quite expensive. So, we decided to move forward with a partial model. Things have changed a lot since then and in early 2022, we started migrating to a continuous version of Snapshot. The basic process isn\u2019t all that different. Customers still choose whether and how to participate in Snapshot during the quote and they still receive a participation discount. They still have 45 days to plug in the device or set up the app and then they can just drive. The difference comes after the renewal. As instead of sending the device back or deleting the app, we ask them to continue to monitor, and we\u2019ll adjust their rate at each renewal to reflect their more recent driving. Additionally, that participation discount is larger now at 15% instead of 10%, which encourages more people to participate in the program. Having more recent data also improves the predictive power of UBI, which means we can price even more aggressively. We\u2019ve increased the size of the maximum potential discount to 45% and the maximum potential surcharge to 60%. We\u2019re one of the few companies to combine a continuous model with the possibility of surcharges. As of the end of 2022, we had deployed this new continuous model in 12 states, representing over a quarter of our net written premium and plan to roll out to most of the rest of the country during 2023. So, while we\u2019ve been steepening these factors and requiring longer monitoring to make our pricing even more accurate, what\u2019s happened to take rate? The answer is that the share of our personal auto customers participating in Snapshot has moved steadily upward. In fact, it\u2019s up nearly 40% across both channels combined since January of 2019. So today, more people participate in Snapshot than ever before, providing data for longer periods of time that we can use to price more accurately than ever before. So, that\u2019s the update on what\u2019s been going on with our core Snapshot program, which provides great incremental segmentation over what is available via traditional rating variables on renewal policy terms. Now, I want to talk about how we\u2019re working to bring this pricing accuracy to where it\u2019s most useful at the time of the new business quote. Since in this scenario, the customer is only now just coming to us will have to use telematics data that was collected by others. Our long telematics experience has helped us learn how to use this data and how to make it predictive. We currently have two initiatives in market. The first is a lead generation program that works by inviting good drivers to come and quote with us. While the other begins when a customer comes to Progressive directly to get a quote, and we find and incorporate driving data from third parties into the right we present them. Let me start with the lead generation program. Here, a partner like Credit Karma invites their customer to opt into collecting driving data to see if they could save money on their car insurance. In a privacy-friendly way where we don\u2019t receive personally identifiable information, we can let Credit Karma know who\u2019s likely to receive a discount so they can invite them to quote with us. Only when the customer chooses to quote, are we able to personally identify that data and are then able to apply that discount to that individual\u2019s quote, improving pricing accuracy immediately. Our second program involves working with data collected by automakers. Over the last several years, more and more of them have been equipping their vehicles with technology to collect driving data. They\u2019ve been working to show the value of these programs to their customers so that they\u2019ll sign up to share that data with them. And we\u2019ve been able to tap into that. When a customer comes to us to quote and their driving data is available, we\u2019d ask the customer if they like us to use it to determine their price. They say, yes, we bring that data in and apply the UBI discount or surcharge to their quote immediately. Again, pushing that rate accuracy to where it matters most, the new business quote. Because of our long experience with UBI and in working with both OBD and mobile data and the fact that we attract so many insurance shoppers every year, we\u2019re well positioned to execute and benefit from this. To be clear, automakers are in various often early stages of getting the necessary equipment into their cars and making this data available to insurers. Additionally, just because new cars coming off the assembly line have the hardware, it takes a long time for the fleet to turn over. So, this isn\u2019t common yet, but we\u2019re excited about the opportunity it represents. We\u2019re already working with two of the largest double makers, General Motors and Toyota, and it\u2019s clear that this population will grow over the coming years. Lastly, I\u2019d like to share some exciting news that doesn\u2019t involve using telematics data to more accurately rate policies but instead, builds upon our telematics heritage to provide a valuable service to our customers. Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve experimented with offering a service to detect and respond to major accidents to some of our Snapshot customers to learn if they value the service and to better understand how it could be useful in handling claims. We\u2019ve been encouraged on both fronts as customers have consistently told us that this kind of service is something that they really do value and our claims representatives have seen a telematics data can help them settle claims more quickly and efficiently. Still, we know that despite how times have changed, there is a large segment of customers who don\u2019t want their insurance premium to be based on their driving data. That means that if we limit this just to our Snapshot customers, we\u2019d be leaving out a lot of others. So, in March, we plan to start making accident response available to all of our auto customers, not just those who were in Snapshot. We\u2019ll use data from the sensors on the phone to detect when a serious crash is likely to have happened. We\u2019ll reach out to the customer to confirm the accident and to see if they need help. If we don\u2019t hear from a customer at all, and it seems particularly serious, we\u2019ll request that the police conduct a well check to make sure our customer is okay. Since we know the customer\u2019s location from the telematics data, we know just where to send them. We know there are other accident response services available. We think what we\u2019re offering has several key benefits, though, that distinguish it. First, many services come at an additional monthly expense. Ours will come included in the policy. There is no additional charge. This adds value to the customer\u2019s relationship with us and can become another reason to choose and to stay with Progressive. Additionally, while other insurers offer crash detection to their UBI customers, we\u2019ll be making it available to all of our Personal Lines auto customers, whether they\u2019re in Snapshot or not. Third, we\u2019re deliberate about dispatching EMS. We certainly wanted to get EMS dispatch as quickly as we can when a customer needs it. But we also don\u2019t want to waste EMS resources and bother the customer when they don\u2019t. This can be challenging since the sensor data for a near miss and an actual accident can look awfully similar. So, we try to contact the customer more than once using different methods so they can let us know if there was an accident and if they need help. We only send help if the customer has requested or if we haven\u2019t been able to reach them after several tries and the accident looks severe. While most customers in these accidents don\u2019t actually need ambulance, many do need a tow truck. We\u2019re able to build on our roadside assistance experience to meet this need. We understand that those are even more urgent than a typical roadside request. We can also help customers notify their family members. Lastly, after an accident, one of consumers\u2019 top concerns is how to get their medical bills paid and how to get their car back on the road. As their insurer, we\u2019re the ones positioned to help them get there. By detecting these accidents and having this telematics data able, we\u2019re able to get their claim started more quickly and able to handle it more efficiently. In fact, if an ambulance or two is dispatched, we\u2019ll actually get that claim started on their behalf. Let me show you an example. This is a real claim that was detected via accident response. In the loss pictured here, our customer was driving on an urban boulevard when they hit some ice, lost control of the vehicle for a striking barricade to their left before striking the barricade on the right. Fortunately, no other vehicles were involved. As you can see, the airbags deployed and there was pretty severe damage to the front of our insurance vehicle. In fact, this vehicle is a total loss. Additionally, our customer and two of their passengers were injured in the crash. Within 2 minutes of the impact, we reached out to our customer. While they didn\u2019t response to our initial push notification, they did respond to a subsequent call from a live agent, which occurred less than 5 minutes after the accident that agent dispatched an ambulance and a tow truck to the scene. Only a few minutes later, the claim was filed. Altogether, it took only 10 minutes from the time of the accident to when we had a claim in our system. We\u2019ve surveyed some of our accident response customers where we\u2019ve gotten has some great feedback. For instance, this customer showed that they were \u201cunable to call for help at the time but help called me.\u201d This service helps us help our customers when they need it most. It\u2019s not just the immediate response to the accident that can help customers though. Here is another example. This customer collided with another vehicle when changing lanes. We detected this accident as well, dispatched the tow for them and had the claim filed within 12 minutes of the accident. What I want to highlight in this case though, is that this customer had this accident just two days after buying their policy. Some of the first steps in handling any claim include establishing the facts of loss and determining if the loss is covered. Unfortunately, there are people who buy insurance after they had an accident and then try to make a claim for it. This means that honest customers are inconvenienced as we need to take the time to verify that the accident happened when they told us it did. That was pretty easy in this case, however, since we detected the accident in the first place and arranged for the tow truck to pick up the car, and we can see from the telematics data that the crash happened where and importantly when our customers said it did. Therefore, we were very confident that this loss did occur after and not before the customer purchased the policy, which let us move forward more quickly with getting the customer back on the road. So, it\u2019s not just the accident response service self, but its promise to improve the claims experience that can benefit our customers. They\u2019ve told us they value accident response, and we\u2019re excited to make it available to them. We\u2019ll start that process in March and expect to make it available to all of our personal auto customers over the next year or so. To wrap up, we\u2019re not just jumping on the telematics bandwagon. We have decades of experience here. We\u2019re clear-eyed about the challenges, but also see the great opportunities telematics offerings present. But this is just the Personal Lines side of the story. My colleagues in Commercial Lines have been developing their own approach about how to use telematics data in their markets, and Cory Fischer, who\u2019s led Commercial Lines R&D for the better part of the last 10 years is here to tell us about it. Cory? Cory Fischer : Thanks, Jim. As Tricia shared, I\u2019m Cory Fischer, and up until recently, I was the business leader for Commercial Lines Product Research and Development, which includes responsibility for commercial telematics efforts. Today, I\u2019d like to share the progress we\u2019ve made since introducing our commercial telematics programs, some early observations and how we\u2019re thinking about future investments in this space. The chart on the lower left was shared in a prior Investor Relations call. It\u2019s why we\u2019re excited and have been investing in telematics. Pricing segmentation is an important part of how we compete. The group I\u2019ve worked with is charged with advancing our commercial auto segmentation leadership position in the market. Telematics is the most predictive rating variable we have by a lot. To build on that segmentation leadership position we need to be a leader in telematics. For context, we have two branded telematics programs. Smart Haul is the first program we introduced in 2018 after several years of data collection studies and pilots. It targets truckers that are acquired to maintain hours-of-service logs. The launch intentionally coincided with the federal mandate, requiring these truckers to move from paper log books to electronic logging devices. We have recognized those devices provide continuous monitoring and capture very similar data to our Snapshot devices, including location information. With the customer\u2019s consent, we use the data from the trucker\u2019s electronic login device to generate a score and apply a rating factor. Ideally, we access the data during the quote process, just like the process Jim discussed, using data to price new business. If we are not able to get the data, either there are newer venture without driving history, or we don\u2019t have immediate access to their ELD vendor, we provide a participation discount on the quote. Snapshot ProView on the right is more similar to what Progressive Personal Auto has offered. Its target is essentially anyone that doesn\u2019t have an electronic logging device. We market Snapshot ProView as safety and savings. For customers that enroll, we provide a participation discount at new business and send a Snapshot device that they can easily plug in. Given how small businesses have employee turnover, this program has continuous monitoring. We will then use their driving data to generate a score and a factor that\u2019s applied at renewal. This factor could be a discount or a surcharge. In addition, we provide access to a free driver portal. Our customer can see where their vehicles are and how they are being driven. It\u2019s a fairly simple way to keep tabs on their fleet and driving behavior. Since we have deployed these programs, we have been monitoring a number of key metrics. The chart on the right shows a version of take rate, that is, percentage of new business apps and rolling into a telematics program. We\u2019ve seen from prior program launches, it can take a while and require a sustained effort to get meaningful adoption. Though we have identified opportunities for increasing take rate, we are genuinely happy with how quickly adoption has occurred and the trajectory it\u2019s on. In addition to adoption, we have seen that when quotas enroll into a program, they convert at a higher rate than the cohort that\u2019s eligible, but chooses not to enroll. We also see that our telematics book of business performs better from a profitability standpoint even after the discount is applied. That\u2019s not the longer-term goal. Our intent is to accurately price all segments at target. Between our significant footprint in the commercial auto market, healthy adoption rate and conversion lift, we\u2019ve built a substantial commercial auto telematics book of business. That book would be a Top 15 commercial auto insurance carrier on its own. In summary, we are really pleased with the growth and performance of our telematics efforts. But we have learned a lot since introducing these programs. One recognition, getting into telematics is not easy. It\u2019s not just as simple as adding a new rating variable. It takes broader and sustained effort, new capabilities and investments. For example, we are asking our partners in the independent agent channel to take additional steps to enroll customers, which can include a supplemental app and working through customer reservations with sharing their driving data. That requires an incremental level of support and training. With telematics, we are now dealing with hardware and data transmission. We are also in the logistics business, sending out devices, tracking inventory levels and recently dealing with global supply chain issues. That\u2019s a different set of vendors, technical challenges, systems and business processes that we\u2019ve had to work through. I think the biggest difference is the amount of data that these devices generate. We have to ensure that data is being managed effectively. It\u2019s imperative as the data is being transmitted and stored that is handled securely. Also, as the largest commercial auto insurer in the United States, we have a lot of data and have developed effective tools, processes, and skills to manage and model those more traditional data sets. Telematics is an entirely different situation. One truck alone might generate over 1 million records per year. Our traditional approaches aren\u2019t nearly as effective, transforming big data sets into variables that we can test and model off of. A big advantage to us is that personal auto through its efforts and investments over the past 20 some years, has established a lot of these capabilities or learnings that we can leverage. For example, our Snapshot ProView program uses the personal auto Snapshot device. Given the volume that personal auto has generated, we have a very competitive cost per device, and that device is already set up to transmit the data back to our secure storage solutions.  In terms of big data, personal auto helped us move to their cloud solution, essentially a highly scalable cloud-based data storage and analysis service. This significantly reduces our processing time to analyze data and at a much lower cost than traditional alternatives. They\u2019ve also provided support as we upskill our team to use these new tools. To summarize this slide, getting into telematics requires a lot of effort. A competitive advantage that we have in Commercial Lines is that our colleagues and Jim\u2019s group have already laid a lot of that groundwork that we can either use or learn from. It takes a lot to stand up a leading telematics program and to maintain that leadership takes ongoing investment. I\u2019ll share some of those ideas with this slide. Near term, there\u2019s a lot that we can do to improve the experience. We have data that shows where customers drop out of the funnel or hit operational hurdles by granting data sharing consent or installing the plug-in device. We have worked with our vendors and have new business processes that will improve both. We have several manual processes in place that support these programs. By automating those, we will lower our program expenses and improve the customer or agent experience. There are a few segments that aren\u2019t currently eligible for one of these programs. We\u2019re looking to expand eligibility. One example is for our small fleet customers that have their own telematics service, but not electronic logging devices. This could be a service fleet like plumbing. Our intent is to enroll them into a program and access the data from their telematics service provider. Through these near term plans, we\u2019ll continue to grow our telematics book, and with that additional data continue to refine and improve our scoring models. We\u2019re also excited about new data sources and applications. We\u2019re seeing better reception from segments that we target to having dash cams. We\u2019ve been doing a pilot with dash cams for over a year. There\u2019s data from video that we don\u2019t capture today, like following distance, which could be valuable, and as Jim shared, we\u2019re interested in how telematics can help with the claims process. Dash cams would be an additional input that could be meaningful for claims. We\u2019re also using the data to support our underwriting efforts. For now, that might mean verifying other information on the application like radius of operations or garaging Zip code, which are important for us to assess where the vehicle is operated. Sometimes we need to follow up to confirm that the information on the application is correct. We can use telematics data to better target which risks we should follow up on. Our telematics score is currently bolted on to our core model. Given not everyone is in a telematics program, we solve our core model first and then add a telematics score factor for those enrolled. Over time, we plan to move more of the telematics data into the core product, especially where we have those insights at time of quote. Here\u2019s an example. This shows one truck\u2019s driving pattern for 60 days. On the application, the insured\u2019s address and garaging Zip is Elizabeth, New Jersey and they\u2019ve listed their operating radius as 25 miles. Our model would use information closest to that address to determine a territory factor. Some customers at garage there might never go into New York City. This truck goes lots of different places, but it turns out, there\u2019s a fairly regular pattern of going into the city. It\u2019s hard to tell from this map, but from the data, let\u2019s say 75% of the trips go from Elizabeth into New York City before turning around. A territory factor that puts more weight on the New York City experience would be more suitable. Part of our roadmap is to integrate telematics deeper into our model. I don\u2019t see a time we have a telematics only model. We know we get valuable segmentation from non-telematics variables, but there are variables like garaging address and radius, that proxy driving location and where the actual telematics data would be a superior solution. Wrapping up, we\u2019ve got a great start to our telematics journey. We\u2019ve got a significant benefit from the experience and investments our colleagues in personal auto have made. And I\u2019m really excited about how we\u2019ll continue to use telematics to drive competitive advantage going forward. Doug Constantine : This concludes the previously recorded portion of today\u2019s event. We now have members of our management team available for -- available live to answer questions, including presenters Jim Haas and Cory Fischer who can answer questions about the UBI presentation. [Instructions] We will now take our first question. Stacy? Operator : Our first question for today comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Michael Zaremski : Hey. Great. Good morning and thanks for the presentation. A first question, Progressive\u2019s personal auto accident frequency levels appear to be trending a lot better than the industry over the past year. I\u2019m curious if you agree with that statement. And if you do, any thoughts on what\u2019s causing the better than historical average trend line? And I know, clearly, a lot of this call was devoted to segmentation, Progressive is a first mover -- or one of the first movers in telematics. So, that theoretically should, I guess, improve Progressive\u2019s trend-line versus the industry if I\u2019m thinking about things correctly too. But would love to hear more about that. Tricia Griffith : Yes. Mike, I think you\u2019re thinking about it in the right way. A couple caveats. When we report frequency, we report incurred in a lot of our competitors report paid, but we\u2019ve been seeing this trend more negative in the industry for a while. We can\u2019t speculate on a lot of things. Obviously, segmentation is a big piece, we believe. We also believe that mix of business could play a role and that could be mix in states or mix overall from a preferred perspective. We talked in the fourth quarter and in my letter about growth across all of our segments that we started to see increase in Q4. We have seen growth again across all segments, but higher in the Diane\u2019s Wrights and Robinsons. Again, we still see it in Sam\u2019s, but it\u2019s higher, so it could be mix as well. The good news is that we see this data change quickly. So, if we need to change anything we\u2019re doing from a pricing perspective, we\u2019ll see it pretty quickly. John Sauerland : I\u2019d add a couple items on that. So I think Jim Haas\u2019 slide where he showed the retention of customers who are getting a surcharge versus a discount is a great case in point of segmentation at work. So the folks who are getting a surcharge, all else equal, are going to be the higher frequency drivers and the folks who are getting a discount are the lower frequency. And obviously in the marketplace, as that continues to play out, that will help drive our frequency more favorable than our competitors. Additionally, we\u2019ve talked about underwriting efforts we put in place as we were challenged by profitability. We\u2019ve raised rates considerably as we\u2019ve shared. I will note though that we have retained our underwriting restrictions fairly tight. So, we\u2019ve been able to manage that in this very competitive environment to a point where we are able to maintain the underwriting restrictions, which generally speaking are pushing off the higher frequency customers and able to raise rates at the same time. So, I think we are in a pretty good place, both from the rate level perspective but also continuing to guard against segments that might be underpriced. Michael Zaremski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. My follow-up is regarding some of the commentary you made about the automakers. And I know we appreciate that you are not an automaker and you are partnering with them and it\u2019s in the early stages. But I believe you used the word excited about the partnership. And I believe a lot of investors have felt that the automakers could represent a new leg, or new kind of leg of competitiveness within the industry. So curious if you\u2019re having to -- maybe you can shed more light on the partnerships and only if Progressive is having to pay the automakers for this data, why isn\u2019t it a bit of a competitive threat as well? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Yes. Sure, Mike. I\u2019ll let Jim Haas talk a little bit more about that. But we think competition across the board, whether it\u2019s with the OEs or with insure-techs is great. We also feel like when we have partnerships like Jim talked about, it\u2019s really important and it benefits most importantly the consumers. So Jim, do you want to add any color to that? Jim Haas : Sure. Mike, you are right. We obviously pay for the data eventually goes to the automakers, is a way for them to monetize that. They are putting all those hardware in the car that costs money. This is a way for them to get some return on that. Some OEMs are going to want to get an insurance, as we\u2019ve seen, some might not. And so this is a different way for them to get value-add out of that data from us. Operator : Our next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David, you have the floor. David Motemaden : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Tricia, I believe in August you told us that, you thought auto PIF growth in the next couple of years would be difficult to match the 70% type of PIF growth you guys saw in the six years, since the start of the last hard market in 2016. Just wondering if we could get an update on your thoughts on that front, just given the challenges in the marketplace that some of your peers are seeing, some of the losses they have reported and just how you are feeling with your rates and what you are seeing on the new apps? Just wondering how you -- do you still feel that way just on the type of growth that you think we could see over the next five to six years? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, David. I will tell you I feel a lot more bullish than I felt about four or five months ago. We went through reacting to severity trends that frankly we\u2019ve never seen before. I can\u2019t predict what PIF growth will be because we -- there\u2019s a lot of environmental things going on, and what I\u2019ve learned over the last three years is to anticipate that there\u2019s going to be things that we haven\u2019t prepared for, whether it\u2019s the used car prices, inflation, frequency, driving behavior, pandemic. That said, I believe we\u2019re in a really great position as we sit. So, we said, we were going to start to take rate. I think, we foreshadowed that late \u201821. It took some time into 2022 to obviously start to earn into the book. We do feel good, but we\u2019re always watching what\u2019s happening and there\u2019s been kind of an ever-evolving changing. So on the private passenger auto side, as you know, we took 13.5 points last year. We still have about 3 points of that to earn in, in this calendar year. And just for some color, we took 1.5 points in January. So, we continue to look at trends, and the future -- and the future trends and the rate need -- that we need now to match rate to risk. But that said, and John Sauerland added this on to the first question from Mike and that is what --we\u2019re in such a good position now because we have -- there\u2019s a lot of shopping out there, a lot of prospects out there because our competitors have been now raising rates. So, they\u2019re catching up just and sometimes exceeding us. But we\u2019re in just a different position, because we got out in front of it. So, there\u2019s a lot of shopping, a lot of ambient shopping, which is really efficient for us. And what happens with what both Jim and Cory talked about, as well as other variables, we believe we have superior segmentation. So, we\u2019re going to grab onto as many customers and obviously keep as many customers as we can for as long as we can. However, this timeframe in this hard market lasts, and of course that segmentation and the adverse selection flywheel works in our favor because of our many, many decades of investing in things like segmentation, competitive prices, our brand, et cetera. So, while I can\u2019t foreshadow what our PIF growth is going to be, we are going to do everything we can to follow our longstanding goal of growing as fast as we possibly can at our 96 combined ratio and making sure we can take care of our customers. David Motemaden : Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. And maybe just following up there, it sounds like the continuous monitoring that\u2019s been an interesting development that -- I\u2019m interested to hear what sort of impact that has had on underwriting profitability, and growth in the 12 states where you\u2019ve rolled it out. And how we should think about that as you roll it out on more states? Is that something where we can maybe see a step change in terms of profitability or frequency or anything from that perspective just on -- just greater segmentation that you might get from that? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, I think from a cost perspective, obviously continuous is a little bit more expensive, but those costs have gone down over the years. But I think, what we\u2019re excited about and what Jim talked about -- the excitement about is the services that we\u2019re going to provide especially in some of the claims examples. So, we will continue to evolve like we have since 1996 with our UBI products. And we believe that we\u2019ll continue to enhance our ability to out segment our competitors. What that means from the exact amount, we don\u2019t know yet, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor and I\u2019m sure ever so often we\u2019ll update you on where we\u2019re at with our UBI offerings. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Alex Scott : First question I had was just on -- all the potential new business just looking at the application growth and so forth. How is -- how does sort of the growth penalty from new business coming on look in this kind of environment maybe during prior periods? Tricia Griffith : Yes. You know, I\u2019ve been thinking about that a lot because in times where we have high growth, we often talk about the new business penalty. And as I\u2019m thinking about it, penalties from my perspective are something that is done to you because maybe you did something wrong. As an example, Sunday, I was watching our youngest son play Lacrosse. He got a penalty for slashing. He knew it. He was emotional. He did it. He took a knee. We\u2019re a little bit different because the things that we do and the amount that we pay is all controllable. As you witnessed when we pulled back on media and did some other things to make sure we reached our 96. So, from my perspective, what we are paying, so you\u2019ll -- you saw the increase in January and our expense ratio specifically on the direct side because we front load our acquisition costs there. It\u2019s really an investment in our future. It\u2019s an investment for our owners, investment for our customers. So, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re excited to do in terms of how we manage the business? And again, we have the caveats with our ceiling of an aggregate, all business lines, 96 combined ratio. So it\u2019s hard to compare from the past where we\u2019ll go. But we know that this has been a really volatile environment and we have the levers to pull back should we need to and throttle forward should we need to. So, can\u2019t tell you the exact amount. I will tell you that we\u2019re pretty excited about the position we are in right now. And again, we\u2019re Progressive. So, we\u2019re never going to be cocky and we\u2019re always going to be really paranoid and we follow the data maniacally and talk about it all the time. But we are really excited about what we believe this hard market, however long it lasts, brings. Alex Scott : Second question I have maybe a little more applicable to the telematics. When I think through this and the pricing advantage that it gives you over some competitors that are not doing it to the same scale or maybe even just to the industry broadly, I appreciate you probably don\u2019t want to like quantify some of these things, but could you kind of talk to us about directionally has that pricing advantage that it provides, has it expanded because of some of the things you\u2019re doing? Or some of these things that you\u2019re doing just allowing sort of your pricing advantage to be maintained as others begin to do more on the telematics front but not to the same degree? Or is it sort of diminishing as more competitors are just like more broadly adopting telematics? I guess, just high level if you could talk about that. Tricia Griffith : Yes. I\u2019ll talk about it high level and then Jim and Cory can weigh in for their perspective on businesses. But one, it takes a lot to get history of driving behavior and to continuously learn on that. So, I think you have to have a headstart, which is why we sort of did a primer on the history of where we\u2019ve been. We were out ahead of it, obviously, nearly three decades ago. A couple points though, I think the -- and one that Jim made is, I think it\u2019s important to make sure that we are pricing rate to risk. So although customers are never happy when they get a surcharge, when they do and if they go somewhere else again, that\u2019s adverse selection. So there is multiple pieces of not just the, N equals 1, but also what can happen from a competitive perspective. So, to be able to have the UBI as well as our other segmentations to truly understand that rate to risk in what John talked about with our underwriting acumen is also an important piece. I think it\u2019s probably more important on the commercial line side from the perspective of, if I\u2019m a good driver and I drive a truck, can I save money on my insurance, which is a big cost in the commercial line? So I don\u2019t know if Jim or Cory, you want to add anything? Jim Haas : Personal Lines side, yes, there is certainly more activity in UBI than there was 10 years ago, let\u2019s say. We are just continuing to move our pricing forward, price more aggressively, take more advantage of that regardless of what anybody else is doing. We want to price as accurately as we can, and get as many people into that program as we can. Cory Fischer : Yes. Thanks, Alex. So for commercial auto, we are the largest commercial auto insurer and we are also number one in truck. And I think with that, we have a lot more data than anyone else. And so, we have, we feel like a leadership position in segmentation. I think telematics extends that leadership position relative to the marketplace. So, there are some companies that are investing in telematics. But I think between our size, the amount of data we have, we believe we are increasing the lead through telematics. John Sauerland : I\u2019ll just add. So, over the history of the personal auto, evolution in telematics, early on, we weren\u2019t pricing to the full curve. So, we understood that a lot of people should be receiving surcharges, and some people should be receiving bigger discounts. Because we were at the forefront and we are seeking consumer adoption, we didn\u2019t price to that full curve. I think we are now very close to or almost completely pricing to that curve with the data we have today. However, as Jim was sharing, we can continue to advance the science, continue to pull additional data elements that can continue to have us leading the pack. So, our segmentation game is never ending. We are always trying to continue to advance, to find additional data to use that can keep us with a gap between us and the competition. And as Cory mentioned in the prepared comments with the slides, Commercial Lines is at an earlier stage similar to where Personal Lines was. We still have a significant loss ratio benefit in aggregate for telematics and Commercial Lines, which means, we have further pricing options that we can play as competitors come to market with their offering. So, I think we are in a great place from a telematics standpoint. We are not at all at the end of the journey. We are going to continue to evolve and continue to advance our competitive advantage, when it comes to pricing and telematics. Tricia Griffith : I\u2019ll add one last thing just because I think this is a subtle nuance, so really important. And Cory mentioned it a couple of times. When he\u2019s thinking about telematics in his role, in his prior role and Commercial Lines, he\u2019s talking to Jim and their team. He referred to his colleagues and learnings that they have. This is really common and very specific when you think about our strategic pillars. One is our people and our culture. Our culture is to go back and forth, whether it\u2019s talent and rotational jobs, but understanding learnings from the first movers within the company. That is really key, and I think it\u2019s really different because many of us -- I think Lori Niederst prior to her role when she prior to her role when she was in CHRO, she shared many years ago, the amount of depth in our leadership ranks because we think it\u2019s really important for people to know many sides of the business. So although it\u2019s subtle and it\u2019s hard to measure, the way our culture is and the way our leaders work and the sharing of ideas and successes and opportunities is really important, especially in something like telematics. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Andrew Kligerman : Hey. Thanks a lot. Really helpful answer to that prior question, but I\u2019d like to elaborate on it a bit. And just thinking about the fact that -- I don\u2019t know, maybe 80%, 90% plus of the insured Personal Lines population utilizes Cambridge Mobile Telematics. I understand that Progressive\u2019s data and analytics is incredibly robust, the segmentation, you talked about history and data use. But the competitors can see all that. So my question is this replicatable in a very fast fashion? What makes it so hard not to replicate given that you\u2019re all using a similar platform? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I\u2019ll let Jim talk about that more. Similar platform doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re all using the same data or the same models or using the data in the same way. So one, it\u2019s expensive to get into this. Over these last three years, we\u2019ve invested a lot. So, you just can\u2019t all of a sudden turn on, understand your data early on, it\u2019s different. In urban and rural, it\u2019s different with your other segmentation variables. But Cambridge is the platform, but we\u2019re not all sharing the same data and outputting the same exact thing. Jim, do you want to add anything? Jim Haas : Sure. You\u2019re right. Cambridge Mobile is our partner. We\u2019ve had a great relationship with them. They provide the data collection mechanism that gets embedded in the app. And so, we do get that data from them. And you\u2019re right, most people use them in the industry. I think, what\u2019s different is we own our own algorithm. We use that data the way we want to, and we\u2019ve learned a lot over the years about how to make the most out of that data. And I think you mentioned like everybody can see that. That\u2019s not actually true. Most -- in the entire industry, most algorithms for UBI are filed confidentially in the states. So, those are not shared with all of the competitors. So, we can\u2019t see other companies\u2019 algorithms, they can\u2019t see ours. So, we think we can -- we\u2019ve developed an advantage there, and we can maintain that. We also have an OBD device which we offer some of our customers pick, which gives us another source of data, which we think helps calibrate some of that as well. Andrew Kligerman : Very helpful. And that\u2019s pretty amazing, your accident response product, where you\u2019ve got under 12 minutes to solve for some of the stuff on site. I\u2019m wondering if you could share with us the fact that the impact on LAE and severity, any loss numbers? Anything you could share there to gain some insight into how that affects your loss ratios? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think that\u2019s just too new. We\u2019re just really dipping into this. We\u2019ll probably have more on that in 18 to 24 months. Again, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re interested in. We\u2019ve always been since probably 30 years ago want to make sure that we\u2019re there for our customers and their greatest time of need. So, our -- the biggest thing that we want to do there is to help our customers get help when they need it. And if we can use the data from the impact to start the claim going and get them back into the position they were before the accident, give them that peace of mind. That\u2019s pretty important. And that could relate to a lot of great benefits in terms of retention, et cetera. But again, way too soon to be able to share much on that and we\u2019ll probably have more in a few years. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. And just real quickly, you mentioned 40% increased usage in UBI. Could you tell us the percent adoption, a percent of the overall book of business that you have? Tricia Griffith : From the new perspective, which is what we share externally, it\u2019s higher in direct. Jim, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, about 15% in the agency channel. A little bit lower? Okay. A little bit lower in the agency channel, and then more in the direct. We offer it to everyone in the direct channel coming in. And obviously, we work with over 40,000 independent agents. Some feel more comfortable making that offering. Not all do it, but we\u2019ve seen an increase since 2019, which makes sense. And it\u2019s a perfect fix if you believe that you drive safely and maybe you\u2019re driving less often for new business across the board as other inflationary pressures hit consumers. John Sauerland : I\u2019d just add that. So in the direct channel, the take rate is substantially higher than in the agency channel. It also offers that in the commercial space the demand through the agency channel is very robust. So, we\u2019re talking about, especially with Smart Haul, which is generally larger trucks that have higher average insurance costs, the benefit of enrolling in a program like this is substantial. So, agents and consumers or business owners in this case are way more likely to select that as an option and as Cory said is highly predictive in that channel as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, Tricia, goes to some of your initial comments, right? You said that future rate would be driven by loss trend. I mean, I realize that it\u2019s a very volatile environment these days, but what are your expectations for loss trend when we think about 2023? Tricia Griffith : We will just continue to watch it. That\u2019s why I wanted to give you a little bit of insight in January taking 1.5 points. What we know is that we closely monitor a lot of these trends. And I mentioned a bunch of them. It\u2019s been such a volatile several years that we look at our internal data, UBI data, macroeconomic trends, all I can tell you is that we will be able to react quickly and that\u2019s sort of embedded in everything that we\u2019ve done in the last 85 years. So, when we start to see those or see those trends and experience those trends, we\u2019ll react quickly. And that\u2019s why we feel like we\u2019re in a good position because we were able to react quickly to the severity trends that we started to see in late 2021 and why we\u2019re sitting in the position -- the enviable position we\u2019re in now, to be able to profitably grow. Elyse Greenspan : And then on the UBI side, I thought most of this was opted into right for new business customers. And I know that\u2019s where you just gave some of the percentage. If you\u2019re at current Progressive customer at renewal or just during the length of your policy, can you opt in and choose to use a Snapshot product, if you want to try to lower your rate? Tricia Griffith : Yes. And we actually did. It was in, I think 2021, maybe or 2022. I\u2019m not sure exactly when we did, but we actually sent out material to our current customers, when trends started to change to make sure that they had that offering. And we had a small group except that. But yes, we want to be able to provide that if it makes sense for each driver. But it\u2019s normally a new business. John Sauerland : Yes. That was when we saw COVID driving down materially and made an offer to our existing customers to save through Snapshot and not many took us up on that offer. So it\u2019s open and available. Customers can do it. They just haven\u2019t taken us up on it significantly. Elyse Greenspan : And then one more quick one. So you guys mentioned the new product is continuously monitoring. So the state that you\u2019re active in with that Snapshot product, anyone that uses Snapshot has to be continuously monitored or can they opt into a different monitoring period? Jim Haas : So when they opt into the program, it is -- there is only continuous. You don\u2019t get to pick at that. Obviously, we can\u2019t force them to continue to monitor forever. So, we\u2019ve got sort of -- the program is designed around that and accommodates when people stop giving us data, if they do, but we certainly encourage them to continue to grow that data. The biggest discounts are available that way and the program\u2019s design that we\u2019d be monitoring continuously. Operator : Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Tracy, you have the floor. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Even though you feel like you\u2019ve approached rate adequacy in most states, I\u2019m wondering, since you are growing quite quickly with lower ad spend, could you get away with getting even more rate? I mean, you did mention some of your competitors are exceeding you guys with rates. Do you feel like, it\u2019s fine to be cheaper than some, given your risk selection? Tricia Griffith : Well, we want to be competitive and we want to price to future loss trends. So, we continue to look at that and we will increase rates, should we see severity or frequency trends change, and that\u2019s why I did give that data point in January. So we will stay on top of trends and we will continue to grow. And like John said, we haven\u2019t opened up our aperture in terms of not looking at things that are important from our underwriting perspective. So we still have more leverage from that perspective. But now to -- for me, it is all about using the data and pricing accurately as quickly as possible to match each rate to risk. Tracy Benguigui : Got it. Could you also touch upon your initiative to raise retention amongst multiproduct customers that was mentioned in your filing yesterday? What are the key tenants to achieve that? Tricia Griffith : We know that our customers and I think most consumers with insurance want stable rates. And so we want to be able to have, if possible, even in this kind of volatile environment what we call, small bites of the apple, to not have to increase rates like we had to in 2022 to stay ahead of trends. We also have very many offerings. So, we have whether it is in our Progressive Advantage Agency for we have a stable carrier of home, unaffiliated partners we work with to have more and more of those bundles, Wrights and Robinsons, we will continue to do that. And we really seek long-term to be sort of the destination company. And so whether it\u2019s on our paper or not, we think of that in terms of our pillar of being where, when and how our customers want to shop and buy, so broad coverage. So, on the Personal Lines side, we sell other people\u2019s home, company when it doesn\u2019t necessarily say where we\u2019re going to go. On the Commercial Lines side, we also use our product as well as others for a small business, workers\u2019 comp, GL, et cetera. So, it really is about following the customer and the more we\u2019re able to offer them, even with the Progressive Advantage Agency where it\u2019s -- we work with a lot of different partners ranging from life insurance to travel insurance to jewelry insurance, the more that the customers have and the more that we\u2019ve earned their trust, the longer they stay. So, retention continues to be the holy grail. We\u2019re seeing positive improvement. We\u2019ll continue to report on that as the quarters unfold, but we do know two parts of retention are really about having stable rates and having great service. Tracy Benguigui : Great. And is there a segment you\u2019re focusing more on? Agency, will that be more a focus versus direct? Tricia Griffith : No. We focus across the board. They\u2019re a little bit different in terms of control. So, an agent can decide if they want to shop it on behalf of the consumer, but they\u2019re looking at the same thing as consumers are. And that\u2019s making sure that our mutual customers have stable rates with a company with a great brand and great service. But our goal is to extend PLEs across every segment individually and in the aggregate. John Sauerland : As Tricia was saying, Tracy, we\u2019re continuing to broaden the offerings to our consumers. So, you talked about multi-product households as Tricia was implying those households stay with us a lot longer than single-product households and much longer than our historical core customer of Sam, who we call the inconsistently insured customer. So, our book does continue to shift more towards the Robinson end of the spectrum which is actually the longer retaining end of the spectrum. We have, as Tricia also noted, seen a setback as we\u2019ve had to raise rates aggressively. That is coming back. Our PLEs are starting to trend positively at least on the trailing 3 metric. And the trailing 12 is not yet fully turned, but certainly the trailing 3 is the leading indicator of the trailing 12. So, we are definitely focusing on more multi-product households as we roll out new products in the personal auto space. Increasingly, we find segmentation that can make us more competitive for those preferred customers. Our book continues to shift that way. And as we get to a more stable rating environment, I think you\u2019ll see our PLEs continue to grow as they have been before we had to take a lot of rate. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Shanker at Bank of America. Josh Shanker : Could you please give some insight? You have the policy conversion and new application numbers for the full year 2022, but it seems like something inflected in the fourth quarter. Can you give some indication on what\u2019s happening fourth quarter versus fourth quarter 2021 in quote conversion and new policy apps and maybe into \u201823 as well? Tricia Griffith : Yes. We don\u2019t publish new apps on a quarterly basis, but we did want to show it for year-over-year in the opening slides we had. Basically, what happened was shopping started, the hard market started. We were in a good position, and there\u2019s a lot of prospects that began shopping. And we had good coverage at great rates and we were able to convert. So, it\u2019s really sort of when we started to see things turn. We were in a good position for that from a staffing perspective on the sales side and the claims side. But yes, that\u2019s really kind of when we saw the hard market churn. John, you want to add anything? John Sauerland : Sure. Josh, we do provide you year to date numbers through the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So, if you just assume an equal weighting, you can come to a number, but we also in the presentation showed you actual charts of those. So, you can\u2019t see exactly what the number is, but you come pretty darn close by looking at those charts. So, the short story is conversion was up considerably in the fourth quarter. Prospects were up considerably in the fourth quarter, and obviously new apps as a consequence were up a lot. Josh Shanker : And question for the commercial side. Since acquiring Protective, can you talk a little bit about your large fleet offering and how that\u2019s changed? John Sauerland : Can you repeat the question, please? Josh Shanker : I\u2019m sorry. The question was, how has large fleet changed as part of your business since acquiring Protective? Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Not substantially. Yes. I mean, we\u2019re still learning a lot and the integration\u2019s going really well, and it was really something that was additive to what we were growing from our small fleet. So, we continue to be excited about the acquisition of Protective and will continue. And I\u2019ve met a couple times with Mike Miller, who\u2019s running Protective. He came from the commercial line side and is now running that. So he\u2019ll be excited to have his growth plan in play. We\u2019ve been focusing in the last year, so really on integrating the company within Progressive at large. Operator : Our next question is coming from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Great. Two related questions, I think. This is on slide 26 with a 15% participation discount. The first is I was hoping you could talk us through what underpinned the decision to raise the discount. I would\u2019ve probably naively guessed that incremental information has less marginal utility. And the second question is all of equal, if I\u2019m a bad driver and I get a surcharge, then I get a bigger participation discount, then how does that factor into I guess retention and profitability? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I\u2019ll let Jim talk about that. I think the larger discount is what John was saying. We\u2019re pricing to the curve -- to the full curve. And so we know those customers are -- have great driving behaviors and we\u2019re going to add them. And of course, the adverse election is on the drivers that are not so good in the surcharges. Do you want anything, Jim? Jim Haas : Sure. Yes. Raised the participation discount, in part we\u2019re going to continue as we\u2019re asking customers to do more in that case, and we wanted to encourage them. And the participation discount creates a larger incentive for that. As for how it would relate if you ultimately got a surcharge on the renewal term, the participation discount is only for the first term. So it\u2019s removed, when you get to the renewal. And so, a bad driver is now getting a larger surcharge and they\u2019re getting a larger discount removed off the first term, which would get us priced more accurately on them in the subsequent terms, which is the goal. So, the participation discount is there to encourage people to participate, and then we just price as accurately as we can on the subsequent terms. Meyer Shields : Second question, I\u2019m thinking of California, but there may be other regions where rating flexibility is limited. It seems like the economic benefits are of UBI monitoring are enormous. Is there a chance of getting this incorporated into the rating algorithms for more risky states? Tricia Griffith : We\u2019d love to be in California. That\u2019s kind of a history from a lot of the proposition 103, things that came up many, many decades ago. We want to grow in California. We talked about that a lot. It\u2019s the most populous state. But in the meantime, we will continue to work with the department to get the rates that we need to make sure that we reach our target profit margins. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Paul, go ahead with your question. Paul Newsome : Good morning. Thanks for the call. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about if the telematics, particularly the continuous use of telematics are allowing you to effectively change prices faster if the environment changes without having to actually file a rate change. It sounds like that\u2019s possible, but I don\u2019t know enough about how the formulas work for telematics products to know if you can effectively react to environmental changes through the telematics product without actually changing the filing? Tricia Griffith : Good question, Paul. I\u2019ll let Jim take that. Jim Haas : Paul, you\u2019re right. The customer is continuously monitoring and they\u2019re driving changes dramatically, like because of a pandemic or something like that, the telematics rating on the renewal would pick that up over time. In terms of the effect of that, you have to just -- we just started to roll out continuous last year. For the first six months, it looks just like it did before, it\u2019s not until the renewal that it changes, a lot of the states we elevated were towards the back half of the year. So they\u2019re just coming up on their first renewal, so. And then you need to build up a bigger -- that will grow over time to be a bigger share of the in-force book. But right now, it\u2019s still early days of that. So it will be a little while before that\u2019s like a really effective mechanism for that. Plus, we would need to get the rate on all the people who aren\u2019t in UBI, we would do that through traditional means. Paul Newsome : Can you talk about how quickly you can change the algorithm as well? Is that something that means that something can go into a filing or we effectively just change the algorithm for both the continuous and the non-continuous, if you see an environmental change of some type? Jim Haas : Typically, that\u2019s sort of filing. We file the algorithm of the states confidentially and that\u2019s typically how that would be done. Paul Newsome : Great. Thank you. That was my questions. These are wonderful calls. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Gregory Peters : Most of my telematics questions have been answered. Tricia, in one of your comments you talked about media spend. I know you guys go through an annual budget. Can you talk to us about your perspective on your advertising media budget for 2023 versus 2022? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So, I mean, we absolutely do a budget, but then ongoing, we assess it based on the efficiency of the spend. We look at our targeted acquisition cost, our cost per sale and then -- and kind of where we\u2019re getting the business from. So I talked a little bit about ambient shopping, which, of course, is really efficient. We\u2019re in a little bit more of that position now. But, what we will do is as the year progresses, we will continually assess what we need to do to spend more if we believe it\u2019s efficient or pull back if we believe we\u2019re butting up against our 96 ceiling. And those are conversations that happen continuously. Some things we -- to get sort of advanced discounts we pay for upfront. So those are kind of -- those spend. But we have a lot of flexibility, especially on the digital side to bolt back should we need to, like you saw in the last year. So, we have a budget, it\u2019s fluid. And over the years, it can go up or down depending on what we believe is in the best interest of profitably growing the Company. Gregory Peters : Does that answer mean that the budget is higher for \u201823 versus \u201822? I\u2019m not sure what it means. Tricia Griffith : At this point in time, it could be higher. I mean things changed. So, it was higher last year. If you would have asked me this last January, I said it would be higher than the year before, but it didn\u2019t end up being that because we had to make some flexibility. So, we budget for what we think can happen with a lot of flexibility. John Sauerland : A couple of adds there. So it\u2019s -- I would characterize it as dynamic and opportunistic. So, to the extent we feel we\u2019re adequately priced, we\u2019re going to spend a lot more on advertising. Again, with as Tricia said, an eye towards our targeted acquisition cost that we priced into the product and our lifetime economics on those policies. But, if you look at our expense ratio, especially our direct expense ratio for January, as an example, you can see it was up. So, clearly, through the latter part of last year as we were working hard to ensure we hit our 96 combined ratio for the year, you saw that expense ratio drop which was driven to a large degree by lower advertising costs. In January, you saw that pop back up, which is a great indicator that we\u2019re spending more on advertising right now. Gregory Peters : Okay. My second question was on reinsurance. Now, the market\u2019s hard that you\u2019ve had. Obviously, reinsurance is an important part of your story last year. Can you talk to us about your perspective on reinsurance and how it might change this year versus last year? Tricia Griffith : Yes, absolutely. We have Brandon [ph] here who runs our reinsurance organization. So, I\u2019ll have him weigh in. Unidentified Company Representative : Thanks for the question on reinsurance. I mean, I think we -- particularly with how we adapted to the placement at 1/1, we\u2019ll carry that forward to how we look to our June placement, which is really the core part of our program. We tend to be fairly conservative in how we want to retain property cat losses. I think we\u2019ll continue that. We\u2019ll have to be flexible in what the market is willing to offer as far as how we can tailor that to what we decide to purchase. Gregory Peters : Does that mean you\u2019re going to have a higher deductible or a lower deductible? Unidentified Company Representative : It\u2019s a little early to say exactly where we\u2019re going to land on that. Certainly, the bottom end of reinsurance programs have seen a lot of pressure, not just this year but over the last couple of years. We will be looking at other creative options if need be to manage our retention. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Ward with Citi. Michael Ward : I did have a question on telematics, specifically the OEM data and vehicles. Just curious if you have any data on the capabilities of the existing vehicles on the road in the U.S. It just -- it seems like that might be limited to more newer vehicles with cellular data connections, which I get the sense might be -- at least currently might be a fairly small chunk of the vehicle population in the U.S., just given turnover. So, just wondering if you can elaborate on that at all. Jim Haas : Yes, you\u2019re correct. The firm we\u2019re talking about depends upon vehicles with the cellular connection as we\u2019re referring to OEMs over the last several years have been investing in that. They\u2019re in really different places depending on the OEM. Some are -- have had been there for a number of years, some are still working on it. So, it\u2019s -- and it does take a while for the fleet to turn over. So, it\u2019s very focused on a few OEMs and the most recent model years. But as we mentioned, we\u2019ve got relationships with GM and Toyota, which are two of the larger ones. They\u2019ve got more of an installed base. And we expect other -- almost every OEM is moving in this direction. So we expect that this population will grow over time. Michael Ward : And then maybe could you discuss kind of the take-up between OEM data versus using the mobile phone app route? It just seems like there\u2019s more hurdles involved in the mobile app, and that maybe that\u2019s why take-up wasn\u2019t great initially. And so sort of curious about how you see those 2 trending? Jim Haas : Adoption in the whole program overall has been up, and we\u2019re happy with the adoption of both mobile and OEM. So we\u2019re happy with both of those programs. We just offer different options to consumers depending on how they want to share that data. And so we\u2019re just trying to get the biggest footprint we can and both have been increasing. Michael Ward : Okay. So maybe just to elaborate on that. I think you guys mentioned that the take-up or the adoption wasn\u2019t great for existing customers. And so, I\u2019m just curious what -- why might it be great for new customers than -- is part of it, just the competitors raising rates currently or the shopping is up? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I would just say it\u2019s one of the things that new business when you\u2019re asking for a bunch of data to kind of assess the rate to risk. When I talked about the current customers, we were doing that in 2020 because we knew people were struggling with their finances. Everything was going up from groceries to et cetera. So we did sort of a marketing campaign and just most people didn\u2019t do it. I think you get sort of -- just like anything, whether it\u2019s life insurance or health insurance you sort of make that decision and then you stick with it. It\u2019s something you don\u2019t necessarily want to do again. So, it\u2019s just easier to do a new business when we\u2019re acquiring all the information we need for an accurate rate. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous. Ryan Tunis : I had a couple on just the UBI stuff. So, the first one, just thinking about the collision detection. I\u2019m curious if maybe that could potentially have some kind of impact on frequency because I would think that there\u2019d be a lot of customers with kind of smaller dollar claims that wouldn\u2019t want to tell their insurance company, they got in the crash and just to keep their -- the rates where they are. So is there any possibility that you knowing that they got in the crash that potentially lead to you actually getting more claims in the door? Jim Haas : Yes. Thank you, Ryan. It\u2019s a good question. In this particular case, the way the crash detection algorithm works, it\u2019s looking really for more severe accidents. It\u2019s not trying to pick up fender benders. So, these are claims that we fully expect would have gotten reported either way. These aren\u2019t small dollar claims, where somebody might just choose either not to repair or to handle it out of pocket. These are larger claims. So, we don\u2019t think of it. We think we\u2019ve gotten these claims anyway. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then I guess just thinking about some of the telematics. So one question I had was for the drivers that you find giving really big discounts to be like 40%, what -- if you look at like kind of the traditional insurance rating variables you used that are not in telematics space, I don\u2019t know, ZIP code, FICO, whatever, can you draw any conclusions about like when you\u2019re giving really big discounts to customers, which of the variables tend to have been kind of the shakiest predictive indicators? That\u2019s the first part. And then also I was just curious about is when you find yourself giving a surcharge for the continuous, like six months later, you gave the discount, how you\u2019re giving a surcharge, what are the main reasons that you\u2019re finding that you\u2019re having to give a surcharge after getting a discount? Jim Haas : So, on the first part of your question in terms of how -- what are the traditional variables and what it informs, the whole point of UBI that is incremental to all of that. So, if we could have seen that these variables without UBI, we\u2019re inaccurate, we would have fixed it. UBI gives us new information about that customer that the traditional variables tend to let you segment further, not just live in the ZIP code or they have this credit score. But this person within that is different than the other person that otherwise looks the same. So, that\u2019s the point, it\u2019s improving the segmentation. In terms of the surcharge, the discount we give is a participation discount, which is just for signing up. And so, if they move from the discount surcharge, it\u2019s simply because we\u2019ve then gotten that driving data and continuous model, theoretically, people could move from one to the other. But in terms of why someone will get a surcharge, our model, as we kind of share on the website, it uses things like hard braking, how much you drive, when you drive variables like that. So folks who tend to get a surcharge drive more and drive -- have more hard brakes. This is a sign of how aggressively they\u2019re driving. Those are typically some of the variables that figure into that. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And just I guess following up, so I hear you it\u2019s incremental. But what about just in terms of conclusion, is it usually -- can you say anything about those who get 40% tend to largely be much more preferred or those who get kind of in the 40% discount tend to be more mixed or tend to be a little bit more on -- a little bit less standard? Jim Haas : I think the UBI is kind of showing us it\u2019s incremental to all of that. So the -- intentionally, we don\u2019t want it to look that way. We want it to be -- if we knew the preferred customers were more likely to get the discount, we\u2019d just give them a bigger discount in the first place. So, we try to use UBI to kind of sort out this preferred customer deserves an even bigger discount. This other preferred customer deserves maybe a surcharge. So, it\u2019s really -- it\u2019s segmenting beyond what we already have. Doug Constantine : We\u2019ve exhausted our scheduled time. And so that concludes our event. Stacy, I will hand the call back over to you for closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter investor event.

    "content": "\ufeff Douglas Constantine : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's First Quarter Investor Event. I'm Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be a moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and a letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company website. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60-minute schedule for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 60-minute schedule for this event for live questions and answers with members of our leadership team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as supplemented by our 10-Q report for the first quarter 2023, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia? Susan Griffith : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. One of the enduring lessons since the onset of the pandemic is the uncertainty of the future. Since March 2020, the world and our business have been pummeled by unforeseen events. In that vein is perhaps poetic that 3 years post pandemic, we continue to have to manage through the unexpected in our business. In the end, I'm confident that our resilience will see us through.  Through the first quarter, we're not on track to achieve our calendar year goal of a 96 combined ratio. Given our extensive history of meeting our stated goals, this has prompted many questions about how we got here and where we're going. As such, in lieu of a more traditional opening statement, I'll instead provide answers to some questions that have been asked by the investment analysts. My hope is that you will gain a clear understanding of how we are addressing the challenges as well as the urgency with which we are acting. The first question is, how are you reacting to being above your target of a 96 calendar year combined ratio. The answer to that is we will react to the same way we always have with speed and decisiveness. The 3 largest levers we have to manage our margin are to decrease our expense ratio, tighten our verification and underwriting scrutiny of new business and increased rates. I'll address these in that order. Our largest controllable variable expense is advertising spend, and we are taking action to reduce these costs, which we expect could both slow growth and help to reduce our expense ratio. Once we are confident that we can deliver our target calendar year profitability, we will consider resuming our spend. While we won't provide details on which segments of media we are reducing or how this may affect growth going forward, I will tell you that we've invested in bringing the same industry-leading science from the pricing side of our business to the acquisition side, and we'll continue to spend in the places that we believe have the greatest benefit to the business. Using non-rate actions such as tighter verification and underwriting standards and limiting bill plan options, will reduce our growth in the segments we believe we can't currently write at our target margins.  Finally, our largest and slowest moving lever is rates. In quarter 1, we took 4 points of rate in Personal Auto on an aggregate country-wide basis, and we are still earning in some of the prior year rate increases. We plan to take aggressive rate increases where needed across all lines through the balance of 2023 to ensure we're pricing to deliver our target profit margin. The next question, given the actions we will take to meet our profit target is, what will this do to growth? First and foremost, keep in mind that growth in the first quarter of 2023 was an all-time high for the company, and we are very proud of that. Secondly, we are still in a very hard market with lots of consumers quoting their insurance. We also continue to see ambient shopping. While policy growth may be slowed by our actions, we still anticipate there will continue to be robust demand for our products. Of course, the actions of our competitors also play a role in what growth will be. So I won't speculate on specific growth predictions. However, you can rest assured that we are focused on growing policies that we believe will meet or exceed our target margins. Lastly, we've received many questions like this one. Do you now believe your reserving is adequate? Or said another way, you said that you were confident that the biggest rate increases were behind you, what changed? The answer is fairly basic. We started seeing data come in over the last few months that was not in line with what we were anticipating, which caused us to increase reserves and react with rate increases.  In Personal Lines, our reserve strengthening happened largely in the short-tailed fixing vehicle coverages. In these coverages, we can recognize and react to new trends relatively quickly, and we feel good about our reserve levels today. That being said, reserves are estimates and change over time based on evolving trends. As for the effects of Florida House Bill 837. In March, we estimated the reserve changes we believe we needed to capture the effect of the legislation, including the flood of lawsuits triggered by the law change. The reserve increases we took in March represented our best estimate of what we believe would be the full effect of the lawsuits on loss costs for prebill accident periods. Going forward, we believe the legislation takes positive steps to help manage the cost of auto insurance for Florida consumers. However, the situation is evolving, and we will continue to assess and react to information as it develops. In Commercial Lines, again, we believe we are adequately reserved today and are monitoring trends in frequency and severity to ensure we remain adequately reserved. Of course, any assumption on reserve adequacy comes with a caveat that trends can change. If they do, we will react to them as appropriate. The follow-up to the reserving adequacy question is, how did you miss reserving trends in the recent past? And given that, how can you be confident in your current reserve adequacy? I'll address these questions individually. The business of insurance is predicting the future. We never know our full cost of goods sold until years after premiums are collected. As such, our reserves are, by nature, estimates of our exposures based on assumptions. We use historical data, extensive knowledge about our business and customers and advanced analytics to predict ultimate loss costs usually with an extremely high degree of accuracy. Predicting the future is hard, however, and we didn't fully predict trends that developed during the quarter. We saw higher-than-expected severity trends in previously closed claims in Personal Auto, primarily in fixing vehicle coverages. While I won't speculate on why these trends change, I can tell you that we reacted quickly and decisively to adjust our reserves for these short-tail coverages. I'm confident in the people and processes we have in place to ensure we're adequately reserved.  For the 5 years ending 2022, prior year reserve development averaged about 0.25 points unfavorable on our year-end combined ratio, which I believe supports the statement that we always strive to set reserves adequately. Hopefully, these questions and answers address some of the most sought-after explanations of the first quarter. Rest assured that no one is more acutely aware of the results of the first quarter than myself, my team and all the people at Progressive. I continue to be confident in the long-term direction we're headed, and I a little doubt will continue to do everything we can to achieve our goals. Thank you again for joining us, and I will now take your questions. A - Douglas Constantine : This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO. Michael Zaremski : Thanks for the helpful prepared remarks. As a follow-up to the Florida comments, can you elaborate on the legislation? You said the situation is evolving. But you said -- you also said you feel that the legislation is positive. So now ultimately, sometimes past, has there been less claims in Florida in April due to the legislation. Do you feel like it has teeth and there could be kind of a payback for the charges that were taken to the influx of claims? Susan Griffith : Good question, Mike, thanks. So we think the long-term effects of the legislation as it's written today would be very positive for the consumers of Florida. In the meantime, we're very familiar with the plaintiff bar, and we don't know that they will not try to challenge those. So what we did in March was we took a look at the fact that more lawsuits were being filed. And every time we consider our cost we look at, is it estimable and probable. And that's why we strengthened the reserve for possible and likely lawsuits that are going to occur between the time that the governor talked about the legislative bill and the time that he signed it.  In fact, in March, there were 280,000 lawsuits filed in Florida, not ours, overall in Florida, civil lawsuits, which is up nearly 130%, the all-time high of May 2021. So significant lawsuits. So short term, we are going to prepare to obviously get through those long term, this will be good. So a couple of good things that came out of the House Bill 837. Comparative laws changed from pure to modify comparatives. So if you're greater than 50%, you don't collect. The statute limitations is from 4 years to 2 years. There's a safe harbor for bad faith, which is really important to us because it takes some time when you get into claim to actually gather the information to make to actually start to negotiate if there's a demand and probably most importantly, repealing one way attorney fees. There's a little bit more than that, but we think those are really good. In the short term, though, we -- this could evolve, and we don't know if it will be challenged. And so we will just react accordingly as we have more information. But overall, we feel very good about the law changes, and we think it's really good more importantly for the consumers of Florida. Michael Zaremski : Got it. That's helpful. And my final follow-up, I know you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but pivoting to Personal Lines growth, which has been excellent. I'm trying to juxtapose the comments you made -- what we're seeing is the new applications that appear to be record levels with kind of your comments about needing to take maybe some corrective actions. It sounds like you still feel like Progressive will be a meaningful market share CAGR. I don't want to put words in your mouth. Would that be ultimately, there's more shopping and on average, Progressive's rates are lower than most of your customers. So as long as the industry is taking a lot of rate, you still feel good about the absolute level of growth. Susan Griffith : Yes. I mean I think at any time you reduce advertising, the likelihood of growth on subsiding a little bit is going to happen. We see that in our data. And we have seen our competitors take rate compared to us and even more so -- even more than us. So the hard market really has to do with our people shopping, and they are. So we do feel still bullish on our growth. Let me give you a couple of key stats because I didn't talk about those. I talked a little bit about the new apps, which were tremendous in the all-time history of the company. But let me give you a couple of other interesting stats that we feel really incredible about. So this quarter, we grew policies in force $1.4 million. We grew premium $2.6 billion, which is approximately like 1 point of market share. If you look at even like a 12-month span, we've grown more than $5 billion. And if you think about that, that's the size of a top 10 carrier. So those are a couple I think, interesting an extraordinary tidbits that we feel good about. Also, when you look at growth, you're going to look at both unit growth and premium growth. So maybe unit growth subsides a little bit, we really don't know. We just know that sometimes when you reduce advertising, when you increase advertising, there's the inverse relationship. But there's also premium growth. So as we take more rate to get to our target profit margin, you're going to see some premium growth. And ultimately, our goal is that you'll also see our margins widen. John Sauerland : Mike, the one point I'd add on that is, we don't live in a vacuum, obviously. And our actions I would say, all else equal, will certainly adversely affect growth, less advertising dollars, higher rates for sure. But as we saw last year, as the competitive marketplace was in a bit of disarray even with our aggressive actions, we saw growth. So it will remain to be seen what our competitors do in this environment that we are currently experiencing and if they react aggressively as well, then obviously, our growth won't be as adversely affected. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, I wanted to get some additional color on the magnitude of additional rates you guys are looking to take from here. In the 10-Q and in your comments, you mentioned being aggressive with rates, raising rates over the remainder of the year. So more specifically, like within Personal Auto, when you say aggressive rates, is that in the low single digits, in the high single digits? Can you just give us a sense of the magnitude of rate increases you're now expecting to take? Susan Griffith : Sure. I assume that would come up when I didn't give a number. we're going to take as much rate as we need to try to get to our target profit margin. I believe what we've shown, not just over this inflationary period, but over decades with Progressive, that we execute on our ability to do that. We have a great pricing group, a great rate revision group. So we know we can do that. Now there's all the caveats of regulatory approval, what can happen with weather, which could increase or decrease our desire to have more rates. And of course, it's very specific state, channel product, et cetera. What I would say at this point in time, and again, all the caveats that this is really quite a dynamic time. We think we'll take in the neighborhood of around 10 more points this year to catch up and stay ahead of trend in private passenger auto. So low single digits. But again, that could be 8% to 12%. We don't know. Right now, that's our plan as of today. We're watching as things unfold. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then could you maybe break down your business for us, the portion you just said, right, 8% to 12% price needed, but the portion of the book that needs rate versus perhaps the portion that you're still looking to grow in? Is there a way to kind of give us a sense of which percentage, and I'm really concerned in talking about Personal Auto, would still perhaps be where you might be looking to grow versus the portion where you just think you need these aggressive level of rate? Susan Griffith : Yes. From an auto perspective, we always want to grow as fast as we can, but we are limited sometimes with the regulatory approvals. So obviously, there are places where we haven't got as much rate as we've needed, think the Coast, which we've talked about before, going to need more on those because we've been waiting for some rate increases in some of those states. Some are less where we feel like we're ahead of it. We don't really want to go into details, but suffice it to say, on a country-wide average, we think in the neighborhood about 10% additional this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : A couple of them here for you, Tricia. The first one, Tricia, I remember back to 2016 and all of the discussion about new business penalty as you're growing pretty rapidly. What's the impact of that new business penalty on your Personal Auto results today or in this quarter? Susan Griffith : Well, I think in this quarter, our media expense was up, so you're going to feel that especially on the direct side since we front-load those costs. So I think I said this in the last call. I sort of look at new business penalty as an investment in our future and having our future policyholders. But you did see a higher expense ratio, and we were -- we still had our pedal on for media spend in that first -- in the first quarter this year. So yes, expenses were higher. Brian Meredith : I was thinking more on loss ratio side actually, just because new business typically carries a higher loss ratio. Susan Griffith : Yes, yes, new business does carry a higher loss ratio. That was part of it as well, including a lot of things that happened in the first quarter, record level compared to the last 5 years with weather losses, et cetera. But yes, there is a penalty there as well anytime we have new business. Brian Meredith : Okay. And then my second question, I'm just curious, if I adjust for the reserving actions taken in Personal Auto in the first quarter, I come up that you're kind of like a 94 combined ratio, ex those reserving actions still below the 96. I guess my question is, is it why are you having to tap the brakes right now given that you're kind of at a 94 ex those , which I'm assuming you're expecting not to happen here going forward? Susan Griffith : Yes, it's that balance, Brian, of our calendar year commitment and our lifetime cohort commitment. And so we're always thinking about the future, we're always trying to balance it. And I would say we're not putting on the brakes. We're definitely going to reduce our media spend, but our intentions are that we still want to grow. I just wanted to say that normally, when we reduce media, it could have anticipated slow growth.  Now John just mentioned, too, a lot of it depends on what's happening with competitors. We're still seeing a lot of ambient shopping. We're seeing -- we still see a very hard market. So our intentions are to get to our calendar year 96 and literally, as soon as we can, if we get to that, depending again on weather, regulatory things, et cetera, we can very easily ramp up our media spend to grow. So it's really that balance of accident year, calendar year commitments. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Andrew Kligerman : Tricia, you cited overall severity up about 10%. So I'm trying to unpack the pieces. You cited the repair category being the most severe. Could you specify a number around that? And the second part of it is, I noticed the Manheim Index sequentially up 8.6% in the first quarter. So that was a big move. How are you thinking about used car prices as the year moves forward? Susan Griffith : Yes, a really good question. There's a lot that goes into the severity of fixing cars. And so a couple of things. We have really -- and I think as an industry, struggled with shop capacity. So our ability to get cars in the throughput to get them out, which could, of course, have effect on length of time, rental, et cetera. Parts prices are up, just a little bit under 3%, and labor rates. So think of the unemployment rate and how there's a problem kind of hiring everywhere. Same thing with mechanical techs in the body shops. But those repair rates are up between 4.5% and 5%. So that's some contributions. And then really, the parts prices, the cost of those haven't really abated either. So what we're really working to do our President of Claims is working with our body shop partners to open up capacity and get those cars in and out. And of course, weather exacerbates that as well. So we still haven't seen -- the Manheim went down a little bit. But again, it pops up and the high over the last several years is extraordinary. So that's kind of the trends we're reacting to. Again, the good part about this is these are short tailed. So we can react to them really quickly, which we have. And then we can continue to watch trends to determine have we taken enough rates for what we need now, in the future. Andrew Kligerman : I see. And you've mentioned non-rate actions, particularly for Commercial. And I think you may have touched on it in Personal. But given the non-rate actions have kind of been a part of the practice for the last couple of years. Is there really much leverage there non-rate actions? Susan Griffith : Yes. Yes. I would say there's a lot of leverage, especially on the Commercial side. And I won't go into all of what we're working on with restrictions on new business, et cetera. But yes, we're able to pretty quickly put those into play to make sure that the new business we're bringing on reach our target profit margins. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Jamminder Bhullar : So first, I had a question on advertising. And if you can talk about or quantify how much you're pulling back on advertising? And is it in specific regions? Or are you doing it throughout the country? Susan Griffith : Yes. We won't share exactly where we're pulling back, just like we don't share our budget and actually where our budget goes to whether it's mass media or digital. But I will say when we pull back on advertising, we have an incredible media book, and they will -- media group, and they will look at the most inefficient media and pull back accordingly. So that's something that we can dial up or down depending on what's happening with our profit margins. So -- but we won't share that. We can more easily turn local off if we need to, if we can't get right, et cetera. So that's kind of the approach we take to our media. We're really flexible and nimble as we've shown in the past. Jamminder Bhullar : Okay. And then on the -- can you talk about the pricing environment and how conducive is the regulatory environment for adjusting prices? Because I think as companies are raising in the 2021 period, there was a lot of pushback from regulators. Is that -- is the price -- the regulatory environment better for price increases now than it was before? Or do you still expect pushback from regulators and delays in the process of raising prices? Susan Griffith : I think most of the regulators really do see and are watching these trends and it's not Progressive alone. It's definitely the industry seeing these inflationary trends continue. And so for the majority, as we show the data, they understand what we need for prospective rates. There's always going to be some challenges and we continue to have challenges. Like I said, if you take the 2 states on each coast that we always have a challenge with. But you know what, we're working with the departments of insurance to show and share our data and the need for it because in the long run, what we want to have is competitive prices. That's what makes our industry great, and we want to have available and affordable coverage for people in every state. So availability is really important. We know that. And so we're going to continue to work with the regulators to get that, but there's always a couple of states that could be challenging. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Scott : First one I had is just on frequency trends. And I think they've run reasonably favorable for you all over the last 12 months and just how they've contributed to loss trend. So I just wanted to see if there was any sort of evolving view there and how that will play out and what you saw in 1Q, if you have any update? Susan Griffith : Yes. I mean frequency in Q1 was relatively flat. We haven't quite seen it come back necessarily to solidly pre-COVID. It's really hard to flesh out frequency trends because there's still so many macroeconomic things that go into, we kind of just try to react to it. And there's always a little bit of noise in one quarter. So we'll continue to watch how frequency goes. Obviously, we have a lot of data from miles driven, vehicle miles traveled from our UBI data, so we watch for that. But that's something that we watch and react to, and there's a lot of inputs and a lot that we don't control. Alexander Scott : Understood. Okay. And as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask on bodily injury severity. If you have any update, if you learned anything through 1Q on that front. It sounds like the decisions you're making in terms of the ad spend and growth and so forth in rate or more property damage severity driven, but I just wanted to make sure that there wasn't more of a bodily injury component to this. Susan Griffith : Yes. Bodily injury has started to be relatively stable over the last several quarters. Some of the severity increases we saw in Q1 had to do with our large losses, what we call , which is soft tissue, attorney rep, non-lit and some closing of soft tissue. So we're able to discern that pretty deeply and watch for that. And of course, obviously, those trends can change as well. But it's been fairly stable. And I think attorney rep levels are being -- are stabilized a little bit more too. And of course, I'll go to Florida because that could -- Florida is a big state, one of our biggest states, so that could change as well depending on how many losses we ultimately get based on House Bill 837. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Jon Newsome : A little bit of a follow-up. I was a little surprised not to hear commentary on distracted driving and faster driving being kind of an issue with the reserve issues. And it seems like it's all sort of pieces actually fixing things and the process of the shopping. Is that part of the equation as well? Or has that sort of stabilizes well? Susan Griffith : Well, it's hard to discern distracted driving solely on its own because we look at so many different variables. And obviously, we have a lot of data from our usage-based insurance from our snapshot to kind of understand the different variables. And there's a relatedness to that. So if you think about distracted driving and how it could relate to hard break. So it's not -- so we don't look at distracted driving only. So we were just talking before the call on how many more accidents we see. What we can react to, though, is the data where we -- is exactly what we're seeing in terms of accidents, frequency, vehicle mile travel, the congestion. So we look at all of that to understand what's happening and react to that. But I wouldn't say I would have any really further commentary specifically on distracted driving. Jon Newsome : And then quite separately, can you talk a little bit about the Commercial business. It looked like the big picture that maybe it was all the same trends affecting private passenger auto, but that necessarily hasn't been in the past. So is that the case or all these kind of comments about where the reserve issues are and where the severity is happening in the Commercial business as well? Or is there a difference that's notable between the 2 businesses from a trend perspective? Susan Griffith : Yes. So our Commercial Lines, especially when you look at the reserving, is mostly in our core auto and very -- they're seeing very similar trends. And the trucking segment, those are expensive to fix as well. And from the perspective of reserving, we're seeing a little bit more late reports in our reps. Our case reserves are just strengthening from the rep perspective, but pretty similar trends. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Tricia, just on roughly 10 points of rate that you need to take, I think that's in addition to the 4 points that you already took this year, but correct me if I'm wrong on that. Could you just talk about how much of that is -- you had mentioned a catch up versus just what's needed to keep pace with trend? Susan Griffith : Yes. It was additional to the rate that we took in quarter 1. I won't go into actually talking exactly about what's catched up, et cetera, because we also look at rates perspectively, but we believe at this point with what we're seeing that, that will get us both of those. It will get us to the point where we are at our target profit margin eventually, hopefully, and rate to come to stay ahead of trend specifically. David Motemaden : Got it. And then just it sounds like you guys are still intending to grow and still feel pretty good about growth despite the lower ad spend. Am I right to interpret that when you think about how the rate adequacy you're not that far off on your existing -- on the existing prices out there and so you feel good about that dynamic? Susan Griffith : Yes, I do feel good about growth. And someone asked a question about underwriting scrutiny, and that's where you can really make sure that you gather more data to be more confident that the new business you're bringing on reaches your target profit margin. So we do feel comfortable with the growth, with the caveats of making sure that we do some extra scrutiny just to make sure that new business for the future is profitable. Pat, do you have anything to add? Patrick Callahan : Yes, just a little other color commentary on Q1's growth. So half of the incredible new business growth we had was from conversion improvements. And in the agency channel, it's more like 3/4. So when you talk about how competitive our prices are on the street, that's a pretty good indication that even with some media pullback, we will continue to have strong competitive rates and with higher levels of ambient shopping, feel pretty good about continuing to grow the business. Susan Griffith : Yes. What I always love to, and we've talked about this the other day in one of my meetings, is every time a situation like this happened and this has been such an incredibly volatile 3 years. When you pull back on advertising or expenses, you always learn something. So we try to take advantage of these times as well to learn something about our advertising and efficiency, et cetera. So we continue to do that as well, just as another comment. John Sauerland : David, on your question on catch-up versus forward looking. Our pricing is always forward-looking. And as we mentioned and Tricia's introductory comments, we clearly were a little off in terms of severities for fixing cars coming into the year. And that obviously was dialed into our indications. We've seen additional data points, as she mentioned, and we are dialing that into our future trend selects. There was also a discussion around Manheim. Our projections around Manheim, if you look back, for it to come down more aggressively than it has. It has been -- car pricing, in general, has stayed higher than we had anticipated a while back. That all goes into our future trend selects when we are doing our pricing indications. We've obviously dialed those up recently, and that's where we've arrived at the conclusion that we need to get more aggressive on rate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : Since higher severity and auto physical damage was a key driver behind adverse development in the quarter, can you reconcile how you got comfortable lowering your view of auto physical damage loss trend this quarter to 15% versus 20% last year? Susan Griffith : Well, I can give you a color of why we believe there's higher severity this quarter. And there's always a lot of noise in the quarter, but much of what you're seeing with the higher versus collision has to do with some older claims that are now working its way through our inbound subrogation. So if you think about claims at the height of ACV, et cetera, we're working through those. So that would be my point about the property damage severity trend. I'm not sure if I answered your question or... Tracy Benguigui : Yes. In your Q or your K, you break out all the components, the loss trend. So within severity, I just noticed in the Q, auto physical damage was up 15%. I look at the 10-K, it was 20% last year, but directionally, it looks like it's down, doesn't seem to reconcile with the comments made earlier on the call and adverse development taken in the quarter. So I just wanted to understand why you took down your view of loss trend within auto physical damage? John Sauerland : Maybe a clarification. It's not our view of loss trend there. That is a retrospective looking number. So that is simply saying physical damage severity this quarter versus last year first quarter, similarly, when you looked at last year's numbers. So it is a consecutive retrospective metric. Does that help? Tracy Benguigui : Okay. And so would 20% even be the right number to think about for last year, given all the adverse development you've taken in that accident year or it's not correlated to given what you just said? John Sauerland : So each quarter we're providing you versus the previous period change in severity there. So we normally provide you the quarter and the year-to-date. And so right now, we're up 15% versus previous quarter for property damage. So you mentioned physical damage. Property damages the third-party coverage for fixing cars. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : If we go back 2 years ago to this conference call after the 1Q '21 10-Q, you announced that you were taking rate. And when we saw May 2021 results, growth had just ground to a halt. You had very little regulatory approval at that point, very little premium written or earned at the new rates. And you were able to stop the growth almost immediately. What were some of the skills that you had that you were able to do that before you had even taken the rate? And what aren't you going to do this time compared to the urgency that you were able to stop the growth in 2021? Susan Griffith : Yes. We're going to use the similar levers, and that's why I tried to answer in my opening question-and-answer session. At that point, regulators -- we were ahead of the curve, ahead of the competition. So regulators were still, I think, worried about the effects of the people giving us back with the COVID, et cetera, which I'm very proud of all that we did with that, but very similar levers that we used last time. I think also what we're seeing now, though, is that it's a very hard market. So I think both Pat and John talked about the rate increases that our competitors are taking, which is still causing some shopping. So even though we'll use similar levers, we've been able to grow, like I gave you some of the stats first quarter. And so we believe that, that may continue depending again on what competition does. I think regulators started seeing way more companies come in with very similar data, and they know that if they want to have available coverage for their constituents that we have to put this through the system. It's just -- it's the bottom line, what we're seeing from an inflationary trend. Joshua Shanker : All right. And then in the 10-Q, you mentioned that the current year impact of HB 837 was less than 100 basis points on the quarter. Can I extrapolate that it was 200 or 300 basis points for the month of March? Susan Griffith : Yes, you probably could. I haven't really done the math on that. But what we did is we looked at -- we looked at what we thought would be probable and estimable based on the thought of lawsuits that happened in a short period of time before the bill was signed. And again, that could evolve because some of those things may or may not actually happen. But yes, that math is probably pretty accurate. And again, that's something that will continue to evolve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : My first question, looking at just the tremendous growth we've seen quarter-to-date, can you maybe talk about the weighting of Sam's, Diane's, Wrights, Robinsons among those customers that were added? And even among new applications, like are those roughly -- is that distribution roughly in line with what you have in the in-force book? Susan Griffith : Yes. I think we're out in the queue. Pat or John can weigh in on this. I think we grew in all segments. I think we've -- I think we've increased in Robinsons from an auto home bundle. Sam's are going to be more likely to continue to shop. So there's always the PLE part of that. But I think we grew against all segments. Patrick Callahan : Yes, that's right. From an app perspective, we saw positive growth in the quarter for new apps across all segments. And our fastest growth was really in the Wright and Robinsons and Diane's also grew. So Sam's grew just a little slower, but they grew as well. From a PIF perspective, we also saw positive growth across all segments during the quarter. So faster in the segments that are not Sam's, but... John Sauerland : And just for those unfamiliar with our nomenclature, Wrights are homeowners who don't bundle with us. So Robinsons as well known, I think, by this audience. Wrights are homeowners who have their auto insurance, perhaps some other products with this as well. And that's where we've actually grown the fastest. And in the agency channel, especially where we are limited to our -- what we think of as our manufacturer or underwritten property product, Progressive Home, we have been pulling back in a number of markets to revise our geographic footprint. And it's encouraging to see that we are still growing with home-owning households, even though in a lot of markets where we're restricting the property piece of that portfolio. So we're still growing in Robinsons as well as Pat pointed out. And Diane's are what we think of as renters who are stable in their insuring habits. So growing more in the more stable sectors and growing homeowners considerably even without the bundle, which is also encouraging to see. Yaron Kinar : And then my next question, I guess, goes back to I think several other versions of this question that were asked on the call already. And I'm just looking at comments coming into my e-mail over the course of this call. It seems like there is still some lingering investor confusion around what I would say maybe is the sense of urgency and aggressiveness coming from you talking about kind of the need to take some corrective actions. And the year-to-date data that we're seeing, mainly 95-ish combined ratio when we take out some of the reserve adjustments that we assume will not go forward. So I was hoping to maybe take another stab at that will give you another opportunity to maybe clarify some of that confusion. Susan Griffith : Yes. It's really all about our calendar year goal. So -- we appreciate the fact that we will look at our long-term growth as long as well as our short-term growth. But we've had a very long stated goal for long-term holders, for our investment community that we will do everything we can to treat our calendar year 96. And we're not there. We're at 99. And so that's why we're taking aggressive actions. The great part is we have lots of levers that we can quickly move. And our nimbleness, specifically here Progressive will be the benefit. So if things turn around dramatically in the next 4 months, again, the caveats are regulatory approval, weather, inflationary trends, we'll be able to put on growth. But also -- and that's why I gave those stats at the beginning. The growth has been unbelievable, and we don't think it's going to come to a screeching halt. We know that there's a relationship between advertising and new business apps we're still feeling positive.  So I hope my letter, the queue and my comments didn't say this growth is going to come to a screeching halt. What I wanted to do is just say, hey, that can very well happen when we reduce advertising and always has in the past. To what degree is very dependent on all those things, including competition. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi. Michael Ward : I noticed policy life expectancies trended positively in the quarter. Just hoping you could help us understand what goes into that metric? And how should we think about that trending now that you're raising prices again and have added a lot of new customers? Susan Griffith : Well, it traded positive on a trailing 3. It's still down on a trailing 12. We think trailing 3 is more indicative of what's happening. Again, that may and could change depending on the rate increases. That's usually what we see happen. The PLE is just our likelihood for our customer, the length of time our customers are likely to stay. So the trailing 3 is pretty -- is more recent activity. We'll have to continue to watch that trend to see if any of our rate actions affect that negatively. Michael Ward : And then on the investment portfolio. I was just hoping you could provide some color on the strategy in CMBS. I know there's new disclosure in the queue. Just specifically curious why you guys favor single properties, CMBS, especially office. I'm wondering if you could sort of comment on the sales that you mentioned in the Q thus far? Susan Griffith : Absolutely. I'll have Jon Bauer weigh in. But I will say from -- we added the chart in on the Q for CMBS this year. And I'll say that Jon was ahead of the curve in terms of starting to reduce our risk in CMBS over a year ago. But I'll let him walk through why he did that and where we're headed from here. Jon? Jonathan Bauer : Yes. Thanks so much for the question, Michael. So just to take a step back, and then I'll try to hit it as specifically as possible. About first quarter 2022, when we looked at the portfolio, and we looked at the overall macro environment, we saw that the portfolio we came into early 2022, which didn't match our macro views going forward. So several actions that we look to take at that point.  So first of all, on the interest rate side, we sort of ended January around 3 and then 8s on our interest rate duration. We thought that was too high given the environment. So we allowed that to shift down throughout the year to about the $275 million by October and then look to move that back up again to 3. On the equity side, we thought, overall, given what the actions were likely to be that equities were likely to see more volatility than we have seen in the past and therefore, look to reduce our equity exposure pretty much cut in half to what we are right now. And then we looked across our non-sort of cash and treasury fixed income portfolio and said, if we hit a recession, where is it that we think that we would be most uncomfortable. And the 3 areas that we sort of identified to watch and that we wanted to hold taking any further credit risk was residential mortgage-backed securities, CLOs and commercial mortgage-backed securities. I would say, in the 12 months since then, as many of you witnessed, the housing market has probably performed better than many thought. And the same has been true within our residential mortgage-backed securities. So we even though that shrunk as a portion of our portfolio, we think the housing market is better than we thought. In terms of CLOs, I would say it's still to be determined what the corporate default rate looks like going forward, but feel very comfortable with our position there, even though it's smaller versus last year. And then that takes us to commercial mortgage-backed securities. In that portfolio as opposed to just not adding and allowing the runoff to happen, we prospectively looked at the portfolio and said, if we were to hit a recession, which are the securities in here that we think in a severe recession could get hit. And with that, we looked over the last year to reduce out of those securities. And as you can see, year-on-year, CMBS represented about 13% of the portfolio at the end of the first quarter 2022, it represents less than 8% of the portfolio right now. So what encompasses that we felt like we wanted to give the disclosure.  On the office side, 2 major drivers of that portfolio. The first thing is trophy office. So these are offices that were built in the last 10 years or so, that our view was -- would have significant demand, especially as different companies look to shrink their footprint, but look to be in the best quality buildings. And then the second part of the portfolio is if it's not trophy office, we would want it at least 4 to 5 years past maturity to an incredibly strong investment-grade tenant. And so that makes up the core of the portfolio with a single asset portfolio, it allows us to look and pick individual buildings that we would underwrite as opposed to a conduit type thing, where you have a lot of different type of quality of buildings that we think are a lot lesser than they are on the single asset side.  So with that, and as we mentioned, the disclosure, we have no delinquencies in the portfolio. We have about $350 million of maturities over the next year in the overall CMBS portfolio, and we expect them, even in this type of environment, all to be refinanced without a problem. I don't know if that answers your question, but please let me know if I could give you any more specifics. Michael Ward : Yes. No, that was tremendously helpful. Maybe just on what you shedded recently, recent quarters, did you trim California, Seattle? Jonathan Bauer : Yes. So I would take it a lot more broadly than that. Again, for us, and I would -- since we have the opportunity to talk here, I would say this across our portfolio, not just in commercial real estate. What we are constantly doing is looking and saying, are we getting paid for the risk that we're taking in the security or that one? For CMBS in particular, it was the first thing going back to February, March of last year, is there any tenant rollover where we think this building could be vacant coming into their maturities. So get rid of that one. Is there any buildings where we don't think the owners are going to put the money into the building in order to get it to the quality, to lease up, get rid of that one. And so what that left us with broadly across the portfolio was trophy real estate and then ones that have really strong tenancy, 5 years or longer past the maturity.  So I wouldn't focus geography. By geography necessarily, I'm more on what's the quality of the building, what's the quality of the tenancy. And I think that's what left us with the portfolio with no delinquencies where we feel confident in the next 12 months of maturities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Yes. Just a couple here. So I guess the first question, on the 10 points of rate. So when we go back like a year ago, I think it was on this call, where you guys said you were done taking outsized rate increases. I guess since then, you guys never stopped taking rate increases. I think since then, you've gotten like 9 points in the aggregate, so I guess when I think about like this extra 10 points that you're saying you need over the next 3 quarters and thinking about the fact that you've actually taken almost that much like in the trailing 4 quarters, it really just doesn't seem like that much of a step-up versus what we're seeing. But yes, just your comments on whether or not I'm thinking about that correctly. Susan Griffith : Yes. I mean what we prefer to do is, obviously, we want to be ahead of the rates to achieve our target profit margins. We prefer to take small bites to the apple, which we did in first quarter, but then we saw the data change dramatically. And so for our future rate need, we believe at this point that around 10 rates is sort of the neighborhood of what we'll need on the private passenger auto side. So I think you're thinking about it. Okay. I mean what we said in the quarter is that we thought the largest rate increases were behind us, but this has been a really volatile time. And so we're just reacting to what we're seeing right now. John Sauerland : Right. I would just add that over... Susan Griffith : John wanted to add a comment. John Sauerland : I was just going to say, over time, we have been very well served, analyzing the data very expeditiously and taking action as we see changes. So as Tricia mentioned, if things don't play out in terms of loss trend as we are expecting, we can always pull back. We can always even take rates down. I would be surprised if we do that, but we can certainly pull back. But continually, we find we are way better off looking at the data every single month. And to the extent we think things have changed taking action expeditiously. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then I've got a couple of questions on just whether or not there might be like some adverse selection going on. If you could just comment on like where you're seeing the loss trend, the issues in the book? Is it -- would you say it's disproportionately toward the new business that you put on? Or are you kind of talking about that broadly across the book? Susan Griffith : No. I mean I think where adverse selection comes into place specifically is for those companies that have industry-leading segmentation. And we believe we have that. We believe we have that with our variables, with our UBI, et cetera. So we actually feel good that we talked a little bit about the underlying loss cost. We feel pretty good about that. There's just some trends that we're seeing that we need to get ahead of. So our goal, of course, is to rate accurately and be aggressive in getting the right rate at the right time on the street. And if you do that and you have segmentation like we do, adverse selection should happen, but not to us. Patrick Callahan : Yes. The only thing I would add is -- the only thing I would add on the mix of business that we're getting in the quality is to the contrary, we feel very good about the quality of business we put on during fourth quarter and first quarter. We're constantly paranoid. We always watch and we look closely to ensure that the mix that's being shed by our competitors as they transfer market share to us, we watch closely, and we are seeing clean business. We're seeing homeowner business, as John mentioned, long prior insurance periods, multi-car. So it's exactly the business that we intend to grow with, and we're pretty happy with what we're seeing contrary to any adverse selection. Douglas Constantine : We've exhausted our scheduled time and so that concludes our event forum. I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation's First Quarter Investor Event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Douglas Constantine : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's Second Quarter Investor Event. I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I'll be the moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website.  This quarter includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team.  As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first and second quarters of 2023, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia? Susan Griffith : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I usually begin these calls by extolling the commitment of Progressive's people and expressing my pride in the results they deliver, and this quarter will be no different. In the face of extraordinary pressure on the industry, our people continue to take the actions necessary to succeed in this difficult environment.  While our results through the first half of 2023 fell well short of our 96 combined ratio target. I continue to believe in our people and our strategy. I believe we have assembled a progressive team of nearly 59,000 employees that's best in class. I have no doubt that we are continuing to lay the groundwork to ensure that our best days are ahead of us. We continue to manage to this calendar year target, maintaining the discipline that has allowed us to grow in the past with better profitability than the industry.  At the same time, we will be pragmatic in our approach to growth and remain cognizant of long-term value, which we continue to believe has served well by balancing growth and profitability. We spent much of the first quarter call talking about actions we would be taking to address our calendar year profitability pressure and those actions continue. In quarter 2, we took 7 points in personal auto, which puts our year-to-date rate take at just over 11%, and assuming regulatory approval, we plan to take approximately 6 additional points during the remainder of the year as we adjust rates to match loss trend.  During last quarter's call, we also said that we would reduce our media spend, resulting in our quarter 2 direct expense ratio being amongst the lowest in recent history. These actions have had the expected effect on growth with new app growth slower in the second quarter as compared to the first and PIF growth, while still robust, slowing from highs we saw in prior months. Calendar year profitability continues to be a challenge. So with the calendar year 96 goal in mind, we will continue to evaluate the rate and non-rate actions we may need to take.  Catastrophe losses were a significant part of our profitability pressures. To date, 2023 has been a significant catastrophic year with some estimates suggesting that U.S. insurer losses have already surpassed $25 billion this year. The events this year had been broadly felt with 44 states affected by 43 events. At the company level, these events have added 4.5 points to our combined ratio year-to-date, which is 1.7 points higher than the impact catastrophe events had on our combined ratio for the first half of 2022.  Our property business has been most affected by catastrophes, adding almost 46 points to the property loss ratio so far this year, which is about 16 points more when compared to this time in 2022. Historically, we have been among the best in the industry in reserve accuracy with reserve changes contributing little to our calendar year combined ratio. We've advanced the science of reserving, an employee team of highly experienced individuals to support our goal of being as accurate as possible with our reserves.  Accurate reserves help us to price more accurately and give us the confidence to grow as fast as we have over the last decade. Having said that, the difficult environment of 2023 has presented challenges for our reserving practices. Through the end of the second quarter, prior year adverse development has contributed 4 points to our combined ratio and current accident year actuarial adjustments have contributed another 1.5 points. The majority of personal lines adverse development can be placed into 2 categories : Florida and fixing vehicle coverages. Florida's prior year adverse development accounts for just over 40% of the 4 points of prior year development. While we continue to be optimistic that March's new legislation will result in lower loss costs over time, the short-term effect has been a significant increase in attorney representation largely in medical coverages. Our data has matured each month since the bill passed, which has allowed us to continue to fine-tune reserving in the face of changes to Florida's ultimate loss costs. In fixing vehicle coverages, unforeseen severity trends deepening on previously closed claims continues to be the major driver of prior year adverse development countrywide. The contributors to the steeper trends come from a variety of sources, including longer vehicle repair times, longer rental times, higher parts prices and labor rates and changes in subrogation trends. Fixing vehicle coverages are short-tailed, which explains why over 80% of the total year-to-date prior-year development is from the 2022 accident year.  In fact, excluding Florida, accident years prior to 2022 have developed favorably. Our current year actuarial adjustments are primarily due to fixing vehicle coverages. Since fixing vehicle coverages are short-tailed, most of the claims that are affected by emerging trends have happened in the recent past. As we have moved deeper into the year, the new steeper trends in fixing vehicle coverages have increasingly affected claims that occurred in the current accident year.  Florida litigation has been a relatively small part of current year actuarial adjustments since the increase in attorney representation rates largely affected claims that occurred before March of 2023. We continue to monitor loss trends across all states and coverages and will adjust if necessary to ensure we're always adequately reserved. While both reserving and pricing have been a challenge this year, I have great confidence in the teams and our strategies, which have delivered results better than the industry for a very long time. To showcase these skill sets, this morning, we have 2 senior leaders to speak to these 2 topics for our presentation. First, Gary Traicoff, our Corporate Actuary business leader and Head of our Reserving Group, will discuss reserving practice at Progressive and how we endeavor to accurately set and adjust reserves. Gary is a 28-year progressive veteran and has led our reserving group for almost 11 of those years. After Gary, Jim Curtis, our Personal Lines Controller, will discuss cohort pricing. Cohort pricing is our term for managing to both our calendar year and lifetime 96 target when new business and renewal business have different expense and loss characteristics. Jim has been with Progressive for 28 years and in his current role for 4.  Again, thank you for joining us this morning. I will now pass you to Gary. Gary? Gary Traicoff : Thank you, Tricia, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to talk to you today about loss reserving at Progressive. I will first cover some key definitions and metrics in our general process, then walk through an example on how our overall reserve levels are determined. And finally, walk through an example of the reserving life cycle of an individual claim and how it would flow through the actuarial categories of the earnings release. Let's start off with the size of our loss and loss adjustment expense or LAE reserves. The columns represent our carried reserve balance at the end of each calendar year from 2013 through 2022 and at June 30, 2023, for the rightmost column. On the left side of the graph, we can see that in 2013, Progressive had about $8.5 billion in reserves on a gross of reinsurance basis at year-end 2013. This would be the sum of the orange and blue sections within the bar with our growth as a company, reserves before reinsurance as of June 30, 2023, is now almost $33 billion and almost 4x greater than what it was in 2013, while our premium growth was a little less than 3x greater over the same time period. Much of this difference in reserves outpacing premium growth relates to our growth in longer-tailed products and commercial lines over this period. This means that we believe for all accidents that have occurred through June 30, 2023, our ultimate future liabilities will be almost $33 billion. The orange section of the bars represents how much of our reserves are ceded for reinsurance. Some examples of this include state-regulated plans, such as Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association and the Florida Hurricane Cat Fund and private reinsurers. Our ceded reserves now make up about 16% of our gross reserves versus just over 12% in 2013. Much of this increase in the higher proportion of ceded reserves relates to newer products that have been added over time, including property and protective, which have more reinsurance needs than our historical products. The blue section of the columns represents how much of our reserves are retained after reinsurance, almost $28 billion as of June 30, 2023.  Next, let's look at some metrics on how our reserves are distributed. The chart on the left shows that 67% of our net reserves are in loss case, 17% loss IBNR and the remainder under LAE. Any open claim will be assigned a case reserve that may be set by a claims adjuster or an actuarially derived estimate set by the actuarial team. We will discuss this in more detail in a future slide. IBNR, which stands for incurred but not reported, makes up about 17% of our net reserves. IBNR may have different meanings across companies. For most of Progressive's products, one can think of IBNR as the future liabilities to cover claims that have already happened and are currently not recorded as open case reserves. This would include late reports, reopens and salvage and subrogation recoveries. Anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries can be thought of as a contra reserve and is a reduction to future liabilities. For most of our products, IBNR does not cover any anticipated development in case reserves. This is because since our case reserves are a combination of adjuster estimates and actuarially set case reserves for the majority of our products, our IBNR reserve, does not cover expected case development. LAE reserves make up the remaining 16% and typically cover the anticipated expenses needed to settle claims that have already happened, such as defense counsel costs and claims adjuster salaries. The middle chart shows the distribution of our reserves by product. As expected, reserves will index more to longer-tailed products with higher limits relative to premium size. Thus, our Commercial Lines business makes up almost 1/3 of our total reserves, but a smaller proportion of premium. The graph on the right shows that in personal auto, 83% of our reserves are set to cover injury and medical costs and 17% to cover the cost of fixed vehicles. Again, this is due to the longer-tail nature and higher severity costs to injury and medical coverages versus fixing vehicle coverages and reserves are over-indexed to injury and medical relative to premium. In addition, fixing vehicle coverages have a higher proportion of contra-reserves from salvage and subrogation compared to injury and medical. One additional point. This data is as of year-end 2022 and is on a net of reinsurance basis. While the previous slide gave a high-level overview of the distribution of our reserve mix by various parts, we review the reserves at a much more granular level. We typically review reserves by some combination of product, geographic areas such as group of states, individual states and even down to a region or subset within a state. Further breakouts typically include individual line coverages such as bodily injury, uninsured motor bodily injury and property damage and even by limit. To determine these breakouts, we weigh the credibility of the data, homogeneity in the data and additional value of segmenting the data at a finer level.  For example, in personal auto bodily injury, almost all states are reviewed separately with the majority of states reviewed quarterly. State-level data is credible and many states have different development patterns, which warrant the data to be reviewed separately. In personal auto collision, while state-level data is credible, many states exhibit similar data patterns and several clusters of states are reviewed together. About 25% to 30% of our reserves are reviewed at this in-depth level monthly and about 85% of our reserves quarterly. About 700 reviews, which is some combination of product, state, line, et cetera, are reviewed over the course of the year. By reviewing reserves at this detailed level, we are able to adjust reserves more accurately at a granular level, which helps our pricing teams better match price to risk. We also have a robust roll-forward process that we will discuss later on, which allows up to 100% of the reserves to be adjusted monthly. The roll-forward process allows us the time to do a deep analysis on a portion of the reserves monthly while still feeling comfortable that all of our reserves are being updated monthly. Here is an example of how an in-depth review schedule will look over 3 months. In the first month of the quarter, 57 reserve reviews were completed. Each reserve review is either a loss or LAE review, which is further broken down between defense cost containment or DCC and adjusting and other expenses or A&O. Some combination of products, such as personal auto, CL or one of our core commercial auto products or TNC, which represents transportation network companies, line coverages such as bodily injury and some combination of state is reviewed. These 57 reviews would make up about 25% to 30% of our total reserves. In the following month, 60 reviews were completed. Again, there is some combination of type, product, coverage and state, but all 60 reviews are independent of reviews completed during the first month and represent another 25% to 30% of our total reserves. Finally, the third month of the quarter had 68 reviews completed, which are all different from any reviews completed during the previous 2 months and represent an additional 25% to 30% of the total reserves. Over the course of the quarter, about 85% of the reserves were reviewed. Typically, between 50 to 70 reviews are completed per month. Now let's talk about how the overall reserve level is determined. We use several different methods. One of the methods that we use is called the accident period chain ladder method in a standard industry practice. And the example above, each row represents a 6-month period when the accident occurred and each column represents how much in paid losses had been paid out for those accidents at certain time periods after the accident. For example, the top row represents all accidents that occurred from July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. The $100 in Column 1 means that the $100 was paid out as of December 31, 2021 for those accidents. Moving to the right of the same row. Column 2 of $120 means that for accidents that occurred during the last 6 months of 2021, as of June 2022, cumulatively that $120 had been paid out. Thus, an additional $20 was paid out during the first half of 2022. The increase of $20 could be due to payments on known claims, late reports or reopen activity. The increase of 20% from $100 to $120 is shown in the loss development factors section in the December 2021 row and column 1.  Similarly, the loss development factor of 1.08 in Column 2 of the December 2021 row is calculated by taking the paid loss of $130 in Column 3, divided by the paid loss of $120 in Column 2 for the December 2021 row. Next, the actuarial analyst selected a 1.27 in the first column as the predicted Column 1 loss development factor for the accidents happening in the 6-month period ending June of 2023. We can see that in the June 2023 row, $120 had been paid out by the end of June 2023. The analyst is predicting that paid losses will increase by 27% or $33 during the second half of 2023 and cumulatively be at $153 by December 2023. Multiplying the $153 by an additional 8% predicts that an additional $12 will get paid out by the third column for a cumulative of $165. Thus, the shaded numbers in blue are predictions of what will be paid out in the future. The indicated reserve is then calculated by taking the ultimate estimated paid losses minus what has already been paid as of June 2023 since reserves are to cover future liabilities. The indicated reserve is $45 for accidents happening in the 6-month period ending June 2023 and $13 for accidents happening during the second half of 2022. In total, the indicated reserve is the sum of all accident periods or rows and adds up to $58. This example illustrates an accident period chain ladder approach using paid data. Triangle, similar to this byproduct and grouped by line coverage can be found in our annual report. Other approaches that we typically employ include using case incurred data, developing severity and frequency separately and stratifying the data by size of loss layer. In addition, data is also segmented by late report and reopen lag time from the date of loss to the date of late report and reopen and hindsight testing to prior reserve amounts are considered as well. Additional ad hoc analysis is typically completed to understand changes in the underlying data and loss development factors. Based on the indications from the multiple reviews completed during the month, the actuarial team will then decide how much of an overall reserve change is needed and adjust reserve factors accordingly. Those changes will show up in the earnings release under the actuarial adjustment section and be reported showing the breakout for the current accident year and all prior accident years. For example, in June of 2023, based off the scheduled reserve reviews, which represented between 25% to 30% of reserves, the actuarial team increased reserves $130.9 million for accident years 2022 and prior and increased reserves $160.3 million for the 2023 accident year for a total change of $291.2 million. The $130.9 million increase to prior accident years directly impacted the prior accident year development. In addition, due to other changes not related to actuarial reviews, prior accident years developed an additional $6.9 million unfavorably for a total amount of unfavorable development of $137.8 million.  Next, we will discuss what are some of the other items that are in all other development. Now let's go through an example of the pathway of a case reserve over time and the impact on our monthly earnings release. Remember, case reserves make up about 67% of our total reserves. In this example, a claim happens on December 15 and is reported and opened in our claims system on December 19. Since the claim was reported in the same month as the occurrence of the accident, this would not be considered an IBNR claim. The adjuster does not have much information about the claim at this point and it sets a case reserve of $5,000, noted by the orange dot. In parallel, a tabular case reserve is determined for this claim from an algorithm used by the actuarial team. The actuarial team uses predictive modeling techniques based off of certain characteristics of the claim and policy to predict what the expected cost would be for all claims that meet the criteria. In personal auto, there are over 200,000 unique combinations of tabular case reserves. It is important to note that the actuarial algorithm does not expect this one claim to pay exactly the tabular case reserve. But on average, all claims that meet the similar criteria should pay close to the tabular case reserve. This is similar to a pricing rate order of calculation formula. In this example, the tabular case reserve is $12,125.  Finally, the adjuster case reserve as compared to a reserve threshold set at $25,000 in this example. If the adjuster estimate is below the reserve threshold, the tabular case reserve is booked to the general leisure as the financial case reserve for that claim and is reflected on the balance sheet. If the adjuster case reserve is greater than or equal to the threshold, the adjuster case reserve becomes the financial case reserve booked to the general ledger. The logic here is that the predictive modeling approach is fairly accurate for lower dollar claims. For more severe claims, the adjuster has received more specific information pertinent to the claim and will predict better than the model for higher dollar claims. This combination of adjuster and tabular reserves provides more consistency and accuracy on a monthly basis. The threshold varies by several variables, including product, line coverage and limit, just to name a few. Since the adjuster case reserve is $5,000 and below the threshold, the tabular case reserve of $12,125 is used in the general ledger. In addition, $1,000 of IBNR is set to cover claims that happened in December and at some point after December, would either be late reported or reopened. The IBNR reserve is not attached to any one claim and instead, set as a factor related to earned premium to cover all potential late reported or reopened claims.  The total reserve liability on the balance sheet is $12,125 per case, plus $1,000 for IBNR, equaling a total of $13,125 denoted as the dark blue dot and will be the reserve booked at the end of December. In January, the adjuster has kept their initial estimate of $5,000. Since this is below the $25,000 threshold, the tabular case reserve will again be booked to the general ledger. As part of our roll-forward process, all tabular case reserves can be adjusted monthly by an aging factor and inflation factor. As the claim is 1 month older, the actuarial algorithm predicted that all claims remaining open would have a higher ultimate cost.  In addition, all tabular case reserves that are not part of an in-depth actuarial review during the month gets inflated as well. The new tabular case reserve is 12,376, which is an increase of $251. A portion of this $251 increase is aging and a portion is inflation. This will show up in the earnings release as unfavorable prior accident year all other reserve development in January. It is important to note that other claims that settled in January may have settled for more or less than the December tabular case reserve, which would also show up in the all other development category of the earnings release. In February, the adjuster has received new information and increased their estimate to $15,000. This amount is still below the threshold and thus, the tabular case reserve is still used to set the case reserve liability. In February, this claim was part of the 25% to 30% of reserves reviewed at an in-depth level by the actuarial team. The actuarial team increased the tabular case reserve for all claims that have a similar criteria as this claim to $13,500, which is an increase of $1,124 from January.  This increase will show up as unfavorable prior accident year actuarial adjustments in the earnings release. In March, the adjuster increased their estimate again this time to $20,000. Since $20,000 is still below the threshold of $25,000, the tabular case reserve is still used as the case reserve book to the general ledger. The claim becomes plaintiff attorney rep in March, Thus, while the tabular case reserve will be inflated and aged again, it will also change due to becoming plaintiff attorney rep as this is one of the variables used in the actuarial algorithm.  The tabular case reserve is now $20,050 which is $6,550 greater than the prior month. A portion of this $6,550 increase is due to inflation, a portion due to aging and a portion due to the claim becoming plaintiff attorney rep. The $6,550 will show up as unfavorable prior accident year all other development in the monthly earnings release. In April, the adjuster has increased the reserve again to equal to the reserve threshold, the adjustor's estimate is booked to the general ledger as the case reserve for this claim. This is an increase of $4,950 in the case reserve on the balance sheet, moving from the tabular reserve at the end of March to the adjusted reserve at the end of April. The 4,950 will show up as unfavorable prior accident year all other development in the monthly earnings release.  The adjuster made no change to their estimate in May. Case reserves set equal to or over the threshold can only be changed by the adjuster revising their estimates. Thus, there are no additional changes for inflation, aging or any other factors used in the actuarial algorithm. In June, the claim closed out and settled for $20,000. This will show as $5,000 favorable in the prior accident year, all other development section of the monthly earnings release. Finally, in July, the claim was reopened an additional payment occurred for $1,500. A claim could be reopened for several reasons. For example, a claimant may have initially been undecided about a vehicle repair and received a cash settlement based upon the initial estimate. Several months later, they may have ultimately decided to repair the vehicle, and additional damage may have been found. Another example is when a claimant may initially feel that they are not injured in an accident, the claim is closed and subsequently reopened when the person realizes that they were injured in the accident. While the case reserve had closed out in June, we were still carrying $1,000 of IBNR reserves for the potential of a December claim being late reported or reopening. For this example, the IBNR reserve was released in July, which means that there is an expectation that there will be no future costs from late reports or reopens from any accident that occurred in 2022 and is currently not an open case reserve as of the end of July. The development is unfavorable $500. This would show up in the prior accident year all other category of the earnings release. In practice, the IBNR reserve for prior accident years tends to get released monthly as part of another actuarial algorithm as the probability of late reports and reopens decreases with time. An in-depth review of IBNR reserves are completed in tandem with case reserves. Remember, any changes made to factors by the actuarial team as a result of those reviews will show up under the prior accident year actuarial category. For the year, the starting reserve was $13,125 and the claim was eventually paid for $21,500. The year-to-date development is unfavorable by this difference, which is $8,375. I as the Chief Actuary, have complete decision-making authority on our reserves. And while the actuarial team has complete independence in determining the reserves to be booked, there are many checks and balances in place. Internally, we have a close partnership with our claims, pricing and product management business partners. Meetings are held throughout the month at both a localized and national level discussing trends, changes in the mix of business, claims process changes, rate activity and methodologies.  Quarterly, I meet with the Audit Committee members of the Board of Directors to discuss results and trends for the quarter. Furthermore, our external auditors perform an annual audit of the company as required by the SEC. My actuarial team meets with the audit firm to discuss our actuarial process, current trends and results for the respective quarters and year.  I hope that you have found this presentation helpful. For more information on Progressive's loss reserving practices, we posted a report under the investor site of progressive.com. This report is updated every 2 years. Thank you for your time today. And I will next turn it over to Jim to discuss cohort pricing. Jim Curtis : Thanks, Gary. Now let's transition from estimating ultimate losses in LAE to another key element of our pricing, which is our expected lifetime value. We price each policy written to a lifetime target consistent with our enterprise goal of a 96 combined ratio. We refer to this as cohort pricing where a cohort is defined by policies written at new business and followed through their expected lifetime value, including all renewal terms. Lifetime performance is measured as the sum of all expenses realized and the premium earned across all new and renewal terms for a policy. When I say all expenses, by that, I mean loss, LAE, acquisition expenses and operational expenses. As you can see by the stylized chart, loss and expense costs vary between new and renewal policy terms. With this in mind, we price across the policy life to achieve a lifetime 96 combined ratio. Said another way, the sum of lifetime loss and expenses divided by lifetime earned premium, nets us at 96 combined. This pricing approach positions us to offer a competitive rate of new business and stable rates across renewals.  Now that we have a conceptual view of cohort pricing, let's dig into the mechanics. The following is a tabular representation of the lifetime view we covered in the last graph. We think about pricing in 3 separate categories : loss in LAE, acquisition expense and operational expense. Loss and LAE represent our indemnity experience. We break out our expense ratio into acquisition and operational expenses. And in all cases, renewal business operates at a total lower cost structure than the first term or our new business. While we price to the lifetime profitability of our policies at a 96 or better, we also manage this approach with consideration to our calendar year goal of meeting a 96 or better-combined ratio. Next will explore each individual category or line item and finish with our management of cohort pricing within our calendar year 96 goal. Let's start with loss and LAE expense. Loss ratio improves from new business to renewal and is primarily a function of mix of business and policy life expectancy. And we priced to that expected lifetime loss ratio performance based on the characteristics at new business, which ensures the business written is priced to a lifetime target. Starting in the upper left in this illustrative example, you can see that our first-term business runs at a loss and LAE ratio of 85% with our renewal book of business at 77%. With an expected policy life of 6 policy terms, the lifetime loss and LAE ratio is at 78%. When combined with our other expense categories, the lifetime CR is at 96%, thereby combining new and renewal performance and achieving our lifetime target. However, within the new-to-renewal loss ratio performance, there are segmentation opportunities as not all policy characteristics at new business have the same expected lifetime loss ratio performance. Building on this with an illustrative example, consider car color starting in the upper right. When looking at the expected renewal improvement from new business in loss ratio on red cars, we see a larger change than we expect to see in green cars.  The implication for pricing are twofold. First, we observed that red cars last on average 5 policy terms and green cars last on average 7 policy terms. The second consideration is that the loss behavior also varies. We priced at this differential in expected policy life expectancy and the different improvement in indemnity performance between the 2 segments, in this illustrative case car color. Applying this to a real-life opportunity, we frequently discuss key consumer segments as Sams, Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons and our continued opportunity for growth in the Robinsons segment. As a refresher, Robinsons, our consumers who bundle their home and auto needs and typically have a longer policy life expectancy. We can recognize this policy extension and build it into our pricing, which ultimately leads to lower rates with more lifetime renewal premium at a lower cost structure. Finally, while I focused on the indemnity piece of cohort pricing, you'll also note that the policy life expectancy can affect the other expense categories.  We'll move into the distribution channel and acquisition costs next. Before we dig deeper into acquisition expenses, we need to first review the fundamental differences between the direct channel and the independent agency channel. While we price both channels to a lifetime 96, the economics differ in both how we account for the acquisition cost and relatedly, the timing of those costs. Starting on the left, Direct has an upfront acquisition expense by virtue of our marketing spend. We spend consumer marketing dollars, media and nonmedia alike and account for the entire acquisition expense in the new business term. We can see that in the illustrative example with a 60% acquisition expense ratio on the first term and 0% on subsequent renewal terms. Again, this reinforces the lifetime value of extending policy life expectancy. With the independent agency channel, policies are acquired at the cost of commission paid to the agent. The commission expense is paid to the agent and ultimately reflects a percentage of premium earned by policy term. Unlike Direct, we see a much smaller acquisition expense in the first term, which reflects the commission paid on that term, and we see additional expense in renewal policies also reflecting a percentage of premium earned. In both cases, in this dialyzed example, lifetime acquisition expense is 10%, and we achieved a 96% combined ratio, but we have a much larger first-term expense in Direct and a higher renewal expense in Agency. Let's look at each distribution channel in a little more detail. We'll start by spending more time on how policy life expectancy is a key component to our direct acquisition economics. Consider 2 policies with different PLEs. In policy #1, we see a total of 6 policy terms with a target acquisition expense of 60% on that first term. With an average policy premium of about $750, we can assume our rate level considers about a $450 acquisition expense, which is about 10% across the entire life of the policy. In other words, 750 x 6 policy terms is 4,500 and the $450 policy acquisition expense is 10% over that lifetime premium.  Now let's move to policy #2. Holding all else constant, but the policy life expectancy, you can see the first term assumptions produces the same 450 permissible or 60% of 750. However, with the addition of 2 policy terms, the acquisition expense of $450 million is now 8% of total policy lifetime premium. Said another way, we invested the same $450 in policy acquisition as we did in policy #1, but we see the benefit the PLE extension gives us as a lower acquisition expense as a percentage of lifetime premium. We can segment our pricing to capture differences in policy life expectancy. Depending on market conditions, we can either increase the allowable to drive additional demand or we can lower our rate level to increase our new business conversion. In both cases, we will still achieve a lifetime 96. A real-life example would be our continued segmentation efforts, reflecting our consumer marketing segments and correspondingly, our investment to acquire Robinsons. Again, those who bundle home and auto, which carry a longer policy life expectancy compared to those who don't bundle their home and auto with Progressive. Moving on to the Agency channel. This distribution business model takes a different form, as I mentioned, we pay commission to agents. In the example above, the policy achieves a lifetime 96, but you can see that the acquisition expense ratio is the same between the first policy term and the remaining 5 renewal terms. This is possible because we pay commission by policy term and ultimately unearned premium. In practice, it is possible to vary commission by new and renewal. However, even in this scenario, the combined ratio implications will likely be much flatter than what we see in our direct economics. Because we pay a percent of commission is earned, acquisition costs and dollars will vary based on policy premium, but as a percentage of premium, we'll always match.  This is a key element in cohort pricing as the dollars may vary, but the expense as a percentage of the premium will be the same. We still see cohort performance that has an overall higher cost structure in new business, but it is proportionately more in an indemnity and operational expense relative to our direct business model. Finally, we finished with operational expenses, and we see a modest new renewal differential. The operational cost for servicing new business policies is greater than the operational cost for renewal terms. The remaining other category includes things like bad debt or unpaid balances on earned premiums. We extend coverage on a canceled policy and did not receive payment. This happens with greater frequency on new business. We see these expense differentials consistently and can also price them into our product. Calendar year earnings have an implicit new and renewal mix driving results, and we manage that mix to ensure target combined ratios are achieved for the calendar year-end question.  While managing our new renewal mix, we consider both the mix of our cohorts and the rate revisions earning in. Remember that rate from revisions take time to earn in as policies have to renew into the new rate level. Typically, this happens in our new business faster than renewal as our rates hit the marketplace before our renewal book. This will affect the combined ratio performance of our new business and renewal cohorts. Setting rate changes aside, periods of accelerated new business application growth can apply upward pressure on our combined ratio, as we now know, new business has a higher expected combined ratio and in the case of Direct has additional pressure based on our accounting of consumer marketing expense. Using this stylized example, you can see that in a period of high growth, new business makes up a larger portion of our total earned premium. And while we may be within our lifetime targets, we see our calendar combined ratio pierce the 96. To manage this, we can slow growth and thereby reduce the mix of new business earned premiums, which results in a combined ratio less than our 96 goals. And in both cases, we are within our cohort targets. This is a great example of how we develop our media budget. We consider both our lifetime economics and our margin position considering each simultaneously with calendar year performance taking priority, and we then adjust our budget accordingly. Upward pressure from new business can be dampened by the lengthening of policy life expectancy as our renewal book becomes a larger portion of the overall book of business. With the expected combined ratio improvement, we can use that to manage new and renewal earned premium mix. As you can see, as it relates to our expected cohort performance, we price across the lifetime of a policy and balance our near-term and long-term growth with our 96 calendar year goal. Thank you for your time. A - Douglas Constantine : This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Gary Traicoff and Jim Curtis, who can answer questions about the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question. Operator : The first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, you guys highlighted that you need 6 points of additional price, right, in Personal Auto over the balance of the year. Can you just help us get a sense, what are you assuming for severity and even frequency, just overall from a loss trend perspective when you think about additional rate need from here? Susan Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. We really don't share our trend selects normally. But obviously, we've been seeing the trends in shorter-tail business increase as just the repairs to vehicles have slowed down. And when we look at that in overall kind of both frequency and severity, we think we're at 6 right now. And just like I said in the last call that could range. But at this juncture, we think we need another 6, so about 17-ish for the full year. Elyse Greenspan : And that will get you -- you believe that will get you to the 96? Susan Griffith : It will certainly get close. Again, all the caveats I said last time with weather. We feel much better about our reserving because of those losses being short-tailed, and we started seeing those at the end of last year. So I believe Gary really got out in front of that. It will certainly get us closer. But again, all the caveats and the uncertainty that we've felt for the last 3 years kind of are underlying that assumption. Elyse Greenspan : And then my follow-up, you guys saw a significant amount of adverse development for accident year 2022. So I'm just trying to square the fact that there was a good amount of adverse development for accident year '22 with the improvement that you're seeing in the accident year ex-cat loss ratio so far this year. Susan Griffith : Yes. What I would say to that is as those 2022 rates earned in that I put on one of the slides that I had, we believe we're putting on the books both new and renewal business that is closer to or below our targets, our accident year targets, I should say, in both channels on a year-to-date basis. So we feel good about where we're at in the business we're putting on the book in 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Michael Zaremski : I guess my first question is on loss cost expenses. And you talked about, Tricia, coming from a variety of sources. And you also talked in the letter about some of those sources looking like they're maybe mean reverting or decelerating a bit. But I guess just stepping back, I know there's -- I know this is a complicated issue because there's lots of different sources. But we saw, I feel like over the last decade or so, a bit of a secular trend in terms of higher bodily injury expense inflation levels. And maybe you disagree with that. But -- and the industry seems like they've been doing a decent job of appreciating that over time in pricing for it. It seems like it's coming more -- or we can see the data is coming more from the non-BI side today. And so do you feel like there's like a stickiness to this that you and the industry are appreciating? And ultimately, does this kind of cause Progressive to not be able to maybe play as much often if there's uncertainty on the trend over the coming year or so? Susan Griffith : Yes. I think we have our arms around it. I mean for BI, obviously, we try to keep ahead of that trend. When we see it, we react to it, and we're in line with the industry. This has been a very unusual time. As you know, if you've looked over the last couple of years, and you've seen the Manheim used car index and how that's flowed. Even though you're seeing it tick down a little bit, it still is a very big difference in what you saw in 2018 and 2019. So when we look at that, especially as we looked at the second half of last year, we really started to see the trend, specifically in property damage, but also in collision increase. And it's really -- and we're watching it flow through in our claims organization.  So you have -- let's take the property damage example. Somebody is taking care -- another one of our carriers -- competitors taking care of their insured, but they're going to subrogate us. So that accident happens today. And there's no shop capacity for that particular hit. So they do an estimate as best they can with the sheet metal still in the car. Let's say it's drivable, for this example. And they continue to drive. The shop can get it in 45 days from now, maybe 60 days from now. It comes in, they get the sheet metal off of it, oh, lo and behold, there's more damage. Those supplements are more frequent, and they're more expensive.  So you're having capacities, longer cycle times, longer rental times. I think I said in my letter, the rental time, we're seeing it go down a little bit, and that's one data point. So we'll continue to watch that. But you've got that, and then you've got labor rates and parts increase. So in terms of your question, the stickiness, will likely be based on wages for workers in the body shop.  So there -- recently a Wall Street Journal article that talked about automotive repair workers, their salaries increased 24% in quarter 4 of 2022 compared to 2018. So 20% over the last year, and that was from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And making cars be in the same position, the indemnification of the vehicles has also soared since 2018, about 36%. So I do think we might see some trends like in used car prices as the supply chain issues came through and new, et cetera. That might continue to go down. But I think some of the other things will be part of our new normal. Michael Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful. My final question is on the expense ratio. It's been -- the expense ratio has come down a lot. You've called out. We can see some of the math behind it. It looks like ad expenses has been the biggest lever, which is a great lever to have. But kind of curious directionally is -- we're looking at the ad expense ratio over a decade plus, is this -- are we kind of at the trough? Or is there more room for either ad and/or the expense ratio to come down in the coming quarters? Susan Griffith : Well, as we attempt to get to our calendar year 96 where there's always levers we can pull, clearly, I'd rather be in a different position where we're spending more money on media and continuing to grow as long as, of course, that would be at our target profit margins. We have a lot of discipline within the company as well in terms of expenses in times such as these. So we -- obviously, we'll continue to look at that for this next 6 months to see if we can get closer to that 96. Operator : The next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan Securities. Jimmy Bhullar : So you went through a lot of details on your whole process on reserving. But maybe just stepping back, can you talk about your confidence in where your reserves sit now? And given that you've had, I think, 6 straight months of adverse development, are you much more comfortable in reserves overall? Or is there still a lot of uncertainty, and it's hard to say that you've got up in terms of loss trends? Susan Griffith : I'll let Gary weigh in on that. I would say from where I sit, I'm much more comfortable. But again, Gary is independent and does his reserve reviews without my involvement. I hear about that just a little bit before you do. So Gary, why don't you weigh in a little bit. Gary Traicoff : Sure. Thanks, Tricia. Great question, Jimmy. So overall, yes, I feel really good about our overall reserve position and where we're at right now. To your point, we have had quite a bit of unfavorable development each of the last 6 months. As Tricia pointed out, if you exclude Florida, all of the development would really be coming from accident year 2022 were actually favorable on accident year '21 and prior.  And within accident year '22, over 85% is from accidents that happened in the last 6 months of the year. And a lot of that relates to the fixing cars and the reopen severity that Tricia was talking about. That's fairly short-tailed. We've seen that come through the data, and we have reacted very quickly to it. And so that gives me a lot of confidence because of the short tail nature of -- or most of the issue was that we're in a good position right now. At the same time, right, I can't obviously guarantee and the data could change going forward, but I feel really good of our current position. Susan Griffith : Thanks, Gary. Jimmy Bhullar : And along the same lines on Florida, I think it was somewhat expected that the number of lawsuits would go up given total form, but it's lasted longer in your results. So just wondering how the number of lawsuits that are coming in have trended through the last 3, 4 months or so? And was there an element of Florida in June in terms of adverse development and how that's changed versus maybe April and May? Gary Traicoff : Yes. So that's a good question. So with respect to Florida overall, obviously, the big hit occurred March, April, May. And we've started to see it level out in what's been coming through. Most of June really related to the actuarial adjustments that we took from the reserve reviews primarily related to property damage, third-party fixing cars. So Florida had a very little impact from what we had from the June development. Susan Griffith : Yes. And all I would say in addition to that is as soon as the House Bill 837 went through, and then we had the subsequent lawsuits that I talked about, we went in and were pretty aggressive and conservative because we were trying to figure out what was estimable and probable. And that will develop over time as those also get settled. So that's not something that we'll know right away because those take a little bit longer to settle. Operator : The next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore. David Motemaden : I just had a follow-up on the reserves. Gary, you had mentioned that you can adjust up to 100% of your reserve balance monthly. I'm just wondering if that happened in June. Or was it a normal review where you maybe did 60 to 70 reviews, but not a complete review? And we have to wait for potential further movement upwards or downwards as we move forward over the next few months? Gary Traicoff : Yes. Good question. So in June, it was the typical 25% to 30% of reserves that were looked at. The comment related to the 100% kind of goes to the part on the reviews that we do not look at in the month. They still will be inflated or unless -- particularly if they're below the threshold, they will be inflated. And they also will be aged.  They also can change. For example, they become plaintiff attorney rep, et cetera. So the potential every month to have 100% of the reserves adjusted somewhat whether it's by an adjuster or whether it's by inflation or aging exists. In terms of our normal process, we typically stay pretty consistent with that 25% to 30%. I would say the only couple of times we might deviate, in December, in particular, because I'm the opining actuary for the statutory reserves. If we are seeing additional information, we may add a review or 2 to make sure that the statutory companies are in the correct position as of year-end. And then, obviously, for something like Florida when the House Bill passes, we would go in immediately with new information from that and do an adjustment. David Motemaden : Got it. So I guess -- so in the June review, it sounds -- so I guess you just confirmed that was just 25% to 30% and maybe some other adjustments around the edges, but it wasn't one of those full comprehensive reviews. Gary Traicoff : Yes, that's correct. David Motemaden : Great. And then just my second question, so I believe there was a stylized example just given about the mix of business and how having less new business, more renewal business can have an impact. I guess how quickly can that have an impact on the combined ratio, particularly considering the growth that you guys had in the first quarter? Is that something where that mix can change significantly through the end of this year? Susan Griffith : I'll let Jim talk about that a little bit. Obviously, there's a lot more that goes into it than just the acquisition expense. A lot has to do with losses, and there could be uncertainty around catastrophes, et cetera. But Jim, do you want to talk a little bit about that? Jim Curtis : Sure. Also a good question. A couple of ways to think about that. There's several dimensions to consider when thinking about mix. So to your point about any type of lag function when we write business, it's in written premium, but doesn't necessarily hit our earned premium mix until it starts to age or get into the policy term.  So we would see on a 6-month basis, roughly 3 to 4 months later, where you start to see your earned premium mix shift. That would work in both ways, periods of growth on new business apps and periods of slowing our new business apps. Unidentified Company Representative : The one thing I would add to that, just for clarification, we expensed advertising in the period incurred. So all -- on a direct basis, especially -- and you're seeing that come through the expense ratio very quickly. Jim Curtis : Yes, I would -- and I would build on that, that the expense does hit immediately. The earned premium mix would -- really would start to see some measure of reaction in our indemnity performance. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Taylor Scott : First one I had is on the commentary that you guys gave on the lifetime combined ratios. And it just strikes me is a lot of that is very geared towards what the lifetime ends up being. And appreciate that you guys probably have the best data and best capability to analyze it, too. But are we at a period of time where just given how unprecedented it is, with inflation and all the pricing, I mean how much room is there around the estimates that you guys are putting into the lifetime?  I mean, are you being conservative around potentially significantly higher churn as we kind of get through this period where everything is being taken out to market on a much more consistent basis? And how much is that being incorporated into your decision as to whether to start growing quickly or not? Susan Griffith : Well, I think we always -- each data point. And as we get more confidence, of course, we were able to do that. We saw an increase in PLE on both the 12 months and 3 months. I'd like to see a couple more data points because there's a lot of shopping in the industry. And obviously, you're looking at the same data we are from the industry, and there's a lot from movement from rates. So I would say there's hundreds of variables that we look at when we think about that. And we'll continue to do so, again, in this uncertain environment. Jim, do you want to add anything? Jim Curtis : Sure. We also consider different time periods and just typical when looking at data set, longer time period, more credibility and more confidence we have. We'll look at recent time period as just a leading indicator adjust slowly. My team set sort of our permissible acquisition as an example, and we just go through that exact process. Unidentified Company Representative : I would just quickly add is that we're not writing a 4-year policy at once, right? We constantly adjust rates to ensure we're hitting our lifetime targets. So to the extent that we have those targets, every renewal of every policy, and we have an advantage with a mix of 6 months policies that we can adjust as we see another card or see another data point in loss costs, et cetera. Susan Griffith : Have you seen that with how nimble we've been with our pricing over the year? As we've seen things we've made changes. We are as anxious as likely our shareholders to grow. But again, we have a very specific core value of profit on a calendar year 96. And so that's a priority. Taylor Scott : Got it. That's helpful. The follow-up I had is on the loss adjustment side of things. I mean some of the anecdotal chatter, I've heard out there is that just given where the labor markets are and so forth that the claims adjusting process might be challenged by that and being able to get the right amount of hires and talent and to be able to execute that process like it's done normally. And are you -- have you experienced any of that? Is that at all a challenge that you face in trying to get the reserves in the right spot consistently? Or is that something that's less of an issue at this point? Susan Griffith : I think it's a little bit less of an issue. I think anytime you have the growth we've had and with the labor environment that has been around for a couple of years, it's a challenge. I will say at this juncture, we are fully staffed in our claims organization. So we feel really great about that and turnover is continuing to go down.  That said, our tenure is still low. And so with that comes just the learning curve from that. And our Claims President is having the newer people definitely are in the office with supervisors because that's really where you learn a lot and you get up to speed very quickly, and we have a lot of processes in order to do that.  But I would say, if you asked me that a year ago, it would be a different answer than today. I feel confident in our claims organization, the action they're taking. And as tenure continues to grow, I think we'll be in a great position for accuracy. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : Yes. I guess my question is for Jim. Looking at the new cohort acquisition cost ratio, can you talk a little bit about how the current period with ambient shopping in the last meeting to reach new customers with advertising to get them onboarding affects the way you look at that new cohort margin? Jim Curtis : Sure. We measure that by our permissible compared to actual. Actual is defined as our media spend or consumer marketing spend and income and volume apps, with what we believe to be as a sort of heightened dislocation in the marketplace, a lot of shopping, which we hold our conversion level that will drive our cost per sale down. And so in the current period, we'd be pretty efficient. And then it's a matter of managing our media budget to our calendar year position. Joshua Shanker : And I realize how valuable the 96 calendar year is to the company. Is there a risk that right now, there's an opportunity to acquire new customers at a cost far below the long-term average and by focusing on the 96, there's a lot of growth being forgone that ultimately will be more expensive to achieve in the future? Susan Griffith : Josh, that's a great question, one we obviously ask ourselves. And in fact, I was recently onboarding a new director on our Board. And I let her know that are, in my mind, as I lead the organization, there are 2 things that are sacrosanct here : our 5 core values at our 96 calendar year combined ratio.  So I'm going to -- this is going to be a longer answer, but I think it's one that a lot of the -- a lot of your analysts -- the analysts have asked Doug. And so I think it's worth the time for -- just me to walk through a little bit how we think about this on the profit side, the growth side and the capital side.  So let me first begin by reiterating our core values and, of course, one is profit -- public in 1971. And ever since that date, it's been publicly talked about, probably prior to that, I just don't have the evidence in writing. But like all our other core values, profits, it's not a value of convenience, where we look to waver from it depending on the business. It's really how we guide our business. It's an all-in number. We don't manage to an underlying even though that's obviously something we look at, but it can't be exclusive of catastrophes or adverse development or reserve development of any kind because that's part of being the business of insurance. How it reads -- it's our profit core value states. We have a responsibility to ourselves, our customers, agents and investors to be a profitable and enduring company by offering products and services consumers value. It's part of what makes and has made Progressive so successful. We inject the discipline of putting profits before growth, and we've built a business that has delivered better than industry results consistently for a very long time. That consistency in which we've been able to deliver on our profit target is a significant part of the share price multiples we enjoy today. Like now when profits are under pressure, we take action quickly and aggressively. And by taking action quickly and aggressively, we not only meet our targets, we've also put business that reaches or exceeds our goals and deflect business that doesn't. You might remember, because you've been around for a while, over 7 years ago when I took over this role, I took the opportunity to publicly commit to some objectives that we've written about for years. And I just want to take a moment to reiterate one of those. It's outlined in our annual report in our policy section, but I think it's worth repeating. For us, a 96 combined ratio is not a solve for variable in our business model equation, but rather a constant that provides direction to each product and marketing decision and a cultural shipping point that ensures 0 ambiguity as to how to act in certain situations. Set at a level we believe create a fair balance between attractive profitability and consumer competitiveness, it's deeply ingrained and central to our culture.  I can't really stress that enough. It's part of the fabric of our culture and really embedded in everything we do along with the other 4 core values. It's true our published accident year ratios are lower than the calendar year ratios and closer to our targets. However, that's the moment in time. And I really have said several times in prior calls that uncertainty is a new normal since the onset of the pandemic, and that remains true today.  So for us, growing fast in an uncertain future, before profit is addressed it's a recipe for sustained profit pain. Many insurance companies make this misstep, and we don't intend to repeat those mistakes. But let me go to growth because I think that's the story that we're not hearing enough as well. I wanted to remind everyone of the significant growth we've had in the first half of 2023. In 6 months, we've added 2.2 million policies in force. And we've increased written premiums by over $5 billion, and that's the equivalent of adding a top 10 Personal Auto carrier. So I would say growth this year could be defined as spectacular.  Ambient shopping, and you brought that up, does remain elevated. Our agency channel is actually the best barometer for industry shopping levels because it's less affected by media expenditures. And that channel quotes were up about 16% in the quarter. If we had perfect knowledge about the future and knew that we, for sure, had adequate rates, undoubtedly, there's opportunity for significant growth today.  But that said, growth opportunities today do not preclude the possibility of growth opportunities tomorrow. You've probably watched in the past, and we've taken rates and other underwriting actions to focus on achieving our profitability goal. We've proven to be better positioned for strong growth in the following periods : 2022 was among the worst years for industry Personal Auto profitability and so far, 2023 has been worse.  While we can't know the future, current market conditions suggest there'll be opportunity to increase market share in the future. And then just let me wrap up by saying growth can't happen without growing surplus. Our capital position today is strong, and we believe we have plenty of capital to support the premium growth we expect.  We have a structured growth business that is largely self-funding internally through underwriting profits and investment returns. So to bring us back full circle, our profit core value is the key to sustained growth. I know that was a long answer, but I think it's really important to be super clear and unambiguous about how we think about the business. I hope that answered your question, and hopefully, others. Operator : The next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Charles Peters : I'm going to start building upon the comments you just had about the growth results and Jim's cohort pricing. I'm wondering if you can provide us a perspective of how the limits profile of your consolidated order book have changed. I would imagine if you're focused more on Robinsons, the profile is moving up. But maybe you could give us an updated perspective on how that looks and where you think it might be heading. Susan Griffith : Yes, I think you're spot on. We are trying to have more and more of the Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons. We love Sams as long as we can make our target profit margin, but we continue to increase our bundle. And as we think about both auto and property, those bundles are more important. So we've increased our Robinsons over time. And then, of course, we've talked about this in the past, and it's probably worth an update at some point in the next couple of quarters.  The soon-to-be Robinsons. So it could be a Diane that's buying a house, et cetera. So we'll continue to try to be a place for every cohort, but we have increased our Robinsons profile in the last several years. And of course, during times like this, Sams are going to shop more because they're very incented by price. Charles Peters : Right. I guess -- well, I guess what I'm wondering is, in the cohort pricing, there's an assumption around retention. And given that there's all these price changes happening, not only at Progressive, but with a lot of other companies in the auto sector, I'm wondering how with elevated shopping, how those retention characteristics are holding out at the Robinson level, at the right level? Is it matching what your expectations are? Or is that causing some hiccups along your pricing assumptions? Susan Griffith : Well, I think -- we don't talk about retention with each of the profiles of our consumers, the marketing tiers. But we do look over time. And historically, Robinsons have fared better. And we find that the more products you have, the stickier you're going to be. And Sams, especially if there's other characteristics to go, can -- last about the same months and haven't varied too much over the years. But although we don't share it, I would say Robinsons continue to be stickier. Unidentified Company Representative : Great. I just -- we are constantly looking at the assumption to go into our acquisition model. As Jim was mentioning, we use PLE to understand the permissible costs for acquiring customers, and we do that at a very granular level. So you're right. There have been significant changes in policy life expectancy. Obviously, lately, it has been going back up, and we're looking at that at a very granular level and pricing that in over the lifetime of those customers. And to pass point, we have many shots at pricing -- repricing those customers, if necessary. Operator : The next question comes from Tracy Bunguigui with Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : Just a quick follow-up on your 96% combined ratio target. I appreciate all the commentary so far. But I'm just wondering, do you feel like there are secular changes going on in auto that you may need to do better than 96%? Like it feels like the tail is lengthening, which is happening for property damage despite it being a short tail line, which could add to volatility. Susan Griffith : Well, good question, Tracy. You remember our 96 is an aggregate. So we look at it differently for new business, renewal business. We've taken to the assumptions of our PLE products, state, although it all goes up to 96, which I don't think will change. One, thing, we do look at a really granular level; and two, I think we want to watch this playthrough because some of these changes came about pretty quickly in the delays. And a lot of it is really the shop capacity. And as that starts to open up with the exception of what I talked about with labor rates and probably prices, I think we could be priced adequately and continue to keep our 96 calendar year and lifetime goal. That would be my approach. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Your year-to-date current accident year actuarial adjustments of $424 million was primarily driven by fixing vehicle coverages. So how do I reconcile that update with your property damage severity loss trend going down when you come up with your loss picks? Like you reported yesterday, property damage severity is 11%. But if I compare that to 1Q, it was 15% and then 20% in the full year '22. Susan Griffith : Well, we had a lot of rate increases come in, so that was one of them. And a lot of our property, if you take -- if you look at the property and the cat load on top of it or the -- I should say, the cats we've had, you can take that into account. But it is -- that 80% of that, I think you did the quarterly number, but 80% of that $1.1 billion on the year-to-date was auto, 50% was cars, about 35-ish percent was Florida, glass, PIP, BI. And then the rest was IBNR and BI across the country, but property did not -- did develop favorably. Gary, do you want to add anything? Gary Traicoff : So I think Tricia's spot on there. The one thing I would add, Tracy, to your point, the property damage severity that you're showing, that's for all claims, if we stratified and only looked at the reopen severity, which is really where the reserve actual adjustments have come from. The reopen severity is well above and has been increasing over those quarters relative to the 13%, 14% you're seeing. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Yes. Sorry, I meant in your current loss pick, your current -- your actuarial adjustment, not the $22 million adjustments. Are you considering a higher loss pick for property damage or not given that -- it feels like that loss trend is trending down? Gary Traicoff : Yes. We are. So I think to your point, even though the overall is trending down some, the reopen severity, we believe, on the current accident year has been trending up. And so a lot of those actuarial adjustments, both on prior and current year are reflecting the elevated reopen severity. Even though, to your point, the overall has come down, that is a different trend if you just look at only the reopen severity, which is really what's driving a lot of the reserves. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : So Tricia, I guess just going back to the comments you were making about how in the past, you've had tons of remediation that have led to tons of outsized growth. And you referenced that you see opportunity for that in the future. Just curious from where you sit today, is there any reason to think your appetite will grow, will be different going into 2024 than it was going into 2023? Susan Griffith : As long as we look at the data and feel good about where we're at with our combined ratio on overall calendar year and accident year, we will grow as fast as we can. So that has been our objective for a long time, 96, grow as fast as we can. We want to do that. We're a growth company. We feel great about it. But again, profits over growth. But as soon as we feel confident with the little stability and less uncertainty, we are very prepared to grow. Ryan Tunis : And just to be clear, like let's just say they're about -- you guys executed, but there's a bad hurricane and you ended up coming in at That wouldn't lead you to punish yourselves and not grow in January, right? You'd be looking what you think the prospective returns are. Susan Griffith : Yes. Yes. We don't know how the next 6 months will go. We're going to do the best we can. But again, like you said, if something happens, that is above and beyond that would be different. But yes, we will continue to grow. And in 2024 would be a new year as long as we felt that we had the policies on the book that we believe are at or below our new and renewal targets. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then just lastly, we've talked about the impact of the [indiscernible] stuff on prior year. Is there any way to quantify the loss ratio impact did that happen in the first half of 2023 -- on the current accident year? Susan Griffith : From Florida, you mean? Ryan Tunis : Correct. Unidentified Company Representative : The current accident year, the impact was virtually 0 because those are lawsuits that are opening on claims that occurred pre-HB837. It can't be now because HB837 was in March. So there's some, but predominantly, those were prior year claims. We're also looking closely at what we expect to be some benefit in the environment from HB837 as well. We're looking at the data closely. It will take a while to assess if indeed, we are seeing that. But we personally -- we believe that there is going to be a benefit, and we look forward to pricing in once we see it. Operator : The next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : A lot of questions on the 96, so I'll pile on here. So if I understand correctly, you're still within line of sight, being close to 96 for this calendar year. One of the ways you can achieve that is by lowering new business growth, which ultimately should improve the combined ratio. I guess my question is, and maybe it's the other side of Josh's question earlier, ultimately, can you achieve that simply by lowering the new business growth while achieving kind of a 96 combined ratio for cohorts?  Or do you now need -- or are you aiming to achieve a better than 96 for existing cohorts in order to get to the 96 will be as close to the 96 for the year. Susan Griffith : Well, we clearly need to get a rate. So that's one part of the formula. We also have really had a lot of restrictions from an underwriting perspective. on new business. And so those are some other things that go into it. We have a line of sight, but again, we'll caveat that by all the comments regarding uncertainty that I've said before. Yaron Kinar : Okay. But ultimately, do you believe that beyond the kind of flexing down or up the new business growth, do you need to take any additional actions to lower the combined ratio for the existing business below 96 in order to get to a full year 96 or close to it? Unidentified Company Representative : So clearly, the new renewal mix is working in our favor right now. The other bigger tailwind is the rate that's earning in. So we've taken a lot of rates. We still have about 6 points in Personal Auto for that rate to earn in. Additionally, we're taking 6 more points for the rest of the year. So the denominator effect is a tailwind for us the rest of the year. Yaron Kinar : Got it. And then my other question, maybe for Gary, since Gary is on the call. We saw an uptick in bodily injury severity this quarter. And I am curious as to how that ultimately plays out or how you think about it, how you approach that with regards to prior year reserves? Ultimately, I would think that bodily injury has a longer tail, so more risk there for things going adversely. So how do you approach that? Susan Griffith : I'll start, and then Gary can weigh in. About half of the BI was actuarial reserves, but it's pretty much in line with the industry. So we're not too concerned about it. A lot of them are soft tissue, attorney rep but not litigated. So they do take longer. But I feel like we're in a good position and understand where they're headed. And I think in a better position than we were even a year ago. Gary, do you want to add anything? Gary Traicoff : Yes. I think Tricia is spot on there. The only couple of things I'd add from the reserve side is we tend to look at the data off of an accident period basis, right, as opposed to reported calendar information. The accident period data is more smooth, right, on a calendar basis, you can get some movements up or down, sometimes with changes in mix or closures, et cetera. So on an accident period basis, we're a little bit lower than what that shows. The other thing what Tricia alluded to is there's some large loss mix, et cetera. If you think back to that presentation, that's one of the reasons we employ that reserve threshold. So when our claims adjusters identify those large losses, once it's above that threshold, they put that up immediately. So it's recognized in the reserves. And again, there could be a little bit a timing difference between the accident period and the calendar period, which you would see. Douglas Constantine : We've exhausted our scheduled time, and so that concludes our event. Michelle, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation's Second Quarter Investor Event. Information about a replay of this event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Douglas Constantine : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's Third Quarter Investor Event. I'm Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes schedule for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Introductory comments by our CEO were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we'll use the balance of the 60 minutes schedule for this event for live questions and answers with members of our leadership team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first, second, and third quarters of 2023, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia? Susan Griffith : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. At the end of the second quarter, we were in a difficult place. Rising loss cost, adverse development and catastrophic weather events meant we were facing a significant uphill battle to deliver on our calendar year 96 combined ratio target, while facing a very uncertain future. We made difficult decisions to steer the business through this challenging time. Despite the headwinds, I believed in our strategy and the leaders who are in charge of delivering that strategy. While we knew it wouldn't be easy, we knew that if we execute it properly, we come out better on the other side. While there is still much uncertainty in our future and more work to do, the results in the third quarter suggest our strategy is working. Before discussing what did happen in the third quarter, let's first discuss what did not happen. First, unlike the first half of the year, the third quarter saw modest company-wide reserve development of only 0.2 points unfavorable across all lines. As we discussed in our presentation during our last call, our reserving group adjusted reserves in the first half tracks many things, including higher severity caused by steepening trends in our fixing vehicle coverages, and higher attorney representation rates in Florida precipitated by House Bill 837. In contrast to the first half, in the third quarter, we saw some flattening in the loss cost trends for fixing and replacing vehicles. We also now believe we have adequately reserved for the higher severity related to pre-House Bill 837 lawsuits. Second, in the third quarter, catastrophe losses were 1.3 points lower in total after reinsurance than the first half of the year. We do not write homeowners in Hawaii. So our exposure to the heart-wrenching Maui fires was limited. After reinsurance, our property catastrophe losses in the third quarter were 28 points lower than the first 6 months of the year. And while Hurricane Idalia was devastating to the people in this path of destruction, the density of homes and autos we insured in that path was relatively low. What did happen in the third quarter is that our rate and non-rate actions had a positive effect on premium and profitability. Including the 4 points of rate we took in the third quarter, we have now taken approximately 16 points in personal auto year-to-date with more of that rate earning in every day. Both Commercial Lines and homeowners also took rate as we looked to address loss trends in those lines. We continue to adjust and refine non-rate actions across the portfolio to help the business we are writing to meet our profitability targets. In addition to improved underwriting results, our net income is also benefiting from the higher interest rate environment. For the first 9 months, our investment portfolio yield is 90 basis points higher, and recurring investment income is 59% higher than the same period last year. With sustained higher interest rates, we expect yields to continue to increase as securities with lower interest rates mature and those funds are reinvested at higher rates. Many of the actions we took and continue to take to address profitability have an adverse impact on unit growth. New apps in personal auto were down 20% in the third quarter compared to the prior year and contributed to a decrease in PIF compared to the end of the second quarter. This is a reflection of our self-imposed pullback in media spend as we seek to manage our combined ratio through the acquisition expense ratio and find the right balance in cohort pricing, which we talked about at length at our last quarterly call. We continue to assess our marketing spend. And as always, we endeavor to find the right balance between profitability and new business growth. While new applications shrank year-over-year in personal auto, retention reflected through our PLE measure continues to be robust at 35% in personal auto on a trailing 3 basis. We believe robust retention, especially in the face of higher rates than a year ago is an indicator that many of our competitors are still tight on underwriting, and we remain competitive in the marketplace. Despite the headwinds created by our profitability actions, our year-over-year growth was very strong. Through September, company-wide PIFs were up 10% year-over-year. Positive year-over-year PIF growth plus higher rates means our premium growth was spectacular with net written premium up 20% year-to-date or $7.9 billion. To put the first 3 quarters premium growth into perspective, we've added the premium equivalent to a top 8 personal auto insurance carrier, which is a truly amazing statistic. Despite the successes that occurred in quarter 3, we are not yet declaring victory. Our calendar year combined ratio currently stands 1.2 points above our 96 target. While loss trends have flattened, they are still elevated. Macroeconomic indicators suggest inflation is abating, but we are vigilant. Given the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, our view of the future could change overnight. We continue to refine our plans for the rest of 2023 and 2024 as new information comes in. We have built a business where we can quickly take advantage of the opportunities the market offers us. So I'm confident that as things change, we will react with the goal of delivering the best-in-class results we expect of ourselves. Finally, as a reminder, and as we've previously announced, beginning this fourth quarter, we will move to reporting results on a Gregorian calendar basis versus our historical approach of a 544 convention. Consequently, for the next year, we will limit historical comparisons on a monthly basis and we will continue such comparisons on a quarterly basis. Thank you again for joining us, and I will now take your questions. Douglas Constantine : This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Jian Huang : Just a quick question on the way you think about growth. Obviously, you are getting closer and closer to your 96% targeted combined ratio. Curious as to how should we think about the future growth trajectory going forward? Once -- now that appears that losses are improving, reserving appears to be more manageable, heading into 2024, once you -- assuming you get to a 96% combined ratio in 2023, should -- is it reasonable to assume that you would reaccelerate growth into 2024? Susan Griffith : Yes, that's definitely reasonable, Bob. Here's how I'm thinking about it. We obviously have 1.2 points to diminish to get to our 96, we're going to continue to work on that. We're still seeing a pretty hard market out there, so we're getting a lot of ambient shopping. And if you caught the last part of the statement even with us doing the self-imposed pullback from our media spend and from non-rate actions, we were able to grow the company nearly $8 billion compared to the first 9 months of last year. 10% PIF is a little bit higher on the direct auto side. So we're pretty excited about what we were able to achieve this year. And I say that not necessarily for the analytical community out there, but mostly for the 60,000 people that got us there. So profit comes before growth. We'll continue to work on that. And what we'll start to do in the relatively near future, start to pull back some of our non-rate actions. So we have a hierarchy of non-rate actions that we'll look to start to pull back. We can test. There's obviously been a lot of uncertainty out there. So we're going to go -- we're going to be measured. And then we can pull back that next tranche in the hierarchy of non-rate actions. And we just met with our media team and are working on a pretty robust budget that we'll plan to put into effect. We still have, obviously, marketing the rest of this quarter but into 2024. So I would say, we're excited. I will say that there's been a lot of uncertainty. And so we're going to be really diligent and cautious, but our goal is to grow as fast as we can at 96 or better. Jian Huang : That's very helpful. Maybe pivot a little bit on reserving. On the 10-Q, you had a lot of disclosure on. An explanation on how severity trends are developing over time? But just kind of curious in terms of frequency, specifically on bodily injuries. It looks like frequency normalized, improved quite a bit. Just curious if you have any commentary there around what's causing the frequency numbers to improve? And is that a trend that we should be expecting that it will normalize back to a generally negative frequency number going forward? Susan Griffith : Yes. It's really hard to discern frequency. A lot of it has to do with geography mix, CMT mix, it could be -- have to do with our underwriting effect. So I don't really want to focus too much on that because there's just a lot of inputs. What I would say from a stability perspective is we're down overall about 1.5%, 13 to 24 months. So we've been pretty stable as far as frequency overall. What I'll also say is when we look at our UBI data, we are seeing about 15 months of stability where VMTs are still down about 15% pre-COVID. Now again, I can't confirm that, that stability will continue. But what we're seeing is not a lot of more movement to commute hours, and we have some external data that shows that badge swipes in office remained pretty stable at about 50% of office workers working from home versus office. So there is some stability. There's always a lot of inputs and there's always a lot of change that's happening, especially as we talked about rolling back some of our non-rate actions, but it's been stable for quite a while. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO. Michael Zaremski : I guess a follow-up on ambient shopping. Should we be thinking about it as kind of looking at the industry's profitability and capital position? And then ultimately, as the industry heals as long as -- as well as Progressive's profit margins healed, the ambient shopping benefit, which is pretty extraordinary kind of should dissipate. How are you guys -- internally, do you guys have your own kind of view? Or has your view evolved at all on the benefit you're getting from kind of lower LTV to CAC and ambient shopping? Susan Griffith : How I think about that, Mike, is it's been a hard market for a while. We did get out in front of rates to begin with, and then again at the beginning of this year as we saw the trends change specifically in severity of fixing cars. So getting out in front of that, when others might be behind, we're going to get that ambient shopping. We watch it really closely in the auction environment. And the great part about that is that you can get a really low cost per sale. So we'll watch that, but we will definitely put on the gas as needed if we feel like the market is softening at all. I can't really speak to what other competitors do, but I imagine that they're trying to get to their target profit margins, and that means they're going to put a lot of rate out there, which means shopping is going to happen, and that's how we get that business. Unidentified Company Representative : Mike, I'd add. Much of the ambient shopping today, we are dissuading from purchasing a policy with Progressive. So as Tricia was saying, we are going to pull back on some of the non-rate actions we've had in place that had been obviously designed to improve profitability. And as we do so, more of those ambient shoppers are going to get through to potentially buy a Progressive policy. So we have some, what I'll call, unmet demand out there that as we're more adequately priced will become growth. Michael Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful. Lastly, I was hoping to switch gears to the TNC business on the commercial side. There's been a lot of growth there, you've taken a lot of market share to peers. I'm assuming that, that business is coming to you at hefty price increases. But it's also been a cause of reserve development. I guess any color you can offer on what's going on with that business? And just lastly, does this business come with a bigger new business penalty than other parts of personal auto or commercial non-TNC? Susan Griffith : Yes, I'll start with the last part. I think what it comes with is sometimes we don't necessarily know that product in the state. So just like any new business, where we're learning the cost associated with it, we've seen that in TNC. So said another way, the more mature states that we've had are performing much better. But you're right on the rate increases. We've over doubled the rate since 2021 in the TNC business. And specifically, what we are seeing is the rate increases are driven by just a few states. And those states have some structural challenges relating to limit mixes, specifically UM/UIM. So what we've been doing with both of our customers is really gathering the data that we have. We have a treasure trove of data being the largest commercial auto writer. And then they have their own data. We obviously separate and bifurcate the two companies, but talk with them about how to get to the right rates in a more timely fashion and work with them to develop approaches just around flexibility. So think of 6-month policies or greater segmentation. And that's what we're working on right now. I can't go into a lot of specifics because it is proprietary, but we're working very closely to get the rate we need, specifically in the states I talked about with the high UM/UIM limits. And the other states, we're more comfortable with because they're performing better. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Jimmy Bhullar : So first, I had a question on Commercial Line reserves. We had an issue for several months where you guys had consistent adverse development in the personal auto side, and I think in September, you had adverse development on the commercial side as well. So maybe discuss what the drivers of that were and what gives you the confidence that this is sort of not the beginning of a trend where adverse development might continue for a few months in Commercial Lines as well? Susan Griffith : Yes. So we saw some of the similar things we did in private passenger auto in Commercial Lines. Really the two factors, the one I just talked about was the TNC reserves in those specific states and the other was late reported injury claims. And I think those make up the majority of the Commercial Lines. We'll continue to look. We obviously feel in some of the reserving that Gary and his team have looked at it pretty deeply. So think of the Florida House Bill 837, think of fixing cars. And Gary will continue to look at those high limit states throughout the year to make sure we're adequately reserved for Commercial Lines as well. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then secondly on your expense ratio, has the decline been mostly driven by just a proactive view on your part to pull back from the market while you're seeking price hikes and not be as active on marketing? Or are there any structural changes in the and exemptions as well? Susan Griffith : Well, we're always looking to reduce expenses, especially on the non-acquisition expense ratio. But we've pulled back significantly in advertising, and that obviously hits the expense ratio as well as the increase in premium. Jimmy Bhullar : And you'll come back, I guess. What do you need to see before you start coming back into the market with more marketing spending? Susan Griffith : Yes. We have -- even if you look at our marketing spend and the reduction, we spend a significant amount on marketing and that will continue into the fourth quarter of pre-planned spends that we already have. But like I said, what we're going to do is be really cautious and initially start to roll back non-rate actions, and we have a robust media spend planned for 2024. Again, that's a plan. So that is one lever where we can pull forward if we think there's a lot of business we had as long as we're making our target profit margins or pull back if we find ourselves in the place that we did in the first half of 2023. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : Two questions. So first, do you see any potential impact from the UAW strike which is hopefully behind us now? Susan Griffith : We do a little bit because even though the strike wasn't that long, I think, around 8 weeks total. There's about 12 to 18 weeks before we start to see recovery in some of the parts as well as new vehicles being made. So immediately, when we saw the strike happen, John Murphy and his group went into the sort of mode of sensitivity analysis around this. We have deployed and executed a plan on that. And our main issue for this next 12 or so weeks is really to just minimize the disruption in both our customers and the company. Yaron Kinar : Got it. So near-term impact potentially, but not really beyond 12 to 16 weeks or so? Susan Griffith : That's what we're thinking. Of course, every now we'll watch just like all of the data and especially as we continue to earn in more rate towards the states that we're adequately priced, it may not have any impact. The thing we worry about the most is delays in fixing vehicles, which has been a concern going forward in the past, I should say, just based on talent in the body shops and having the right mechanics to do that, but we'll be able to see that really quickly and react to that should we need to. Yaron Kinar : Got it. And then my second question, maybe you can help us think through this. So you've implemented a lot of rate in personal auto, still earning a good chunk of that as well. You're talking about some stabilization of the loss trends. So if and when you accelerate this growth on a much healthier rate adequacy, do you expect that to ultimately improve the loss ratio? Or is the immediate impact still an adverse impact because of the new business penalty? Susan Griffith : Well, if we spend more on marketing, there is a new business penalty. But if we believe we are putting new units on the book at a lifetime 96 or cohort 96 calendar year, then we feel good about it. And we'll price to that. We are very efficient in our media spend, and we'll price to that. And really, we feel better every day in all products as each day goes by as more rate earns in. But we know that's part of new business and we're happy to do it if we think we can make the target profit margin that we go to. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : Looking at competitor behavior, I don't need to speak about individual competitors, but GEICO lost a lot of customers over the past year and I look at some other publicly traded companies. And the leakage of policies has not been so significant elsewhere where I can tell yet Progressive has grown dramatically. And thinking about the year to come and the year that's passed, when you think about captive independent and direct channels, where has most of the market share growth that Progressive has achieved come from? And next year for a company like GEICO becomes more aggressive in its desire to add new customers, does that change the calculus on what the market share gains and the type of customers might be in the new year? Susan Griffith : Well, I think we're a growth company, Josh, and I think we're going to try to do anything we can to grow as long as we make our target profit margins. We understand where much of our business is coming through because we know the proof of the prior carrier. And so it's been not just GEICO, but other companies, I don't want to talk specifically about the percentage of where it's come from. But it really depends on are people priced right in the market? Do they have the right brand? Do they care about expense ratio, which keeps the prices competitive? And so for us, it's really -- and we've talked about before, it's making sure that we have all 4 of our strategic pillars, really starting with our people and culture and then going on to our brand, competitive prices and broad coverage. And that's where I think we're able to win and continue to grow. We can react very quickly when our competitors do have actions. And really, that's our focus, is to make sure that we have those 4 strategic pillars and that we invest in all of them to continue to be a high-growth company. Unidentified Company Representative : The thing to consider there, Josh, is which segments we're growing in would be somewhat indicative of where they're coming from. So we are continuing to grow well in the more preferred segments of our business, the Robinsons, but also we call rights who are homeowners that do not bundle yet their home and auto with Progressive. And we have not been growing, actually this year, we've been shrinking a little bit on the standard end. So the nonstandard end of the spectrum. So that bodes really well for our future growth because, obviously, those customers stick with us longer. And I think where they come from is important, but also whom we're bringing into our customer set is a really important way to think about it. Joshua Shanker : And given that answer, is there a way of bifurcating or segmenting the property business such that -- I guess, the question is what percentage of the business is operating at a 96% or better and growing as fast as it can. Obviously, there are some states where you're not there yet and maybe it's segmented by state, but to what extent have you achieved the goal of the property business running the way you want it in the geographies that you operate? Susan Griffith : Yes. I think we start with what we started with about a year ago, and that was to derisk the book and have less new apps and policies in volatile states and more in nonvolatile. And you saw the data on that in the queue that we believe we're doing a great job. We're non-renewing about 115,000 policies in Florida, we're just over indexed in Florida. And so we love Florida. We have a lot of Robinsons. We have a lot of autos and we continue to have a lot of homes, but we were not making money and we needed to non-renew some. So that will happen over the next year or so. We knew it would take a long time. But I think really what our strategy is on the property channel is not unlike it was years ago in the auto channel. We're investing more in segmentation, we're investing more in understanding rate to risk and the necessary need for reinsurance, but we will get there. And obviously, third quarter was a lot better than it was in the past. And there's a lot of buzz because Ian came off, and there wasn't as many storms. But we feel good about our plan, it will still take some time to execute, but we're in the heart of that. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Charles Peters : I want to step back to your comments about the non-rate action. And it sounds like you're getting ready to dial back some of those actions. Can you remind us exactly what some of those actions were? Did they include any things around commission or fees to lead gen companies? Do you expect those things to change over the next year? Susan Griffith : I'll let Pat comment on that. It was less about commissions and more on our strategy around some underwriting paid plans. But Pat, do you want to talk about that a little bit? Patrick Callahan : Yes, Greg. Tricia's comments are centered around kind of John's comments as well around how much business we let in the front door. So we have more restricted bill plans in place. We have more verification to require additional checks and make sure we get the accurate information on the risks that are coming in the door to ensure we're priced adequately. So that's -- when we talk about non-rate actions, those are the primary things that we are leaning into lifting in some markets as we approach the end of the year. Your point about lead gen and actually spending more, that would be a 2024 thing, where once we're confident that we put the 96 in the books for calendar year '23, then we would start investing more to generate demand as needed. And we've been out of the market for a while in those markets. So we do expect that, that will ramp back up, but it will be a ramp as we spend only what we need to, to efficiently and cost-effectively attract customers. We've seen that the hard market persists. We've seen there's a lot of competitors who still need to push rate through their systems and a lot right annual policies. So there's still a lot of rate effect to be had in the market on consumers. And we'll lean into that as we get more into the new year from a spend perspective. Charles Peters : Great. I guess the other question, pivoting to some of the previous comments around the property business. You're definitely trending in the right direction from a combined ratio perspective, but it's still running above your 96 target for corporate-wide. Is it your objective that -- or your view that you're going to get that property business to a 96 combined ratio next year? It seems like it's been a drag on your consolidated results for several years now. I just -- or maybe you're using it as a loss leader to grab share in the Robinsons cohort? Just some updated views on that would be helpful. Susan Griffith : Yes. We're not attempting to use it as a loss leader, I'll tell you that. It has been a drag. Overtime, when you look back, home has done pretty well. Now what we did was we should have probably seen the need to derisk a little bit in states like Florida, Texas, Louisiana and across the country. That's why we're doing that now. That's why we're investing in technology and segmentation, new product models. So we do feel good. We have different target profit margins depending on if you're bundled or not, et cetera. But no, our desire -- I can't predict the future. I have no idea what's going to happen next year. But our goal is to continue our plan to derisk and make the target margins that we have in property and have that be a robust part of our book because we know the Robinsons cohort is super important to our future. Unidentified Company Representative : And we have actually been exceeding the objectives we set out for the 2023 period in terms of growing more where we think -- historically, results are far less volatile in property and shrinking considerably in areas including Florida, as Tricia noted, that have been way more volatile from a weather perspective historically. And just to the 96 point, as Tricia was noting, we priced to an aggregate 96 for the company. So by segment, we actually have different combined ratio targets and we think about those as all deriving a return on capital equivalent to or better than the personal auto business. So the 96 calendar year is our commitment to achieve that in aggregate. But below that, we are pricing the different targets based on the characteristics of each business. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. David Motemaden : So I had a -- my first question was just on the auto accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, and last quarter, in the presentation, you spoke about mix shift between renewal and new business and the benefit that, that could have having less new business could have on the loss ration. I'm wondering if you can just size how much of the improvement in the loss ratio this quarter is coming from just that lower new business as opposed to improvement on the renewal book? Susan Griffith : That's pretty tough to size and I think when we obviously renew, we will know more about you as a customer, but when we bring new business on, our intentions are that we reach our target profit margin. Unidentified Company Representative : And I would offer that the rate actions we've taken have far larger influence on that accident year loss ratio than the new renewal mix. So as we noted, we had 5 points earned in just in the third quarter alone for our personal auto business. On a year-to-date basis, it's more than double that number. So when you get the denominator up significantly, that's the best way to improve. Well, that's -- obviously, there's the numerator, but that is where we have gotten most of the loss ratio improvement from. Obviously, severity moderating a bit this quarter has helped us considerably as well. But the rate that we've taken and continue to take is earning in and you're seeing that in the loss ratio. David Motemaden : And then just a question, I guess, just on -- it seems like -- I mean, the retention has definitely been better than I would have thought. It's obviously a hard market out there. I guess has that surprised you at all and influenced at all how you guys are thinking about growth and maybe adding a little bit more business in 2024, just given how strong the retention is on the renewal book. And Pat, as you just said, that seems to have a better or more profound impact on the loss ratio than the new business? Susan Griffith : I mean, I don't know if it surprised us because we watched the data. It certainly is -- delights us, I would say that. And what we want to do, really, the thing with retention is having some stable rates. And we have been increasing rates as has the competition in an extraordinary fashion based on inflation trends. So what we'd love to do is have tremendous growth in 2024, but have some stability around the trends. And I was saying I haven't been able to say on this call for a while, small bites of the Apple where we take a really small rate and our customers feel that makes sense and they don't shop. So that's our goal. But we're very happy with the retention of both the trailing 3 and a trailing 12. We'd like to see some stability, and we will grow as fast as we can as long as we see that stability. Unidentified Company Representative : And I'll state the obvious, but we're coming off a fairly low point in terms of retention last year. So last year, we were ahead of the market in taking rate, and I would think of it in sort of like maybe 10 points ahead of the market in terms of taking rate that we saw the need for. And as our customers got those rate increases, they shop and they could still find a better rate. Competitors now have caught up, and in some cases, actually surpassed us on rate take and consequently, even though our rates continue to rise as customers shop, they're less able to find a better rate. And so our year-over-year renewal rates, the changes are robust and we're getting back closer to PLEs lifetime expectancies that we've enjoyed previously. We're not yet back up to historical highs, but as Tricia noted, we're delighted with the trends we're seeing, and we think they're going to continue. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, you guys pointed out, right, that you're a little bit above the 96% year-to-date. You guys have a sense of what rate you're going to earn in, in the fourth quarter, right? And it sounds like loss trend, right, in the Q3 got better relative to the Q2. So I'm sure you have expectations there as well. So what's like the biggest swing variable as we go into the next few months of earnings with whether you ultimately get below that 96% target for the year? Susan Griffith : Yes. I think weather is huge. And so watching that closely. We have another 3 points to earn in on the private passenger auto side. On the Commercial Line side, we've been earning in rate from both '21 -- '22 and '23 revision. But a lot of our improvement, we believe, in Commercial Lines calendar year as been through non-rate actions. And so we're headed into '24 with a lot of rate really starting to earn on the commercial line side. But we do some analysis quite often of what we think we need to do to get there. We care deeply about expenses. So as a company, we've been trying to reduce expenses and we can continuously do that. And I think weather is going to be the big variable, Elyse. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then my second question, advertising has come up a bunch on this call. So it sounds like the clock, obviously, in the calendar right, resets, we get to the start of next year. So will -- is that when you expect to kind of push more advertising considering we're restarting and then you can go for the 96% next year? I'm just trying to think through the thought process around when you ultimately turn on the marketing machine. And then how do you balance not growing too fast too soon, recognizing right, that's what happened at the start of this year? Susan Griffith : Yes. I can let Pat comment a little bit, but our intentions are if we see -- if weather is sort of normal in the next several months. And we see some of the non-rate actions that we're pulling back on to achieve new business, then we are going to be able to likely put a lot more media spend into play in the first quarter. But a lot of that depends on what we're seeing. A lot of it depends on how much we need to. But I think that excites us because we do sort of get the start of -- the clock starts over. But Pat, do you want to add anything? Patrick Callahan : Yes. The only thing I would add is last first quarter. So first quarter of 2023, we had sort of the perfect storm of lots of ad spend in a really hard market. And what we don't yet know is how much ambient shopping remains in market and how much shopping fatigue could be in market. So John's point about when shopping pays off because you find a lower price that reinforces or rewards that. If consumers shop in the first quarter and our rates are similar to where they are, there may not be as much ambient shopping and switching available in market. So we don't yet know. But as Tricia mentioned, there's markets where we're off most markets for local advertising today, but there were markets we were off at the start of this year too. So it's very dynamic based on our lifetime expectation of hitting our profit targets for new business that we generate during the period. So dynamic system, and you're right that we will start spending more after the first of the year, but we will be leaning into that and ramping that up as needed depending on how much is available in the ambient market and which markets we feel we've got adequate rates to support the ad spend. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : I'm just curious and kind of going maybe a little bit to Elyse's question. Given the experience we saw earlier this year where you guys are growing really quickly and then all of a sudden, you saw this pop in inflationary pressures, and given the continued uncertainty just from a macroeconomic perspective, are you probably going to -- are you going to be a little more cautious to kind of open up that growth engine this time around, maybe get a little bit more data under your belts before you're going to go after it? Susan Griffith : Yes, I think we will be more cautious, and that's why -- that's sort of the beauty around the 96 and the discipline around the 96, whether it's on a calendar year or a cohort year. And that's why we'll slowly pull back, watch, test, and we'll only be pulling back in the states where we feel like we've got enough rate. And so that's a little bit of a limiting factor. But we want to grow, but I do think that there's been so much uncertainty that we will watch it closely. So we aren't in the same position where we have to crank up rates like we did this year. Brian Meredith : Makes sense. And then the second question, Tricia and I, we haven't talked about this topic just for a while, and I saw it in a letter to the BOP business. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how the rollout on the BOP is going. I know you're in 46 states. How is the profitability trend in that business relative to what you kind of thought it was going to be? And at some point, are we going to see that start to kind of ramp up from a growth perspective? Susan Griffith : Yes, we're super excited about how many states we are in BOP, it's still a relatively small part of the business. So we won't actually comment on it publicly. And it is -- we have targets, and of course, with new business, when you think about acquisition costs and understanding loss costs, it's obviously going to be higher than stable business, but it is what we expect and so we'll continue to watch that and grow the business as we get more comfortable. Brian Meredith : Great. So no surprises so far? Susan Griffith : Exactly. Yes. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Stifel. Meyer Shields : As we get back to what should be normal, is there any way of quantifying both in terms of growth and profitability how much impact the fact that you're fully pricing to the telematics curves have had before COVID? I assume that you're probably generating excess profits for growing a little bit less quickly than you could have been? Susan Griffith : Well, we don't price fully to the curve. We have expanded on both the surcharge and the discount. I think it's pretty tough to quantify to that is really what I'd say. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes. So I think Tricia is right, we've been expanding our offering to price closer to the curve over time, and we've been expanding to continuous monitoring in the UBI world to collect more data and to be able to more continuously price policies more accurately. As far as specific quantification of how much growth is coming from and the profit coming from it, I wouldn't comment on that at this point. And it's a meaningful piece of our business. It's our most powerful rating variable. And we continue to invest in both the technology to lower the expense of collecting data and to analyze the data more precisely to price more accurately over time on a continuous basis. So I think we're in probably 50% of our earned premium states. I think 29 states have continuous monitoring at this point in time. So we feel really good about continuing to invest to maintain or even widen that moat that we think we have in the issues-based insurance space. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's very helpful. The second question, and again, this is more thematic. There are clearly a lot of smaller personal auto insurers out there that frankly probably can't compete. Does Progressive look at the option of maybe buying renewal rights as opposed to simply outcompeting in the marketplace? Is that more or less economically efficient? Susan Griffith : I think that depends. We always look to -- if we can do book rolls. But like you said, a smaller company is going to have a more difficult time investing in technology, segmentation, brand, distribution and so as you've seen in this last couple of years, we've gotten some of that on itself. So I wouldn't want to pay a premium to get that -- to get those policies on our book. I think we can get them regardless just based on our size and our efficiency. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : Just some quick math. You achieved 16% year-to-date rate increases in auto. And in the 10-Q, you said that you plan to take an additional 3% in 4Q, so that will get us something like 19% for the full year. I think last quarter, you penciled in 17% personal auto rate increases for the full year. So it feels like you need to take more rate now. It's not a lot, but can you share the key drivers behind this additional rate needs? Susan Griffith : Yes. I mean I think -- I don't know that I would read too much into a point difference. Sometimes, it could be a delay in having it approved. We have to go through each department, but the same trends that we have been seeing, that we've talked about are what the rate is about. So whether it's attorney reps or fixing cars, so [indiscernible] comment any more on that? Unidentified Company Representative : Our forward-looking rate action statements its dynamic, obviously, as you know, and it is down to the state and segment level. So it's important to remind how we manage the business. We have product managers who manage at the state and product level, and even in some cases, lower than that, and they are all assessing what is going on in their specific marketplaces, trends, projecting the trends, understanding as we noted, what they plan to do in terms of non-rate actions as well as ad spend. So there's a lot that goes into the aggregate rate changes we take and that we say we plan to take. And again, it's going to be dynamic. We obviously have seen severity moderate back down to the single digits, which is fantastic. Where that goes, it's tough to know. But from what we can see, we think we're moving it to a more normal environment when it comes to change in claim severity. But in aggregate, it's very hard to dissect that 19 or 17, and it's changed today. I assure you. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Great. It also looks like you had modest favorable personal auto prior year development this quarter. The adverse mostly came from commercial lines. Was that because you feel good about adequately reserving the Florida [indiscernible] reform? Were there other factors? And I'm curious if you're seeing reopen claims in the quarter? Susan Griffith : That's exactly right. We're feeling much more confident in both the House Bill and fixing cars. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. And I know you touched on it last quarter, but can you remind me what caused the reopen claims in the first half of the year that you haven't seen in the past? What it changed? Susan Griffith : Yes. I mean, there's a couple of things that happen, but you can write an estimate. And then when the person, the customer, whether it's an insurer or claimant, goes to get the car repaired, so we paid -- we've made that payment, the feature is closed. And it gets into the shop and they find more damage and it's maybe delayed repair, it increases rental. So it really was the lead time with -- to get parts. It's labor rates, it's length of time, so rentals increased. So there are a couple of different factors that have gone into fixing cars. Unidentified Company Representative : And on the injury side, there was a lot of Florida influence there -- I'm sorry. And so House Bill 837 drove an influx of attorney representation and lawsuits and we had to take reserve increases to reflect what we believe the future cost of setting where the claims would be. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. So you don't wait until an actual claim closes, you estimate what the close would look like. Was it maybe perhaps premature in calling those claims closed? Susan Griffith : No. It's the way our system works. So we have reserves set for different line coverages. And then if those change and they change dynamically not one file or two files, that's when we know we need to strengthen our reserves. Unidentified Company Representative : But yes, we are absolutely estimating the ultimate loss cost with the best information we have at this time. Susan Griffith : I think it's very common in our business to have supplements because you can have parts of vehicles that are -- you can't even see. So suspension and other parts. So you write what you can see, you shouldn't write more or less. And then as the claim evolves, especially with collision or property damage, you'll be able to see more. Sometimes it's nothing, but there could be supplements. But that's really common. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO. Michael Zaremski : Just one on Florida. So I guess now that the -- I guess, the pig has made its way through the python in terms of reserving mostly. Are you seeing any positive influences from the legislation on the recently written business? I know you guys have a big pit book in Florida? Or is it just too soon to tell? Susan Griffith : I'd think it's too soon to tell. We anticipate that it will be positive, but we have to let this play out a bit. Douglas Constantine : That appears to have been our last question. So that concludes our event. So I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation's Third Quarter Investor Event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Douglas Constantine : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's Fourth Quarter Investor Event. I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed statements related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. This quarter includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we used the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with the leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I am pleased to introduce our Customer Relationship President, Lori Niederst, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Lori? Lori Niederst : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As Doug said, my name is Lori Niederst and I'm excited to be the first to participate in our new format. Traditionally, Tricia provides the opening comments for these presentations. But going forward, members of our leadership team will have the opportunity to speak to topics in our area of responsibility and introduce the talented individuals executing on these initiatives that we highlight during the event. In previous presentations, we've discussed our strategic pillars, which serve as the foundation of our vision. Today, we're focusing on one of those pillars, serving the broad needs of our customers. This pillar is synonymous with our strategy to become a destination company, providing products that meet our customers' changing needs throughout their lifetime. We seek to instill customer confidence in both the products and the prices that we offer. To set the stage for today's presentation, I thought it would be helpful to recap the history of Progressive's evolution as a destination company. Back in 2008, we publicly introduced our now ubiquitous customer segments, Sams, Dianes, Wrights, and Robinsons. In 2014, we first spoke of our destination strategy, stating our intention to invest in the products, services and experiences to better serve customers from all four segments. Since then, we've had relentless focus on not only maintaining and growing the Sams, Dianes, and Wrights who have always been well served by Progressive, but significantly increasing our market share with Robinsons, which we estimate represent just under half of the personal insurance direct written premium in the United States. We've been very successful growing Robinsons who in December of 2023, accounted for just under 13% of our direct written premium. Countless efforts have contributed to Robinsons being our fastest-growing segment, but it was two strategic decisions that really drove our success. Even before the introduction of the destination strategy, in 2006, we began offering homeowners insurance from other carriers in our Progressive Advantage Agency, or PAA. What began as a small endeavor has evolved into HomeQuote Explorer, or HQX, where we now offer customers competitive homeowner rates from a lineup of reputable carriers. This success in direct and our desire to grow Robinsons in the independent agent channel, led Progressive to purchase a stake and eventually fully acquire American Strategic Insurance. ASI, now branded Progressive Home, has enabled us to offer both underwritten home and auto bundles as well as partner bundles to significantly increase our appeal to the rights in Robinsons. We've since leveraged our learnings and success in bundling personal insurance products in the commercial market, where we continue to be an industry leader. In 2018, we first introduced BusinessQuote Explorer, or BQX, which enabled direct customers to purchase a variety of commercial insurance products from other carriers, and bundle with our Commercial Auto and BOP coverages. More recently, we're exploring this winning strategy in Personal Auto with AutoQuote Explorer, or AQX, which enables customers to compare rates and purchase products from other personal auto carriers on progressive.com. This gives us another avenue to serve more customers and cross-sell from our expanding portfolio of products. Customer bundling doesn't end with Home and Personal Auto, our Commercial Auto and BOP. We have a whole suite of offerings, which includes Progressive underwritten Special Lines, Renters and Umbrella products. By expanding our portfolio of products, we have continued to increase our addressable market and capture new business. The result of these efforts has been pretty incredible. We now estimate that 19% of households in the United States have at least one Progressive sold product, an increase of over 80% in the last 10 years. The benefits of these efforts on our business are far reaching. The top line growth from increased sales of progressive underwritten products and commissions earned from sales of partner products is just the beginning. The more products the customer purchases from Progressive, the stickier the customer becomes leading to higher lifetime profits and lower per policy acquisition costs. Fueling the virtuous cycle that results in greater market share. But it's not just Progressive the benefits. We're making insurance easier for customers by providing options to meet their insurance and other financial needs now and in the future. Additionally, our industry-leading brand and acquisition engine provides growth opportunities for our partners. Making this destination strategy, a win, win, win. It's important to note that today, we're talking about the direct channel. Like many efforts Progressive has undertaken we often leverage the direct channel to test, learn, and perfect new ideas. While doing so, we're always looking for ways to deploy our successes in direct to benefit our independent agents. For decades, the agency channel has been vital to Progressive's growth and independent agents will continue to be the face of Progressive for millions of customers. While we're focusing on Direct today, we fully recognize that Robinsons are the largest segment of consumers served by independent agents in the United States, and we have a number of significant investments underway to continue our leadership in this channel and our partnership with our 40,000-plus independent agents. For a deeper dive into our evolution as a destination company, I'd like to introduce Kathryn Lemieux, a 42-year Progressive veteran and our Business Leader for CRM Sales Experience. Kathy will share more detail on how we're leveraging our HQX, BQX and AQX platforms to provide choice and build customer confidence. Our second speaker is Sean Freeman. Sean is a Business Leader of our Comparison Rating Experience and Direct Property Quoting, who's been with Progressive for 14 years. He'll demonstrate the benefits of bundling and multi-product households and explain how these efforts will continue to drive Progressive's growth and profitability. Again, thank you for joining us today, and I'll now hand it over to Kathy. Kathryn Lemieux : Hello. I appreciate the opportunity to deliver some highlights on our progress toward achieving our destination company vision. Today, we'll focus on how the Progressive Advantage Agency is becoming a primary source for insurance products for consumers who prefer the direct channel. We strive to provide access to a broad portfolio of products, so customers begin and then keep their relationship with us without the need to look elsewhere. Let me begin by introducing the journey of Sam and Ashley, two actual Progressive customers. Back in 2009, when Sam first contacted Progressive, he was seeking insurance for his 1999 Saturn. Eventually, he bought a motorcycle, which needed insurance as well. Later, he married Ashley, and together, they acquired Renters Insurance until eventually, they bought a home, which required homeowners insurance. Both our Renters and Homeowners insurance policies were purchased through the Progressive Advantage Agency. In the case of Sam and Ashley, we were able to offer them different products as live events triggered the need for additional and more complex insurance coverage. We would have loved to sell a Progressive manufactured property product to the couple, but that wasn't the right solution for them. So we had other options ready. Let's talk more about that approach. Our multi-carrier marketplace for property and small business insurance products allows us to meet the needs of more and more customers. We are leveraging the Progressive brand building on our industry-leading digital tools and working with a growing number of reputable carriers to make buying and maintaining insurance easier. This recipe is proving very successful delivering 200% growth in premiums written through our agency in less than a decade. Over the years, we've evolved the comparison shopping experience from Property to Commercial Lines from one carrier to many from the phone to the online channel and from Quote to also buy without agent intervention. While the large majority of our insurance customers start their shopping experience online, using our HomeQuote Explorer or BusinessQuote Explorer digital experiences, which launched after our shop by phone-only models, the majority work with our team of knowledgeable in-house agents to customize their policy before purchasing. As you've come to expect from Progressive, we continue to invest in improving the quote and buy experience, always focusing on the needs of our customers. We introduced a Digital Multi-carrier Quote experience, which we call HomeQuote Explorer in 2017. Over the course of the next several years, we made enhancements and introduce new features to improve the quoter experience and the platform's efficiency. These efforts have generated close to a 10% increase in quote completions over early HQX results. One of our most recent changes was the introduction of a QuickQuote Experience, which displays prefilled data from third-party providers upfront so that customers can easily review and edit. Leveraging our proprietary models, we customize prompts and details to assist customers in selecting coverages and qualifying for discounts. This change alone decreased quote time by 20%, reducing the effort for customers and increasing their likelihood to purchase as a result. This is just one example of our work to simplify what has traditionally been a complicated shopping experience for both homeowners and small business owners. Our dedication to continuous improvement is bolstered by a rigorous A/B testing approach aimed at making a fully digital quote and purchase available to more shoppers. However, our in-house agents are always here to provide guidance and instill customer confidence. The investments in our HQX and BQX platforms only produce value when they're backed by a broad portfolio of products underwritten by reputable brands. Both the breadth of carriers in our network and the depth of their product suite have grown over the last decade. Presently, 13 carriers comprise our HomeQuote Explorer portfolio and nine for BusinessQuote Explorer. There are major benefits to having a large contingent of carriers in the PAA, which Sean will get into later, but there is also a risk because we are exposing progressive customers and thus the Progressive brand to the services of another carrier. To protect our customers and the Progressive brand, we are selective about the carriers we partner with. They must meet our standards for customer care. They must offer a quality product at a fair price, pass our information security assessments and they must have the financial strength and standing to uphold the promise we make to customers that will be there when they need us most. Additionally, we'll consider a carrier's technological capabilities so that we can provide a seamless integrated digital customer experience for quoting and servicing. Also worthy of note is that our carrier networks include a number of companies that provide both property and small business insurance offers in HQX and BQX. We take pride in this fact as it demonstrates the strength of our mutually beneficial relationships. The benefits of our multi-carrier model extend far beyond quote and buy and are evident throughout the customer insurance journey for significant life changes, such as Sam and Ashley getting married and buying a house, perhaps experiencing a future job relocation or if they eventually need to ensure their teenage driver. Our agencies ready with the products they need and the customer service to help them navigate these events. Recall that Sam and Ashley added a home policy underwritten by one of our network carriers several years after acquiring their Progressive Auto Insurance and built a bundle, becoming one of the more than 1 million Robinsons we ensure through the PAA. The portfolio of products and carriers who underwrite them that are available to our customers allows us to grow more bundles over time. But even when the event isn't life changing, for example, a policy renewal accompanied by a steep rate increase, we are presented with an opportunity to support our customers by offering options, which gives us the chance to retain the customer. Often, we are able to anticipate customer shopping by leveraging our proprietary data models and proactively reach out to offer assistance. Even subtle nudges such as the e-mail presented here, reinforce the value our in-house agency offers. That leaves our longest running product comparison experience, Auto Insurance. More than 30 years ago, we introduced auto comparison rating as a fee-based service in California. Insurance products were much simpler in those days, so at the time, rates were manually calculated by a team of Progressive people who reverse engineered them from public filings. This industry altering idea proved to be a winner with customers, prompting us to make the service available countrywide and to build our brand on comparison rates. Our early marketing messages combine the ease and savings from one-stop rate comparison with a message of transparency. If our rate isn't the lowest, we'll tell you who's is? And challenging the status quo now what you'd expect from an insurance company as early brand differentiators. As Progressive and competitors advance their products, adding credit, underwriting and tiering, our precision in providing comparison rates declined. Consumers saw decreasing value in the range of rates we provided to adjust to these conditions. The next evolution of comparison rates came in 2016 when we began purchasing discrete auto rates from a third party. This model has proven to be a lower-cost way to provide a service that is to this day, valuable to our customers. Over the past five years, we've conducted dozens of tests leveraging comparison rates to improve customer experiences, increase Progressive's conversion and monetize click referrals. Our decades of experience led us to take the next step in the auto rate comparison journey AutoQuote Explorer. Bringing our CRE, HQX and consumer insights together, we've been piloting a multi-carrier auto quoting experience since the third quarter of 2022. We launched a Quote and Buy experience over the phone first and have refined the delivery with our in-house agents through several iterations. We're ready to introduce the AQX Experience online soon. The screens that you see on this page were developed using focus group and agent feedback when testing with prototypes. Early results give us confidence that the comparison quote and purchase experience with a reputable set of carriers will give us the opportunity to better meet consumer needs, starting new customer relationships in those cases where insurance shoppers would not purchase a progressive policy, getting their auto insurance needs met elsewhere. Progressive continues to be known for providing comparison rates, but our launch of AQX provides an opportunity to refine our brand positioning. The key is to generate interest by conveying that we've taken the hassle out of shopping for car insurance, while giving customers confidence in the products, prices, and providers that we offer. But just like HQX and BQX, the customer value of AQX extends beyond the purchase and we continue to refine the benefit statements, taking advantage of our market research. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak today. I'll now hand it over to Sean. Sean? Sean Freeman : Thank you, Kathy. Following that overview of the operations of the Progressive Advantage Agency and the many unique shopping experiences we have deployed as part of it. I will now be walking you through the robust benefits of this Destination Era strategy. As Lori referenced earlier, any discussion about the benefits of the Progressive Advantage Agency should be viewed through the lens of a win-win-win strategy. As we look to implement programs where all participants stand to benefit. As with everything we do at Progressive, our customers really come first. The PAA was created to ensure we had a full suite of insurance products within our direct channel that can meet consumer needs throughout their lifetime. But beyond just offering a broad collection of types of insurance, we look to ensure that our customers are confident in their purchases through education and choice. Being able to provide quotes for other insurance companies in addition to our own underwritten policies ensures that customers feel empowered in their decision and are confident with their price and coverage. Additionally, our customers benefit from the ease of the shopping experiences, with our best-in-class quoting capabilities, saving them time and frustration. When thinking about the benefits enjoyed by our participating network of carriers the list really starts with the access they gain to millions of qualified customers that were generated through Progressive's marketing and media efforts. Given the strength of the Progressive brand and our advertising experience, this can frequently be greater consideration or at bats than many of these participating brands would experience on their own. Progressive also understands what is critical to writing profitable business. So we allow the carriers on our network to apply any of their proprietary acceptance and pricing rules in addition to our strong adherence to any provided procedures as of their appointed agencies. Furthermore, Progressive has been a leader in innovative customer experiences, both off-line and online for many years. Being a part of our carrier network allows for leveraging these experiences to efficiently and effectively quote and bind customers which presumably leads to positive brand association for our participating carriers. Finally, the creation of the Progressive Advantage Agency creates a multitude of benefits for Progressive and our shareholders. I will be highlighting many of these in more details in the upcoming slides. But in general, this Destination Era Strategy allows us to achieve greater top line growth, better efficiency in our media spend, extends household retention and serves as a stable source of revenues complementary to our underwriting profits. As we have covered in past IR calls, Progressive has been focused for several years on expanding our addressable market and improving our penetration into multi-product households or Robinsons as well as increasing our product offerings outside of those traditionally underwritten by Progressive. In doing so, we have seen a steady trend up in our multi-product households on both an absolute and relative basis. Through our Progressive Advantage Agency, we are able to offer complementary products within a unified bundle experience. For example, in Personal Lines, we can offer renters and/or home insurance to go along with the customer's auto policy or in Commercial Lines where we are able to offer general liability or business owner policies to complement their commercial auto coverage. These are prime examples of how the internal agency is able to help us provide a full suite of insurance solutions to meet customer needs and in turn help us grow. Another important component to our overall growth strategy is understanding how consumers view comparison quoting experiences. We know through our research that there are many key drivers of consumer consideration and ultimately, how they decide what insurance carriers they're going to receive a quote or purchase a policy from. Several of these considerations align nicely with the solutions that we are delivering as part of the Progressive Advantage Agency. This includes consumer confidence that they're getting the right coverage or rates, making the entire insurance process easy to navigate, feeling in control of their insurance decisions, getting good value and demonstrating an understanding of what is important to the consumers. Each of these drivers is met in some way through our comparison quoting experiences and agency operation, and will serve as guiding principles as we expand and refine our consumer messages and experiences. Along with the previous slide, these top of funnel benefits are foundational to the win-win-win dynamic that I started with. As these expand the total volume shopping with Progressive and thus leads to a greater pie to be shared by Progressive and our network of carriers. This offsets any minimal cannibalization risk that may be present through the providing of comparison quotes. With that said, we monitor very closely these trade-offs to ensure we achieve the most optimal outcomes. As highlighted in the last two slides, the Progressive Advantage Agency operation allows us to attract more customers at the top of the funnel and drive them to progressive.com or to our call centers. The next critical step is to get the most out of these interactions. Our multi-carrier model allows for a greater likelihood of returning competitive rates that meet consumers' needs. As the chart on the left indicates, by having more carrier appointments in a geography, we increase the likelihood that we can return at least one rate for our consumer. This is not surprising, but still critical in the face of greater underwriting restrictions for specific products such as homeowners. As a result of our carrier coverage, we were able to successfully provide a home or condo rate to more than 80% of all shoppers seeking these coverages on progressive.com in 2023. Additionally, we know that offering multiple comparison rates increases the chance we return a competitive rate to the customer. The chart on the right indicates that our conversion relativity is directly correlated with the number of rates we return. While there is diminishing return with every addition, we have seen more than a doubling of our conversion rate due to our portfolio of carriers as compared to a single carrier platform. This means more people finding a policy that works for them and more households having a relationship with Progressive. Transitioning from getting more customers in the door, I would like to highlight the value of the internal agency and maintaining these relationships through increased retention. As mentioned earlier, our goal is to meet customer needs throughout their lifetime. We hope that the policy we initially sell to a customer does just that. However, if this initial policy is no longer the best match, we have the ability to offer alternative carriers and coverage that may be a better fit. In doing so, we maintain a relationship with that customer and household longer. In the current environment, while rates are rising and underwriting is more restrictive, the ability to shop several carriers across the same product produces significant value to the customer and in turn Progressive. Within our homeowners portfolio, we see that we extend this household relationship nine months longer on average as a result of this multi-carrier safe practice. The other form of retention benefits comes as a result of increasing the number of policies that exist within a household. Not only does selling an additional policy lead to increased sales and profit from those other policies, but the expected retention of the original policy also dramatically improves. Across all products within our portfolio, the policy life expectancy grows meaningfully as you add products to the relationship and by a magnitude of up to 2x or more. It is important to note that we see this retention improvement, whether they are Progressive underwritten policies or network carrier policies, leading us to believe that meeting all insurance needs is the driver of customer loyalty even if we leverage other insurance carriers to do so. Many of these benefits come together in what we call a media virtuous cycle. With access to a multicarrier model, we can offer consumers more choice that meets their needs. In doing so, this elevates our sales yield per visitor to progressive.com or into our call centers. Getting a more efficient return on every visitor to Progressive allows us to increase our media spend while still hitting our target economics. This increased spend drives greater awareness of Progressive's offerings, driving traffic to progressive.com, our call centers as well as our appointed independent agents. This, in turn, increases the volume available to Progressive and the carriers within our network, incentivizing more carrier participation within our agency, strengthening the multi-carrier model further. This starts the cycle all over again. As we have especially seen in recent years, marketing spend is an important tool to stand out in the crowded insurance marketplace. This virtuous cycle is valuable to ensuring Progressive can rationally be in the top tier of marketing spenders and further widens the financial moat with lesser-known brands. The scaling of the Progressive Advantage Agency and its corresponding revenue expansion has several risk mitigating benefits. Commission revenue is a predictable annuity and has minimal exposure to the loss and cap risks that come along with underwriting insurance policies directly. This includes prominent risks such as weather and natural disasters. As agency compensation is really directly impacted by these risk exposures, this serves as a complementary source of revenue to our standard underwriting operation. Additionally, as previously highlighted, meeting more customer needs strengthens our brand and improves our sales yield, mitigating some of the standard competitive risk that insurance companies face. The many benefits that I've highlighted, stemming from the PAA can be found throughout our income statement. Our top line net premiums earned includes the premiums from our Progressive's underwritten products and is impacted by the agency's brand and consideration lift, the household retention improvements, increased additional protection sales and the increased media spend associated with the PAA operation. Additionally, our success is penetrating the Robinson customer segment roll up within these figures. As we have expanded our PAA operation and product offerings, we have experienced net earned premium growth for Robinsons that has outpaced that of our other customer segments. The service revenue line on the income statement includes the commissions earned from our carrier network. As the chart on the lower right demonstrates this is the most direct way to gauge the trajectory of our internal agency operation as it clearly shows our steady growth throughout the past decade. While it has not lost and made this as an Investor Relations call, and thus, the financial results are the primary focus, the story of the Progressive Advantage Agency still really comes down to the customer journey and ensuring that we are offering products and services that meet our customers' needs. Kathy previously highlighted the journey of Sam and Ashley as they progress through their lives and the evolution of their insurance needs along the way. Without bringing together a network of insurance carriers who offer complementary products like BOP or Life Insurance, we may not have been in a position to satisfy all of these needs and possibly would have lost the household relationship entirely. Happily, this is not the case as we are pleased to be able to continue to build and grow our Progressive Advantage Agency with a full suite of insurance products and a network of participating carriers. And ultimately, we believe, make good on our win-win-win strategy of delivering value to our direct customers, our network of carriers and to Progressive and our shareholders through the operation of this best-in-class internal agency. Douglas Constantine : This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Lori Niederst, Kathy Lemieux and Sean Freeman, who can answer questions about the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. In order to get to as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now take our first question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open. Michael Zaremski : Hey, great. Good morning. Thanks. The first question is regarding some of the commentary regarding kind of going back on the growth offensive given that profits are healed in a good chunk of your territories. So I guess on the last earnings call, I recall you alluded to growth likely being a little more subdued versus the beginning of '23 when you last one of the offenses. So I guess is that still the right way to think about things? Or any context around how you're thinking about growth, either by state or direct versus agency channel would be helpful? Tricia Griffith : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Here's how we're thinking about growth right now, which is somewhat different and somewhat alike last year. So we went into 2023 feeling like we had the right rate in the system. Clearly, as the year unfolded, and we realized that inflations were still going up, so they hadn't abated, and we needed more rate. So our sole concentration last year was to get the right rate on the street. And we feel like we're in a really great position right now. So if you think about the overarching belief that we have the right rates in the system, and we believe we do now understand there's all the caveats about we don't have every state. We're still working with some states to get rate. But for the most part, we feel really good about our rate. This is how we're thinking about growth, really sort of the trifecta. So we have a continued hard market. Ambient shopping is still up. So we know our competitors are still getting rate. So those customers are shopping and we're able to get that at a really inexpensive acquisition cost. Then we also know that we're unraveling a lot of our non-rate actions, our underwriting actions. We talked about that a little bit in November, but we're going to continue to do that. And then really the third part of that trifecta is our ability to be able to spend a lot on media. So we are really excited about heading into 2024. Obviously, my whole theme for the annual report was uncertainty. So, or the letter I should say, is uncertainty. We feel much more certain and much more confident we will watch as the data unfolds, and we're pretty excited. The one caveat I would say, Mike, is when we're starting to look at first quarter of this year, versus first quarter of last year, you're going to see some really odd comparisons on new App growth. So we are growing new Apps like crazy last year. In fact, on the Direct Side, our new apps were up 93%. Overall, in Auto up, I think, like 83% or 82%. So huge comparisons if you're going to compare it to this quarter. So keep that in mind as this quarter closes, we believe it will smooth out over the year, but that's something we should just make a note of. Michael Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful. My last follow-up is regarding your commentary about segmentation and continuous product model delivery is the term you also use in the letter. And I appreciate that it's probably, some of this is your special sauce and you might be, you want to be limited to how much you can say. But I'm curious, if we look at Progressive frequency and severities, but especially frequency over time. It tends to be better than the industry. I know there's different definitions. So you reminded us of frequency and severity, too? So we've got to be a little bit careful. But I Progressive still continues to do better than the industry on loss cost trends. Curious if you're willing to add any context about what what's driving the pricing segmentation? And is telematics a material kind of driver of you being able to do that? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean I think our continuous product model is our secret sauce. Over the years, I think we've sort of shared not in a lot of detail, but how, each model sort of adds segmentation and gets us to where we want, especially with the preferred customer. UBI is a big part of it and has been for a long time, and that will continue to be and why we're investing more and more into our latest product model, which is our continuous. I think with the Florida added this year, we're at about 70% continuous, and we're learning a lot from that. And we'll be able to do a lot for our customers as well. So maybe at some time when we do some of the deep dives, we can share a little bit more about how we think about our [indiscernible]. We're never going to share a secret sauce because that is just that. But we literally have our R&D departments working in both Personal Lines, Commercial Lines and Property, nonstop, thinking about the next mode to just get that extra piece of data to understand how it correlates to loss costs. John Sauerland : I can also add that you're right. When you look over even decades, you see our frequency being more favorable than the industry and severity being somewhat similar to the industry. And Tricia noted what we believe are some of the key drivers, but we are also continuing to shift the mix of our business to more preferred customers who generally have lower claims frequency. So, it's hard to parse out exactly which piece of those frequency trends are the aforementioned, but we should note that we're also moving more and more to preferred and that will drive the frequency down as well. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Bob Huang : Maybe just a follow-up on one of the comments that you made when you earlier talked about you plan to spend a lot on media to drive growth. Can you maybe help us understand like when you say a lot, like how should we think about it from just a modeling a forecasting perspective because, the way we think about it, obviously, there's going to be a lot of growth potential for Progressive. How should we think about the impact on expense ratio? And as well as what is a ballpark target that you're thinking about when you're normalizing expense back to a more historical level? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I would say back to more historical levels. We've had a couple, several rough years where we've had to pull back on media I mentioned that in my letter. They've been incredible. We have a media machine, a marketing machine and both are working really well, and we want to leverage that. We're not going to spend if we don't think it's efficient. When I talked about our growth in sort of the trifecta, we're getting a lot of ambient shopping still, and we'll continue to watch that. However, we think there's an opportunity to kind of open up the spigot and get more business in the door. We feel like we're in a really prime time now, especially with our rates. So while we're not going to share our full budget we believe we can spend assuming all things with our pricing is right and we get pricing and some rate in some of the states that we need, I think we'll be able to spend a tremendous amount to really leverage what we think could be a great growth year. Bob Huang : Okay. That's very helpful. My second question, I think you addressed some of this in the prepared remarks. I just want to see if we can deep a little bit -- dig a little bit deeper into it is the broader competitive environment, and obviously, it seems like you made it very clear that you want to expand, especially in the off market, the bundled market Robinsons market, so to speak. But is there, can you maybe give us a more in-depth view on what are the competitors that are already in those position? What is the current environment look like for you to take share? Is it going to be in your view, much more difficult than before? Or is the current environment a much easier competitive dynamic for you to grab market share, especially within the Robinsons market? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think that has to do a lot with timing. So a lot of our competitors have increased rates as well pretty substantially. So there's a sort of a time frame. I don't know exactly when that is. But right now, we believe, we are able to take market share. Again, there'll be some, at some point, there'll be stable rates throughout the industry and there'll be less shopping. Really, the key for us in terms of market share will be to grab as much new business at or below our target market -- target profit. And really, the holy grail is retention and keeping those customers. So the key this year for us because we've had so many years of rate after rate is to have some stability for our customers. They deserve that. We want that. Of course, we'll watch the trends, and we'll have to react to those trends. But I'd like some stable rates because I think if we've got the new business coming in the door and then people staying with us, that is a huge win. And then, of course, Robinsons, we've continued to grow. We're excited about continuing to invest in our HomeQuote Explorer and the Progressive Advantage Agency. Working with great partners in that. Bob Huang : Okay. Thank you very much. I think after all these years, we're all looking for comfortability. So thank you for that. Tricia Griffith : Absolutely. Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is open. Joshua Shanker : Yes, hi there. Thank you for taking my question. My first question, given the growth the company has had over the last couple of years, can you talk about what economy of scale has done to the other expense ratio? Tricia Griffith : Well, I think any time you have an economies of scale, you'll be able to push down the expense ratio. We're always trying to balance out our expenses with investments and what the customers want. So digital and other things like that. So the bigger you get, I think the more you can, whether it's brand or expenses you can push on that, but we have been investing a lot in digital for our customers, and we'll continue to do that. One of our other pillars, and we talked about broad coverage today is competitive prices. And the two parts of competitive prices are really what we talked about a little bit earlier with Mike's question, that's segmentation having industry-leading segmentation. Understanding rate to risk. And the other is expenses. And we are constantly challenging ourselves to what's that right balance of investing, but getting those economies of scale. We'll continue to work on that for as long as I'm here for sure. And as long as John Sauerland is for sure. John Sauerland : Josh, sorry. As I think you know, we focus internally on what we call our non-acquisition expense ratio. So we talked a lot about media. We're always looking to optimize media relative to where we are in terms of rate adequacy and market opportunity on the non-acquisition expense ratio side, we're always looking to optimize costs. And of course, scale is a part of the way to do that. We have been successful in taking, if you look over the longer run, at least four points out of our cost structure on our non-acquisition expense ratio. Tricia mentioned, it's always a balance in investing and relative to the longer run, but we continue to expect to find opportunities to drive our non-acquisition expense ratio lower across all three of our businesses. Joshua Shanker : My other question at this point in the cycle where Progressive seems to be profitable and most of the competition is not. What does the marketplace look like for commissions right now? Both contingent commissions as well as base rate commissions? Tricia Griffith : I can let Pat take that. I mean we, our commissions have been pretty stable and we have different structures depending on if we have a Platinum agent and some other programs we have with different agents I think, I don't want to speak too specifically to our competitors because they also ebb and flow. Pat Callahan : Yes. We've definitely seen competitors use commission cuts as a profitability or margin restoration lever. And we haven't done that. So we've maintained our commission. We do have a contingent component which self-cures when we're not making money, and we think that's a superior design, because you're aligned incentives and when the business performs well, agents get paid well. And when it doesn't, we correct without having to change commission structures and contracts. So we built and deployed that and had that out in market. Now competitors who have pulled back, we know agents have long memories. And we think that will potentially hinder their ability to restore growth when they want to come back in the market later in '24 or beyond. Joshua Shanker : Thank you for the answers. John Sauerland : Robinson segment. So just for clarity, we do have different commission structures for our Platinum agencies to incent the bundle. And we think we're very competitive with the marketplace when it comes to compensating our independent agents for bundled business as well as monoline business. Fair to say. Joshua Shanker : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi, good morning. So just following up on one of your earlier answers, you mentioned the app comparison, comp comparisons being tough and that will suppress growth in the app count in 1Q. Should we assume a similar trend for PIF growth as well to where it will be weaker in 1Q and improve year after? Or does that not apply to PIF growth? Tricia Griffith : I don't think you're going to expect as much of a different trend in PIF than New Apps. New Apps were up just so much. Like I said, 92% in direct, 83% overall. It was just a tremendous quarter and we actually tried to slow growth. So you're just going to see a little bit of a negative trend. But I think PIFs, of course, are not just new apps or also our retention. And our preferred year to growth is unit growth because as you've seen over these years where average written premium can go up and down, that's where you want the unit growth to be able to have that stable value company. Jimmy Bhullar : And the reason I was asking is PIF growth was good in 1Q, but it wasn't sort of outsized. I think you grew 5% in January, 7% in February and 10% in March in personal auto. And then just following up\u2026 Tricia Griffith : It's pretty good on our book. Yes, I would, anything with -- that begins with one and another number, I'm pretty impressed with PIF growth with the book of our size. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then just following up on sort of competitor behavior. What are, I realize that you guys are not raising prices as much as many of your peers, because you started repricing your book earlier. But in terms of marketing spend, are you seeing competitors pull back on marketing spend as well as [indiscernible] profitability? Or are they continuing to market pretty heavy? Tricia Griffith : No, I think we're seeing competitors reenter the market, and that's why we believe it's a good time. We're still seeing, like I said, some ambient shopping, but I think it's going to be a really competitive year for everyone, and we're excited about it. Jimmy Bhullar : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Robert Cox : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe start off with a little bit of a longer-term question here, but Progressive is a growth company and has certainly been taking share and it seems like you'll be the market leader in personal auto in short order, if you're not already. Is there an internal view on the structural ceiling that Progressive can hold over time? Like is something around the 19% share that State Farm held in the early 2000s aspirational for Progressive? Or do you think you can gain more share than that? Tricia Griffith : I mean we want to grow as much as we possibly can while we make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit. So we're going to continue, we're not going to have a ceiling with that. What we will do is understand the addressable market. And kind of go across both, all of our lines of business to understand where we need to invest, where we need to, where we think we can gain more share. And that's really why we diversify. That's really why we've had the HomeQuote Explorer, BusinessQuote Explorer, AutoQuote Explorer to be able to gather more market share, be transparent for our customers and give them an easy way to shop and save even if it's not with us. That's also one of the reasons why years ago, we set a construct together that we used this McKinsey construct that were called the Three Horizons. And the first one is execute. We've been working on that since 2016, 2017, and that is execute the heck out of growing or getting as much on private passenger auto and commercial auto and home business that we can as long as we're making money. And we've done extraordinarily well. They're obviously surpassing $61 billion in premiums for 2023. The second horizon is the exciting part in Commercial Lines where we've been growing our BMTs there, but we also have some expansion coverage that we're excited about. We just entered our 45th state with Florida last week. So very excited about that. We obviously bought Protective to have larger fleets. We're now calling Protective just so you know, Progressive fleet and specialty. And of course, our TNC business. So those ancillary products that where we believe we have the right to play and the right to win, and those have been really exciting expansion for Karen and her group. And then Horizon 3 is a little bit further afield, but those are some products that we believe will fit unmet customer needs and you think kind of longer-term out. So we're constantly in a cycle of three years, five years, 10 years. And in fact, we have our Board retreat later this week to outline how we intend to continue to grow market share across the board and do so in a profitable manner. So we're excited about the future. We're excited about the position we're in at this point given the extreme amount of uncertainty in the last four years. And if there's any team that can do it, it is the team here in Cleveland, Ohio. Robert Cox : Awesome. Thank you so much for that. And maybe just on the second question, I was just hoping you could walk us through some of the larger states that you're not yet rate adequate and what is the game plan for those states? Tricia Griffith : Well, we're, it's typical, some of the typical states you've talked about on the coast, think of New Jersey, New York, California on the direct side. We just got a plus 20 on California agency. So that is a good move towards that. We're having continued conversations because this is really about the consumer. We want to have availability for each consumer to be able to get the coverage they need to protect the things that they love. And all we want to do is try to make $0.04 of underwriting profits. So we're going to continue to work with each insurance department to get the rate that we need and then be fully open and available for those consumers. Robert Cox : Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, going back to the marketing, and I guess maybe a little bit tying into the PIF discussion. As you guys lay out the marketing budget for this year, Tricia, are you expecting it to be even throughout the four quarters? Like how do you think about the cadence of the marketing spend as you think about trying to acquire customers during 2024? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. So some of the marketing spend, we already like pre-buy. So that's sort of out there. And then other that we have like digital and some other areas where we can be more fluid will react to what's happening in the environment. So if we feel like that our MP6 is down, which is our new prospects, we can increase it. We're always going to do it and try to be efficient around it. That's really the game plan. And again, it has to do with what our customers are doing -- I'm sorry, our competitors are doing. So it's not an easy question. We continually tweak it to make sure we're efficient while bringing as much new business in the door that we can and then we have some that will already be on the books. Do you want to add anything, Pat? Pat Callahan : No, I would say we normally pace heavier in Q1 than we do in Q4 because of customer shopping. So just as Tricia said, we'll fish where the fish are. And when there's a lot of people out there in market, we want to advertise to make sure they know where available and to bring them to Progressive. As we've stated this year, we're opening up maybe a little slower than we did in 2023. So from a pacing perspective, we'll probably be more level between Q1, Q2 and Q3 than we historically would have been. But we also know that if the hard market prevails and continues, then we will want to continue to spend up to our allowables to capitalize on growth while people are looking for a new provider of auto home or commercial insurance. Tricia Griffith : Yes, I don't forget about our other lever, and that is opening up and unraveling our non-rate actions. So we've got a couple of different things in play, and that's the reason to believe, and our reason to believe that we can capture a lot of market share this year. So that's another avenue that we've continued to do since late last year. Elyse Greenspan : And then my follow-up, you guys saw favorable development in January. For the first time in a while, right, typically, that's a month right when you have late reporting claims from the prior year, what drove that development in January? And does that, was that frequency or severity driven? I'm just wanting to get a sense that there would be some expectations for continuation of that better trend in '24? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I would say the January decrease. The majority of that was Florida. Most of the other states were pretty tight. Again, it's one month, and we will let that year play out. Gary's team looks at a lot of data each and every month just to make sure were adequately reserved, and I'll let his team do that. It's very separate from. And I'd like Gary do the right thing on behalf of the company, but I wouldn't read too much into January. It's obviously, we're pleased to have favorable development, but it was mostly Florida. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hi, good morning. So I had a question just on just -- Tricia, just how impactful you think unraveling some of the nonreactions can be on PIF growth. Just wondering relative to ad spend, historically, has there been more impact to PIF growth from bringing up or down marketing spend compared to non-rate actions? Or can you help size the potential for growth from rolling back those non-rate actions? Tricia Griffith : It's really hard to size because I think I feel like we've never been tighter in our non-rate actions than we were last year. Again, it's hard to quantify because there's a bunch of different actions we'll do, and we'll do some on different products, different states. It could be different in channels. So it's hard to quantify. I think if you want to have a quicker reaction, the media spend does that. But it's hard to discern exactly what would go into each. What we do know is we were really tight trying to slow growth, making sure we got rate in the system and now we're able to unwind that. But we're not doing it full bore. We're doing it very logically to make sure that we reach our target profit margins. John Sauerland : And I'd add, if we're looking towards PIF growth, new business is one driver, but retention is a far stronger driver of PIF growth. And as Tricia mentioned, we are looking forward to more stable rates this year. We are feeling very adequate in most environments. So we have already enjoyed retention improvements, and we expect to continue to enjoy retention improvements. Competitors are certainly in a better place, but are continuing to raise rates as well. So on a competitiveness basis when the renewals come through, we think we're going to be in a good place, and that will help drive policy in force growth as well. David Motemaden : Got it. Thanks for that. And that sort of leads into my follow-up is just last quarter, I think, Pat, you had said that PLEs and retentions were improving, but not at historical levels. Where are we at now? And just in -- just thinking about that because I recognize there is a tougher comp on new Apps, but I would think the retention comp is also a little bit different as well. So how far away are we from historical retention? Just sort of thinking through some of the drivers of PIF growth? Tricia Griffith : I don't know historical at the top of my head, David, but we're pretty excited about both the trailing three and trailing 12 PLE and where we are from a month. And we sort of have internally, David here that we talk about the value of one month of PLE to our lifetime earned premium. I think we're pretty high. John Sauerland : Yes. We are not yet quite back to our all-time high for policy life expectancy. But we're getting there. And our trajectory is certainly indicating that we might be achieving new highs later in the year. We can't project that, obviously. But when you look at the charts, that's what you might conclude. So again, will depend upon the competitive environment. We think we're in a much more stable place, meaning not having to take nearly as much rate as we have historically. The market continues to rise, and we think it's going to play well to policyholder retention. David Motemaden : Understood, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Could you just talk a little bit about, Tricia, I guess, across the book, how you're thinking about severity in 2024? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, I like the fact that severity seemed to moderate a little bit. And so we're hoping that it's a little bit benign. When you look at, last year, we were affected by fixing cars, and that seems to be a little bit calmer. So I think auto parts inflation is nearing 0 and auto services is in the kind of mid-single-digits. So we're, that's how we're thinking about it. We'll obviously watch if something changed as they did last year. But I'm thinking, I think benign and kind of moderate is what I would say from a severity perspective. And I feel the same way with [indiscernible] right in the 8% to 10%. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then I know last year, you kind of shared with us early in the year, I think it was a modest amount of rate that you expected to be taking over the year. You mentioned California, New Jersey, New York. Could you just give us maybe a placeholder for, I guess what you're thinking in the aggregate, if you're able to get those, the rate in those states kind of yes, in the aggregate, what we'll be looking at in terms of rate increases in '24? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I really can't share that because it's different with each state. We're in the midst of talking to the departments and showing our verification for needs for those rates. All I can say is that we'll get what we need to, to be at our target profit margins, or won't be able to be as open, which is like I said, unfortunate for consumers. For the rest of the country, we feel good at the rate we have gotten for the last several years. And so that's really what we're focusing on in addition to the conversations and negotiations with our departments. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then just one more, if I could sneak it in. obviously, progress with the Robinson. Just curious what the geographic diversity of that book looks like versus your broader auto book. Is that still kind of heavily coastal or I guess it doesn't look like the broader agency book does? Tricia Griffith : Are you thinking, are you, Ryan, are you talking more like the property side of the Robinsons? Ryan Tunis : On the Auto. So yes, because of the property, it had been coastal, I'm wondering if it's starting to look more like the, how you've historically seen the agency book? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I think we're trying to make sure that, well, there's Robinsons everywhere. So there could be a different value of the insurability of homes, et cetera. But yes, I think that, obviously, because Robinsons have a property feature to them, and we are getting into more nonvolatile states growth. You'll see Robinsons growth in those states over time. But it will take some time. I mean we were still in the midst of moving our book a little bit away from Florida, as we discussed with our 115,000 non-renewals that actually we set notices out in January, and those will start to non-renew into another company that we're working with to take those should they want them in May, of this year. But yes, we're if you read all the data of our PIF growth, our premium growth and our new app growth in nonvolatile versus volatile, we are ahead of plan, but still a long way to go. But we should grow Robinsons in those areas for sure. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on Elyse's question, the Florida releases. Was that some of the litigation-related reserves from last year? And I guess, how are you feeling about those reserves in that kind of situation? Tricia Griffith : It was mostly floor to kind of across the board, a couple of different things. Some were some settlements on glass, some from House Bill. So there was a couple of different inputs to the release, we are feeling positive about the tort reform change in Florida. And we're starting to see a little bit of that. I don't want to get ahead of my skis with that. But we believe, especially the new comp negligence law should be very helpful. But again, we'll watch that really closely because it's still new, and there's a lot of things that can unfold, but we're positive about the changes that have been made in Florida. Michael Ward : Okay. Thanks. And then on frequency, curious about frequency kind of like year-to-date? Just following the very favorable December. Tricia Griffith : I don't, if I were looking at frequency, I would look at it more on the trailing 12 over current 12 and about 2% because there's a lot that goes into the data that you saw from this quarter in terms of mix. So John talked about that a little bit. We were really tight with our underwriting. So our mix of business is more preferred which causes less frequency of accidents. You'll hear this a lot. But since we're changing to a Gregorian calendar, there is a little bit of data in there. And then, of course, weather in December was really benign. So I would think that, and of course, we can't predict frequency or severity. But I would be thinking of frequency as more of reverting back to our normal trend ex-all COVID, et cetera, the last 60 years, frequencies continue to decline a couple of points every year. Michael Ward : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great, thank you so much. Two quick questions. First, Tricia, in the past, you talked about how the last sort of piece of the property puzzle was getting non-cat weather price correctly. Do you think that was the issue that kept you above the 96% in 2023? Tricia Griffith : Well, there's a lot of things that went to that. I'm trying to think of, I was just thinking of January, too, because some of the weather in January was actually nonvolatile. So there's weather just across the board here and there, nothing big with cats. But I would say a lot of things went into 2023. We didn't have the right rate. We're still working on our segmentation. We really in earnest just started to be able to de-risk especially in the really volatile states. And I think all those things together kind of put us where we were at the end of the year. Meyer Shields : Okay. The second question is with regards to PAA. Is there any limitation on your like contractual limitations on your ability to use the data from other companies? Tricia Griffith : Yes. We are very, we are, it's a very important thing for the relationships to make sure that their proprietary data is just that, and we don't share it within other places of Progressive. So as an example, there's a company we've worked with for a long time. They're a great partner, and we actually bifurcate the monthly reports, the data because we think that is really important for everyone to have their algorithms and same with ours. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. Tricia Griffith : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning everybody. My first question ties back to Josh's questions on economies of scale and the improving expense ratio. How much room does that leave you guys to maybe increase your ad spend, marketing spend without really compromising on efficiencies and seeing significantly lower incremental returns there? Tricia Griffith : Well, if you're talking about expense ratio, I would look, I probably look more directly at our direct expense ratio because that's we're going to hit some of the marketing spend. And it's pretty low, especially compared, maybe this isn't the right comparison. Especially compared to January of last year, it was like 4.5 points lower. So there will be pressure on the expense ratio. Even though the marketing spend will be efficient just because it's out there. And you'll see that I would follow the direct spend. If you look at December's direct loss ratio to January. I think December was a little bit over 12%. So you're going to start to see that when we put our media budget into play. Yaron Kinar : Right. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is if we go back, we'll see an expense ratio of roughly 20%, which is a mix of ad spend and other stuff. Can you essentially fill the ad spend bucket to get back to 20%? Or is the economies of scale so significant today that, that 20% rate is probably kind of not so relevant anymore? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, I'll let Pat add in. I think to John talked a little bit about the non-acquisition expense rate. So I'll show acquisition. I'll let Pat weigh in a little bit. We are not going to spend just to spend to get up to the 20%. We're going to be efficient. Now for some reason, it gets up to 20%, and we are bringing great new business and huge amounts, and we feel great about. That could be one thing. And then we'll continue to focus on the pressuring non-acquisition expense ratio as one part of that formula. Do you want to add anything? Pat Callahan : Yes. I think that's your characterization is spot on in that we have a hierarchy of levers that we pull in order to slow the business and in order to grow the business on the other side. So whether it's starting with reducing verification or opening up more favorable bill plans, then spending more than if we're doing all those and unable to drive conversion at a level that we want to grow, we would potentially lower rates at that point. But that's the hierarchy that we're reversing right now. And at this point, what's maybe a little deceiving is average premiums have gone up significantly due to the rate increases, which is driving down that expense ratio. So even if we got spending back to an absolute dollar basis, where we were in the past, you're not going to get your expense ratio back to where it was in the past. But to Tricia's point, our budget is governed by our ability to efficiently acquire customers against what we expect to be the lifetime value of that customer to Progressive and of course, to make sure we can deliver phenomenal claims and customer service and support the growth on that end. So I hope that helps in that we're not swinging back to 20%. What we're doing is unwinding some of the changes that we've made. Some have very little expense costs associated with them. Media, obviously has a greater cost to it on the other side. John Sauerland : Sorry. I just wanted to give a little greater appreciation of how we spend. We do it in an extremely surgical and analytical manner. We have loads in our pricing by customer segment at a very finite level. And so we understand what we can spend to and meet our lifetime combined ratio targets on each customer segment. So as we go into spend, we are not targeting an expense ratio to Pat's point, we are being extremely surgical and targeted in going after customer segments where we know we can spend up to that allowable cost that we have priced into the product at the segment level. A little different approach than I think you're thinking. Yaron Kinar : I think you just articulated than the way I was able to ask the questions. So thank you, my other question, if we could switch to the commercial book. I think you had some volatility in the TNC business last year, both in terms of the top line growth and more importantly, there's the loss ratio. Can you maybe give us an update where you are today, how comfortable you are with it? But kind of the trajectory you see there? Tricia Griffith : Yes. So for the, let me kind of talk about Commercial overall, and I'll get into the TNC part. So -- for our core commercial business, I feel much more positive where we are from a combined ratio perspective, especially with 16 points yet to earn in this year. And then I talked a little bit about some expansion products that we talked about like in Horizon 2. So think of Progressive Fleet, think of TNC, think of our BOP. Those do put a little pressure on our core business, but we think it's important to invest in them. The TNC, we've continued to strengthen reserves, as you saw last year, and we'll have some rate increases that go into play significant ones this quarter. So we feel much better about it. And if you go back we have 20 states total between the two companies that we work with. But if you go back to where, we started with our first state in 2016. That knowledge that we've learned in the TNC business has really helped us. So each state is a little bit different depending on the maturity level of that. And a lot of what happened last year with the reserve strengthening, happened to be in two states, New Jersey and California and in coverages of UM and UIM. So that's where we're working to get the right rate to make sure we can reach our profit margin. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Michael Phillips : Thanks for putting me in. I think I just have, well, maybe two. Just one. To what extent is the hard market in Personal Auto have any impact on the mix of customers that stay bundled. In other words, if there's more, maybe sticker shock in one versus the other? Are you seeing customers kind of get away from the desire to bundle? Tricia Griffith : I mean I think right now, customers are looking for price because it's gone up so much with everything else. So people do you like to bundle because you can also get a discount in most companies. The hard market for me I really equate to more just overall shopping. Just people get their renewals and they shop and can have we already got the rate in the system to get them. So we want to get auto, we want to get home and we want to get the bundled regardless of either one. Obviously, we care a lot about the bundle. But it's really, I think customers dictate the market based on the trends they're seeing in their bills. Michael Phillips : Okay. And then just separate, can you share any thoughts on loss trends in your Protective business that you did a couple of years ago? How is that looking? And any trends there? Tricia Griffith : Not really. No. Michael Phillips : Okay. Nothing that stands out versus normal the smaller fleets, the smaller normal commercial business? Tricia Griffith : No. We continue, we'll continue to grow. We've expanded our own fleet before Protective from 10 power units to 40 power units. We continue to expand. We continue to work on the integration of the acquisition, we feel positive about the acquisition. And we have some rate in the system definitely for a Progressive Fleet, but nothing really more than that to share. Michael Phillips : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. We have a follow-up question from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great, thank you so much for taking the follow-up. I was just wondering whether the PAA commissions factor into either the 96% combined ratio target somehow? Or if there is a profit goal for that business? Tricia Griffith : The commissions are just that. There's just commissions that come in the door that we've agreed with the companies and then there, of course, rating their auto or their home based on their rating algorithm. John Sauerland : They flow as a contract expense on the area in that combined ratio. Tricia Griffith : Yes, I'm sorry. Meyer Shields : Okay. Perfect, thank you. Operator : Please standby for our next question. We have a follow-up question from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. Are you guys considering making any changes to your reinsurance program as it comes up for renewal this year? Tricia Griffith : I think well, you saw what was outlined in the K with the Aggregate Program. And then our CAT Tower Program is up for renewal in June, and we're working on that. Right now, actually, two of the people are in London, talking with our reinsurers, we feel like we'll have some positive results come the June renewal. John Sauerland : Yes. So we don't have anything definitive to offer Elyse, but you can generally think of us targeting retention in generally the same area. I can't guarantee it will be exactly the same. We have, as we de-risked the property portfolio been enjoying decreasing PMLs. So that helps us at the top of the tower because we might not have to buy as much. But generally speaking, you can think of the focus and the structure of the CAT Program at June 1 is very similar to what we have today. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. We have a follow-up from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open. Michael Zaremski : Great. Just a quick follow-up. First, I heard you say, I think it was the first time you've said that you feel the recent Florida legislative reforms are actually a positive. You gave some context around it. But just curious, are the reforms meaningful enough that it might cause you to change your de-risking strategy in the state of Florida, which has been I think more home insurance centric? Tricia Griffith : No. I think what allows me to think about is being able to continue to grow there and not have so much litigation that puts pressure on the rest of the book. We still had, when we think about the de-risking of the Florida property book. Half of those were rental properties, coastal properties. Those are things that I feel like we should have de-risked anyway regardless. So I think you would do that anyway, and I wouldn't go back from that. I mean I think the reforms will be good overall just for the structure. And of course, again, I don't want to get out ahead of my skis, I want to kind of see how it pans out. But yes, I think that's what I would say. So we're seeing some small data signs that we believe it's good. Again, I want to give it some time. I want to de-risk the book. And right now, we're open for business really in sported with new construction on homes, and that's it. Michael Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. We have a follow-up from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. Just had a question on the 19 points of personal auto rate that you guys got last year. How much of that is still yet to earn in? Tricia Griffith : How much of that Pat, I think... Pat Callahan : At this point, I think we've probably got, I don't know, eight to nine points that are still earning in I'd have to look at the table for details, but we got some big rate increases later in the year that we'll still earn in because we've got obviously six months and then 12-month policy renewals. David Motemaden : Got it. Understood. And then just on the ambient shopping levels, have you guys seen any changes in ambient shopping over the last several months? Tricia Griffith : Yes. We've seen the increase in ambient shopping. And so we'll watch and see if that continues. And I think when some of our competitors get their rate in the system, like Pat just said, it depends on the competitor because some have six-month policies, many have 12-month policies, which obviously takes a lot more time to earn in. I'm sure we'll see that diminish, but that's when we have all the other levers that we have for our growth. David Motemaden : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Operator : Please stand by for our next question. Tricia Griffith : Let's wrap up after this. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Ward : Last but not least. Thanks. I was just wondering the claims specialist in property, is that the increase in that number? Is that part of the customer value prop? Or is it something else? Tricia Griffith : I'm not clear on your question. Michael Ward : The property claims specialist count increased? On the 10-K we noticed. Pat Callahan : Is that property claims. Is that. Tricia Griffith : The growth for the head count growth? Michael Ward : Yes. Tricia Griffith : Yes. So we are growing our ability to handle our own claims internally historically, especially when we first bought ASI, the majority of the claims that we handled were through independent adjusters. And while we still use a lot of independent adjusters for our appraisals, we wanted to have that talent in-house. So that is the increase. Sorry, I did understand your question to begin with. But yes, that increase is just to us to have that talent and understanding as we grow our property book. Michael Ward : Awesome. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Doug. Douglas Constantine : That appears to be our final question. So that concludes our event. And Towando [ph], I'll hand it back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Progressive Corporation's fourth quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Douglas Constantine : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's first quarter investor event. I'm Douglas Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today's event.  The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website.  Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 60 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with members of our leadership team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event.  Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2024. And you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will pick us off of introductory comments. Tricia? Susan Griffith : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In many ways, this first quarter has felt like we have turned a page. Since mid-2021, inflationary pressure and its subsequent effect on our profit margins has been a predominant factor in our strategic decision-making. Even in the second half of 2023, when we started to see indications that severity trends were stabilizing, more rate was earning in and accident year loss ratios approached our target. We continue to flex in order to deliver on our calendar year 96 combined ratio goal.  In our August Investor Relations call, I was asked if we should put aside our 96 target and instead capitalize on the perceived growth opportunity at the time. In my answer, I cited our core values and the belief that our strategy to put profit before growth would prove to be a winning formula. As we look back to the second half of 2023 and the stellar results of the first quarter 2024, we feel stronger than ever that sticking to the core values that has served us well for so long was absolutely the right call. By adhering to who we are, it looks like we have turned that page and we're now seeing the benefits of the tough decisions and hard work over the last several years since inflation took off. Our first quarter of 2024 has really set the stage for us to capitalize on both growth and profitability. During the quarter, net premiums written grew 18%, and we produced a solid combined ratio of 86.1%.  Our profitability was made possible from rate continuing to earn in from the rate revisions we took in the last year, seasonably favorable frequency. Mix changes in our book from the non-rate actions we implemented over the last 2 years continued improvements in segmentation and less prior year loss reserve development, among other factors. In Personal Auto, our calendar year margins mean we've been able to shift more focus into growth with incredible results. In the first quarter, we added over 900,000 policies in force, one of the best quarters in our history and second only to the first quarter of 2023. We did this on the back of strong retention on our renewals and new application growth that is ramping up as we increase our media spend and pull back on some of our non-rate actions.  During the first quarter, media spend was down 7% versus the first quarter 2023, and new auto applications were down 9% compared to a record growth in the first quarter last year. The [ year to ] year gap in both spend and sales declined as the quarter progressed. When comparing March 2024 to March 2023, ad spend was up and new auto applications were nearly flat. We continue to see opportunity for growth as the market is still very tight. We have non-rate actions we are unwinding and still have a few states where we are working to get rate revisions approved.  As we look forward to the rest of 2024, we will continue to seek to strike the right balance between efficient marketing spend, our calendar year profit targets and maximizing our growth. In Commercial Lines, the first quarter saw better results as compared to 2023. Our core commercial business continues to run well with almost 10 points of rates still to earn in from revisions in 2023 and 2024. As a reminder, 90% of our policies in commercial lines are on 12-month terms, so it takes much longer for rates to earn in as compared to personal auto. The trucking insurance market continues to be soft due to macroeconomic factors. And as a result, we are experiencing year-over-year decline in policies in force in our for-hire transportation and specialty business market targets. While our other 3 BMTs are growing year-over-year from both a unit and premium perspective, in property, we continue to execute on our strategy to reduce our exposure to catastrophe prone states, growing states that have less volatile weather profiles and improve the underwriting and segmentation of our products. Policies in force in volatile states decreased about 5% year-over-year in the first quarter 2024 and grew about 20% in the nonvolatile state. We now have 5 states on our 5.0 product model, which improves segmentation throughout the product. While results are unpredictable, we shouldn't look too deeply into the results of a single quarter as the uncertainty in the last several years has shown us, it's difficult to predict where the future is heading.  Given what we know now, however, we're encouraged about the future. Inflationary trends are showing indications of stabilizing, and we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on a marketplace that is still reeling from the profit challenges of the last 2 years. It's comforting to be able to report that we're pivoting to a more normalized operation where, in most states, we can take small bites of the apple when it comes to rate and can focus on growth and increasing our market share. While challenges undoubtedly lay ahead, we're confident in where we stand today and look forward to maximizing our potential in the future.  Thank you again for joining us, and I'll now take your questions. Douglas Constantine : This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question. Operator : The first question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Jian Huang : First question is regarding retention. On your 10-Q, you talked about improved retention, both in personal lines and property business. given that you're unlikely to be the only company that is positioned for growth as we head into 2024, curious to your view on retention going forward in terms of the broader market competitive dynamics, do you see people potentially coming in challenging your market share position just going forward? And then broadly speaking, just retention in general. Susan Griffith : Yes. Bob, I think you know our retention is sort of our [ holy grail ] we continue to feel good about our trailing 12. Our 3 months is flat. We're going to focus now, like we said, like I just said in the opening comments on having more stable rates because that's really what consumers want. So will they go to shop, if the rate is better, then their option is to leave. We've got to make sure we have competitive rates. So as we think about growth, we just think about new business. We think about renewal business, we think about our service and growing PIF, the units of both new and renewals. So we'll continue to focus on that, focus on having more stable rates and continuing to be ahead of the competition. Jian Huang : Okay. My follow-up is on the -- your distribution channel, and this is a little bit more hypothetical. Your direct channel, obviously have a little bit less of an underwriting margin versus your agency. As you continue to push for growth going forward, is it fair to assume that that's going to have somewhat of a headwind challenge to your overall combined ratio given your direct channel continue to be sort of a focus on the growth side? Should we expect our current underwriting margin to normalize a bit with the combination of focus on growth, your distribution channel mix and things of that nature for the personal line -- personal model? Susan Griffith : We're going to focus on growth in both channels. But of course, you will see the trend in the expense ratio, specifically on the direct side as we start to increase media. If you look -- if you look at January, it was around 15 points. February was 17.5, March was in the 18 area. That was -- I was putting more and more pressure as the quarter developed on the media spend. Now when we look at we look at non-acquisition expense ratios and then as much as we can spend in media as long as it's efficient. So when we look at overall combined ratios, we're going to look at, obviously, at the type of business we're bringing on. We have a preference to bring on bundled business. And we believe we have the best segmentation model in the industry.  So that's a big part of the understanding rate to risk. So all those flow together. But we're excited and really thrilled to be able to continue -- to continue on our growth method because even the last years, with all the headwinds and all the uncertainty we've still been able to grow, but to be able to grow at these margins is really exciting. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO. Michael Zaremski : Question on Personal Auto. Historically, not every year, but historically a disproportionate amount of Progressive's organic growth sales have come in the kind of the January through April time frame. Given the current dynamics, do you feel that that's the right type of seasonality we should be thinking about? And if not, what factors should we be thinking about? Susan Griffith : Yes. I think a lot of that comes from tax refunds and other things that happen in a yearly basis. I wouldn't necessarily think about that this year though, because even last year, we were growing, we are actually trying to kind of stop a little bit because of the pressures on our margin. I feel very bullish about our continued growth on both a premium basis -- unit basis, and that's a -- you know there is our preferred measure of growth. So it's all going to be about our ability to do a couple of things. We want to continue to roll back our nonrate actions, so there's -- we still have more levers there. We have the premium earning in and we believe that we're not going to have to -- at least at this juncture, the wide swath of premium that we had to get to our target margin and then our media spend to be able to have those margins. We're about 10 points better than our target 96. So we have a lot of levers to pull to be able to really maximize growth. You'll notice I said this in my letter, in my opening statements and several times throughout the 10-Q. And we talked about it as we were riding the management discussion and analysis about is maximize growth, the right word, versus optimize. And I felt maximize was absolutely the right word to use because that's exactly what we're going to do. Michael Zaremski : My follow-up, I know you've touched on this a bit even today and past letters, but if I just want to confirm. So if you look at the expense ratio, excluding ad expense, in 1Q of this year, it's about [ 14.1% ], which is a little bit lower than full year levels and the -- so maybe 1 quarter might not make a trend. But the LAE ratio [ 2 ] In '23, down a little bit versus the previous couple of years levels. Just wanted to confirm whether this is kind of a structural kind of efficiency run rate? Or is there kind of a cyclicality in here that could bounce those figures around? Susan Griffith : I mean the figures have bounced around, depending on what's happening. Clearly, we're going to want to spend more. And in March, that was on an absolute basis, the highest amount we've ever spent in media. And so we're going to spend more on that as long as it's efficient. I think you want to look at the whole spectrum of what makes up the combined ratio. So we're constantly investing to push down both loss adjustment expense and non-acquisition expense. Figuring out ways with technology, with people, with processes to reduce those expenses, because we can give those back in competitive prices, and that's really important. But remember, anywhere between $0.70 to $0.75 of every dollar that goes out, comes and goes out at LAE and loss. So that segmentation piece is really important, understanding our rate to risk. And I mentioned this in the first question. And I think I don't think I talk about this enough, and you get a little glimpses of it in my letters when I talk about our different product models, be it on the private passenger auto side, commercial lines and now property.  It is really a special sauce. And it's not something that you build in a year or two. In fact, we've been building this for many decades. But about 10 years ago, we decided we needed to have continuous product model. And so we continue to do those. We started in 2014, really ramped up in 2015 and '16. So think of it as we put a couple of models out there. No state is ever more than a couple of miles behind, and we're constantly improving that segmentation. That takes a lot of investment.  So sometimes you can see the expense ratio peak up with that. But those are built in over a decade. And I talked about the product models, but I don't probably give that enough highlight because our R&D groups and our product groups are phenomenal. They're second to none. They never rest. They continue to understand segmentation, rate to risk, and that's a lot of money that goes into the combined ratio. So while expense ratios kind of can come up and down depending on media spend, et cetera. And I don't -- obviously, we're always trying to push them down. A lot of it is the indemnification understanding accuracy and having great segmentation models. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : In your 10-Q, there was a comment about rate increases having an adverse impact on retention. And then you guys highlighted that the 3-month PLE was slowed in the quarter. I'm just trying to reconcile that with your comments, Tricia, right, that rate increases are slowing in terms of both magnitude and frequency. So any color that you could just help us tie that 3-month PLE and impact comment about rate increases. To your overall comments just about the level of rate increase is slowing? Susan Griffith : Yes. Sure, Elyse. I think at this juncture in its last year so, so many customers are getting their renewal bills and the rate increases that are playing through will cause you to shop. So we're always at risk losing customers when that happens. We knew that was a possibility last year as well when we were first to market, getting the rates that we needed on the street. So while we don't know exactly what the trailing 3 will continue to be, and it's on a lagged basis, we'll obviously inform you next quarter. That's really why we feel like we're in a much better position to take those small bites and take smaller increases just to stay ahead of trend. Elyse Greenspan : And then my second question, on last quarter's call, when you guys were asked about advertising, you had pointed to it potentially being more even right through the Q1 and the Q2 and Q3 than normal. It sounds like that's still the plan given how positive you guys are in growth. But can you just give us a sense of how you expect the advertising spend cadence to be this year compared to historical? Susan Griffith : Yes, I'll start. And Pat, if you want to weigh in, you can, if there's anything to add. At this juncture with the margins that we have, we do want to use our spend levels to our advantage as long as it's efficient. So like I said, we've got a lot of other levers. We've pulled back on many non-rate actions that still have room to go on that. And I think if we can spend efficiently in the states where we believe we're adequately priced, we're going to do that, I won't' say to the full capacity, but until we feel like it's inefficient to really leverage this opportunity to maximize on growth. Pat, do you want to add anything? Patrick Callahan : No, no, I think that's great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Jimmy [ Hummer ] with JPMorgan. The next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Charles Peters : So I'd like to focus the first question on the customer relationship management organization that you called out in your letter. It feels, at times, like it's almost impossible to get timely service in so many areas compared with what we were used to pre-COVID. And so I'm wondering if you could comment on the CRM piece and the challenges you're having with the growth you're reporting and finding people and making sure they're compensated appropriately? Susan Griffith : That's a really great question. And I should have brought that up when I think about the overall -- our goal is to grow as fast as we can, which we've been doing, $19 billion, [ $2.9 billion ] comparing quarter-over-quarter and 7% PIF growth. But the caveat always if we can support and serve our customers in the way they deserve to be supported. And that's a big caveat because, there have been times in our history where we've had to slow growth because of that. So a few years ago, we found it really challenging, both from a recruiting and a retention and a compensation perspective in our CRM organization. We made some changes in compensation about 2 years ago. We've invested a lot in the work environment and the digital capacity for our customers to be able to serve themselves should they want to. And we are seeing the fruits of those investments through greater tenure and better customer service. Now we are never at rest in terms of customer service. In fact, we're just working on a new customer commitment. And we need to be, frankly, fanatical about customer service because those that could call in, either they don't want to use our digital online services, which we believe are really best-in-class. So we really need some one to talk to and they need someone to answer the phone. Our  phone handling times have been really great for both sales and service. I feel -- I mean, the world of difference than 2 years ago. So I think we've done a great job staffing, training and giving them the tools they need to help our customers in the way they deserve. And that's one of the other reasons why I feel so positive about maximizing on our growth. Charles Peters : Maybe -- in conjunction with that, my follow-up question would be one of the common areas that we're trying to figure out is how you're investing in technology, the generative AI, the large language models, et cetera. So I don't know what you're going to be willing to share with us on that front, whether what -- how much you're spending this year versus last year? Or how you're deploying these tools to make your company more efficient. But any color on technology and the emerging options that you have available to and how you're deploying in your company would be interesting? Susan Griffith : Yes, absolutely. So what I would say is we have been investing well, let me step back -- Peter Lewis used to say, we are a technology company that happens to sell insurance. So everything we do has technology built into it. We have, I believe, again, a best-in-class IT organization. With that, we're always trying to stay ahead of the trends. So think of in the direct channel, think of usage-based insurance, all those things, even though they're -- they become actually a part of the product, they start with IT and our ability to have innovative technology.  We started with machine learning and large language models probably over a decade ago, and we put a lot of those in place. So think of like we had a Chatbot that can give you documents without having a human involved. And we've continued on those and progressive.com. We've used a lot of machine learning to give you the best choice for what you need for coverage.  Right now, we have well over 100 different models in different formats. Some are tests, some are full, full bore and summer thoughts, including many in generative  AI. We did an entire several day session with our Board of Directors a few months ago on all that we're doing in AI. And I got to tell you, it's pretty exciting. And it's exciting because the efficiencies we're going to get. I can't go into a lot of the details, but we have some great models, great tests that we're doing, and we believe it's going to be a game changer really in every single aspect of our company. So think of recruiting, think of media. And in fact, we have a Board meeting this week, and we're going to go over some AI test in media that have proven to be really successful. We lean into that technology. Clearly, you always want to think about biases and you want to have responsible AI. So we have a committee that overlooks every test that we do to make sure that we're doing it responsibly.  But I think we're excited just like we have for the last nearly 90 years leaning into technology, I'm using it to benefit really competitive prices, so that our customers come and stay with us and we grow market share. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : Obviously, the subject for the quarterly letter was growth, and the company is successfully converting on that. But there are gating factors in terms of capital. And one of the areas where you're growing is in the Robinsons, and it looks like you're picking up more homeowner property exposure than you have in the past. Can you talk about your internal capital model and how much you can grow and the extent to which capital is gating factor? Could you be 10%, 15% larger tomorrow? And still have the capital to do that without earning it. Where does that stand accurate? Susan Griffith : Yes. I'll start and John Sauerland, you can weigh in. We are growing in one. But again, we want to grow across the board, so we'll continue that. Our property profile, as we talked about, we are rowing in what we would call growth states or more non-volatile states as far as weather, and we're shrinking I in the volatile state. So that's been a plan we put into place quite some time ago. A lot of this takes time. As I laid out last year, we're starting to see the over 100,000 homeowners policies in Florida start to non-renew that took a while because we needed to notify the customers and talk with the DOI.  So we believe that -- that our long-term strategy has to be -- to have our portfolio sort of across the country. So when you think about capital, you have to have regulatory capital. So think of auto having a 3 :1 model. So you need to -- if you write $1 billion, you have to have $300 million in capital. And then we have contingent capital in case something unforeseen happens, a big storm, financial crisis, and then we have capital even above that for that. And there's even more for home because it's more of a volatile product. I would say right now, we are in an incredibly comfortable capital position, which is another reason why I'm so excited about this growth. Do you want to add anything? John Sauerland : Sure. Yes. We are growing Robinsons more than the right now, and some of that requires our own home product, some of it doesn't. So in the direct channel, we sell a number of other competitors' home products. But for our own home product, as Tricia mentioned, we're growing a lot in non-volatile states, shrinking actually in volatile states. And when we look at our PML, so our probable maximum losses that's actually come down as a result of our shift. We also recently wrapped up our June 1 reinsurance renewals, and we are very comfortable with the risk we're taking there. And actually got slightly more competitive rates. So we feel great about that portion of our risk management program. And as Tricia noted, we have -- we're generating ample capital right now. We're growing a lot, certainly, at a $2.9 billion year-over-year in the first quarter. And of course, that requires significant but probably around $1 billion of regulatory capital. But we are generating that with underwriting margins to some degree as well year-to-date on investment returns. So we feel very comfortable with our capital level and our ability to grow as fast as we can, again, hitting those margins. Joshua Shanker : Thank you for all the detail. And one quick question. With the Florida policies that you're not renewing to the Loggerhead company, is that going to be significant enough that we should expect your attritional loss ratios to be higher at the end of this year, although when the added benefit of lower capacity volatility is added, they'll be lower, but on an attritional basis, will they rise? Susan Griffith : I couldn't really answer. I mean a lot, obviously, the first thing is first, we wanted to get off some units that we believe will not be profitable. And a lot of it, of course, from a loss perspective, depends on weather, which has really been the clincher for the last several years. And so that's why we're trying to make sure that we're just more balanced. We are still very large in Florida because we have a large auto base and we believe that we can win in Florida on both the home and auto and especially bundled, but we just need -- we were just a little bit too heavy there in addition to a couple of other states, which makes sense because ASI now Progressive Home was based and kind of grew in that area. But it's hard to think about loss ratios when I don't have sort of the crystal ball of what will happen with weather. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Michael Phillips : Speaking of Florida, you mentioned some favorable frequency trends in the state and your auto book because of the total refunds. Can you share any thoughts on what you've seen on the property side because of that? Susan Griffith : Property side. No, we haven't seen much. Those were mostly on the auto side. [indiscernible] There's a little bit on the property, have you seen much, Pat? Patrick Callahan : It's too early to tell on the property side, right? We've got different statute of limitations. We've got different kind of assignment of benefits that will play through the book over time, but not as immediate as we're seeing on the auto book. Michael Phillips : Okay. And then you mentioned the policy life expectation has been improving month to month to month. I guess given all the dynamics in auto, maybe what's behind that? And is that harder for you to get your hands around and predict when shopping at such a high level? Susan Griffith : Well, we know those shopping happens when rates go up. And I think it's a little bit different, I think, depending on the demographic if you -- when you read through the 10-Q, [ Sam's ] are much more likely to be shop sensitive because they're price  sensitive. And so it's very different. When you kind of peel back the onion, you look at our different demographics as well. But we -- like I said in the last couple of calls, last year, we had seen inflationary factors like that. And so I'm not surprised that there's been a lot more shopping. And that's why the key is to get out ahead of the rate. It's short-term pain for long-term growth, and that's exactly what we did and why we're sitting in this position.  So we're going to continue to have -- try to have stable rates. Just stay ahead of the severity trends and go from there. And I think when customers see that and then they are able to also, like I said, have great claims service, have a great service from our CRM. We want to give a reason to stay. And all the products that they can have from Progressive. Operator : Next question comes from the line of David Motemaden Evercore. David Motemaden : Tricia, you had mentioned ad spend was up in March, and it was the highest amount we've ever seen or you've ever seen, but the apps were flat. So it feels like -- I know there's some lag there, but I'm sure that some of the non-rate actions are limiting conversion. Is there any way to size how much of the country still had non-rate actions in place today versus 3 months ago? And how you're thinking about rolling those back throughout the rest of the year? Susan Griffith : Yes, David, that's a great question. And one of the other things you have to compare is our extraordinary growth in quarter 1 in 2023. So that comparison is really off because we were growing a lot. We really didn't want to be a growing as much because we didn't have the margin that we wanted. But that comparison is going to be hard as well. So that's the first factor.  We have pulled back our -- and there's a lot of levers of non-rate actions. So there's build plans, there's proof of garaging, there's a bunch of different sort of pre binding things that we do. So there's several different ones. Some we pulled back more quickly and fully. There are some states where we haven't pulled back hardly at all because we don't have the rate that we need yet. But we're working on that pretty diligently. From a percentage wise, I would say we're -- what would you say, Pat, 60% or 70%? Patrick Callahan : Yes. I would say, as you broke it down, on the bill plan side, we are getting close back to pre pullback. And on the verification side, it really depends at the state level, right? We still have about 20% of our states where we have media off, which is a good indication that if we have media off, we probably still have significant non-rate actions or verification in place. But we have lots of, I would say, room to run as we unwind those across both channels throughout the remainder of the year. Susan Griffith : Yes. And I feel like just even in the last couple of weeks or during the month of March, I feel like in some of the places where we've needed rate, we're starting to have some much more productive conversations. Patrick Callahan : Yes. I would agree. On the regulatory side, there's certainly -- we've had a couple of recent approvals, and we're getting more comfortable more of our calendar year premium earned in that margins continue to be we expect them to be on -- in more and more of our states. So that gives our general managers and product managers greater confidence that they should open up and write more volume because we think we're priced adequately. Susan Griffith : Thanks, David. David Motemaden : No, great. That's really helpful. That's encouraging to hear. And then for my follow-up question, it was good to see that Robinsons new apps up almost double digits in the first quarter. It sounded like conversion also increased on Robinsons in the agency channel. Could you maybe just talk about how you're attracting the Robinsons and how you're achieving this increased conversion and whether you're seeing any improvement on the retention of Robinsons as well? Susan Griffith : Yes. I think it's different if you're thinking about it from the agency's channel versus the direct channel on the agency channel. We continue to have our preferred agents, our platinum agents and no, we want the bundle, and they can be compensated for that. And so that is a big part of the agency channel. On the direct channel. We have our HomeQuote Explorer, where we saw Progressive Home, and I know they've been working diligently with some really great unaffiliated partners to be able to place that coverage even if it is not with Progressive Home. And we're continuing to work on having a stable group of companies in that mix. We -- last quarter, we went through sort of how we think about evolving with what we write on our paper and not on our paper. And we think that's good for customers to be able to have an [ album ] when they come in. So that's proven to be something that we're working diligently on, and we'll continue to work on, especially as the market, I think it's more stable. And I think the Robinsons now they come to us. I remember, years ago, John, you might remember, I remember John standing up here at an IR call and saying that, we want to be the company that when they call, they say, do you have this, we say Yes, we do. And so we're getting closer and closer to being not just a destination insurer but a destination company. So when you come and you -- or you're a Robinson, you're going to want auto home, but you're going to possibly want umbrella. You're going to want some other things. And so each added product increases retention. We don't share those. But if you look at our overall retention of the Robinsons versus the other segments, it's much higher. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jimmy Hummer (sic) [ Bhullar ] with JPMorgan. Jamminder Bhullar : So first, I had a question just on the expense ratio. Should we assume that given how much premiums have gone up the last few years, that your expense ratio should be -- especially the non-acquisition or the sort of nondiscretionary expenses should be structurally lower for the next several years? And if that is the case, then would you let that fall to the bottom line and assume a lower combined ratio going forward? Or should we assume the deal use it to be more competitive on pricing and it will show up in the form of better growth potentially? Or gets competed away? Susan Griffith : Yes. Good question, Jimmy. Probably a little bit of both. So I think we'll try to continue to push expenses and we need to be efficient. And we don't necessarily though, need to be the lowest cost. We want to have low cost because that equates to competitive prices and that equates to growth. And that growth, of course, is a great cycle because that unit growth is important, especially as you've seen in the past years when severity trends go up and down because those can be less stable than having a unit growth. But yes, I think we're going to spend where we can to maximize on this growth. We're going to continue to think about expenses and utilize the investments that we make across the board to become more efficient. But a lot of it, too, and the reason we're able to do this is because of the investments we've made over the many years on technology, on people, on processes, on just our overall people and culture to be there. So I would expect that we'll be able to do a little bit of both. John Sauerland : I'd just add that we have continued to make progress on our non-acquisition expense ratio, and we've been doing so over at least the past decade. So, structurally, as you say, as we increase average premium, not only the efficiencies we plow into our business, but the denominator is a tailwind for sure. But we will always price that 96 combined ratio at the company level. So to the extent we get efficiencies, we're going to pay that back into growth and target the same margin over time. Jamminder Bhullar : And then maybe if you could talk about the competitive environment and just competitor behavior. Overall, it seems like almost every company is still in the process of repricing its book, but I'm assuming that trends vary by state. And there are a few states where several other companies beside you are at adequate margins. So are you seeing price competition pick up in those markets? And are companies being disciplined overall? Or are you even seeing some companies maybe be a little bit too loose in terms of pricing and underwriting in areas where the loss trends have been good and states were early in allowing companies to raise prices? Susan Griffith : It's hard to say what other companies are doing. I can say that we still feel like it's a hard market. And we feel like we got ahead of the curve as far as pricing. We're seeing that with our growth, and I hope to continue to see that. I think if you follow, which I'm sure you do, the competition, margins look good. And so I think everyone saw what we saw in terms of trends and reacted. Again, you have a certain period of time where if you react more quickly, you have an advantage, and that advantage sort of begets growth and sort of is like -- I feel like at this juncture, last year when I talked about it in November about starting to think about pulling back some non-rate actions and doing some things as like we kind of put our toe in the water and everybody else wasn't quite there. We then -- we put our whole foot and we set the edge of the pool, and now we're diving in.  So I think we feel really great about our ability to grow. People will catch up. That's this industry. It's an ebb and flow of soft markets, hard markets, and it's just about getting out ahead of it. And again, I can't stress enough how much segmentation and our ability to match rate to risk matters. And to not ever rust and say, okay, we've got whatever, [ 8.8, 5.04 ]. We were very creative in our model naming. But the bottom line is, is constant, and we don't put one in and say, okay, we'll wait for 10 years and see how that works. And they -- and the interactions with our different variables with each other are so important. So that's a big piece of it as well. So it's about having the right [ rate ] on the street, of course, that's table stakes. So it's also about having product models where you really understand the ultimate loss costs. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Meyer Sheilds with KBW. Meyer Shields : Great. When we look at year-over-year policy count growth in personal lines, we saw a pickup in direct, but modest sequential slowdown in agency. And I was hoping you could -- sorry, in March, I was hoping you could translate what actually is going on like why we're seeing that sort of different trends? Susan Griffith : Yes. I think if you -- I think agency in March was more flat. I think you'll see that a little bit -- it will be a little bit more delayed than direct, where we have more access to put on the media spend, whereas I think agents -- it's just a different model. Pat, you can add one of that. But if I recall, March started to be a little bit -- the trend started to return a little bit in agency. Patrick Callahan : Yes. So we've been slower to open things back up in the agency channel and specifically things like returning rates on comparative raters across the board, which, thus, put our rate in a more competitive position and potentially drive more growth. But know that we are leaning into that at this point. And as we're more confident in our rate adequacy we are opening up some of those non-rate actions in the agency channel. We have fewer top-of-funnel levers in the agency channel. It's more mid-funnel. So you will see that delayed effect when, media, we can fill the top of the funnel on the direct channel much more responsibly and quickly when we decide we're rate adequate. Meyer Shields : Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. And to response your comments earlier, would it make sense to have more 6-month policies in commercial lines? Susan Griffith : We've talked about that for years. And I think what I would say it's very dependent on the BMT. When you go in to get a quote and ultimately convert, there are some business marketing tiers that are really complex and time-consuming. And you're gathering information, and it's not an easy process. You don't want to do that every 6 months. So with those, you just have to be priced right and have the ability to do things like debits and credits. To get things right more quickly.  We have [indiscernible] and we had a lot in the past. And we continue to think about that. I know Karen and your team are thinking about that in some of the BMTs that could be more flexible. That said, I'm super excited, and I'm glad you brought up commercial. I'm super excited to talk about commercial. I feel like we're in a great position. We still have 10 points to earn in, the rest of this calendar year. Again, the key was getting out in front of it, and it's especially important because of those 12-month policies. But one of the things that we did many, many years ago, and I think this might have been the first IR call or maybe in the first year or so after I took over. When team and I develop -- we hadn't developed the horizon concept that came from McKinsey, but we developed how we were going to think about growing the company. And on commercial lines is a big part of that. They were already in Horizon 1 with commercial lodging the #1 writer. But in Horizon 2, we wanted to do is really understand adjacent products that we could develop. And they really mostly within the Commercial Lines organization. So if you think of small fleets, that has tripled business over the last 5 years. You saw that we're now in Florida, we have BOP in 45 states. The new product [ files ] I've been talking about on the private passenger, auto side or also on the commercial side. And our business model contractor, right now, just recently in the last several weeks, we've seeing new app volume have new all-time highs. And as importantly, the take rate for ProView, which is the usage-based insurance, I think snapshot for the business auto contractor customers has doubled. So really excited about the growth and the different levers because of such a variety of types of products in the Commercial line organization. And what we'll do is we'll look at those and see, is there an opportunity to have more on 6 months, what does that mean to your retention? What does that mean to conversion, et cetera. So we'll test some of those things likely in the next year or so. But I am excited. And even when you think about FHT, we've been talking a lot about macroeconomic trends. When you go back pre-pandemic. And then of course, we were set. We knew that market really well. We leveraged and capitalized on the fact that the trucking industry exploded because people were moving goods across the country, spot rates were high. And now that we're sort of a little bit back to normal. What we're seeing is when we look at Federal Motor Carrier authorizations, we -- they're off a certain amount, we're actually up higher than that on new business with FHT. So I'm going to -- it's hard to not compare the pandemic and subsequently what happened. But what we're really trying to look at is how does growth compare to 2019? And what I would say with FHT, the For Hire Transportation, it looks good. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi. Michael Ward : I was wondering about Telematics. We noticed adoption was down, I think, 20% in agency. I think you said because of the mix of agencies, just hoping you could help us understand why that is? Is Telematics more specific to certain customer segmentations or geographies? Maybe Robinson just aren't as bigger adopters of it. Susan Griffith : Yes. Mark, that was mostly a couple of big national account agencies. That started happening maybe around mid-2023. So nothing much to read into. We're still really excited. In fact, take rate and agency really has peaked up since prepandemic. And so we continue to believe that's a big part of our model. We have 57 billion miles driven. So we have a lot of data, 7 billion trips. So we continue to have that be a big part of it. And we're constantly talking to agents about the importance of that to get those great drivers, great discounts. Michael Ward : Okay. And then maybe just on recent loss experience. We've seen accident frequency ticked down high single digits into last 2 consecutive quarters. Just wondering if you could share your view on maybe what's driving that? Is it mix? And I guess or mild winter? And what are you seeing more recently? Susan Griffith : Yes, that's good. And those are 2 of the variables for sure. So the mile-to-mile quarter helped our mix of business, our sort of self-imposed underwriting actions. And actually, we have seen a tailwind from [ House billing 37 ]. So those would probably be 4 of the contributing factors. What I would look at instead of focusing on the quarter, that would be, I would look at the trailing 12 over prior frequency because those were some factors in this quarter for sure. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : Just following up on the frequency questions. I'm just curious, do you think changes in all terms and conditions or customers maybe raising deductibles or anything is causing the benefit of frequency right now. I think we've seen that in prior kind of cycles like we're in right now? Susan Griffith : It's so hard to discern that. We've been playing around and there could be -- and maybe Mark brought it up a little bit. There could be a little bit of regional differences in terms of frequencies no fault state versus none. It's hard to really pinpoint that. We're going to continue to work on that. But it really is hard to pinpoint those exact things from frequency. So really, what I said before, what we're seeing at least in that first quarter is really our self-imposed underwriting restrictions, some mix difference, which makes sense and then some weather and some changes from the Florida House bill. Those are the parts that we can better quantify. Brian Meredith : Right. So you're not pricing for it basically? Susan Griffith : We look at it and we price for frequency and severity, but we can't predict frequency. We know when we see it. Brian Meredith : Great. And then my second question, just curious, getting into the smart commercial business, obviously, the homeowners. Can you talk a little bit, do you have or are you thinking about E&S capabilities? And would that be an area into and we get more from the full package business and you have it in the other side? Susan Griffith : I'm really sorry, but you broke out completely there. We didn't understand the question. Brian Meredith : Sorry, can you hear me now? Susan Griffith : Yes, perfect. Brian Meredith : I was asking more about E&S capabilities in maybe homeowners or commercial or plans to have some of those excess and surplus line capabilities. just given the regulatory and risk landscape out there? Susan Griffith : Yes, those are things to think about all the time we have. We actually utilize the E&S capabilities in some venues in commercial already. And we always look at kind of the best way to understand if we can't get the rate we need in the admitted market, and we have an opportunity and an ability to do that should that arise. Operator : The next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Wanted to start with a couple of mix shifts and the potential impact, if we can. And then maybe we start with the Robinsons. Would the  greater weighting of Robinsons ultimately also lead to greater exposure in bodily injury, where I think severity trends remain a bit higher? And if so, how do you address that or price for that keep the profit targets in line with where you want them to be? Susan Griffith : Yes. We priced like John was saying, every customer, every state or channel to a lifetime 96 knowing that the limit difference different if you're a preferred if you're going to have higher limits. So we price for that and are very clear on -- and reserved for that. And so that's sort of our secret sauce as well. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then if we switch to commercial. So historically, if I look at Progressive, I think the company has been able to avoid a lot of the severity pressures that have been that the industry has seen in commercial auto. And I think a lot of that has to do, obviously, with your underwriting and segmentation, but also because you had a small trucking orientation. But now that post the protective acquisition and with the growth in the TNC business, do you see this, I guess, severity trends different in the overall commercial auto book than they had been in the past? And how are you managing those? Susan Griffith : I mean commercial is very much -- I mean all of our businesses state-by-state, but commercial has a few states that are much more volatile, and we have to price for those or like Karen's doing now and actually Pat on the PL side is a lot of business restrictions until we can get the prices we need and non-rate actions. But I think, like I said, when I was outlining the variety of BMTs, they react very differently and exposure very differently, and we treat them differently in terms of the segmentation perspective. You mentioned TNC. We needed a huge increase with one of our partners there, and we're able to get that. So our comfort level of success in the TNC organizations is very high now. We feel good about that.  But yes, the exposure is different. You just have to stay on top of it from a pricing perspective and from a claims perspective. Douglas Constantine : Those in the queue appear to be those who've already asked questions. So that concludes our event.  Those left in the queue can direct your questions directly to me via e-mail or my direct phone line. Tia, I will hand the call back over to you for closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation's First Quarter Investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year.",

These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first and second quarters of 2024. We will see discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I am pleased to introduce our Personal Lines President, Pat Callahan, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Pat? Pat Callahan : Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Pat Callahan, Personal Lines, President, and I'm pleased to introduce the topic of today's presentation, direct acquisition. Our vision is to become consumers, agents and business owners, number one destination for insurance and other financial needs. To achieve that vision, we strive to be available where, when and how consumers want to shop for their insurance and to optimize our experiences to meet the needs of individual consumers. A foundational element of this optimization is to understand the differences between our agency and direct channel customers. Agency customers often choose that channel, because they value the professional local counsel, ease of shopping, breadth and depth of product and carrier options available through independent agents. These customers often have more complex insurance needs. And as such, the expertise provided by an agent coupled with the personal relationship agents build with their customers gives the customer peace of mind. The direct channel customer frequently places higher value on the convenience and ease of access afforded through self-service 24/7 shopping and servicing. They often have less complex needs and feel comfortable making insurance decisions after educating themselves through the tools that we provide online, supplemented by the knowledge of our trained and licensed direct consultants. The customers, segmentation and economics of these two auto insurance distribution channels are fundamentally different, which is why we've developed, deployed and optimized distinct personal auto products for each channel. The result of these distinct products is not necessarily higher or lower rates in one channel versus the other, as we target similar combined ratios. But instead, delivers products that better aligns our rates with the different indemnity and expense characteristics of each channel. There are three primary distribution channels for U.S. auto insurance; captive agents, independent agents, and direct-to-consumer. We write through both independent agents where we're the market share leader and through direct where we're the number two writer, enjoying over 25% and growing market share. The independent agency and direct channels make up the majority of the U.S. personal auto insurance market and continue to grow faster than the captive market. The current hard market has distorted some long-term channel trends as certain large competitors in these channels either shrink significantly or grow rapidly amid large underwriting losses. These dynamics have presented an opportunity for us as prospects have been released to the market and rate increases from less well segmented carriers have driven competitors to be adversely selected. On the right side of the screen, you'll note just how critical our dual-channel strategy has been to achieving our continued market share growth. But today, we're going to spend time focusing on what drives our success in the direct channel. Insurance is a trust-based business and we build that trust and take share from competitors within the direct channel through the strength of our brand, the power of our segmentation, the breadth of our media presence, and the experiences we deliver to our customers. Our presentation will focus on two aspects of the direct channel; media and customer experience. We think about direct customer acquisition has a funnel with a virtuous cycle, similar to what we've previously shared from a product segmentation perspective. Media sits at the top of this funnel, where our online presence and award-winning advertising is deployed and optimized by our world-class in-house media team. Our advertising delivers billions of impressions every year, which in turn bring more than 100 million visitors to progressive.com annually. The experience on progressive.com turns those initial touches into tens of millions of quotes and ultimately, millions of sales annually. As we put more prospects through our funnel, we obtained the data to optimize the experience which in turn improves the media economics at the top of the funnel, which again, leads to further optimization. Our scale means this cycle is difficult for competitors to replicate, which has helped to continue to feed our market share growth. Today, our direct media business leader, Jay VanAntwerp, a 20-year progressive employee will provide insights on how we optimize our media spend and why investors should feel confident that when we invest a dollar in media, it's a dollar well spent. After Jay, Dave Krew, our acquisition experience business leader will join us. Dave has led our acquisition experience team for 12 of his 34-year progressive tenure. He will walk us through how progressive.com has evolved from a basic Web 1.0 site back in the 1990s to become the number one ranked insurance website today. And, how his team enables us to continue to increase the complexity of our rating and our products, while simultaneously improving yield through our acquisition funnel. Thanks again for joining us today, and I will now hand it over to Jay. Jay? Jay VanAntwerp : Thanks Pat. Today, I want to begin by talking about our Media Group and why we believe it is a competitive advantage for Progressive that would be incredibly challenging for our competitors to replicate in the near to medium terms. One of the distinct things about Progressive is that we buy almost all of our media using an in-house team. The media channels we buy include mass media like TV and radio, programmatic display, paid social media, direct mail and paid search. Virtually any type of advertising or demand generation that is purchased, our media team buys. We believe that this makes us unique, not just in the insurance industry, but advertising industry overall. This is not a new development. The decision to buy media in-house was made almost at the very beginning of our efforts in the direct channel in the mid-1990s. At that time, our demand generation efforts were focused on television and direct mail. But since then, our Media Group has evolved with the media landscape. As digital channels like programmatic display and paid social media have become more prominent, our media team has given appropriate focus to those areas. And using Progressive's risk learn, grow philosophy, we develop viewpoints on how to buy those media types efficiently. So our current capabilities are the result of an evolution of over three decades. Given how long we have been doing this and how ingrained the Media Group is within the company, it would be very challenging to assemble a team from scratch that would be able to efficiently deploy spend in all media channels and at our current scale. What are some of the advantages that having an in-house team gives us? Our focus relative to an external agency is very important. We focus on one brand and one small set of products. This allows for a level specialization that an external agency would be challenged to match. We are able to leverage one of Progressive's core strengths, which is analytics. Progressive has a very strong history and track record of analytical innovation. We draw on those capabilities and building our analytical team. Another advantage our in-house team has over an external agency is product knowledge. Our analysts typically come from other areas of the company. They understand our product. They understand the dynamics of the auto insurance market. They're able to bring the insurance context to how they look at media in a way that no external agency would be able to replicate. If you combine the focus with the analytics, the result is custom models built specifically for Progressive using first-party data we would never make available to an external third-party. All of our models are proprietary, using our data to evaluate only our brand and the products that we sell as opposed to a one-size-fits-all model for multiple clients that you might get using an external agency. This has been incredibly impactful. We have leveraged our analytical horsepower and first-party data to dig into all of our spend and determine the relative efficiency and lifetime value of all the different media channels. This then gives us a guide for the optimal places to spend more when adding budget and when reducing the budget, so we can optimize for Progressive specific needs. Progressive is a leader in segmentation for auto insurance pricing, it is similarly powerful when we bring these skills to how we buy media. Another advantage is the ability to quickly flex the budget. Our budget is flexible within controls, which I will talk about later in the presentation. We are willing to increase the budget if there is efficient opportunity and available margin within our calendar year 1996 combined ratio target to fund the additional spend. Also, if there is a need to reduce the expense ratio in order to hit our target 1996, we can do that quickly as well. Our analytics show us how to optimize sales, both when adding and when cutting. Furthermore, we are able to flex our budget up and down extremely quickly. Another advantage is that we have aligned incentives. Like other progressive employees, our media teams on our gainshare annual bonus program. So they benefit from the success of Progressive in a way that a media agency that is compensated on commission wouldn't. A media agency is primarily incented to encourage clients to spend more on media in order to increase commissions. Our media team is focused on the core strategies of Progressive, primarily profitable growth. We also have lower overhead costs than an equivalent program that relies on external media agencies. So not only are we buying the media smarter, but we are also doing it at a lower cost. A 5% commission on $2 billion in spend which is about what we spent at our peak in 2020 would be $100 million. Our team is less than 100 people with total annual cost for this team this team considerably lower than $100 million. Finally, and really cannot be overstated. Our team has very strong relationships with in Progressive that no external agency would be able to develop. While we work closely with our marketing team in the way most agencies would. We also work directly with state product managers and general managers as well as many other areas of the business. We also have a very firm understanding of the business that allows us to credibly show how what we do in the Media Group benefits Progressive. As I talk more about some of the accomplishments of the last decade, I think it would be unlikely that an outside agency would have been able to make the case to be as aggressive as we were leading up to our peak spend in 2020 and could an outside agency move as quickly to make cuts as we did in 2023. To summarize, we feel that our Media Group and the capabilities that we have built over 30 years have contributed greatly to Progressive success. I will talk specifically about the last decade and how we have been able to support Progressive's goal of growing as fast as possible at or below a '96. Before talking about progressive specific spend over the last decade, it is worth providing context about insurance industry ad spend over the last 30 years because it has shifted significantly over time. Progressive Direct and other directors became more aggressive in the mid-1990s, with the emergence of the direct-to-consumer business model for auto insurance. Which spurred strong growth in insurance and advertising spend. From 1996 to 2003, and there was 10% compound annual growth in Media spend. This is a high rate of growth, and yet that rate of growth increased about 50% from 2003 to 2011, with the compound annual growth rate rising to 15%. Between 2011 and 2017, industry ad spend slowed to only 2%, largely driven by agency distributed companies whose economic models didn't allow them to keep pace with the direct-to-consumer companies who continue to have double-digit growth rates during this time period. Starting in 2017, growth in advertising ramped up again from 2017 to 2021, the industry compound annual growth increased five times from the previous period to 10%. We will talk about some of the dynamics happening at that time that may have spurred the next round of growth. But there is a strong argument to be made that Progressive was the catalyst as we started spending more at this time and competitors followed suit. As we know, overall industry profitability issues in 2022 and 2023 led to a contraction in ad spend as the compound annual growth rate for those two years was negative 20%. That was the overall industry landscape. Now, let's talk about Progressive specifically. Prior to 2017, Progressive's media spend was under $700 million and we are consistently around 10% of total industry spend. In 2015 and 2016, we really hit our stride in using analytics to generate insights for how to buy media more efficiently. We were able to come up with a common metric between all media types that allowed us to better evaluate where our spend was efficient and where it wasn't. Also during this time, we were coming out of a hard market. Similar to today, we reacted in advance of the industry and aggressively raised rates, such that our loss ratios were trending below our '96 combined ratio target. As such, we had available margin to fund a higher level of spend as a percentage of premium, while keeping our combined ratio below '96. Starting in 2017 and continuing for the next three years, we were able to operationalize the advances in media efficiency, which allowed us to spend significantly more while still maintaining our target economics with the increased spend funded by available margin. We went from $650 million in spend in 2016 to almost $2 billion in 2020, a tripling in just four years. You will remember from earlier slides, that during that four-year period, there was also an increase in industry spend, which I hypothesized was spurred by our increase in spend. When we started to spend more, competitors noticed and also began spending more. This resulted in that period of growth from 2017 to 2021 for the industry. While our competitors did spend more during that time, we increased our media spend much faster than the industry. Resulting in an increase in our percentage of total industry spend from 11% in 2016 to 20% in 2020. To summarize, we tripled our spend in four years and almost doubled our share of the industry spend. When our losses are higher than target, we look to cut expenses with the goal of meeting our '96 combined ratio target until we have adequate rate. One of the largest and most flexible ways we can control our combined ratio is through the media budget. As severity trends rapidly steepened starting in 2021. We cut the Progressive media budget three years in a row from 2021 through 2023. Prior to this period, going back 30 years, we had never cut the budget two years in a row. So this was an unprecedented time as was the increasing size of the cuts. We went from almost $2 billion of media spend in 2020 to about $1.3 billion in 2023. These cuts happened at a time when the overall industry was cutting as well. So even with the significant cuts, the statutory data shows that we were the biggest vendor in industry in 2022 and 2023. And our share of the overall spend within the industry was almost flat. Going from 20% of spend in 2020 to 19% in 2023. All of these dynamics would have been impossible to manage without the capabilities of our in-house team. Our insights, analytics and relationships with the business allowed us to make the case for the increase in spend up to 2020 and then quickly cut significant amounts particularly in 2023 to support the overall company goal of hitting a '96. I've talked about the efficiency of our spend, but have not necessarily defined what that means. We do have a number of controls on our spend. The primary one is that our cost per sale has to be at or below our target acquisition cost. If that is the case, then we would say that the spend is beneficial. Cost per sale is our total acquisition costs divided by direct sales. Tamini is the largest part of our total acquisition costs. Other costs include the expenses related to running our call centers, development of our creative, maintaining and improving our online quote experience, the compensation of our marketing and media groups, among other things. Targeted acquisition cost is how much we charge customers for acquisition expenses over the life of their policy plus margin adequacy. It's the amount we price into the policy for acquisition. This amount is adjusted up or down based on where our margin is relative to targets. We need to make sure that the sales we are bringing in are at or below the acquisition expenses we price into our policies. That's the primary control in our spend, but there are others. Another constraint is that the direct auto lifetime combined ratio has to be at or below 96, meaning we have to be confident that that the new business we are writing in a state is going to meet our profitability target over the life of the policy. As we talked about in our second quarter 2023 Investor Relations call, direct channel policy acquisition costs are expensed in the first term of the policy and every subsequent term of the policy is collecting the premium necessary to cover the initial acquisition expense. If the acquisition expense is too high, such that the premium collected over the average lifetime does not cover initial acquisition expense, indemnity expense and other expenses, we shouldn't be spending money to acquire those policies. We need to be able to service our customers well. This is primarily for claims. There are times when the growth in the state is greater than our claims staffing can keep up with. So we will turn media off in order to slow demand and allow our staffing to catch up. Another constraint is our focus on achieving an aggregate company-wide calendar year combined ratio at or below a 96. We will not spend additional media dollars if our calendar year 96 target is under threat. Even if there may be opportunities for efficient media spend. And the final control on our spend is an efficient incremental cost per sale. That is a relatively new constraint. Incremental cost per sale is our measure of whether our spend is bringing in a quote or a sale that is over and above the ambient shopping rate. We are able to are able to measure that at a pretty granular level. And we are able to use that metric to evaluate efficiency within a channel as well as between channels. This chart shows the relativity of actual cost per sale versus the target acquisition cost. We want this metric to be at or below zero. At zero, it would mean that our actual acquisition cost is equal to our target acquisition cost. You can see that even during the run-up in spend from 2016 to 2020, that we kept cost per sale below the target in some years by as much as 15%. Even as we deployed three times the level of spend, we brought in enough sales to hit our target economics and for that extra spend to be completely paid for with the premium that was generated. 2023 was certainly an outlier given the size of the cuts. When we cut spend, we cut the least efficient areas first. After the cuts in 2023, we were left with only the most efficient spend as well as a relatively high level of ambient shopping due to the hard market. So cost per sale was significantly below the target acquisition cost in 2023. Even with a significant rise in spend 2024, the ratio has increased, but is still well below our targets. This means that so far in 2024, we are adding policies very efficiently. And this is true for two reasons. First, year-to-date, many of our competitors have remained at depressed levels of media spend. This means that we are able to get a large amount of media impressions for less. Additionally, when those impressions turn into quotes, we're converting them at a good pace, suggesting cost competitiveness. Another view of efficiency is to look at the upfront acquisition expenses as a percentage of the lifetime earned premium that is expected from the sales. From 2016 to 2020, our acquisition expenses as a percentage of premium went up, but stayed in the 7% to 7.5% range. As with the cost per sale versus target acquisition cost, this metric did fall as we made cuts in 2023 and is up in in 2024 as we've increased spend. Again, this suggests that 2024, even as we have significantly increased our media spend, we're still bringing in prospects at very high efficiency. We have shown cost per sale versus target acquisition cost in order to illustrate that even with the run-up in spend, we hit our target economics. This chart illustrates the benefit that we got from increased spend a little more clearly. This chart shows an index of media spend anchored to 2015 as a 1.0 on the horizontal axis and an index of direct auto sales anchored to 2015 on the vertical axis. Each dot represents a different year.You can see that even with the increase in spend, we were able to increase sales commensurately. As with the other charts, 2023 is an outlier. In previous calls, we were often asked about ambient shopping and how we gauge it. The 2023 number is a clear indication of the elevated amount of ambient shopping last year. Despite spending below 2019 levels, we sold more direct new policies than in any year in our history. This is because rates were rising across the industry, prompting customers to shop at and eventually purchase from Progressive. We have talked about how the budget cuts were a key tactic in helping Progressive hit the 1996 [ph] combined ratio in 2023. This chart shows acquisition expenses as a percentage of direct auto earned premium. You can see the increase in acquisition expense as a percentage of earned premium going from under 9% in in 2016 to almost 13% 2020. I had mentioned before that one of the keys to our ability to increase the spend the way that we did was available margin to be able to pay for the extra spend, while still hitting profit targets. As we reduce spend starting in 2021, the acquisition expense ratio dropped from 13% to just over 6% in 2023. This cut reduced the company-wide combined ratio by about 2.8 points in 2023 and was a big factor in our ability to exceed our 1996 calendar year target. Year-to-date 2024 we have increased spend, so now our acquisition expense ratio is back to about 10%. Note that the 2024 ratio on the chart is a year-to-date number. The first quarter acquisition expense ratio was below that of the second quarter. As margins continue to be strong, we will look for opportunities to grow the business as much as possible. While we only get statutory spend data annually, we do have some ways to gauge Progressive spend in relation to the rest of the industry during the year. There are a number of third-parties that provide a measure of what individual competitors are spending in select media channels. This chart shows an index created using iSpot data as a proxy for year-to-date TV spend and SensorTower's Pathmatics data as a proxy for year-to-date programmatic display and paid social media spend. We have set the Progressive spend at a 1.0 index and show the next four largest spenders in the insurance industry. You can see that based on this data, Progressive Media spending is considerably higher than others. Though this is only a partial picture of all the advertising done in the industry, it does provide a useful data point suggesting Progressive is outspending competitors by a significant margin. That increased spend is paying off as we are delivering the necessary sales to pay for that spend. This chart of spend versus sales is the same as the one I just showed, but each dot represents only the first half of year. You can see that 2024 is above the historic trend line with record spend and record sales. This chart suggests we are getting a strong return on our media spend to date. In conclusion, Progressive's in-house media team is a unique competitive advantage that has driven significant value for Progressive since the inception of the direct business. In the last decade, the media team has been instrumental in increasing media spend efficiently, which has resulted in greater market share. This team also plays a huge role in managing to our 1996 combined ratio through expense management and cutting spend to support the goal of a company-wide 1996 combined ratio. Today, the team is laser focused on profitable growth and is deploying record spend amounts in the first half of 2024, and this has produced the largest first half direct sales volume in our history. While we focus on the relationship between sales and media spend as a measure of efficiency, it is important to point out that many other areas of the company work in conjunction with our media team to deliver sales. Everything from the award-winning creative produced by our marketing team to industry-leading product and pricing make our jobs easier. Another key area is the team that received the online and we generate at the top of the funnel and converts it into quotes and sales. That team is the direct acquisition experience team, which has ownership of progressive.com and the online quote funnel. In the same way that the media team has evolved over decades, the acquisition experience team has been a competitive advantage for Progressive since we sold our first policy online over 25 years ago. My colleague, Dave Krew, leads that group and is going to speak to their part in the funnel. Dave? Dave Krew : Thanks, Jay. Once Jay and his team get prospects to engage with Progressive, the direct acquisition experience team works to turn digital touches into productive experiences for the consumer and then profit for Progressive. My team is focused on progressive.com and our personal lines auto and recreation aligns direct sales funnels. There are parallel roles that focus on property and commercial lines applying similar concepts. Our goal is to deliver incremental lifetime underwriting profit each year by optimizing our digital experiences and periodically delivering breakthrough step functions in the evolving digital education, quote and purchase process. The term lifetime underwriting profit or LUP for short refers to the sum of expected profit dollars generated from the incremental sales we produce. I'll touch more on why that's important later. To do what we do requires very close collaboration with adjacent organizations; IT, product, CRM and marketing in particular. It also requires a diverse set of subject matter experts on our central team. We work to connect the dots between deep insurance knowledge, the digital agency mindset, data analytics, data science and process management. Another way to say this is a real balance of right and left brain disciplines come together. And in my opinion, that's where the value has had. Like the media team, we've been at this for several decades. Let's start with the origin story. There have been a number of digital first in our history. We are online in 1995 and started quoting and selling online soon thereafter. We started planning for scale, had segmented operational data and tracked results all before the turn of the century and 15-plus years prior to the coining of the term insurtech. Taking the time line a bit further and deeper, as I said, we were online in 1995. We first showed comparison rates online in 1996, sold our first fully digital auto policy in 1997 and expanded our online footprint from auto to recreational lines in 1999. As we grew, we set out to innovate in the user experience space with several end market innovations, such as Name Your Price. We also invested in our mobile quoting capabilities. Starting in 2017, we began to leverage advanced technologies to personalized user experience and increased funnel throughput. We also continued investing in other value-adding educational content and a chatbot. Which leads us to today selling millions of policies untouched by human hands each year plus a substantial number of digital-assisted sales that quote online and purchase over the phone. While over half of those digital sales happen on mobile devices. Here's a look at today's digital funnel. There are over 100 million visits to progressive.com annually. These leads to tens of millions of quote starts and ultimately, millions of digital sales. The screen shots on the right of the slide are representative way points as a prospect navigates from our homepage into an auto quote in this case, and ultimately a purchase. A 1% movement in throughput generally contributes sales lift that equates to tens of millions profit dollars. To that end, we invest significant talent and resources in the user experience, technology and optimization. These incremental sales are high margin given the media team already got the prospects in door. To be clear, we often count sales for ease of communication, but the underlying analysis of Lyft generally contemplates contribution of lifetime underwriting profit or LUP as noted earlier, given all the policies are not the same and trade-offs can present themselves. Optimizing motorcycle versus auto lift in a multiproduct experience is one example of such a LUP based tradeoff. I'll now transition from our digital history and scale to some of the how of what we do. Our digital experience is in effect, the front end of our highly segmented product. Our product continues to evolve and move faster, which is a very good thing but using the metaphor on the slide requires our digital customer acquisition train to stay sync with an accelerating product train. Our product requires a complex interview for infrequent transaction with many options. We have decades of experience delivering an accurate online quote and optimizing the user experience simultaneously. Along the way, we've evolved a set of tactics and principles that help us make informed trade-offs. We often run pilots ahead of product changes to assess the best way to gather a given rating input. And by best, we mean most accurate and easiest for the consumer. We've also evolved a living analytic framework to assess and target abandoned points as our user experience and product evolve together. As stated a bit earlier, there is much value to be had at the interface of deep insurance knowledge and deep user experience knowledge. To be clear, the fastest quote is not our goal. Optimal use of the consumer's time is. An instant or quick quote generally implies assumptions in downstream rework. Not to say we don't experiment, in fact, we have a motorcycle quick quote pilot in market in several states as we speak, as well as embedded rates with automotive and financial partners. But the science needs to include rate accuracy in a total end-to-end look at the customer experience from quote to purchase to onboarding. Regarding that science, our scale affords lots of data to optimize new experiences via A/B testing. As part of that testing, we look for sales and LUP [ph] lift, as one might expect, and also come full circle to look at the impact of user experience on product mix. How you ask and display the question can matter. To conclude this slide, keeping up with a fast-moving product, while simultaneously improving user experience and sales throughput necessitates that we have deep connections and frequent collaboration with our product and IT partners. Another way to state our objective function is to stay on and ultimately stretch the efficient frontier of customer ease and segmentation fidelity. As the final topic in our acquisition experience section, I'll touch on our approach to personalization and the digital funnel. We know that delivering the right content to the right consumer in the right context drive substantial value. As I pointed out before, we have been delivering personalized content to enhance customer experience and drive increased sales associated LUP since 2017 We've built a number of points of user experience personalization throughout our digital funnel. Personalization use cases have led to cumulative benefits in the hundreds of millions of dollars proven via A/B tests in the marketplace. Before breaking down our approach to real-time digital personalization on the next slide, I'll also mention another point of advanced technology deployment. Since 2018, our quoting and progressive.com chatbots have delivered millions of conversations and replaced millions of dollars of human support cost. While I won't get into detail on the specifics since this is a fast-moving space that provides real competitive advantage, I'll break down our approach. Delivering personalization at scale in a digital sales funnel in real time requires a set of balanced capabilities. We continue to evolve our capability set along four dimensions. Every year, we work to make sure we advance along each of four key elements, represented on what we call the personalization wheel. While not in a particular order, I'll start with context data. We continue to evolve the data we can access in a real-time digital funnel to drive decisions. We take great care around annuity and privacy as we use the data to drive better user experience. Working clockwise on the wheel, we come to content. Delivering the right content to the right consumer in right context is at the heart of our digital personalization work. We constantly work to add new use cases to our road maps, think stars on the prior slide. A close connection with the marketing team is important here. Next is Decision Science. We continue to add new models and evolve existing ones. Context data is the input, a content decision is the output. Last and absolutely not least, is the delivery system. We need an infrastructure that delivers the content decision and the content itself in milliseconds where the value of optimized content is lost. We also need a nimble environment for our data scientists and engineers to test and evolve new models. We have a strong partnership with our IT team to ensure we leverage and influence the latest enterprise-wide developments, while meeting more current in-market objectives. We work advance on all four of these dimensions each year as a means to drive a road map of short, medium and longer-term end-market tests and ultimately, sales and LUP lift. That was a very brief overview of our direct acquisition experience world. To summarize, we've been at digital sales funnel growth and optimization for a very long time. We have a lot of data that we learn from and advance in progressive fashion. A tight coupling with product is not only necessary, but we believe a source of significant advantage that Insurtech startups will likely never have. We continue to advance our personalization capability set in this space. And last but not least, we've been evolving at the junction of insurance and technology for decades to help fuel the direct customer acquisition virtuous cycle. Doug Constantine : This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Jay VanAntwerp and Dave Krew, who are available to answer questions about the presentation. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question. Marvin will... Operator : Our firs question comes from the line of Bob Jian Huang of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Bob Jian Huang : Hey, good morning. I'm trying -- so first question is, I'm trying to tie out several quarter worth of presentations here. So first of all, you're signing up probably, call it, 2 million new auto policies this year-to-date so far. And even if I assume there's no additional new auto policies that is still a record. So if we think about from that perspective and typically, first year, because of acquisition costs is because of estimates, your -- that policy cohorts combined ratio should be elevated. And if we go out into 2025 and beyond, despite the fact having already a very efficient acquisition cost, shouldn't your -- that policy cohorts combined ratio to be relatively low. So consequently, give you a lot of more flexibility on the combined ratio side to acquire additional customers. Is that the right way to think about this? If not, like how should I think about just essentially the artificially low combined ratio now? And then how far is that going to evolve going forward? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Bob. And yes, you're exactly right, with 2 million additional auto policies and 2.6 million additional policies overall for the company, there's so many inputs that go into a combined ratio that it's hard to discern exactly how the future will go. But here's what I would say. We're very efficient, and there's been a lot of ambient shopping, as you've seen in our presentations and I've written about we've talked about. And so we're able to have our cost per sell well below our targeted acquisition cost. Now the fact is we want even more growth. So we want to grow from a premium perspective, but I've talked a lot about my preferred -- our preferred method of growth is a unit of growth. So we're going to continue to do that. And we're sitting in really great position. So we will spend more if we think we can continue to grow policies units because, frankly, our premium kind of goes up and down, as you've seen in the last four years based on our trends. It's been a high inflationary trend that's abating, which is great for our customers. So while I'm not going to be able signal what our combined ratio will be, know that we're going to spend as much as we can from a media perspective if we think we can get it in an efficient cost with, again, calendar year and lifetime 1916, we're going to continue to drive down non-acquisition expense ratios, we\u2019re going to continue to work on our accuracy and efficiency as well as customer service and work environment, our claims organization, which we have seen just a lot of really great momentum as we've gotten staffed and more tenure in there, and we're going to continue to evolve our brand. So if you look at that, I can't tell you in your model what to put in for our combined ratio, but know that we're looking at all levers at all times, but we feel like we are finally in a really good position to be able to do what we've always said we wanted to do and take small bites of the apple and continue to grow. And whether that's small bite a little bit upward a little bit downward, really be in a position to grow and take even more market share than we've taken in the first half of this year. Bob Jian Huang : Great. Really appreciate that answer. Thank you. My second question revolves around investment income and the way competitive environment is evolving. So, obviously, last few years, a lot of insurers we're subsidizing their underwriting with investment income to offset the inflationary environment. As we think about the growth prospects going forward and interest rate volatility going forward, if interest rates were to come down, if equity market remains volatile, does that help you on the broader competitive environment given that some of your key competitors tend to guide as far as an ROE rather than an underwriting combined ratio. Is there a way to think about that from a broader dynamic investment -- as that broader competitive dynamics? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. We really try to separate the operational with our capital management. So, obviously, our net investment income has improved because we've had some bonds maturing, we have a lot of money from the operations, so we can put that into bonds with higher yields. But really our job, at the Progressive Capital Management, we actually just got back from a business review last week is to protect balance sheet. We're going to continue to grow as fast as we can. We're not going to change the dynamics of our overall original [ph] objectives that we've had since 1971 probably before that, but that is to grow as fast as we can at a 1996 combined ratio, or making at least $0.04 of underwriting profit, but making sure that we take care of our customers. So we look at the competition and competitors have just different models. We're going to continue to have the motto we have had for a long time because we think it's a winning one. Bob Jian Huang : Great. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, just given the ramp-up in ad spend that we've seen this year, are you guys doing this with the expectation that the year-over-year PIF gains that you guys see in the second half of the year will accelerate versus the first half of the year. When we think about relative to that $1.9 million that we've seen added through June? Tricia Griffith : We sure hope so, Elyse. We're going to continue that. I would say if you -- if there's ever a signal of our confidence in our rates, it's based on what we're spending on our media. So you'll see that we're pretty confident what a difference a year makes. But our intentions are to continue on this path and really leverage where we're at from a competitive perspective, both a media and brand perspective, competitive prices, and we're going to hopefully continue that throughout 2024 and beyond. Elyse Greenspan : And then maybe my second question is a follow-up on that, right? When you guys in the slides talking about competitors returning advertising. Do you have -- how do you view the efficient, I guess, advertising opportunities today relative to the past year? Tricia Griffith : Yes, I think we're still seeing a lot of ambient shopping and there are some people, there's some -- some of our competitors that are still getting a fair amount of rate, which will continue to have shopping as we talked about, both with our of prospects and conversion. So, we feel really great about where at different companies, of course, measure it differently. And I think really the secret sauce is what Dave and Jay talked about. And that is something that we've worked on not for a year, not for two years, for decades and is built upon each other, and then, of course, working with our product group, our claims group, our marketing group that's really the special secret sauce. So, now, we feel really great about the efficiency. And we feel, like I said, even more importantly, great about having the right rates on the street. Now, again, that -- I can change a little bit here and there, but it's been such a pendulum swing in the last four years, giving $1 billion back to customers and lowering rates during the pandemic and then, of course, the inflation. It's really nice to what we see at this point in time just some stability, which our customers deserve and just tweaking it up and down a little bit, and that's really where the fun begins where we really can get competitive on our advertising, our media and, of course, taking care of our customers. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks Elyse. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Phillips of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Mike Phillips : Thanks. Good morning. Take a step back for the first question, a little higher level, Trish. I guess -- looking at the consumer landscape that's clearly changing, the younger generation, more online, more media, more social media things like that. I guess as you think about how that continues to change, how do you see the overall size of the DTC channel relative to the overall personal market? What percent do you think that's going to be in maybe five, 10 years down the road? And part of that I ask is we're seeing clearly more competitors try to cut into this, whether it's small new entrants or even some pretty big traditional agency competitors of yours that are trying to switch over to direct. And so if you can comment on how difficult you think that is to get into this market, given you guys have been quite successful for decades? Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Yes, I mean I think that the generation, I think I've shared with you before, I have six children that everyone wants to buy online, that makes more sense. It's easy. I remember when we first started prog.com, it was called something else is called Auto Pro. No one thought anyone would ever buy auto insurance online, and we made a bet. And it's difficult. And it was an uphill battle. It was an expensive battle, it took us 10 years before we made money. As if you go back into this presentation, you look at what Dave Krew said, we were in SureTec before that it was never coined a name. So, I think we feel pretty proud that we're going to continue to innovate. That's so important in our DNA. So, we're going to continue with the integrated marketing campaigns. I think for us, it's really about choice for consumers. So, I am still an agency customer. It works for me, it doesn't work for my children. So, I think to answer your question, it's hard to get into, but even as we watch the competition, it really boils down to competitors and all of us making sure that we have the right choices for our consumers. And that's really where we want to be. And we believe that we can compete really effectively in both the direct and agency channel, and we have been. Mike Phillips : Okay. Thank you. This is a little more specific to your recent Q. You mentioned a lot about growth in renters. And I guess I'm curious, is there anything concerted effort on your part that's caused that? Or where is that coming from? And are there growth opportunities in your auto that come from that growth in renters? And are there things in the renters customer base that you can learn that would make the auto growth a little bit more profitable? Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I mean I think renters is oftentimes required, we have an easy, really quote flow for renters. We do like to have the auto renters bundled. We also know that renters can often turn into homeowners. And of course, we have to make sure that those homes are ones that fit our risk profile as we move forward and de-risk that book a little bit. But yeah, any time we see that bundle happen, whether it's auto and renters and then any other product you add that also causes stickiness, and that's really where the rubber meets the road is making sure that consumers we have what they need and when we do, they stay for a long time. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Gregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. So for the first question, I'm going to focus on Jay's staffing comment. And Jay, during your portion of the presentation, I think you mentioned that there are times when your staffing in certain geographies aren't up to the speed of growth and so you dialed back advertising -- so I guess just some questions around that. How many times has this happened? Has there been specific geographies where this has been a challenge and maybe on a broader base just about some of your higher strategies to offset what you're reporting substantial growth in presumably a tight labor market? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. A great question, Greg. Let me take that one. It rarely happens, but we watch it closely, mainly because we talk about growing as fast as we can at or below a '96 if we can take care of our customers. I recall one time I'll get the year wrong but it was early 2000s. We were growing a lot. And I remember specifically, we had to tell the state of Texas that we had to slow down. So we had to slow down growth there. So, that obviously is embedded in me. I wasn't even in the role. But having been in the claims role, you work closely, and I know our claims President works closely with Pat and his group to say, okay, here's where we're adequately staffed. And also the great part about now having the ability to have some hybrid work is you can shift work to different states. So you can -- if we are a little bit behind in staffing in one state, we could -- and a little bit above in the other, we can train those people to work that state if we need to. All we're saying and all Jay saying is that if we need to shut off media at a local basis like we did in the last couple of years when we didn't have the right rates on the street, we can do that or if aren't staffed appropriately. Now, right after the pandemic going into 2022, I would say, we had way more turnover than we would normally like in both claims in CRM, we're in a completely different spot right now. In fact, are hiring ahead of need and feel really good and I talked a little bit about making sure that we -- with new reps that we are really accurate and we pay the fair amount and that we're efficient. So that's really where we're going to be able to turn that on now because we feel really great about our staffing tenure, the quality and our accuracy. Gregory Peters : Okay. I guess for my follow-up question, I'm going to pivot. And as part of the advertising presentation and advertising expense, presentation, you really didn't talk about multilingual strategies, and we don't really see it in the PowerPoint presentation yet the Hispanic community is a growing percentage of the population inside the United States. So I'm just curious if you could spend a minute and talk about how you're approaching your digital advertising and all the other advertising levers and targeting multilingual cohorts of the population. Tricia Griffith : That is a great question, and we've been working on that for some time. We had a little setback with some litigations in law, law in Colorado. I won't go into the details because it's out there. But it really caused us to pause because it's really difficult for us when we want to do national advertising to control who's seeing in any given state. So we paused on that. Now we have done a couple ads, one in particular, really sweet one. If you go through it, it's a deer talking to the dove and a dad talking to the new driver. And there's some nods obviously, to Latin X [ph], which we think is important. And I totally agree with you. So we have a strategy and a whole team working on our multilingual, a sort of ability to grow. We can grow both in the agency channel, and we have a huge group of what we call Sagora reps [ph] here that handle our Spanish-speaking customers. We believe that this is a big opportunity. Again, we had to pause a little bit because of something that happened in Colorado, but we talk about this a lot. In fact, we're getting an update in one of my upcoming direct report meetings on where we're going with our multilingual strategy. Gregory Peters : Thank you for the answers. Tricia Griffith : Thank you, Gregory. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Josh Shanker : Yes, thank you for taking my question. I was listening to Jay's presentation and he said that you made a big bet in advertising. And of course, the industry followed you. And then Tricia, you said that people doubted people would buy auto insurance online, but of course, that they did. I was wondering what was the catalyst change all that, and I want to apply that to homeowners. When do you think there will be a catalyst that people really buy homeowners online, how big do you think the online homeowners' direct-to-consumer market can get -- and maybe do you think we're on the cusp of that change? Tricia Griffith : Yes. That's several questions. I'll go back to begin with. I think we'll always continue to try to grow in all channels. So we'll use that innovation. I think Jay's big bet on advertising. We had -- we sort of took a decomp and looked at where we were at a long time like go back to like the mid-2000s. And we advertised, we did it well. We had a brand but not solidified. And I think we were able to make a big bet when we had a brand that people recognize that respected, they talked about choice that talked about savings and I actually remember it pretty well because it was not long after I came into this job, I came in mid-2016, we bumped up against the 96 in my first quarter, and shortly thereafter, and I meet with the acquisition teams all the time. Jay and his team came with an approach, and it was brilliant, and I supported it. In fact, Jay often comes to me or through Pat and to me to say we need spend more here, and here's why. And honestly, their group is so spot on. I've never said no. And of course, they've given us a gift of pulling back when we've needed to. So on the direct homeowner side, we're about -- I think about 25% of our business comes into the direct side. So, but think that's Progressive Home and another stable group of carriers. We're going to continue to expand that because we do think people want to buy online. I don't know what the pivot point will be where it's 50-50, like it is in auto, but we're going to continue to invest in that that because we think it's important. And because a home is so much more volatile. And if you get to a density situation can be problematic during storms, we'll continue to work with really solid partners to make sure it benefits them and us as a win for all companies. Josh Shanker : And then looking little more on the rate and homeowners. If you look at some of your competitors provide renewal pricing data in that their rate increases are much higher than yours, of course. Some of your pricing is related to your growing faster in non-coastal non-cat states, which is causing your numbers to be lower due to diversification geography. But still, your numbers seem to be lower. Is homeowners nationally being priced adequately not so progressive, but the industry in general? Is the industry overpricing too much, do you think creating an opportunity for Progressive take share here? Or does Progressive -- also need to take some action here to get current with what others are doing? Tricia Griffith : Well, some of that -- some of those rates you're looking at, like we talked about our growth in renters, which is really much smaller average written premium. We took about 4% in the quarter. And year-to-date, it will be about 10% on a trailing 12% about, 17%. So we've taken quite a lot of a lot of rate, and we've had other non-rate actions that we've taken to derisk our books. I think first things first, we're going to focus on de-risking the book, doing what we've said. We have the 115,000 non-renewals in Florida that we knew were unprofitable. We worked with Florida to have options for those consumers. We're going to continue for us to work on improved segmentation. We have eight states on our new 5.0 product. Get as good at our pricing and our segmentation and really at that surgical level as we have in auto, and that takes some time. We've been working diligently on it. I said in my letter, we're going to be even more aggressive. I think at that point, when the dust clears, we'll be able to take more market share. In the meantime, we are continuing to grow in what we perceive as more nonvolatile states. Weather is always the factor that we have to take into account all the time. But right now, our focus is derisking a property. And then as we feel like we're in a good position, and we do have the right rates. We'll grow in the areas where we think it's most important to grow for the whole health of portfolio. Josh Shanker : Very helpful answers. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.. Robert Cox : Hey, thanks for taking my question. First question just on cost per sale. I'm just curious, as peers have continued to improve their margins year-to-date. Are you expecting increased competition on the cost per sale in the back half of year? And also curious how you anticipate the election will impact costs for advertising? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. To answer the last part, I have no idea. The first part, we might feel some pressure on cost per sale, but it is so much below TAC that we feel really good about the efficiency. Robert Cox : Okay. Got it. Thanks. And just maybe going to the 10-Q, some of the business mix shift impacting accident frequency. When you think about pricing going forward, how much of this favorable frequency environment are you considering as sustainable versus weather related or other nonrecurring benefits? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. So if you look at our frequency being down about 8%, the majority of that is really \u2013 it's always hard to discern exactly. I would say, the two factors right now for us is our preferred mix and some of the non-rate actions. So we've unwound or continue to unwind the non-reactions. The preferred business, our motto has always been that we want Sam, Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons. We want every customer as long as we can make a lifetime in a calendar year, 1996 combined ratio. So we made to pressure on that. But again, it's really hard to discern and really put together exactly what makes frequency. We watch it closely. As well as we do, obviously, frequency and then react to that accordingly. But like I've said, I feel like we're in such a better position in terms of stability around those trends. And if we can now start to do what we do best, and that is thoroughly look at every product, every state, new and renewal and take a little bit up, a little bit down, a little bit up, a little bit down, make those rates stable for our consumers. That's really the winning proposition for us. Robert Cox : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. It\u2019s Jen [ph] on for Meyer. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the rates in the shareholder letter, you mentioned taking some small rate cut for eight states. Just curious on what your thinking behind it? And how should we think about rates going forward? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. So we always -- like I said, we're kind of back to things that are a little bit normal. So if you think about on the auto side, combined ratio right around 88%. That doesn't mean that every states at 88%, that every DMA is at 88%, some are above, some are below. So you can imagine that if we're well-below our 88%, which is below our 1996 actual goal that we're going to take the opportunity to reduce those rates a little bit to bring in new business, along with our media spend and are unwinding of non-rate actions. Remember, too, when we think about that, and it's kind of what I said before, we want to make sure that we're taking those small nibbles, small bites. So even though we reduced rates, by a small amount, 8%. We increased rates in 13%, a small amount, which is just such different game than we've had to play in the last several years. And so that's where we'll think of rate cuts. We'll think of if, in fact, we're making wide margins and we believe it will benefit us for growth and benefit our consumers to have stable rates. We'll use that as one lever to continue new business growth. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. My second question is on the conversion rate. So in your presentation, you mentioned expanding significantly more than competitors. Conversion rate has come down due to the schedule shopping behavior. How is Progressive from thinking about dealing with the conversion rate? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. So we -- I think the question was about conversion rate. And obviously, we want to be on the short list for consumers and then ultimately convert that. So our prospects are high now because we're out there. And so you're going to see -- that's kind of the wide part of the tunnel, the funnel. And then if you go down, our conversion isn't as high because of the numbers. So we can't necessarily control that, but we think -- there's a lot of shopping out there. A lot of people just kind of making sure they shop because rates have been so volatile. But we will continue to work on making sure that our conversion rate is in line with what we think it should be on all products in all states. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Jimmy Bhullar : Good morning. So most of my questions were answered, but I was wondering if you could talk about what you're see in terms of competitor behavior on pricing and marketing spend how it varies by channel -- because it seems like the mutuals as the group haven't been as proactive in raising prices, but just wondering if you could talk about the various channels and what you're seeing? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I mean, the channels are different because like we talked about today that was really focused on direct, which is more of a fixed spend. And then the spend on the agency side is more variable depending on new and renewal and then, of course, what's happening in the industry in terms of commission amounts. I think we have seen our competitors, I would say, acting rationally. And I think there's been a lot of rate in the system, still a lot of rate coming into the system. I can see it becoming more competitive. And if that's the case, I think you'll likely see more spending. And so that's -- to me, that's the rational case. So whether your goal is 96% or 95% or 105%, I think at some point, you need to be mean to be rational and price your right to risk. And I believe we're seeing that. And we all have our own models, obviously, I am biased and believe that our model is the best because it's that balance of growth and profitability and competitive prices and most importantly, our people and culture. So I think this should be an interesting couple of years, but I do see some rational movement from -- across a lot of our competitors. Jimmy Bhullar : And then your margins have obviously been pretty good for the last several quarters, but most of your peers' margins are improving as well. So wondering if you see an environment where in a few quarters, you start to see regulatory pushback on prices since they have gone up a lot or just the excess profit you're earning get eroded because of an uptick in composition on prices? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I mean, I don't -- again, I don't want the pendulum to swing the other way because they're still about 10% states or premium that we don't actually have the right rates on the street from our perspective in terms of where we want to be. So we will, like I said, and as you read, we did reduce rates in 8 states, and we'll continue to watch that. We want to make a '96. I want to -- we want to grow. We want to grow unit growth. And that's why we're doing what we have said we've always done, and that is advertise more, make sure that we're there for our customers when they need us most, as you see some of the volatile weather happening. And I think regulators, we work with them and the relationships are really important to make sure that there's two things that we have adequate rates on the street, competitive prices. So, if we lower rates, I think people will follow as well because everyone has to have competitive prices. It's so easy to shop. And easy to leave your carrier if you want to. So, it's really important to have competitive prices, and so much goes into that, whether it's segmentation or our claims efficiency, et cetera. So, I think that's what we have to look at. I think in addition that we know that our customers do want stable rates. And we're going to continue to work on that and work with our industry. I just don't -- our industry commissioners. I just don't want to swing the other way because this has been stable for just a couple of quarters. And while I don't think we're going to have anything unforeseen happen, I've probably said that a few times in the last couple of years where things have been unforeseen have happened. So, we will continue to let this play out, do the right thing, and we'll always try to be competitive in order to grow our units, which is the most important measure of growth to us. Jimmy Bhullar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward of Citi. Your line is now open. Michael Ward : Thanks. Good morning. I was just wondering, we noticed that your mobile app takeup seems to be pretty high for auto policies in general, at least relative to your competitors. So, just wondering if you have any insight as to why that might be -- it doesn't seem like it's just telematics, but are you incentivizing maybe the use of digital ID cards and paperless or is it something else? Tricia Griffith : I think that\u2019s sort of with the question in terms of the evolution of technology. So, we have a lot of our new apps come in through mobile. And I think if you come in, your likelihood of you want to stay there. And so we continue to invest in making our mobile app more friendly, access to things like you said, the ID card and making payments and just making it easier. So, we've invested a lot in the last more than a decade on the mobile app, and we'll continue to do so. And when you think about one of our strategic pillars as broad coverage, that's one coverage where people go in on the app. And when I go in on an app, I want to stay there and be able to do everything. So, that is service, that's buy, that\u2019s -- get the information I need. So, I think you're right that it's continued, and I think it's based on our investments and people that want to do business in that way. Michael Ward : Okay. And then just expanding on the comments about direct home sales. Wondering if you can kind of elaborate on that in the context of the acceleration in Robinson growth indirect trying to square those two. I guess, are Robinson customer wins taking place more online or more over the phone? And how should we think about your Robinson share expansion going forward? Tricia Griffith : Yes. Well, our Robinson growth is taking place across the board. I would say, higher in the agency because that's really where we needed to have a homeowners product to be able to access those auto customers in the independent agent channel. What I would say is, so we started what we call HomeQuote Explorer many, many years ago. And it was really based on having a stable group of carriers in addition to us, where if we didn't want to write a risk, we could give it to another carrier or another carrier. And so we're going to continue to evolve that. And we have that really across the board. That has been how we like -- how we like to look at what the customers need. And when we think of broad coverage, we have HomeQuote Explorer, which is the direct home, which we want more and more Robinsons there, but they don't necessarily have to be Robinsons. On the commercial side, we have BusinessQuote Explorer, again, where you can buy our commercial auto, but then maybe a general liability policy from another carrier. And then we have AutoQuote Explorer, where we're doing the same thing. It's really about making sure it's ease of use for our customers. And they've come to us through the acquisition -- the media spend that we look at. So they come to us. And if we can't seal the deal, why wouldn't we help them seal the deal with somebody else who wants that risk. So I think it will continue to grow. Again, first things first in our desire to derisk our product portfolio. But I'm proud that we have invested in HomeQuote Explorer and think that will be a long-term solution for us on the direct side. Michael Ward : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Motemaden : Hi. Good morning. Tricia, I was wondering if you could just talk about how much of a lag or if there is a lag between when you ramp ad spend. And when you start to see higher sales? I know that March was the highest ad spend month in your history that obviously increased from there. In the second quarter, -- so I'm just wondering -- and it also looks like that happened in June as well where there was another tick up. Is there any sort of lag between when you hit the ad spend and when you start to see the PIF come through? Tricia Griffith : I would say there's a little bit of lag, but we measure that pretty closely when we have any media spend in terms of our -- the prospects coming in. And then, of course, then we'll measure the prospects that turn into sales. I mean there's a little lag. We also -- we were never totally closed in our advertising. So there's a kind of constantly making sure that we're top of mind for consumers to be on that short list to even shop. So I'd say there's some lag, but I don't think there's anything discernible. David Motemaden : Understood. Thanks. That's helpful. And then last quarter, I think it was in the 10-Q. It sounded like there were 10 points of rate that we're still to earn in throughout the course of 2024. I'm wondering where that stands now and how we should think of that as just additional rate earning in above trend that you can then spend on advertising. Tricia Griffith : So you're talking specifically about auto or overall? David Motemaden : Yes, auto. Tricia Griffith : Yes. On the auto, we've taken so much rates over the years. We have -- we took a little bit for the quarter two, 2% year-to-date. We have a little bit more to earned in, Earn in, maybe 2-ish for the rest of the year. We feel really good about our rates. And in fact, that's why we're able to take a little bit of movement in those eight states where we reduced rates a little bit. But as you think about -- if you go back, it was painful. 2022, we took 13.5%, 2023, we took nearly 19%. So -- the cumulative rates, and of course, they earn in more quickly than home have been a lot. And so we feel really good about having it be a little bit less during this year in terms of our competitiveness. David Motemaden : Great. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Autonomous. Your line is now open. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. Good morning. So, obviously, all three months, April, May and June looked really good from the PIF standpoint. But I guess, seasonally, if we look historically, those actually have not been a big PIF margin. I'm just curious -- would you say that the result was in spite of seasonal headwinds that are still in place? Or is the whole seasonality component of trying to analyze things kind of a moot point just given the changing dynamics? Tricia Griffith : Now I don't want to say it's a moot point. I think it was a blend of having the right rates on the street, being able to pull back on non-rate items that we put into place when we were trying to stop growth, and our increase in media spend as well as us being very adequately staffed to handle everything. So I think it was a lot of dynamics, sort of, the perfect storm in a good way to position us in that way. So I think it's just a bunch of things that came together with a lot hard work with a lot of teams to make sure that we had -- that we were able to capitalize and maximize our PIF growth. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then I guess just on the advertising, I mean, you mentioned 2023, you pulled back a ton, you still spent over $1 billion, I would guess that ad spend is not just a function of not just designed to add new business and most probably also play some kind of retention role. I don't know if there's any way to quantify if there's a base amount you have to advertise, or this increasing advertising spend more. Does that help your attention as well? But I'm just curious how you guys think about that or if there is any way to quantify that impact? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I mean I think, obviously, the best thing for retention is to have stable rates. But you can't even -- if you don't have a brand out there, it's hard to be on the short list of people that think about companies go to buy and that have especially because our brand, I think, is well thought of. We have many different campaigns that hit different people differently. We try to break through with our humor. We try to make sure that customer\u2019s see adds the right amount of time, not too little, not too much to make sure we're on that. I think we have been in the last several years doing some tests from a retention, or just understanding addressable markets. We talked a little bit about the multilingual campaign. So we do spend some money on making sure that we have campaigns out there, whether digital or mass media, or people do see us in terms of what our purpose is, and that is to move forward and live fully. That's what we want our customers and our employees and communities to do so. It is really about attracting and then when they come here, we want to retain them with stable prices, great service and all the products they need. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski of BMO. Your line is now open. Michael Zaremski : Thanks. Good morning. First question, I guess, a follow-up to Rob Cox's, you asked about the sustainability of frequency trends that are favorable, and you kind of unpacked a couple of items on mix and non-rate actions. What about on the severity side? I know you ever looks very favorable, especially relative to some of the pure data. I know your -- you had easy comps, I guess, you can say also last year. But how are you thinking about any of the sustainability or mix factors on severity these days? Tricia Griffith : I think the mix factor can take into place some of it, but some of the severity had gone up so much during the pandemic in subsequent years in terms of think used car prices. And those are still up, but they're stable relative to pre-pandemic. So that's where you're seeing some of the stability in terms of BI [ph] had an uptick in attorney rep in a larger loss in litigation. So I think the things are stabilizing. It's hard to say what will happen, but we've had several lines of data where we do see some stability in that, which gives us a little bit of confidence as we move forward. . Michael Zaremski : Got it. So nothing you're calling out kind of on your mix that should make it more running at a lower rate than it has in the past, okay? Tricia Griffith : Yes. No, mostly just getting hopefully to a more stable place. Michael Zaremski : Okay. And just lastly, my -- my follow-up is on the Jay's part of the presentation on direct-to-consumer. And just by the way, I remember being at your live Investor Day in Ohio, probably a decade plus ago when you asked the audience how many times you think we look at our smartphones. And I was -- I always think about that as I look at my phone, and we all look at our phone way too much these days. So you guys were ahead of the trend. But -- but just I guess, Jay mentioned there was a -- it seems like you mentioned a catalyst for more spend that you improved your data back in the 2016 to 2017 time frame, I believe. I don't know if is that something worth elaborating on and if you feel that there's been a -- you're even improving more so today than in the past? Or was that kind of a big -- you mentioned that. So I was curious if that kind of a -- if there's something special happen then? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : No. I mean I think a lot of things have happened since and that was sort of a pivotal time where we decided that we were going to go ahead as we looked backwards spend more closely to our targeted acquisition cost to understand what that would mean to growth. I will say since then, having worked closely with this group, \"Oh my gosh, the amount of data and how surgical they understand our customers and understand who sees what, when, what that means, how we should price for Sam and Omaha versus a Diane in Missouri is incredible. So it hasn't stopped, and it actually builds off of each other. So it's sort of like our product model. It's not like, \"Oh, Jay's group learns this and then it's -- the next thing they learn. It's like multiplicative. And so I would say, if you have asked me in 2017, I would have said this group is incredible. The group now, which is the same and more people are even better. So what we are learning and what we are understanding from just a granular level is truly amazing. I think that's one of many of our secret sauces. So as we wrap this up, do want to thank Dave and Jay and their incredible teams for the nimbleness when we've hit up against our target. They've never complained about pulling back. And my hope is this year that -- never say no to their additional spend to grow, and they can spend as much as they can to make sure we grow the entire firm. So thank you, great questions today. I appreciate everyone coming to our to our event. Doug Constantine : That appears to been our final question. So that concludes our event. Martin, I'll hand the call back over to you for closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation Fourth [ph] Quarter Investor Event.

    "content": "\ufeff Doug Constantine : Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for Progressive\u2019s First (sic) [Third] Quarter Investor Event. I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations and I will be your moderator for today\u2019s event. The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company\u2019s website. Although our quarterly investor relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today\u2019s event for introductory comments by our CEO, and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 60 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions-and-answers with members of our leadership team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today\u2019s event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our Form 10-Q for the first, second, and third quarters of 2024, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia? Tricia Griffith : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019d like to begin today by extending my sympathies to those affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The scenes of destruction were truly heart-wrenching and the human toll of these storms was devastating. As the cleanup efforts continue, I\u2019m heartened to know that Progressive\u2019s excellent claim staff is standing by to assist our customers in their greatest time of need. In fact, I\u2019ve heard countless versions of stories like the one I\u2019m about to share with you. This is when our customers need us most, and when we shine the brightest. My name is Anne-Marie and my fiance is Timothy. We just lost our RV with this last Hurricane Helene. I\u2019ve been in Tampa for two months sitting by Timothy\u2019s bedside while he fought cancer. I\u2019m happy to say that he is in remission. I came back to Fort Myers Beach to meet with the adjuster, Ray. I would like to tell you about my encounter with this lovely gentleman. Ray was prompt, professional and showed compassion for my loss of our home. He is the perfect person to be assessing the damages of one\u2019s property. I cannot say enough positive things about Ray. He is one of a kind and it was a pleasure to meet under these horrible circumstances. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. To my clients\u2019 colleagues, you amaze me every day. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all that you do each and every day. Turning towards results. The third quarter was one of our strongest in our history. Across our businesses, we added almost 1.6 million policies in force, the most we\u2019ve ever added in a quarter. This brings the total policies added this year to nearly 4.2 million, truly a remarkable feat. The magnitude of this growth during the year requires increases in sales, servicing and claim staffing, and our teams have met the challenge, enabling us to maximize growth while providing the quality experience our customers expect of us. Throughout the third quarter, we experienced very strong demand for our Personal Lines products across both channels. While direct channel new application growth responded almost immediately to our increase in media spend and the release of non-rate actions earlier in the year, as evidenced by the channel\u2019s stronger new business growth in Q2, the agency channel\u2019s growth potential wasn\u2019t fully realized until the last few weeks of the second quarter. The result is a third quarter where our growth machine was firing on all cylinders with clear results in both channels experiencing record levels of new applications. To-date, the level of ambient shopping and Personal Auto remains very high, ambient capitalized on that. In Q3 2024, we spent more on media than in any quarter in our history. The result was a higher number of direct channel prospects than any quarter in our history, surpassing Q2 2024, the previous record holder. Additionally, conversion is strong, suggesting that we are well-priced compared to the competition. Though the fourth quarter, especially November and December, are historically lower in sales volume, we believe that we can continue to position ourselves to capture more than our fair share of prospects from the marketplace. The record growth is even more impressive when you consider our profit margins. Our year-to-date combined ratio through Q3 was very strong. Though the cost of Hurricane Milton are not reflected in our Q3 numbers, 2024 is still shaping up to be one of the best non-pandemic years in our history. Growing at our pace with record profits is a testament to the investment we\u2019ve made in segmentation over the years and we\u2019re not standing still. Our newest product model, which continues to add further segmentation in our Personal Auto products, is available in states that represent about one-third of our net written premium. You\u2019ll recall that in 2022 and 2023, the Commercial Auto market was impacted by many of the same inflationary pressures as Personal Lines. In response to the rising loss costs, we took double-digit rate increases in 2023. In Q3 2024, we reported our third straight quarter of quarter-over-quarter improvement in our loss and LAE ratio for Commercial Lines. Our results in part from the rate we took in 2023, earning in, which is a slower process in Commercial Lines, since the majority of our policies are 12 months. Growth has been more difficult in that line as the softness in the truck market has offset solid growth in our other non-trucking business market targets. As our competitors catch up in rate, however, we are optimistic that we\u2019re well-positioned for more growth in the future. The third quarter results in Property were excellent at a 78.5 combined ratio, after almost 30 points of favorable development on storms from the first half of the year, and despite the 21 points of losses incurred by Hurricane Helene. However, two hurricanes striking Florida only a week apart underscores our need to risk adjust our Property business. Our efforts here are evident with Q3 PIF growth in what we consider to be less volatile weather-related states of 19%, compared to a decrease of 9% in the volatile weather states. Risk adjustment has been and will be a year\u2019s long effort, but we are making progress. As always, our goal is to have all of our reporting segments meet their profitability targets, and we continue to make headway in our Property business with improved segmentation in our 5.0 product model and adjustments to our underwriting appetite. Ultimately, when I look across our results today, I see a huge amount of opportunity. While we can\u2019t know exactly what the future holds or what the market will bring, I believe that we are in a good position to be flexible and to react to whatever comes our way. The actions we take today are what position us for what we achieve next year and I firmly believe that we are in a good position headed into 2025. While there will undoubtedly be challenges, I\u2019m already looking forward to what I anticipate will be a great fourth quarter and a strong 2025. Thank you again and I will now take your questions. Doug Constantine : This concludes the previously recorded portion of today\u2019s event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Josh Shanker : Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. If we think about -- and good morning. If we think about the idea of growing at a 96% combined ratio or better, as fast as Progressive can, is that a revenue premium number or is that a policy count number? I ask this because there are some who are considering Progressive very, very good margins, votes for price cuts in the near-term future, but would Progressive cut price if it did not come with commensurate improvements to the policy count growth? Tricia Griffith : Good morning, Josh. That\u2019s a good question. We look at both when we talk about grow as fast as we can. Some of our internal measures, success rates are based on our average PIF growth. And we always talk about our preferred growth is our unit growth, because trends can ebb and flow as you see in the last several years. So that\u2019s our preferred method. Obviously, we want to stay ahead of trend and we know that retention is very helpful if we have stable rates. So we want to get as many new apps in the door as possible through obviously our increased media spend, but then we want to keep those and so I think it\u2019s a balance of everything. So premium, we always want to stay ahead of trend and make at least that $0.04 and unit growth, we want to grow as fast as we can as long as we can service our customers in the way they deserve. Does that answer your question? Josh Shanker : Are the margins -- yes. So, I guess, more important, are the margins today so tasty that Progressive has a view that they should be considering price cuts in the near-term future? Tricia Griffith : Well, what the price cuts, we will watch trend carefully. So like we said in the Q, we did about nine states of some price cuts, but we also had states that went up a little bit. So I think what I\u2019ve talked about in the past is really we want to use -- in the current margins we have, we want to use that to propel growth. So that will be the continued sort of march towards using our media spend to continue to have that organic growth. But we will see states and channels and products where we have to increase rates a little bit as well. We go back to that small bites of the apple where we just want to stay ahead of it and have those rates stable, but we believe we\u2019re really well positioned to continue to grow. Josh Shanker : Thank you very much. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Thank you for your questions. Our next question comes from a line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Bob Huang : Hey. Good morning. Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on that, but more on the competitive environment perspective. As we think about your ad spending and as we think about your advantages in pricing or competitiveness in pricing, but if competition were to intensify in 2025 and going forward, how effective do you feel the ad spending and then the pricing side will be? Like, should we expect that incremental ad spend, but the effectiveness of the ad spend maybe will come down a little bit? Like, curious your view on this. Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I mean, I think, competitors have taken this time to get their rates on the street and we see people coming back a little bit, not as quickly as we did, obviously, on the media side. We\u2019ll always look at media from an efficiency perspective and we\u2019ll want, if our cost per sale is still favorable to our targeted acquisition costs, we\u2019ll continue to spend to make sure that we get more customers and convert more customers. I think, really how we feel right now with our current margins and where we\u2019re at, we\u2019re going to continue to push on media and push on growth and we just feel like we\u2019re really well positioned, because if, and we believe we\u2019re still in a hard market, people, consumers continue to shop, we\u2019re going to have those stable rates. And in addition, we\u2019ve been spending and it\u2019s a little bit further afield, but we\u2019ve been spending money on not just getting business in the door, but some delayed response ads. So I don\u2019t know if you notice, I\u2019m sure you do, either in my comments or my letters, I talk a lot about our culture and our people and who we are and I don\u2019t know that enough people, consumers and customers and our communities know sort of our purpose, that we exist to help people move forward and live fully. We\u2019ve recently put out some ads, we call our Purpose Anthem to talk about progress and progress isn\u2019t overnight. You should look up Purpose on a page of Progressive in Google and you\u2019ll kind of see all the things we\u2019re doing. And so you\u2019re going to be seeing some ads with that that are a little bit more of a delayed response, but a response we believe will be nicely balanced with sort of who we are as a company that you want to be involved with. So we\u2019re excited about our growth. We love competition. Yeah, I think competition will continue to have the right rates and show up in media, but we\u2019re prepared. Jay VanAntwerp : You might also have some response to both those questions. Bob Huang : Thank you. very helpful. Jay VanAntwerp : The way we operationalize in the marketplace, our objectives there is for our product managers and they are managing at the state and product level and they are assessing the competitive landscape where we sit by segment, they understand elasticity by channel and by locale. And they\u2019re making the calls that level to decide what we should be doing with price. Obviously the 96% is the objective, but to the extent we can manage and grow a lot beneath that, the product managers are going to make those calls. So I think when you look at our performance over time, you see the aggregate of all those decisions at the local level. So I think that I understand the questions, but I think understanding how we operationalize that in the marketplace is really important to understand our model. Bob Huang : Okay. Very much appreciate that. Thank you. My second question is on retention. So if we look at your 10-Q commentaries, your -- for Auto business -- Personal Auto business, the policy life expectancy has been relatively elongated over probably more than a year now, right? And then that\u2019s been stabilized. If I remember correctly, your pricing is relative to the expected life cycle of a policy. So if that life cycle were to stabilize going forward, should we expect that favorable contribution to combined ratio to be less pronounced going forward? In other words, is it right to assume that you\u2019ll probably need some marginal pricing as that life cycle kind of stabilize rather than continue to improve? Did I lose you guys? Operator : Excuse me, everyone. One moment as we reconnect the speakers. Tricia Griffith : Okay. Thanks, Victoria. I apologize for that. I thought that was on your end, but it was on our end. And so if we have questions at the end of the hour, we\u2019ll certainly elongate the time. So Bob, you were asking your second question and I think it was about retention. I think I must have jinxed us because this weekend when I was preparing, I\u2019m like, this is one of the best quarters in the history of Progressive. This is going to be great, and then of course, our computer crashed. So apologies again. Bob Huang : Yeah. Can you guys hear me? Tricia Griffith : Yes. Bob Huang : Can you guys hear me? Okay. Excellent. Yeah. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have even better quarters down the road. So, yeah, question on retention. Your policy life expectancy is kind of, was growing over the last few quarters and now it\u2019s normalizing. Would that have a headwind to your combined ratio as given that you\u2019re essentially pricing towards an expected life expectancy for every policy or you don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue? Tricia Griffith : Well, yeah, I mean, I think retention is kind of our Holy Grail. So it\u2019s always an issue to grow our units. So the T12 has been pretty flat and that\u2019s really a lot to do with some of the actions that we\u2019ve taken across the board. T3 was down and that\u2019s a lot on the comparison of last year when it was up 35%. But yeah, we watch that closely. We don\u2019t want to spend all of the media money to have customers come in and then just leave. So our focus really is those stable rates and great service to continue to improve retention. Do you want to add anything, Pat or John? Jay VanAntwerp : No. I think that\u2019s good. Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Bob. Sorry about that again. Bob Huang : Thank you. Really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Yes. Good morning. My first question, Tricia, I think you did hit on a little bit in your prepared remarks, but it was just about just the Q4, right? I think typically sometimes there\u2019s slower growth because of the holidays and vacation. I\u2019m just trying, want to understand how you think about that dynamic playing out this year, just given continued elevated shopping, as well as your marketing spend and how we could think about PIF gains in the last quarter of the year? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. Thanks, Elyse. Yeah. We\u2019re going to continue our push throughout the end of 2024. And it\u2019s really, we want to get more than our fair share of the shoppers, even if shoppers are a little bit less in November and December based on the holidays. And really we don\u2019t want to, you could easily say, well, wouldn\u2019t you just pull back a little bit for expenses on media? But really you want to have that consistent media spend and how -- and be prepared for that response and that shopping that we believe and normally typically happens in that first quarter. So it\u2019s really about, relative to our peers, are we in a good position, a better position? We believe that we are. Elyse Greenspan : And then my second question, right? And obviously record growth here for Progressive this year, as you think about the environment, right? You guys are obviously taking less rate, industry, right? Perhaps a bit behind you guys. How do you think about 2025? I know there\u2019s a lot of different variables, but just from a growth perspective sitting here today, how do you think next year could play out? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. We feel really good and bullish about 2025. And you\u2019re going to look at some stats that we talked about in our Q. I mean, 117% new app growth on the direct side, 98% on the agency side. Those are massive amounts. And obviously the comps will be more difficult, but that doesn\u2019t mean on a relative basis, in a unit basis, we\u2019re not going to grow literally as fast as we can. And we feel so much better about our rates, especially on the private passenger auto part, commercial and product. We\u2019re still having rate earn in, but we feel bullish about our positioning as well and our de-risking on the Property side. We feel like we really look at our growth from our strategic pillars. So we\u2019ve got a great culture and great people. We are very adequately staffed, especially in our call center organizations for sales and service and our claims organization to take care of our customers. We reduce our expenses on the non-acquisition expense ratio, because we care deeply about those competitive rates. We continue our segmentation. So you\u2019ve got people and culture, you\u2019ve got competitive rates, you\u2019ve got our brand, which continues to evolve and you\u2019ve got our broad coverage. We\u2019re going to be where, when and how customers want to shop. With those four strategic pillars and where we\u2019re at from a pricing perspective and a marketing perspective, I think, we have a huge opportunity in 2025. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Elyse. Operator : Thank you for your questions. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Your line\u2019s open. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to, oops, sorry, thanks. I wanted to drill down on the frequency severity trends that you put on the queue, specifically the BI liability. It looks like, anything to make of, it looks like the severity kind of moved up a bit and frequency kind of didn\u2019t improve as much as 2Q. Anything to make of that? Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Yeah. From a BI perspective, it\u2019s a little bit higher some of the other line coverage. Mostly that is in higher large losses and more soft tissue injuries where there are attorney-repped. So that ends up usually being more expensive. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re reading a lot on social inflation and we have seen across the industry some pretty elevated jury verdicts that we believe are pretty egregious. So we\u2019re always keeping our eye on that. And bodily injury trends are less of a step function than were what happened with like used car prices where there was just sort of a confluence of events in terms of shortages of chips and all the things that came into play when car prices were risen. When you look at the history of BI trend, it sort of continues to move up based on attorney representation, based on medical bills, et cetera. So we\u2019re not too concerned about one quarter and we feel like we have our arms around the BI trends. Michael Phillips : Okay. Good. Thank you. And then second question just on homeowners. Can you remind us where you are with I guess the PIF reductions and cat exposed dates? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. So we talked a little bit about our PIF growth. So we\u2019re up 19% in our growth states and down 9% in our volatile states. We continue to have a really robust derisking program. So you\u2019ve seen the rate come in. We had 16 points year-to-date, 20 on the trailing 12, 5 more points to earn in this year. And then we have other rates that are elevating. So that\u2019s the first one, get the right rates on the street. We talked a lot about segmentation and what we\u2019ve been working off, our 5.0 product. Segmentation is something that we believe we are industry leaders in and we need to be at least in auto for sure in Commercial Auto. And we will be there in Property as we continue to work on segmentation. We talked about exiting about 115,000 homes in Florida last year. That takes some time by the time you communicate it to insureds and you\u2019re able to do that. And of course there can be moratoriums after states. And we\u2019ve been exiting DP3 in many states. That\u2019s obviously, we have to have prior approval through our DOIs, but we have approval in about 22 states and are working with many more to exit that line of coverage. And then really it\u2019s about cost sharing. We don\u2019t want homeowners to be a maintenance program. So we have a mandatory wind and hail deductibles, and those are kind of being through the system. And then lastly, just conversations with our agents on putting high quality business and high quality bundled business, which is usually preferred in owner occupied homes on the Progressive balance sheet. So we got it -- it\u2019s a multi-tiered plan. We knew it would take a while. We signaled this a while ago, but I feel very good about where we\u2019re at. But clearly having two huge hurricanes less than a week apart really elevates what our plan has been for a while and what will be in the future. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Gregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. I know you\u2019ve mentioned trying to leverage your agent compensation program to reward profitable business. Maybe you can spend a minute and just give us a snapshot if you\u2019ve changed how you\u2019re rewarding your agents and how they\u2019re helping you underwrite business, new business as it comes in the door. Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I\u2019ll let Pat give more color than I will, but we\u2019re constantly evolving our agents and we have agents that are more specialized. It\u2019s preferred bundling. We have our platinum agents. We have agents that have typically been more on SAMs, maybe some mom and pops, but we constantly evolve our compensation to make sure that we put high quality business on the books, but also reward those agents for that business. Pat, do you want to give any more color on that? Patrick Callahan : Sure. We have an aligned national commission structure that we have in place for either our Property agents, so those with the full suite of products or those without access to our Property products. And those matrices are designed to reward higher quality business and greater volume of business. And over time, what we see is agents respond well to understanding what the targets are, understanding how the framework works and understanding how their behaviors and the actions allocating different business to Progressive can result in better compensation for their agencies. Now, Tricia mentioned on the quality side of things, as we pivot and start to invest more to turn the Property business around, there are tactics within the agency channel that will ensure that agents know they have to be bundling business with us, they have to write with our underwriting guidelines in mind and we measure that through underwriting cancel rates, and they have to produce a certain amount of volume to retain their Property appointment with us. And we think those three in combination with a very clear, transparent national compensation plan, agents understand what we\u2019re offering, how we fit in their agencies, and ultimately, how we can mutually benefit by producing high quality, profitable business. Gregory Peters : Makes sense. For my follow-up question, in your letter, Tricia, you said you have nearly 4.2 million more policies in force than you did at the end of last year. In response to some of the questions in your prepared remarks, you talked about how you\u2019re fully staffed. Maybe you can give us a sense of how you\u2019re keeping fully staffed with such tremendous growth in a macro environment, it seems, full employment, and maybe segue, one of the things that we never get much information from you or many of your peers is how you\u2019re deploying technology and artificial intelligence, and maybe that\u2019s helping you with the growth in policy in force. So any commentary on that would be great. Tricia Griffith : Yeah. That\u2019s a really great question. So what we\u2019ve been doing, the only time that I can recall we had difficulty in hiring and retaining was sort of when the wage wars started right after the pandemic. So after that, we\u2019ve done a couple of things. We\u2019ve hired well in advance of need. So when you think about being a fully licensed sales rep in our call center or a fully trained claims rep out in the field, it takes some time. And so that\u2019s, well, it\u2019s maybe a more expensive venture at first blush. We think that pays for itself because we have high quality people handling your calls, handling your claims. And in fact, we were able to deploy between our own employees and independent appraisers to help us with the storms. 2,300 people sort of feed in the street, getting early contacts and early closures in our catastrophes, which is what our customers need us most. So we feel really good about that. From a technology and efficiency perspective, we are always talking about how do we become more efficient? One, to keep prices competitive, but two, can we take easier claims, easier calls out of the system and have humans actually handle the more complex calls? So we have overall what you can call it, AI, ChatGPT, large language miles. We\u2019ve been working on those for a long time to become more efficient. We\u2019ve had a chatbot in our call centers for over a decade because we found out we were getting repetitive calls that really didn\u2019t require human intervention and that took out about 15% of our calls. On the claim side, we have a lot of automation with our estimates. We have tagged millions and millions of pictures to be able to do that. And of course, we want to make sure that we do have human intervention to make sure we always pay the right amount and that we\u2019re accurate in that part of it. But we\u2019re very technology driven. Besides being efficient, we want to be innovative. And we want to continue to learn and make sure that we use the highly trained individuals that we have for the most complex parts of our business. So we use a lot of AI. Maybe that\u2019s something we can talk about at a later deep dive when we have some time in one of the quarters that we do that. But we feel like that\u2019s a key part overall in our efficiency, which is key to our growth. Gregory Peters : Thank you for the detail. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from a line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi. Good morning. So most of my questions were answered, but just -- it seems like many of your competitors are shifting their focus to growth as their margins have recovered. So just wondering what you\u2019re seeing in terms of competitor behavior on marketing spending and on pricing. And is it reasonable to assume that your growth over the next few quarters should slow down just as the market becomes more competitive? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I think, like I said before, our competitors, what I would say is, we got out ahead of the game. We saw what we needed. We knew that that would be frustrating because we had to raise rates so significantly to keep up with trend. We did that quickly. And our plan was that would allow us to be in a position to grow and it certainly has paid off. We are seeing -- and if you see any of the quarterly results, margins are so much better with our competition and so I would imagine that they will continue to grow. We\u2019ve seen some of our competitors, for sure, start to spend more on media. What -- for us, competition is good. And it really is about, like I said, having all those strategic players firing at the same time. So while I can\u2019t predict what our growth will be, we have models, obviously, internally that we work on. I believe we\u2019re in a really great position to wrap up 2024 and move into 2025. And I feel very confident that we will continue to gain traction. Of course, given all the unknowns that could happen with weather and what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Patrick Callahan : Yeah. The only thing that I would add is\u2026 Jimmy Bhullar : \u2026and then\u2026 Patrick Callahan : \u2026 spending more. Tricia Griffith : Hold on for a second, Jimmy. I think I wanted Pat to add on some color on that for you. Patrick Callahan : The only thing I would add is that segmentation matters. So spending more isn\u2019t necessarily going to drive the outcome folks desire. It\u2019s spending it smartly and understanding the lifetime value of the customer and the media that we use to reach those customers. So we think given our scale and given the analytics we have in place, we are creating segmentation in the media world like we have in the product segmentation space. And that segmentation enables us to understand where to spend more efficiently based on who we\u2019re able to acquire and it\u2019s not just about spending more overall, it\u2019s spending it in the right places. Additionally, I think when you see what we do on the product segmentation side, we do think that creating adverse selection for our competitors through matching rate to risk more precisely does inflate their trend different than ours over time and that synthetic trend we think requires them over time to potentially have to adjust rates differently than we have. So we\u2019re pretty confident that at this point. We are efficient in our spend. And as Tricia mentioned, we monitor it extremely closely and we\u2019ll adjust as needed over time, but we play our game and we managed our economics and they look good at this point. Jimmy Bhullar : Thanks. And it seems like obviously there\u2019s been a lot of talk about Personal interest in Commercial Lines. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of long-term trends in Personal Auto as it relates to litigation, attorney rep rates and stuff? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. Attorney rep rates have risen over the years. Again, not as a function, they\u2019ve risen, you can probably tell just by advertising from that perspective. Medical trends, as you know, from just medical insurance have continued to go up. So it\u2019s continued to trend upward, we priced for that. And some of the social inflation, like I said, with some egregious verdicts in the industry are always troublesome because it ends up, consumers have to pay for that and so we always want to get our arms around. It\u2019s really about doing what we have done well for many, many years and that is making sure that our customers know we\u2019re there for them, that they can trust us to do the right thing by them and that I try to get out in front of the claim with contacts and resolution as quickly as possible or when it\u2019s a longer term claim to make sure that we communicate and respect their needs along the way. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing since we rolled out IR years and years ago or immediate response, I should say, years ago. Just get in front of the customers, make sure they know we\u2019re there and we want them to trust us and that we\u2019ll be fair. Jimmy Bhullar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. Your line is now open. David Motemaden : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on just the auto PIF growth and I\u2019m wondering if Hurricane Helene had a notable impact in Florida or the Carolinas on auto shopping and PIF gains at the end of September and if Milton -- Hurricane Milton, is causing any disruption on retention or shopping just given the impacts of that storm? Tricia Griffith : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t say anything. The PIF growth wouldn\u2019t come from that necessarily. Obviously, there\u2019ll be some total loss vehicles that when they replace, we hope they\u2019ll be Progressive. I think that, I had asked John Murphy, our President of Claims a while ago, if we were seeing issues with inventory for new cars, I thought that could be something that could be a headwind for consumers and they didn\u2019t see inventory issues. There\u2019s enough inventory, we believe, on the street to be able to take care of those customers. But the storm, although they were big, I don\u2019t think would move the needle on either of those. David Motemaden : Got it. Thanks. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. David Motemaden : And then on the cost per sale that you spoke about, I think, last quarter it was like 30% below your targeted acquisition ratio. I\u2019m wondering where that stood here in third quarter as some of the competition returns and maybe just also if you could just talk about if ambient shopping levels, sounds like they remain high, but did they -- have they fallen any at all here during the last three months? Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I\u2019m going to try to answer that. You were breaking up a little bit. I\u2019m going to assume that\u2019s on our side. I would say we continue to see elevated shopping, continue to see a hard market and so we\u2019re going to leverage that. And again, I talked a little bit in an earlier answer on we\u2019ve got our sort of direct response, which we see right away with our highest NP6, which are new prospects, which of course, we equate to our, the apps that are such high growth on both the direct and agency side, but then also some delayed response. And so we believe ambient shopping is still up because even with the increased amount that we\u2019ve spent and we\u2019ll spend in quarter four on the delayed response ad, we\u2019re still seeing that shopping. So we feel good about that. I want to make sure I answered your question because you were breaking up a little bit. Does that answer your question? David Motemaden : Yeah. That does help on the ambient shopping. I had just asked on just how much below the targeted acquisition spend the cost per sale is. In third quarter, I think, it was 30% below in the first half of the year. Is that still pretty far below your target? Tricia Griffith : All I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s still below tax. So our CPS for quarter three is still below our target acquisition cost. And again, like Pat said, we continue, and I just had an incredible two-day media business review. We continue to understand exactly how to reach the consumers we want to reach and get more efficient with doing that all across the Board. I think normally we\u2019ll talk about mass media spend and that\u2019s a portion of our spend, but there\u2019s so many other ways that we are able to be on the short list for consumers who are shopping. So we feel good about where we\u2019re at right now with CPS below tax. David Motemaden : Great. Thank you. Tricia Griffith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is now open. Brian Meredith : Yeah. Thanks. Tricia, I was hoping you could comment a little bit about this really favorable frequency we\u2019ve been seeing for the last 12 months. Is this something you think is sustainable? Is it a function of the hard market and auto insurance? What is your perspective on it? Tricia Griffith : Thanks, Brian. For us, what we\u2019ve seen is really the biggest proportion of that is equated to our mix -- our preferred mix has increased, and so that\u2019s obviously a lower frequency. We\u2019re a little bit less negative than we were before, but still again, obviously negative 5. So we will continue to watch that as we grow and put more customers on the book. Obviously, we always want to make our target profit margins both on a calendar year and lifetime value. Brian Meredith : Got you. So mix. Got you. And then second question just quickly. Tricia Griffith : Yeah. Brian Meredith : Where are new money yields relative to book yields right now in the investment portfolio? Is there still some uplift in book yields going forward, do you think? Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I\u2019ll let Jon Bauer get on because he\u2019s always on these calls and never gets to talk. But yeah, we\u2019ve been happy that we\u2019ve been able to invest new money into higher yielding performance. And Jon, I\u2019ll let you go into some of the detail. Jon Bauer : Yeah. Thanks very much. As you\u2019ve been seeing over the last, throughout the course of the last few years, but certainly over the last few months, there\u2019s been quite a lot of volatility in interest rates, especially as we headed towards the election and the Fed started cutting rates. For us, as you know, we have a relatively short duration portfolio, just a little bit over three years. And so the two things that are going to really adjust the new money yields versus the book yields would be the underlying level of interest rates, which has risen quite significantly since the end of the third quarter. And then as well as we allocate money into and out of cash and treasuries into other risk products. Right now we have a relatively conservative allocation. And so if we were to shift that, that would increase book yields over time. But obviously the underlying movement in interest rates as -- will likely increase prospective book yields if they were to maintain around this level. But I would just want to point out that for Progressive, the driving force in our investment strategy is a total rate of return strategy. So the book yield is an output of the decisions we make. But for us, we\u2019re really looking to drive the strongest total return over the longer term. Does that answer your question? Brian Meredith : Yeah. That does. That\u2019s terrific. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is now open. Meyer Shields : Great. Great. Thank you very much. So in the past, I know we\u2019ve talked about the ordered pairs where sometimes, I guess, Progressive will maintain excess profits if the growth trade-off isn\u2019t necessarily worth it. I was hoping you could give us some insight into how much of the Personal Line margin outperformance this year is sort of ordered pairs dependent and how much of it is just the fact that you\u2019ve been surprised by loss trends? Tricia Griffith : Well, I think, I\u2019ll let Pat weigh in a little bit more. But I think the margin comes from so many different things. So if -- are we efficient in our spend to get more customers? So I wouldn\u2019t say -- I wouldn\u2019t call it excess profits. I would say we look at every dollar premium and what outputs we think would happen based on our frequency and severity trends, what we think we could spend to get more customers, the new and renewal business. And we go to each state, each product, et cetera, roll it up, roll it down and come to that. And then if we\u2019re inefficient in our spend, then we\u2019ll either try to get more efficient or pull back. If our margins shrink, we\u2019ll pull back. We have a lot of different levers, but really it all goes under the umbrella of grow as fast as we can at or below our 96%. Pat, do you want to add anything? Patrick Callahan : Yeah. And I would say that the growth that we\u2019re seeing wasn\u2019t expected earlier in the year. So we knew we had shields up when we were slowing the business down to deliver 2023 calendar year profitability and as we\u2019ve reduced some of those verification tactics and gotten, frankly, more competitive with billing options, et cetera, we have seen, as you see in the reports, outsized growth. So I don\u2019t think we entered the year saying we think we can produce this level of profit and growth on a significantly extended period. So right now you see we\u2019ve taken rates down a small amount in a number of states. And as John mentioned, our product managers constantly evolve that competitive environment to see how much ambient shopping there is, how efficient our media spend is and as we come into kind of the slower shopping period of the year, we\u2019ll be monitoring our spend and our rate level to make sure we can grow as fast as our staffing levels and service levels enable us to. So we\u2019ve got some really high comps coming into next year and feel great about how we\u2019re closing out this year. But I don\u2019t -- I think the growth is the piece of the ordered pair that was outperforming this year and it wasn\u2019t certainly in our plan at the outset to be able to capture as much growth as we have. But with competitors raising rates and restricting access to new business, your media becomes really efficient when there\u2019s not a lot of people competing for the clicks or in market with competitive rates for the shoppers. Tricia Griffith : Yeah. What I would add on that as well is and we talked about this a little bit when we had our media deep dive a quarter or so ago. We are so flexible with our media spend. And the last couple of years, unfortunately we\u2019ve had to pull back because of margins. This year, Pat and his team have come to me to increase media on several occasions and being able to be that nimble to do that and not say, okay, we have a budget at the beginning of the year which we do, we set a budget for a year we think will happen. But having that flexibility and turning things on and off pretty quickly to sort of open up or close the spigot has been key this year to open up the spigot. Meyer Shields : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful very detailed. Thank you. Can you give us an insight into, I know there\u2019s obviously this ongoing regional mix shift in Property? What are the other steps that are appropriate to get that line targeted to mine ratios? Tricia Griffith : Well, I think, it\u2019s definitely the rate increases we\u2019ve been taking. I think it\u2019s the geographic mix. It is absolutely the segmentation that will continue to deepen. It\u2019s the cost sharing with customers, like I said, with wind and hail deductibles. And it\u2019s our agency actions, making sure we have solid owner occupied homes on the book that are bundled. So it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s all the things that I talked about before and it\u2019s just one of those things that takes time and we watch it very closely. And we have a whole team of people that are constantly monitoring where we should be, where we should slow down. But those are -- it\u2019s just a plethora of things to get it right in and I have confidence that we will. Meyer Shields : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Tricia Griffith : Thank you, Meyer. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO. Your line is now open. Mike Zaremski : Hey. Great. Good morning. As a follow-up to, I think it was Brian\u2019s question about frequency, the curve being, your frequency is even better than its historic relationship to the industry. You talked about the mix towards preferred helping. I\u2019m just curious, is there a partial offset longer term? Should just the preferred customer have a different or higher severity inflation trend line than the average of the book? Tricia Griffith : I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything huge in that. I think the preferred customers could have more products. Obviously, it\u2019s a rate to risk that we\u2019re looking at. It could be stickier with other products that come with us. And really, frequency has been trending down for the last 50 years or 60 years. I\u2019m not sure what stable frequency means because it\u2019s been so oddly volatile over the last four years. But -- and also, we do want to write any business that we can. Sam Sands writes Robinsons [ph] as long as we reach our target profit margin. So we\u2019re fully open for business for any consumer as long as we can make that target profit margins. Thanks, Mike. Mike Zaremski : Okay. Got it. And my follow-up is switching gears to the competitive environment. So if we think about your average peer, they sell a lot more home insurance than Progressive does and they bundle a lot of that with auto. And I know you guys are obviously increasing your share on home and bundles, but still, I think it\u2019s much smaller than your average competitor or some of your larger competitors. So I\u2019m curious, so given home insurance is still a hard market and will be for the foreseeable future, is that dynamic causing any of your peers the need to increase the bundle pricing more so than you all are, which is kind of helping you in the competitive environment for you all to gain customers? If that was my question, if you follow it. Tricia Griffith : Yeah. I\u2019ll add in. I mean, I think it\u2019s hard because different competitors do it differently. Some are growing and have Property, but not on their own paper. Some of our competitors have sort of derisked before us and are in a position then to grow, but not necessarily in the places that have the volatile weather. And some are bundled, I mean, a lot, when you look at captive agencies are really sticky because they\u2019re bundled for a long time. That eventually, that\u2019s where we want to be able to be, whether the home is on our paper or on the sort of stable group of carriers we work with. We want to make sure that that broad coverage, just be where, when, and how customers want to shop. And that\u2019s why we developed, we obviously want to bundle more, but that bundle has to be profitable and -- but we want to make sure that we can, when people call in, give them what they need, whether it\u2019s on with our Home Quote Explorer, our Auto Quote Explorer, or our Business Quote Explorer. And sometimes, hopefully it\u2019s with us, but if not, we\u2019ll take care of them with customers or I should say businesses that we partner with. So the competitive environment we look to, but we really are playing our own game here, especially with Property as we evolve and mature. And you\u2019re right, we don\u2019t have the same probably percentage market share. Clearly we don\u2019t, but we want to take that slowly so that we make prudent decisions for the long-term of the firm. Doug Constantine : That appears to have been our final question and so that concludes our event. Again, we apologize for the technical difficulties. Victoria, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. Operator : That concludes the Progressive Corporation third quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive\u2019s website for the next year. You may now disconnect your line.",
