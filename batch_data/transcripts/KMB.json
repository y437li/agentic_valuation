We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you'd like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's first quarter earnings conference call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, VP and Controller. Here is the agenda for our call this morning. Mark will begin with a review of our first quarter results and he'll also give an update on the health care spin-off. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the full year outlook. We'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our last Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both excludes certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark Buthman : Thanks, Paul, and good morning. Let's start with the headlines. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 4% and delivered $80 million of cost savings in the first quarter. Second, we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. We're on track with our capital spending plans to grow our business, and we returned three-quarters of $1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share repurchases. And third, we're making good progress with health care spin-off activities. Now, let's go to the detail of our results. First quarter sales were $5.3 billion. That's down 1% versus last year. Underlying organic sales rose 4% led by strong growth in K-C International. Currency rates were a 3-point drag and restructuring activities reduced sales by a further 2%. First quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.7%, up 10 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating profit was even with year ago with an operating margin of 16.2%, that\u2019s up 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Results benefited from organic sales growth, $70 million of FORCE cost savings, and $10 million of additional savings from pulp and tissue restructuring actions. In addition, total between-the-line spending was down 90 basis points as a percent of sales. That's mostly due to lower G&A spending including incentive compensation. We absorbed $65 million of cost inflation and significant currency headwinds in the quarter. The total earnings drag from currency, including translation and transaction effects and losses in other income and expense, was approximately $0.15 per share. And while the adjusted effective tax rate was down slightly compared to last year, that was offset by lower equity income. Putting it all together, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.48. That's even with our all-time record performance last year. Now turning to cash flow, cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $437 million. That's down compared to $607 million last year, mostly due to higher pension contributions and working capital. Given our normal pace of cash generation and with most of our pension contributions for the year now behind us, going forward I expect cash provided by operations to pick up significantly from first quarter levels. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, first quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled $750 million. And as you know, on February, we announced our 42nd consecutive annual increase in the dividend. In terms of share repurchases, we bought back $465 million of KMB stock in the first quarter, and we continue to expect full year buybacks of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Now before we move into our segment results, let me give you a brief update on Venezuela. We measure our results in Venezuela at the rate at which we transact our business in the country. Since March of last year, that's been at the official exchange rate of VEF6.3 per US dollar. To date, we've not had access to US dollars through either the complementary currency exchange system known as SICAD or the recently announced SICAD II auction process. At this time, it's not clear if we'll be able to access either of those systems going forward or what amount of currency exchange will transact through those mechanisms in the market as a whole. So as a result, we continue to measure our operations in Venezuela at a 6.3 rate. Now in terms of bottomline earnings, although it wasn't the case in the first quarter, our full year plan continues to assume that we'll have some year-on-year earnings decline from results in Venezuela as a result of the ongoing uncertainty in that country. Like all multinationals that do business in Venezuela, we continue to closely monitor the currency market and the overall business environment there. Now I'll highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 7%. Performance was led by K-C International with organic sales up 13%. First quarter Personal Care operating margins were 19.2%, up 80 basis points year-on-year led by gains in K-C International and Europe. Moving to Consumer Tissue; organic sales were up 3% driven by higher net selling prices and slightly favorable mix. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 15.2% were healthy, and were up 10 basis points year-on-year. Turning to K-C Professional; organic sales increased 4% with volumes and net selling prices each up 2 points. Organic sales improved 16% in K-C International, but were off 2% in North America. KCP margins were solid at 17%, although down versus year ago, including the impacts from a slow start to the year on the topline in North America. Lastly, Health Care organic sales rose 1%, driven by higher volumes in medical devices. Health Care operating margins of 18.1% were up significantly versus soft performance last year. Although I don't expect full year margins to be at the first quarter levels, I am really encouraged by the team's focus and execution, while we work on preparing for the spin-off. Now, speaking of the health care spin-off, let me give you a little update on our progress. Detailed Separation planning and preparation to carve-out financial statements are well underway and broadly on track. We'll be seeking Board approval to file the spin Form 10 registration statement with the SEC in early May. Robert Abernathy who will lead the new company has assembled his senior leadership team, including naming a Chief Operating Officer and his Chief Financial Officer. We're continue to assess the impact of the spin-off on the remainder of Kimberly-Clark's operations, and as you'd expect, that includes analyzing potential actions to streamline our work and mitigate stranded costs. While this work continues to be in progress, we expect to incur some restructuring charges in order to mitigate our stranded costs. We'll provide more specifics in connection with our second quarter earnings communication in July. And finally, we expect the spin-off to be completed at the end of the third quarter or potentially in the fourth quarter of 2014. So that wraps up my comments. To recap, we achieved solid organic sales growth and cost savings. Our capital allocations plans are on track, and we're making good progress toward the spin-off of our health care business. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Falk : Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll show my perspectives on our first quarter results, and then I'll address our full year outlook. So starting with Q1, overall we had a solid quarter, solid start to the year, particularly given the headwinds we faced and the difficult earnings comparison with Q1 last year being our strongest quarter. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 4%, that\u2019s right in line with our 3% to 5% full year target. At our targeted growth initiatives, K-C International had another strong quarter with 12% organic sales growth. In diapers, our organic sales increased about 30% in China, 25% in Russia, and 15% in Brazil in the first quarter. So our Huggies business has good momentum in these three markets and broadly throughout Kimberly-Clark International, and we've got more innovation coming yet this year to help us drive additional growth. We're also doing well in our other Personal Care businesses in K-C International. That includes feminine care, which our organic sales there grew double-digits. Our adult care business was up high-single digits; and our baby wipes business, which was up mid-single digits. So, our focus on premium innovation and developing these categories continued to generate great results in these businesses and markets around the world. Elsewhere in K-C International, our KCP organic sales were up in the mid-teens rate, with strong growth in Latin America and solid progress in KCP in Asia. So on an annual basis now, the K-C Professional portion of our K-C International business is $1 billion for us and with attractive margins. So we're continuing to push hard to take advantage of opportunities where industrialization and economic development are occurring. So overall, we're executing well on K-C International, and we're very optimistic about our top and bottomline growth prospects in that part of the business. In terms of topline growth in other parts of our business, we're broadly on track except for K-C Professional in North America. There we're off to a slow start in the year. There were some impacts from the severe weather that we had in the US in January and February and conditions in that business have improved more recently and we're expecting better performance as we roll forward into the year. On the innovation front, we're off to a good start for the year. In K-C International, we continue to launch innovations across our product lineup. We got a heavy focus on Huggies diapers and diaper-pants, premium feminine care products and adult care offerings coming to market this year. In North America, we've launched innovations on Huggies diapers, Depend briefs and Viva towels. We've got more near-term activity happening, including improvements to Huggies diapers and baby wipes, new Poise microliners and upgrades to our U by Kotex product lineup. Our brand positions in North America remain solid overall. Our first quarter market shares are up even with year-ago levels in six of the eight US consumer categories that we track. In terms of the bottomline, as Mark mentioned, we had headwinds from currency exchange rates and cost inflation. To offset these challenges, we raised selling prices where we can. We're driving our cost savings programs and we're controlling our overhead spending carefully. And finally, as Mark already highlighted, we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways, and that's a key part of our global business plan. So overall, we're executing well in a challenging environment. So now as we move to the outlook for 2014, we continue to be optimistic about our prospects to drive profitable and healthy growth, and that means we're focused on delivering solid organic sales growth, increasing our advertising and research and development spending and generating healthy levels of cost savings and cash flow and then allocating that capital that we generate in the business in shareholder-friendly ways. In terms of our financial objectives, we're confirming our previous outlook for 2014 top and bottomline growth. On the topline, our organic sales growth target remains 3% to 5%. We got solid topline momentum right now and that's driven by our targeted growth initiatives and our innovation and we expect that to continue going forward. On the bottomline, we continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $6 to $6.20. We're closely monitoring the external environment, including currency markets, commodity costs and the overall competitive and economic environment. As I'm sure most of you know, currency markets in particular have been more volatile since the beginning of the year, most notably in Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. So going forward, we're planning for currency raise to be broadly similar to spot rates that we've seen in the marketplace recently. And in terms of input cost inflation, at this point in time, it's more likely that our full year input cost would be in the upper half of our previously estimated range of $150 million to $250 million. And that's mostly due to additional inflation in some international markets, particularly in Latin America. So regardless of the environment, we're staying focused on our strategies and our plans to improve our business. We're convinced that successful execution of our global business plan will continue to result in strong returns for our shareholders. So that wraps up our prepared remarks. And now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein : Hey, just a few questions, some short term, some longer term. More on kind of short and medium term, it looks like your net price of only 1% is lower than currency. Obviously it's lower than what we'd expect inflation to be globally, and we've seen this for a lot of HPC categories. Can you give us a sense of whether that's just a timing issue or do you believe some of your categories are kind of secularly deflationary here? And I guess is your pricing any different than your competition, so are you closing or expanding price gaps? And then just that gap in terms of net price versus currency and what do you expect for inflation seems to be pretty big and not closing recently? Tom Falk : Yeah, I guess I\u2019d say Ali, if you look across our segments, I mean the only one that had negative price in the quarter was Health Care, and that's probably one that is a carryover of adjusting some of the exam glove prices related to the fall-off of synthetic nitrile. So as the commodity cost in that particular area has dropped, we've seen more price drop there. Across the balance, I would say we've done a pretty good job in K-C International of getting price to wherever there's been major currency weakness, particularly in Latin America. In North America, broadly there has been relatively little price. We've gotten a little bit in tissue through some de-sheeting and you saw that in the quarter. We've got a little bit in diapers. Again, there we got some of the count reduction. It's just starting to go into effect. We didn't get much of that in the first quarter, so you'll get a little bit more in the second quarter. And I think broadly, our strategy is to try to line up where we can and be competitive in the marketplace and then win on innovation, and that's a strategy that's worked pretty well for us over the long term. Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein : But it doesn't sound like you see the gap between even just currencies in your overall net price closing any time soon. Tom Falk : Well, if you look at the amount of price that we got, it was roughly equal to the amount of cost inflation that we had in the quarter. I think it was what Paul, $60 million-ish of price and about $65 million of cost inflation. So if you just looked at those two numbers, obviously currency was a factor as well, and there was a lot of other moving parts, but those two more or less lined up. Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein : So two other kind of broader questions. One is if you just look at your representation online versus offline in both diapers and Consumer Tissue, in North America at least it looks not to be the same between online and offline representation for you guys, and I was just trying to get a sense of how you guys think of that channel, whether you plan to close that gap and what it's going to take to do so, so one is an online question. And then the other one, I might as well throw it in here is just over the years and decades really, you guys have as a company focused more and more on pruning some pieces of the business, Heath Care most recently, but Western Europe before that, go back to Neenah as far back as you want, I mean just along the timeframe that's been happening, do you see ever a time where you were a separate Personal Care and Consumer Tissue business just given the different trajectory those two businesses are on? Tom Falk : I guess on the first question on the online versus offline in diapers versus tissue, I'd say the Personal Care stuff is probably a little bit more efficient to ship on an online environment. It's not to say that you won't see it in the offline or having tissue move into online as well, but I do think Personal Care, diapers in particular is a bigger item. And I think many of the online retailers want diapers for a lot of the same reasons that other retailers are focused on that category, because they want to get the young family as a regular customer. So, I remember not that many years ago when Toys\"R\"Us was our largest diaper customer, because they were trying to capture the young family at that point. So I guess I would say I don't expect that gap to close. I would expect diapers and Personal Care will probably be bigger online, but we'll see if we're out by everything online, then maybe that gap will eventually close. On the portfolio shaping question, we've been around for 140 years and our first product was newsprint. And so thankfully, it's people who have been shaping our portfolio for a long, long time. So at this point, I don't see a path to what you described that you break them apart. There's a lot of efficiency in going to market together. Tissue is a strong cash generator, but there are some markets in the world where we don't have a big tissue presence. Today, our business in China is predominantly Personal Care, although we've got a rapidly growing KCP business in China, which is again tissue related in many areas. So again, we think we're doing all the right things to shape the portfolio. We'll continue to challenge and test that, and we're not afraid to make calls that we think are shareholder-friendly over the long term. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Could you just talk about some of the SG&A leverage, kind of why maybe some of the incentive compensation, I don't know if it got reversed or was always based on plan and then what the advertising spending did in the quarter and if the outlook for the year is still to grow it faster than the sales? Tom Falk : Yeah, I think on the incentive comp, last year's first quarter was a little high. And so, it's partly removing the accruals around for the three-year restricted shares, and as you start to have your performance level and plans tick up, so we topped it up a bit last year in the first quarter. This year, with some of the weakness in currency, it got reduced a little bit. So the net swing was probably a good chunk of the swing on the G&A front, but nothing fundamentally changing on the plans beyond that. And then on the advertising, we're basically down 10 basis points from last year, but up nicely sequentially. And so, we'd say last year's first quarter was the highest quarter of the year, and so we were well above the other three quarters in the first quarter. We've also got a little bit more back-end loaded innovation. So we feel pretty good about the level of spend in advertising. I think research spending was up 10 basis points in the quarter, so we continue to invest in R&D and product development. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : So the same, the guidance still prevails for advertising spending and growing faster than sales for the year? Tom Falk : Yeah. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Is it too earlier to ask you questions about the structure of the health care spend? I mean when will we get sort of the sense for how it's going to impact earnings, what kind of leverage are you going to put on the spend, dividend back to you guys to buy back stock? Is that still premature? Can you guys give us a little bit of a hint? Tom Falk : Yeah, I think it's probably a little early. We'll give you more color on the second quarter. The Form 10 comes out, you get a good look at the historical financials of the thing. And so you'll have a chance to do that. And we'll have more detail on what the impact is going to be. Mark mentioned some restructuring activity, what stranded cost that we have that we're going to get rid of. So we're actively working on all that stuff and we'll have more to talk about that in the second quarter call. Operator : Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail Glazerman - UBS: Can you talk a little bit in detail what you're seeing in terms of the dynamics in the tissue market? I guess last quarter, you talked about the GT kind of regaining their strides. There's maybe a little bit of messiness to some of the private label. So you're any more or less concerned with the capacity that's come on over the last year? And then looking forward, we've had a couple of announcements of new supply coming on over the next couple of years. Do you think the market will be able to support that? Tom Falk : Yeah, I would say I feel pretty good about the capacity balance in North American tissue. At this point, if I look at the volume weakness that we had in North America in the first quarter, it was more to do with weak cold and flu season and some shortfall in facial tissue. Our continental business has done a little bit, but we had a very strong first quarter last year because of some of the challenges that GP had had. And so at this point, we feel pretty good about our innovation strategy. We launched Viva Vantage, which is a new paper towel, and that's off to a good start in the quarter. And so I think we've got a pretty big innovation portfolio. We're working across all those brands. And I'd expect to continue to drive those businesses. Growth rates, they're not going to be as high as the adult care business in North America, but we still think there is opportunity for innovation and mix accretion there. Gail Glazerman - UBS: And just kind of taking maybe a bigger macro view, you mentioned some of the weather weakness in K-C Professional, looking through that, how confident are you on the underlying, I guess, in North America and the underlying macro environment and demand environment? Tom Falk : Gail, I hate blaming weather for anything, because you'd like to think that our products are more essential. So I was really picking on our K-C Professional team when they were trying to explain this to me with weather. People who have didn't come to work, didn't use hand towels. People are more able to get to the welding job site didn't use our safety products. And so we really lost hours of work in the first quarter. That was a significant hit. When you talk to our distributor customers, they would say they're seeing in their numbers in the first quarter and most of those guys are not public reporters. So you may be not as able to see it as easily. And they saw the March volumes picked up and they're feeling like back to more of the underlying rate of growth in the economy. So we'll see. But we've got a pretty aggressive plan baked in to try and get as much of that back in the last nine months as we can. But some of those hours lost due to weather aren't going to be recovered. Gail Glazerman - UBS: And then just lastly on the European restructuring, when do we comp than most of the change and when would we start to see more of a steady state [ph] comp? Tom Falk : Really I think April was about the end of the sales cut off when we exited most of the markets. So it should be pretty well flushing through the sales decline in the second quarter numbers. Paul, that makes sense? Paul Alexander : Yeah, I think you should expect that the second quarter will look pretty similar to the first quarter. We had about 2 points of lower sales on restructuring activities. That's likely to be about right in the second quarter and then it should basically go away. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup: My question had to with the fem care business. The tampon market shares that we're seeing in North America look terrific, but the pad market shares are not as strong. And I'm just wondering what you think that is? Are you literally searching Kotex consumers from one product to the next, or is it something that you need more innovation or different pricing in the pad market, because shares have been down there fairly steadily for a while? Tom Falk : Yeah, if you look at our fem care share, we have been launching a lot of innovation on tampons and have got some of really unique and terrific products that are out there and doing well in the marketplace. On the pad side, we've probably lost share on our Kotex Natural Balance and have not gained at all back on U by Kotex. And so we do have some innovation coming on the pad business. And the encourage thing is a lot of that innovation is already launching in other markets outside the US. And I mentioned in my remarks that we're actually seeing double-digit growth in fem care outside the US, which is well faster than the category growing in those markets. So we're encouraged and we expect to see some better trajectory in the US later this year. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup: And can you remind which is a stronger gross margin business just in the US specifically, tampons versus pads for you? Tom Falk : Pads is historically a stronger gross margin business for us, but we're also doing some work on our cost structure to get our tampon business more efficient going forward. And so we're hoping to close some of that gap. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup: And then my second question is just on the international statistics that you give us, China, Russia and Brazil, the volume growth in diapers. They're just so volatile quarter-to-quarter and they're all strong and are all great and sometimes they accelerate and sometimes they decelerate. But they're just so lumpy. It's hard to tell, oh, gosh, Brazil was like it slowed sequentially a lot despite any easy comp. Can you explain why those numbers are so lumpy? Is it that your market share slumps around or is it just the supply chain issue, because just month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, it seems really hard to predict? Tom Falk : Yeah, I would say part of it has to do with cycle of innovation. So if you looked at China, we've been growing at 40 and now I think in the first quarter, we were at 30. We were at 70-ish cities and now we got 90 by the end of last year. We went from 90 to 95 in the first quarter. So the rate of new city expansion is probably slowing a little bit, which is why those numbers are coming down. In Russia, we launched a number of diaper pant codes last year in a boy/girl format that's really taking off. And so that market ramped up from kind of high single-digits to mid-20s. And so that's probably the face of it there. In Brazil, we also have launched diaper pants and are expanding it into the Northeast part of the country. We've been represented there, but it's really we're putting more feet on the ground and more capability there. And so each market has got its own story as to what's going on. But mostly, it's broader distribution and timing of when innovation gets launched that can drive it from quarter-to-quarter. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup: But in each of those markets, you wouldn't say that either the pricing dynamic has changed? I mean we read a lot about lower price competition coming into China, but it seems like your volume growth is still strong in each of those markets broadly speaking. Tom Falk : I mean there's a lot of competition everywhere. So in China in particular, Proctor, Unicharm, Kao are all over the mid and premium tiers. Hang On is all over the lower part of the marketplace. And so we feel like we have a winning product everyday to be able to compete and are really focused on that. Brazil, P&G is a big competitor in Brazil and Unicharm is just building a plant to launch there later this year. And so we're really trying to make sure we're driving as much innovation into the market and be prepared for that and have a very strong position in the marketplace before competition comes. In Russia, we've run into P&G as well as some other local competitors. So yeah, there is no shortage of people that want to launch everyday. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : So just back to pricing on FX, just curious do you expect there to be more FX related pricing or you're taking about as much as you're comfortable with give where the stock price are today? Tom Falk : I think that at this point, we feel like we've done a pretty good job of getting price into the marketplace, but there's also been quite a bit of volatility. If FX markets continue to move in particular markets, we won't be shy about taking additional price. And again, some of it was taken during the quarter, so may not have been fully reflected in the quarter. So you could have some rollout effect later in the year. But broadly, we've been pretty aggressive about trying to take prices as these exchange markets have moved. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : So it sounds like based on, I guess, it seems very recently a little bit more of a recovery in currencies, you've priced all that you've done it based on the recent movement in price, maybe haven't sort of annualized all of that, not annualized, but you haven't seen a lot come through yet. So it's possible next quarter has a little bit better pricing line than this quarter. Is that basically right? Tom Falk : Yeah, that's probably right. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : (inaudible) is calling like basically $80 and $90 per ton pulp decrease, sort of by the middle of '14. It seems like both on eucalyptus and BSK. Is that in your numbers, because that way you expect to happen as well as that part of your commodity guidance? Tom Falk : So if you look at northern softwood, which we are calling our outlook as around $1,000 a ton give or take. The March price is $1,030. Eucalyptus, we're calling that for more $800 to $830 and the March price was $870. So on average for the year, we're probably not quite as aggressive. It depends on when you assume the (inaudible) thing happens. If you average that for the year, we're probably more in line. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : And then just one last one on Venezuela. I guess that you haven't had any transactions on SICAD or SICAD II. But I'm trying to understand the rationale for staying with the less conservative 6.3 rate. Do you guys think that on a sustainable basis, 6.3 is where you will transaction and get the proponents or the majority of whatever cash you are able to get out in the market? Or do you actually believe that you will at some point see the evaluation, you just don't know what are these yet, so you're not going to take it? Tom Falk : I don't think I can remember in my entire career a situation like this in a significant currency market where you've got a range from 6 at the rate to if you look at SICAD II it's trading at 50. And so I do think that something is going to happen to close that gap at some point, because it's not sustainable to have that kind of a spread in a marketplace. And so I'm looking at this from two perspectives, what do we need to do operate in Venezuela, so how do we set pricing, how do we import product, how do we pay the bills and manage our exposure level. So that's one set of activities. Today, we're getting all the funds related to import at least in the first quarter at the (inaudible) rate. And we're not eligible, even applied for the SICAD I rates. And so as SICAD II just started to trade, very little funds have flowed through that and it's unclear whether anybody has gotten any money out of the country using that mechanism. So we're going to continue to watch this. I would guess at some point, something is probably going to happen to narrow that gap. And in the meantime, we feel like we've given enough transparency. We'll also be filing our 10-Q today. It's the first time we filed the Q on the same day of the earnings call with a little bit more disclosure. So everyone will be able to see what our balance sheet exposure is. We've given enough information about how big it is in the income statements, about investors that want to apply different rate to those have got the ability to do that. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : And you're just following up to that? I mean it looks like Procter and Colgate basically generally it seems like for every 1 point of exposure on the topline, it's been like 1 point, bottomline ongoing exposure to the P&L. So you guys are about 2%. That would sort of make it look like an annualized 2% hit if you were at the 11.8 or whatever it is today. Does that make sense? Tom Falk : It really depends on pricing. So I mean that's the other dimension here is that the price control of economy. And so you can make any exchange rate work if you get pricing really. And so it's a question of what way are you going to get funds and each of those individual exchange rates can you price for them in the business where there's enough margin to make sense to operate. So that's why you come back and say, if we're running all the different scenarios if we could only get money at this rate, what price level we have to achieve to have an operation that makes sense. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : First on SG&A, it sounded like in a response to a previous question that a lot of the decline year-over-year for this quarter has to do with timing of when incentive compensation hits the P&L. So first, is the big decline in SG&A margin this quarter just a matter of timing, because it seems like Health Care was clearly a major driver. It seems like margins for both Personal Care and Consumer Tissue were also up. So maybe you can give a little bit detail on what is sustainably lower in SG&A that's in the card for 2014? Tom Falk : Yeah, it's probably more that last year's first quarter was a little high. If you're going to go look back, it was one kind of a high watermark, I think, in recent quarter as a percent of sales. And so this quarter is a little bit lower than average. And part of that was related to incentive comp was probably the biggest swing. And it was more about every quarter we're looking at our three-year forecast. We got the restricted shares that vest on three-year improvement in sales and ROIC and looking at what our plan looks like and making adjustments up or down. Last year's first quarter was a little higher. Increase in expense this year's first quarter was a small decrease in expense, and that swing drove a good share of the difference. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Do you expect for Q2 through Q4, the rest of the year, still expect SG&A to be down year-over-year? Tom Falk : Yeah, we would say that this year should be flat to down slightly for SG&A is a good planning assumption. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then on the topline, clearly 4%-plus organic is very solid, but you adjusted the midpoint on your range of 3% to 5% and the organic sales comps do get tougher as the year progresses. You mentioned some innovation. Can you talk about the cadence of innovation as the year progresses? Tom Falk : Yeah, we've got a pretty full calendar around the world of diaper and fem care, adult incontinence improvements coming to market. So you'll hear more about things happening on that front. It's probably a little back-end loaded this year relative to maybe where it's been in the past, but still should see a solid progress on that front. And we feel we've got pretty good momentum happening in the business right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : I was wondering if you'd noticed any change in the rate of sales in Russia and Ukraine. It seems some companies report strong sales in January and February, but decline in March because of the unrest. So could you just give us some indication of the tempo of your business? Tom Falk : We really didn't see a big impact on the business. Obviously, it's part of the world we're watching very closely and trying to make sure our people were safe and that our supply chains were secure. And we really didn't have any product supply problems. With some of the currency swing in Russia, we were able to get a little bit of price on Personal Care as it reflected some of the import portion of the materials. And I think Ukraine is a relatively small business for us, but didn't have any significant disruption there that was obvious in the numbers anyway. So no, it was a pretty solid quarter for that part of the world. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. And that continues into April? Tom Falk : No bad news so far, Connie, anyway. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : And as the Q is coming out today, could you just tell us if you quantified the impact of a move to SICAD II and what that is? Tom Falk : We just put the dollar exposure on the balance sheet in the Q and then you can apply whatever rate to it that you'd like. Paul Alexander : As a reminder, in 2013, Venezuela was about 2% of our total consolidated sales and about 3% of adjusted operating profit. Operator : Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : I would like to come back to the competition pricing environment. In the US, track data shows share losses related to Procter. So what happened after you did the change in diaper count. If you were losing share when you had more diapers per pack, do you think that what would be the impact of effectively increasing prices in the US if you're losing share to Procter right now? And that would be question one. And question two, you referred to Mexico last conference call and the income was down way beyond what the peso would suggest. So would assume the pricing environment in Mexico continues to be aggressive. So if you can give us an update on Mexico as well. Tom Falk : On the diaper question, in the US, and so basically if you look year-on-year in the quarter, we're probably down a couple of share points on Huggies. Most of that is lost to Luvs. So Pampers has basically been about flat. And so sequentially our diaper shares are actually up just a tick, but relatively flat in this environment. And so as we look at the price change roll into the marketplace, we fully realize it on the super-premium part of the lineup that competes most with Pampers and we're only taking a part of the increase on the main line to try to narrow the gap with Luvs, because Luvs did fully participate in the price count change that went into effect in the fourth quarter. So we're hoping we can actually narrow the price gap a bit with Luvs on the main line business and line up on the premium business. On the Mexico question, K-C Mexico is going to announce earnings later this week. And so I'll let them give you a little bit more color on their call. I guess I would say broadly economic conditions in Mexico continue to be challenging with less growth overall in the economy than forecasted. And they had a fairly challenging fourth quarter. And I'd say some of the same challenges that they had in the fourth quarter seem to continue into the first quarter. But the team down there is committed to continue to improve their business and they've got a solid track record and they'll deliver improved results in the back half for the year. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : One more thing would be Venezuela situation. It seems like you flag it as a driver of topline growth this quarter. Could you tell us why was it up? It is like Wendy said it has to do with the volatility of the year ago, if you can tell us what was the organic volume growth or sales growth in Venezuela. I imagine that you don't have any pricing. And if it is significant, why was it up so much if you can explain that? Tom Falk : It's pretty simple, Javier. If we get letters of credit to bring product and we bring it in and sell it in the marketplace. If we don't, we don't. And so in the fourth quarter, we got quite a few letters of credit. We brought the product in, in the first quarter and sold it through in the marketplace. And it was probably more heavily oriented to bath tissue. And so if you look at our international tissue growth in the Consumer Tissue category, it was probably more driven by Venezuela this quarter than it would have been in the past. If you look at the total K-C International topline, it was probably a couple of points of extra boost to the K-C International topline in the quarter, but that would be more the nature of it. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : Would it be kind of a 30%, 40% growth in Venezuela? Tom Falk : I don't have the numbers in front of me. We can give you more detail. But it's a couple of percent of our sales. And K-C International was 39% of our overall sales. So you can kind of figure out. You can get close enough to the math, I would guess. Operator : Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : First question is you did call out a pretty significantly sized, I guess, charge tied to Middle East regulation and maybe I missed it. But could you tell us what's going on there and is this truly one-time or is there something going on that could impact how we should look at the business there? Tom Falk : Obviously it's one-time in the sense that we hope that doesn't happen again, but it's also one of the things you're planning around the world that the governments can adopt unusual tax positions that you didn't expect. And I'll have Mark give you a little bit more color. But essentially, we put capital into a market and the government decided to apply a value-added tax to that capital contribution. We obviously disagreed, but we lost the court case. So we booked a non-recurring charge. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : I know this dances around quite a bit, but anything else you can tell us about the other income expense line. As I look at it sort of the recurring component of that, it was about $18 million. Was there anything that you would call out that would have explained that being so high this quarter? Tom Falk : Yeah, it was all currency transactional losses and probably heavily oriented to the Ukraine and I think there was the other market, Argentina. So wherever you saw big currency ships and we had a dollar-based payable, you wind up taking a hit on the transactional currency line. You can't hedge some of these markets effectively. And so that flows through other income and expense. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : I know we're going to get more data or detail on the Health Care and I know it was probably down a bit last year, but certainly was a great swing year-over-year. Do you think you'll see year-over-year profits go up every quarter this year? I know the third quarter is tougher comparison. And I'm not trying to pin you down, but sort of getting an idea of how sustainable this improvement is. Tom Falk : Well, we're off to a good start, no question. They had some one-timers that went against them. Last year in the first quarter, they probably had a couple of things that broke their way this year's first quarter. So I wouldn't necessary apply this margin rate to the full year. They're probably a little ahead of expectation. So I think the good news is, is that while we're doing all this work to get ready for the spin, the business is continuing to operate and execute in a very effective level and they had a solid first quarter overall top and bottomline. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : And then lastly, I know there is a corporate expense when you strip out the one-time items, was down quite a bit. And I was imagining maybe pension is helping you there. But should we see that continue to be down year-over-year throughout the year on that line? Tom Falk : It's probably not so much pension helping us, Chip, as the other incentive comp that we talked about earlier that was in there last year and that was high last year and down this year. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : And so how should we think about the rest of the year? I guess it's a function of the stock and earnings. Tom Falk : I'd say broadly, it'd probably fall the similar G&A guidance, but it's flat to down slightly. Operator : At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue. Paul Alexander : All right. Thank you, David. We will wrap up with a comment from Tom. Tom Falk : So once again, solid first quarter, lots of things going on in the business. And we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thanks very much. Paul Alexander : Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation.

We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow up if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller. Here is the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with a review of our second quarter results and then give an update on the health care spin-off. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year and we'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements this morning. Please see the Risk Factors section of our last Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark Buthman : Thanks, Paul, and good morning. Let's start with the headlines. First we achieved organic sales growth of 5%, led by 10% growth in KC International; second, we increased adjusted earnings per share 6% driven by organic sales growth and cost savings and third, we\u2019re on track with our overall capital plan including working capital, cash generation, capital spending and returning cash to shareholders.  Now let\u2019s cover the details of our results. Second quarter sales were $5.3 billion up more than 1% versus last year. Underlying organic sales rose 5% led by strong growth in KC International, currency rates were at 2% drag and restructuring activities reduced sales by 1 point. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.8% that\u2019s up 30 basis points year on year. Adjusted operating profit was up 5% versus year ago with an operating margin of 16.1%, it\u2019s up 60 basis points compared to prior year. Results benefited from organic sales growth, $75 million of forced cost savings and $10 million of savings from pulp and tissue restructuring actions. On the other hand we absorbed significant currency headwinds. The total earnings drag including translation and transaction effects and losses was approximately $0.11 per share in the quarter.  We also absorbed $60 million of input cost inflation. We now expect that full year inflation will be towards the high end of our previously estimated range of $150-250 million, that takes into account additional inflation in some international markets in a somewhat tighter virgin fiber market. To support our brands and innovations we increased advertizing spending by $15 million in the quarter, that\u2019s up 20 basis points as a percent of sales.  Now moving down to P&L, equity income fell 27% driven by softness at KC de Mexico, KC de Mexico\u2019s market positions remain strong and their primary markets of bathroom tissue and diapers they have market shares well into the 60s. However given recent results and the challenging macroeconomic environment, we now expect that our full year equity income will be down compared to last year and our original expectations for this year. Putting it all together second quarter adjusted earnings per share were a $1.49, that\u2019s up 6% year on year.  Now turning to cash flow, cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $842 million, that\u2019s up 46% year on year mostly due to working capital improvements and lower pension contributions. We continue to manage primary working capital very well, our year to date cash conversion cycle is down two days compared to full year 2013 so we\u2019re in great shape to meet or potentially exceed a one to two day improvement objective.  In terms of capital allocation second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $800 million, we repurchased $476 million of KMB stock in the quarter and we continue to expect full year share repurchases of $1.3 to $1.5 billion. Now I\u2019ll highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter, in personal care organic sales rose 7%, performance was led by KC International with organic sales up 13%. Second quarter personal care operating margins were 18.6%, that\u2019s up 50 basis points year on year led by gains in KC International and Europe.  Moving to consumer tissue organic sales were up 3%, consumer tissue operating margins of 14.7% were up a 120 basis points year on year driven by selling price increases and cost savings.  Turning to KC Professional, organic sales increased 3%, performance was led by 13% growth in KC International, organic sales were off slightly in North America.  Our KCP margins were solid at 17.9% although they were down versus a very strong year ago performance. And lastly healthcare organic sales were up slightly with healthcare operating margins of 15.9% were up nicely versus a soft result last year. And I am really encouraged by the team\u2019s execution as we prepare for the spin-off.  Now let me turn to the planned spin-off of our healthcare business which will become Halyard Health. We are making good progress overall. Our initial Form-10 registration statement was filed with the SEC in May and an amendment with first quarter financial information is filed in June. Halyard senior management team is in place and selection of the Board of Directors is underway with a lead director and chair of the audit committee are renamed. Separation planning is well underway and we're targeting to complete the transaction at the end of October. We are continuing to assess the impact of the spin-off on our remaining K-C operations. Stranded costs are estimated to be about 2% to 3% of our annual adjusted operating profit and in near term these costs will be partially offset by incremental share repurchases and transition services agreements which we'll have in place with Halyard.  As I mentioned in April, we expect to incur some restructuring charges in order to fully mitigate the impact of stranded overhead and to improve our overall organizational efficiency. Our work in this area is ongoing and we expect to share our plans in conjunction with our third quarter earnings communications in October. So, that wraps up my comments. To recap, we achieved solid organic sales growth. We delivered healthy cost savings and bottom-line growth and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways.  Now, I will turn it over to Tom. Tom Falk :  Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. I will share my perspectives on our second quarter and then I will address our full year outlook. So, starting with Q2, we delivered another quarter of good performance overall. Our organic sales growth in the quarter was 5% that\u2019s at the high end of our 3% to 5% full year target. As you think about targeted growth initiatives K-C International had another strong quarter with 10% organic sales growth and improved margins. In diapers, our organic sales increased approximately 30% in Russia and Eastern Europe, 20% in China and 15% in Brazil. Our Huggies business continues to generate excellent top-line growth in these markets and at the same time we're making good progress in improving the bottom-line. We're also doing well in our other personal care businesses in K-C International. Organic sales were up double-digits in both feminine care and adult care and mid-single digits in baby wipes. Our focus on premium innovation and category development continues to generate good results in these businesses. Elsewhere in K-C International KCP organic sales were at a low-teens rate that was led by growth in Latin America and solid progress in China. We're continuing to push harder to further build this business where industrialization and economic development are occurring.  We've also implemented a number of selling price increases in K-C International in response to weaker currencies and cost inflation. These have been executed well and in general have not impacted underlying demand. So, overall we have good momentum at K-C International and we remain very optimistic about our prospects there going forward. In terms of top-line growth in North America, volumes were on track, are ahead of plan and our adult care business and baby wipes and in our feminine care business. We're also largely on target in consumer tissue although we're responding to increased competitive promotion activity in the bathroom tissue category. On the other hand, volumes were below expectations in diapers and in our K-C Professional washroom business. And our teams there are focused on improving performance by better leveraging our innovation, marketing and selling capability.  Regarding innovation activities we are making good progress overall. In K-C International, our focus on innovation in diapers and diaper pants, premium feminine care and adult care, continues to deliver strong growth for us.  In North America, I am encouraged that innovations are helping grow our brands like Poise, Depend, U by Kotex, Viva and Huggies baby wipes. Our brand positions are solid overall and reflect our innovation launches and increased advertising spending. Our market shares in the U.S. improved or even with year ago in six of eight consumer categories that we track and were growing faster than the category in a number of our markets in KCI. In terms of bottom-line, I am encouraged with our second quarter improvement in margins and earnings despite the headwinds that Mark mentioned, some of that bottom-line improvement was due to benefits from the strategic changes we've made in Europe. We've also just started to more formally bring together our European and Middle East and Africa teams into one organization to streamline decision making and improve efficiencies there. While we got more work to do, I am encouraged by our progress in Europe.  Finally, as Mark has already highlighted, we continue to operate our company with financial discipline by generating significant cost savings and cash flow and allocating capital in shareholder friendly ways. So, in summary we're executing our global business planned strategies well in a challenging environment and we are essentially on track with our overall plans for the first half of the year. Now moving on to our outlook for the full year. We continue to be optimistic about our prospects to drive profitable and healthy growth. On the top-line, we continue to target organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. We got a good momentum in this area with 5% organic growth to the first half of the year. While comparisons get more difficult in the back half of the year, we expect to make further progress with our targeted growth initiatives and innovation programs. On the bottom-line, we expect to deliver full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6 to $6.15. Compared to our previous guidance, we've narrowed the range modestly by bringing down the top end by $0.05 a share. This recognizes a slightly more difficult external environment including the outlook for commodities and business conditions for K-C to Mexico, some of the consumer tissue promotion activity in North America and overall competitive activity in general. Regardless of the environment we continue to be optimistic about our future. We're staying focused on our strategies to protect and improve our brands and our business and we remain convinced that successful execution of our global business plan will continue to result in strong returns to our shareholders. So that wraps up our prepared remarks and now we'll begin to take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research : Two questions, first with regard to on the contemplated restructuring program, are you expecting that to be bigger than just to address the stranded overhead cost associated with the spin or is that limited to specifically that transaction?  And then second of all, there has been a lot written and a lot of speculation about Proctor entering the adult incontinence market, and I\u2019m just wondering if there are anything you are doing in anticipation of that or on -- to better position yourself? Obviously you\u2019ve got an incredible position already. But is there anything you do differently now if that is coming down the pike? Thanks. Tom Falk : Good question. Wendy, on the first one, the restructuring; we will give you more color on that in the third quarter call. I mean at the minimum we are going to make sure we eliminate the stranded overhead and Mark gave you a guidance on the range of that as 2% to 3% of our operating profit. At the same time we're asking our teams broadly to say are there other things that as we look at Kimberly-Clarke post healthcare spin that we could do to make ourselves even more efficient. And so we\u2019ll be evaluating those ideas over the next few months and give you more color on that in October.  On the Procter front, we've been going hard to drive dependent employees pretty aggressively as you\u2019ve probably seen over the last several years. And I think having a great innovation portfolio behind those brands is the best defense for any kind of competitive activity. And so we'll continue to drive innovation and try to drive the category growth and we think that will serve us well over the medium-term. Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research : And then just two questions, follow-up. On the restructuring side, are you contemplating any additional product line exit, what you did with diapers in Western Europe or is it really just cost related? And then secondarily, what\u2019s your confidence in the pricing dynamic in adult diapers? I mean they are obviously very expensive product. Do you feel like you've got a sufficient range of products? Is there a chance that Proctor comes in and undercuts you and there is negative pricing in the category? How do you think about that? Tom Falk : Sure, on the restructuring, I would say it\u2019s primarily going to be cost related. I wouldn\u2019t envision there is any product line exists, going on there and so it really is more just looking at our talent where we got it and we have the right capability in the right places and other things we can do better from a shared service or centrally, that we're taking a look at as a chance to look at your overhead structure when you have a transaction like the spin.  On the second question, on the pricing dynamic, we obviously haven\u2019t seen full visibility of what Proctor is going to do. And so we'll make sure we're competitive in the marketplace. But behind a lot of the innovation that we brought -- we have brought DEPEND Real Fit for man and Silhouette for women to the market last year. That\u2019s probably our most income challenged consumer. And because those products work so much better, we picked up 9 to 10 share points behind a more expensive product offering. And so we are not shy about pricing for the innovation when we\u2019ve got real game changing innovation to bring to market. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : I guess, first on pricing, with the plus 2 in the quarter was pretty strong. I guess, I love your thoughts on -- what\u2019s driving that, what\u2019s the promotional environment like? Obviously we know there are some tissue [indiscernible] going on but, what would your outlook be? You think that plus 2 you put up, but when does it start to decelerate, as you moved through the year or in fact do you think that some of this currency driven pricing at a lag might keep it up at that plus 2 rate for a little while? Tom Falk : That\u2019s a great question and I think if you look at where we got most of the price, it was in the markets that have had significant currency devaluation and local inflation as a result. So places like Brazil, Argentina, Russia, the Ukraine, other markets like that where you\u2019ve seen pretty rough currency market. You've seen everybody and across all categories taking price pretty aggressively in a pretty good bit of inflation. So again I think a lot of that has happened and as we'll get some comp of that flowing through for the next several quarters. But I guess, I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s a long term trend at this stage. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess on topline, just a couple of quick things. First on China, obviously plus 20 is a great growth rate this quarter but it's gone from 45 to 35, from 30 to 20. So when is it -- is plus 20, is that kind of where you think China settles out or might be even slip a little bit further given how robust that bridge still is and then overall, Tom, you mentioned obviously that comps get tougher in the back half of the year for the business as a whole. You mentioned that the innovation pipeline, I think, picks up. Do you think there is a chance that you guys don\u2019t see a year on your deceleration in the back half of the year relative to what you saw in the first half of the year? Tom Falk : I mean, I guess I'd say so you are saying you think we\u2019re going be down some sales or just slower growth rate in the back half? Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : Sorry, just slower growth rate. Tom Falk : I guess [indiscernible] tougher comps in the back half and I\u2019d say that we gave the 3to 5 guidance we got 5 in already so I\u2019m highly confident we'll be in that range where we could have a little slower growth rate in the back half than we did in the first half in part because of the tougher comps. In china particular, we still think the -- and I know the Nielsen data isn't showing this but we still think the diaper category is growing high single digits and there\u2019s a lot going on in e-commerce that is being tracked in the Nielsen data that we\u2019re seeing happen in those markets, and so we still got a lot of innovation coming there and really we\u2019re just getting started in fem care with the relaunch there. We got a lot of additional product activity we can bring to those markets to continue to see growth and so, I\u2019d say we continue to expect K-C International\u2019s going to have high single digit growth for some time to come. Operator : Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail Glazerman - UBS : Hi. I know you mentioned that you\u2019re able to pass through the prices in the emerging markets generally but it seems like in KCI tissue volumes were a little bit weak, I wondering if you could give some color there historically. Tom Falk : : Yes, took price a little bit more aggressively in a couple of markets and took some volume risk on that, Brazil was one that would come to mind, and sometimes when you take price and tissue you deal with de sheeting which shows up as negative volume and positive price so you may be selling a similar number of rolls but you\u2019re actually, we measure volume in sheets not rolls, so that can be a part of it in some markets as well. Gail Glazerman - UBS : Okay and in the US away from home market I believe there was an effort to raise prices, I was just wondering if you could give an update on how that\u2019s being accepted. Tom Falk : : Yes, several of the competitors took price, we followed, that\u2019s still rolling out as we speak, as you know in that market you got lots and lots of individual contracts and so it takes longer to have that price get betted down in the marketplace, but so far that seems to be rolling out reasonably successfully. Gail Glazerman - UBS : Okay and just two last quick ones, can you give a little bit more color on the increase of competition that you\u2019re seeing in the US bath tissue market? Tom Falk : : Yes, as you probably recall Georgia-Pacific had some production problems where they were on allocation at the beginning of last year, early, first half of 2013, so they\u2019ve come back with more promotion this year and are really trying to get their shelf space back and some of their market share back. Some of the other competitors in the marketplace have followed that and so we\u2019ve tried to make sure that we\u2019re competitive with primarily in Cottonelle, Scott tissues held up pretty well in this environment. Gail Glazerman - UBS : Okay and then just last one on pulp, you talked about maybe firmer than expected virgin fiber pricing, I am just wondering if you could break that down between kind of the nature grade, soft wood, hard wood and soft pulp and what you\u2019re seeing and expecting moving forward. Tom Falk : : Yes, I mean Northern softwood and fluff pulp has probably been the stickiest and the list price hasn\u2019t come down much, you are seeing some deals particularly on Northern soft wood below list price where we\u2019re kind of just being bought off contract because I think the producers aren\u2019t willing to bring the list down, so that\u2019s making the list price a little bit less relevant to the everyday transaction price that's happening in the market place. Eucalyptus has probably been closer to what we were expecting, still maybe a little bit on the high end of the range but again, I\u2019d say eucalyptus, you see more supply still coming into the market place and more of a predictable behavior there. Gail Glazerman - UBS : And on fluff are you seeing relief, FDA last week kind of talked about seeing [indiscernible], expecting fluff prices to come down, is that something you\u2019re experiencing as well? Tom Falk : : I think everybody\u2019s expecting it, we\u2019re not seeing it yet. Operator : Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : Hi, good morning. Could you talk about your business in Venezuela? Kimberly is one of the few companies not to move to a weaker exchange rate so I\u2019m wondering if the additional rate is what you believe is a true reflection of your economics there and also if you could talk about whether you\u2019ve gotten any price relief. Tom Falk : : That\u2019s a trick question, Connie, as to what the true exchange rate is in Venezuela at this point in time, but as we look at it and in fact we just reviewed this with our audit committee, couple of days ago, when we reviewed the 10-Q and the earnings releases, so there\u2019s about a third of the companies that we\u2019ve been able to track down there that are still using the six-three rate, there\u2019s about a third that are using some form of a blended rate or the SICAD-I rate and there\u2019re about a third that are using the SICAD-II rate and the choice as to which one they are using seems to have more to do with the type of business that they\u2019re in and which rate they qualify for, so if you\u2019re in the services arena you\u2019re probably in SICAD-I, if you\u2019re in the essential consumer products area you\u2019re in the original CADIVI rate and so essentially the only exchange that we\u2019re getting is at the six-three rate and we\u2019ve got more foreign exchange in the second quarter than we even did in the first quarter at that rate.  So I think there has been some discussion with some Venezuelan government officials that they are considering aligning those at one rate. And I think that\u2019s probably the long-term trajectory. At this point in time, it\u2019s something we review every quarter and talk about what\u2019s the right rate. But we\u2019re not even eligible to apply for the SICAD-I or SICAD-II rate at this point in time. In the meantime we try to be completely transparent in the queue about what our balance sheet exposure is in Venezuela and so that investors if they believe there is a different rate that should be applied, they've got the information that they need to be able to do that. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : And are you getting any relief on pricing yet? Tom Falk : : Given that we\u2019re still at getting the exchange at the 6-3 rate, it's difficult to argue for pricing at that point. So if and when the rate changes, then that will be a discussion at that point in time. In the meantime we're more focused on getting enough foreign exchange to be able to continue to run the mill, to bring in raw materials and to continue to bring in some finished product and so we work with the Venezuelan government authorities on that on a daily basis. Operator :  Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  First question, just back to incontinence. It looks like P&G has started to test the waters a little bit in Europe. So do you have any early read on their approach on how you plan to respond to that? And then just on North American diapers, clearly volume has been a little bit difficult in Huggies, with the volume down low single digit; so can you talk about what your plan is to respond to that? Thanks. Tom Falk : : Sure, on the incontinence, I mean they just started shipping in the UK, just in the last month or so. So we\u2019ve picked up some product samples and those are being tested, probably too early to tell. I'd say, at this point we would never take a competitor lightly. But we feel pretty good with the innovation program that we have and the things that we still have coming in our -- behind our dependent Poise business. On the positive side, if you\u2019re going to be the optimist here. It\u2019s that the Poise category in particular, the light bladder leakage category is still pretty underpenetrated and so having another competitor come in and talk about it from the consumer standpoint could benefit all of us, if the category grows more rapidly.  On the North American diaper front, yes, as you mentioned, we\u2019re not satisfied with the share. I mean a lot of it has been lost particularly at a couple of large format retailers have been driven. So we are going to try to make sure we are more competitive in the second half and have more innovation coming across our Huggies line-up to get that brand back in a healthier growth profile. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, thanks. And then on professional, last quarter you attributed the decline in North America partly to unfavorable weather, but now price seems to be a bigger drag. So can you talk through how you think about professional and developed markets given these dynamics? Tom Falk : : Yes, I think the KCP business, weather was certainly a challenge, but as we look at it, we probably say we didn\u2019t execute as well as we needed to. And so we're in the process of realigning some of our sales capabilities, and that probably was more disruptive than we would have thought. So we're focused on getting that business back on track, so a little bit better performance overall in the second quarter. So we had positive volume in North America, which was a good sign. We probably spent a little bit on price to get some of that which is where you saw the negative price. But we were aligning that team to have a stronger second half and we should see that play out in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Erin Lash - Morningstar: I was wondering if you could speak to; first of with the Child Care volumes down mid-single digits and just your expectations for that segment of the business. And if that's reflective of Pull-Ups and how that -- what you're doing, I guess, within that loss? Tom Falk : : Yes, what we are seeing with Child Care is a couple of factors, it is primarily Pull-Ups. We are seeing growth in our size-6 diaper business; which would say that moms are keeping babies in diapers a little longer. And part of that is there is an economic issue where the Pull-Ups are more expensive per piece than a disposable diaper. And we\u2019re also looking as to make sure that the Pull-Up is delivering on the product performance expectations where we are seeing a little bit more leakage in Pull-Ups and is that why the consumer is deciding to stay in diapers a bit longer. And so we\u2019ve got initiatives behind both of those areas and I would expect to see some improvement in our Pull-Ups business in the back half of the year and in to early 2015. Erin Lash - Morningstar: That\u2019s helpful, thank you. And then if I could just a follow-up on Wendy\u2019s question from earlier about potential divestitures resulting from the restructuring. Is that -- was your answer indicative of the fact that you after the spin-off of the healthcare business that you\u2019re content with your portfolio, are you constantly re-examining your portfolio to see if there are other areas that may be are less core to the business? Tom Falk : : To take a long-term view, we have been around a little over 140 years and our first product was Newsprint. So our portfolio looks pretty different today than it did then. And so I guess the answer is, we\u2019re always continually challenging ourselves and what we can add to the portfolio to make us better and then are there other properties in the portfolio that we maybe aren\u2019t the right owner of long term and we have been pretty disciplined about doing that over the years. This is I think my third spin-off but coming out of a big transaction like the spin, I'd probably say in the near term, the medium term, we are pretty happy with the portfolio. Erin Lash - Morningstar:  Okay, thanks you, that\u2019s helpful. And then just finally building off of that question, with regards to potential acquisitions as the use of cash if you could speak and that and potentially where you might see some holding the portfolio that you would potentially look to fill by making acquisitions whether from a product perspective or a geographic perspective? Thank you. Tom Falk : : Yes, we have not done a bunch of strategic M&A in fact the one business that probably was doing some M&A was in our healthcare business and then when the spin happens I am sure that that team will have some interest in continuing to look to add healthcare properties to their portfolio. As I look at our core business, we have got enough organic growth opportunities in the emerging markets. Today, a high percentage of our business in the emerging markets is in diapers and bath tissue, we have got huge opportunities to continue to grow baby wipes and Pull-Ups and our adult care business, as the global population ages. So, our KCP business as the world industrializes, has a great growth opportunity for us outside North America and Europe. And so we see a lot of things that we can go chase with big opportunity that we already own and so we're focused on those probably more than looking for the strategic acquisitions. Operator :  Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : Hello, good morning everyone. Just to kind of how you wrap it up with Venezuela, if you can tell us how much your local currency sales growth was and what percentage of the profit currently represent because I understand that you are now getting access to cadaver rates which other companies in the same space seems not to be getting access to. Tom Falk :   I guess Javier, I wouldn\u2019t assume that other companies aren\u2019t getting the letters of credit at the 6-3 rate like we are, so I mean I think that may be in some categories and not others, the more essential you are, so diapers and bath tissue would be firmly in that area, the more likely you are to get the 6-3 rate. And as you look at 2013 data, Venezuela was a couple percent of sales and a little bit more than that as a percent of profits. It\u2019s probably a little bit higher than that in the first six months of the year, so we've probably seen a little bit faster growth. If you look in the second quarter, I think of the double-digit KCI growth, Venezuela was about a 1 point of that. So, it\u2019s not way out of proportion with the roll in the portfolio. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : Understood, thank you. And the way that I understood your commentary with regards to pricing, you mentioned because 5 points have been both in tissue and personal care international. It seems like not all of it is in place, so does it mean that we're going to see even higher pricing going into the third quarter? Tom Falk :   I mean I think most of it is in place and it's just that as you compare it to prior year, you will have a positive comp for the next several quarters as that rolls through. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : Okay and finally on Mexico. You attribute the decline on the joint venture profits mostly to macroeconomic dynamics but is it -- there is a competitive aspect to it, is something happening to actual retail prices or could you elaborate more on what\u2019s happening with JV income in Mexico? Tom Falk :   Yes, I mean I think if you look at our shares in Mexico, they have been very stable and so the team has defended successfully. There is more competition in Mexico as both CMPC and Mabesa in particular have been aggressive in tissue and diapers. You are also seeing a relatively weak economic environment and a more challenged consumer. There has been some of the tax reform proposals that rolled some VAT through that took spending power out of the pockets of Mexican consumers that had an effect on category health broadly. And you are seeing that in some of the big retailers, I think some of the large retailers have had negative same-store comps for the last two quarters in a row which is the first time in my career I can remember that happening in Mexico.  And so the expectation for growth down there was to grow 3.5%, 4% and GDP has been growing more like 1% and that\u2019s having a disproportionate impact on consumer confidence. And so again we have got big shares, we are defending them. We got good margins. We are largely protecting those but we are not getting as much growth out of that market as we would have hoped for this year. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : Thank you, Tom and just one more on, I mean it has been touched before on the weaker volumes seen in diapers in the U.S. It seems to me that when you changed the diaper count earlier this year, volumes weakened. So, to what extent it\u2019s an issue of pricing that after you reduce the number of diapers per package just started losing share? Tom Falk : : Whenever you do a count change, we always get a little bit of a drop in volume because if you think about it the customers are ordering the same number of cases and the consumers are buying packages at the same rate and everyone\u2019s inventory on average drops by the amount of the count change, so that\u2019s not that unusual. We were probably six months later than our primary competitor in making the count change, so we probably had a price advantage for six months and now it\u2019s more of an even competition on that front. So, I guess I would say that part of it, I could understand. We're also seeing those with a growth in Luvs and the feature promotion that they had in the second quarter that\u2019s probably something that we will be more responsive to in the back half of the year both with innovation and making sure we are competitive in key areas. Operator :  Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital :  Thanks, good morning. And just to follow up on that last comment on Luvs you respond with some news in the second half, might that imply more activity at the lower end of the market, right, because with Luvs they've got two distinctive brands one more cater into the lower end where Huggies is trying to sort of be all things to all people. So, is that something that you contemplate a more of a mid-tier priced brand or sub-brand? Tom Falk : : Well if you think about it, we, both us and our primary competitor do this in a lot of different ways, so if you would go into China for example you'd find Pampers across all product tiers. You'd see the same thing for us in many markets and so it\u2019s not unusual to have the same parent brand and you'll have a sub-brand, so Huggies Snug & Dry will be our tier 4 brand that we would be focused on competing more with Luvs and I was trying to make sure on the right package price and the overall value equation, product performance and price that delivers to the consumer in that segment. And Luvs is sort of priced above private label and below the Huggies and Pampers tier 4, and so just trying to get that gap right for the value that you are delivering in the product. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital : Okay. And then on that private label segway, SCA on their call I guess late last week talked about the impact that they believe they are starting to see of the new higher grade capacity income in consumer tissue in the U.S. and that\u2019s something I think that in the past as you've commented, we don\u2019t think it will be a huge impact on the market. Any change in that? What are you currently seeing in terms of this higher quality private label product coming to shelf? Tom Falk : : I mean we are seeing better quality private label. It hasn\u2019t hit our shares at this point in time, so we see Cottonelle as a differentiated offer and Scott tissue has some of the most loyal consumers in the category. And so, it\u2019s probably been a bigger factor for some of the other categories. I think in this last quarter private label bath was up about a share point year-on-year and so that\u2019s not trivial but it\u2019s something that we are watching but it hasn\u2019t had a big impact on our business at this stage. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital : And do you think that that\u2019s playing a role? I know you can pretty specifically point to Georgia Pacific, trying to regain its momentum, given their problems last year. But do you think that this share gain from private labels also influencing competitor behavior and then just the overall environment gets more competitive. The reasons may be varied but the outcome is the same that everyone gets more promotional? Tom Falk : : If you look at bath tissue and towels, you walk into every store in America and somebody\u2019s branded towel and bath tissue is on deal every week of the year. And so we all take turns with the promotion, so the question is, are you going deeper, are you even trying to be even more frequent? But again, I think we've seen a little bit more depth of promotion from GP this year which is what both Procter and us to some extent have responded to. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital : Okay, great and then finally just on the healthcare spin. So, earlier in the call you said that share repurchases would partially offset the 2% to 3% dilution from stranded overhead cost in year one. So, does that mean that your ballpark figures at this point we can think about, should we think about 1% to 2% EPS dilution or is it not that high as a net number of the share repurchase? Tom Falk : : That\u2019s probably in the ballpark and we'll give you a more complete answer on the third quarter call when we give you the full scope of we figure out how much of the stranded cost we can take out. If we can take all of it out, there is a scenario where you might not have any dilution but we'll, I think for a working assumption for now that\u2019s probably in the ballpark. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, we will be servicing Halyard in shared services and IT and things like that, so we will be getting some income to cover those stranded costs for at least a period of time next year. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital : Okay. And [indiscernible] the restructuring you will be able to move quickly enough, so potentially some of that restructuring benefit or offset stranded has actually happened in year one of the spin? Tom Falk : : Yes, that\u2019s the idea. Operator :  Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : First question is, looks like the tissue margin seem to be quite impressive I think in light of some of the competitive activity that you just mentioned. And I was just wondering if you could help us -- Tom Falk :   [Multiple Speakers] that's very nice of you. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Well hey, give credit where credit is due, how about that? Tom Falk :   You want to ask a question? I thought you were just telling us we were doing a great job. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Well, you got to take the good with the bad I guess but seriously when you look at the business are you continuing to de-sheet, is that one way you\u2019re able to I guess offset some of the promotional inducements you\u2019re providing consumers or is it just totally on the cost side? Tom Falk : : I'd say it\u2019s like the rest of our business, we\u2019re trying to do is products innovation wherever we can so continuing to drive premium variance even in launching flexible moist wipes in the bath tissue category around the world, in many of our international markets we\u2019re selling Kleenex moist wipes for hand and face clean up and so we\u2019re trying to really drive the higher margin segments of those businesses around the world, wherever we can to get the margins where they\u2019re investible and not dilutive to the corporate average. We are to be sure focused on costs in that business because that is a key part of the P&L but it\u2019s as much around innovation and mix management as it is a pure cost take out play. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Got you, and you know maybe, not that you would know the minds of some of these folks but we\u2019re kind of baffled or intrigued by the fact that there continues to be I guess sort of this onslaught of continued plans to build capacity by either new private label entrants or existing players and I\u2019m thinking of the Kruger announcement in the last week or two and to add I think another machine, what I think was one of your plants and [indiscernible] and then also Asia Pulp and Paper, through their St. Croix, division up in Maine and I, are they just at a completely different part of the market that so far hasn\u2019t touched you and so therefore they\u2019re seeing success without it coming at the branded expense or what do you think they\u2019re thinking? Tom Falk : : Yes, I mean as we look at the North American tissue supply demand balance, there\u2019s been some new assets brought on there\u2019s also been a bunch of capacity taken out and typically in the branded, in the premium arena there hasn\u2019t been that much that\u2019s destabilized the market. At the low end when we look down at the away from home private label tissue market as sort of the bottom end, even that pricing hasn\u2019t been way out of whack, so, so far we\u2019re not seeing anything crazy happening and some of these guys may add capacity, they may wind up taking out some older rollout capacity at the same time and so just because somebody built the machine doesn\u2019t mean that more consumers are going to choose private label. Operator : The next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein : I did want to build on that question from a previous ones, if you\u2019re seeing, all of a sudden it feels like a lot of moving parts in your competitive environment, so for the new CAD machines that are coming out in private label so that it\u2019s higher quality, it\u2019s supposed to be not for away from home use but in home use, so that might impact you in the next few years, the (PG) [ph] incontinence move and who knows if either of those two things will be successful but it only becomes more competitive, you mentioned already more price competition from GP and so I can understand how there\u2019s a, as you term it, \u2018slightly more difficult environment\u2019 right now, but how do you think about this not just as a short term shift in the marketplace and these changes being more of a long term bad change that you have to deal with. Tom Falk : : I guess I would say this Ali, we probably would say, we\u2019ve always had (proctors) [ph] of tough competitors so we know that they\u2019re always going to be there and we run up against them everywhere in the marketplace, but they all look at it and say globally there\u2019s more tough competition everywhere in the world, and so I look at the SCA coming out of Europe and they\u2019ve been very aggressive growing their business in international markets, we\u2019ve got both Unicharm and Cowle who are expanding out of Japan with terrific products in the personal care front, you know we\u2019ve got the CNPCs of the world in South America that are moving north into Mexico and so there\u2019s no shortage of people that get up every day wanting to eat our lunch. So we use that within our own teams as a challenge for us to move even faster on the innovation front and to make sure we\u2019re getting there with the best ideas in market, and that we've got the best marketing capability that we\u2019re sharp on cost and that make sure that we can\u2019t be beat wherever we choose to operate and so it is very much of a motivator for us to know you\u2019ve got that much good competition coming after you every day. Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein : So I get the motivational angle on it and that\u2019s a great way to manage folks for sure but do people -- do you the people internally really think that there is kind of an acceleration and increased competition in so many of the areas that you\u2019re looking at, or do you think it\u2019s kind of status quo, because it does feel like there\u2019s acceleration at least from an outside observation perspective. Tom Falk : : Yes, no, we are behaving like there\u2019s an acceleration so we are spending a lot more time, war gaming possible competitive activity as we think about launch plans in individual markets for example, Unicharm is about to launch in Brazil a diaper pant, they\u2019ve been building the plant there for two years, and we\u2019ve been planning our defense strategy in Brazil for two years and have launched every pant we can think of in the marketplace to occupy all the key strategy so we probably pulled ahead and accelerated innovation in that market to make sure we were positioned correctly when they did launch and so we are monitoring competitive activity much more closely around the world and trying to incorporate that into our business plan, so that we are as prepared as we can be to not just defend but to thrive in those markets. Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein :  That\u2019s very helpful lens. If I were to ask you to focus on just one specific area which is China right now, it feels like you are shifting and have over the past couple of quarters actually successfully from driving a lot of your growth from distribution gains, much more to share gains. Can you comment on that observation if that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on there? Number one and number two is what you are broadly seeing from that marketplace? Tom Falk : : Yes, I'd say that\u2019s probably, because every additional city you bring on is probably slightly smaller than the last one. They are still cities of millions of people, so they are pretty good size chunks of business. We are seeing as you get traction in more and more places and are picking up share in those places but that\u2019s -- you are getting probably more share gain although I would tell you any Nielsen data that you see in China, you should think twice about just because the coverage isn\u2019t great yet.  I think may be the one thing that is different in China is the rapid growth of ecommerce and I think in some of the emerging markets in particular China, you could see a different form of retail development over time with a much bigger e-com particularly in areas with dense population and relatively low delivery cost. And so, I think we'll see how that plays out but we are obviously spending a lot of time with our digital marketing capability and our ecommerce team there to make sure we're fully represented in that channel. Operator :  Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Just the guidance first of all, let\u2019s go down to nickel, why did you even tweak it, was the change just that Kimberly Mexico came in a little wider because the pulp prices came down a little bit, they came down less than you thought but it's not like they are up year-over-year, so if you can just comment on that briefly because it's like I said, its only nickel? Tom Falk :   Yes, we were sense only nickel and basically as we look at the back half of the year, we got half the year in and a $0.20 range seemed a little wide given as tight as we usually are around numbers and Mexico was down enough that we felt like that was probably the right signal. So, we'll give you another look at it in the fourth quarter, may narrow it further at that point in time, we'll see. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Okay, got you and then everything you guys have done over the last 10 years, there is may be much more to consumer products company rather than more of a commodity pulp company which has been great. The only metric that hasn\u2019t really moved is the gross margin, so I am curious if you think there is a compelling gross margin opportunity because you things that are in the portfolio, things about the portfolio but that gross margin line and I know commodities have a lot to do with it but that\u2019s the one that really hasn\u2019t budged and kind of to emerge as a consumer products company, I think that your gross margins are about 1,000 basis points below some of the other competitors there, so do you think that\u2019s an opportunity now that everything has kind of cleaned up? Tom Falk :   Well its certainly one that it has gotten better. We're just sorry you haven\u2019t noticed it as much, Bill but it was down around 30 and it\u2019s now up into the mid-30s again. Now that\u2019s where it was before we got hit with a lot of the commodity cost inflation. And I do think that is a big driver of multiple long-term and so it's one of the things, one of the key metrics we focused on with each of business teams is as we bring innovation to market, is it gross margin accretive. And so that we're going to agree completely that\u2019s a key driver of a healthy franchise long-term. Operator :  At this time we have no other questioners in the queue. Unidentified Company Representative : All right. We appreciate everybody\u2019s questions today and we'll close with the comment from Tom. Tom Falk :  Once again thank you for your interest in Kimberly-Clark. We continue to execute our plan effectively and expect to deliver continued strong results in the second half. Thanks very much. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you very much.",

We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow up if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me in Dallas today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller. Here is the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with a review of third quarter results and give a short update on the health care spin-off. Tom will then discuss our organization restructuring and also our full year outlook. We'll finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our Web-site. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark Buthman : Thanks, Paul, and good morning. Let's start with the headlines. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 4%, highlighted by 10% growth in KC International; second, we increased adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 that\u2019s an all time record and up 12% year-on-year; and third, we continue to see strong results from our focus on capital management, including working capital, cash generation, capital spending and returning cash to shareholders. Now let\u2019s cover the details of our results. Third quarter sales were $5.4, that\u2019s up more than 3% versus last year. Underlying organic sales rose 4%. Adjusted gross margin was 35.1% in the third quarter, up 70 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating profit was up 15% versus year ago with an operating margin of 17.4% that\u2019s up 180 basis points compared to the prior year. Results benefited from organic sales growth $100 million of forced cost savings and lower G&A spending. I am really encouraged by our team\u2019s continued focus on cost savings and spending discipline that\u2019s helping us improve margins and invest for future growth in areas like advertising which was up $10 million in the quarter. On the other hand, we absorbed $55 million of input cost inflation and negative effects from currency exchange rates. Moving down to P&L, equity income fell 37% driven by softness at KC de Mexico. In addition, the adjusted effective tax rate was $0.05 drag on the quarter that was mostly offset by a lower share count. So putting it all together, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.61, up 12% year-on-year and reflects continued topline momentum KC International, broad based margin improvements and forced cost savings. Now, turning to cash flow, our cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $976 million, that\u2019s up 7% year-on-year driven by improved working capital. We continue to drive down primary working capital. Our year-to-date cash conversion cycle is down three days compared to full year 2013 so we\u2019re tracking to comfortably exceed our one to two day improvement objective for the year.  In terms of capital allocation, third quarter dividend payments and shared repurchases totaled more than $0.5 billion. As a reminder, on October 7th, we increased our full year share repurchase target to $2 billion. That\u2019s up from our previous estimate of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion as a result of cash proceeds we expect from Halyard Health in conjunction with the spin-off of our Health Care business. So this means that full year dividends and share repurchases should be at about $3.3 billion. Now, I\u2019ll highlight a few areas from our segment areas for the quarter. In personal care, organic sales rose 6%, performance was led by KC International with organic sales up 12%. In terms of highlights for KCI this quarter, in diapers, organic sales were up 25% in China, 25% in Russia and Eastern Europe and 10% in Brazil. Organic sales in KC International were also up double digits in feminine care, led by Brazil, China, Eastern Europe and South Korea. Finally, our adult care and baby wipes businesses delivered double digit organic sales growth in the quarter. In North America, personal care organic sales were down slightly, volumes were up for our Poise and Depend adult care brands, GoodNites youth pants and Huggies baby wipes. On the other hand, volumes were down in Huggie diapers and Pull-Ups training pants. Overall personal care operating margins were 19.5% in the quarter, that\u2019s up 160 basis points year-on-year with improvements in North America, KC International and Europe. Moving to consumer tissue, organic sales increased 3%. In North America, organic sales were up more than 3% behind strong volume performance. That reflects market share gains, innovation and increased promotion activity. KC International, organic sales were up 5%, was driven by higher net selling prices in response to unfavorable currencies and cost inflation. Consumer tissue operating margins of 16.8% were up 250 basis points year-on-year driven by organic sales growth and cost savings. Now, K-C Professional, organic sales increased 3%, performance was led by 13% growth in K-C International. We continue to expand our business for industrialization and economic development recurring particularly in North America and China. Elsewhere KCP organic sales were down 2% in North America and up 3% in Europe. Overall, KCP margins were 18.9%, that's up 50 basis points year-on-year. And lastly healthcare organic sales were off 3% mostly due to lower net selling prices, healthcare operating margins up 13.3% were down compared to a strong performance a year ago, our year-to-date margins remain healthy and up year-on-year. Now a quick update on the healthcare spin-off, we\u2019re in the final stages of completing the transaction, the form 10 registration statement has been deemed effective by the SEC. Halyard\u2019s Board of Directors has been fully established and debt financing for the company is in place. The spin-off has set to occur at the end of the day on Friday, October 31st and Halyard Health will begin trading under the ticker symbol HYH on Monday, November 3rd.  So that wraps up my comments. To recap, we achieve solid organic sales growth, we delivered significant cost savings on all time record adjusted earnings per share and we continue to allocate capital and shareholder friendly ways. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. Tom Falk : Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. Since Mark has reviewed our third quarter results, I\u2019ll just add that I am encourage with our performance and a challenging environment. While we certainly have opportunities to further improve our growth initiatives are on track and our financial discipline is generating strong cost savings, margin improvements and cash flow.  Now let me turn the comment on our organizational restructuring. As we have said all along, since we announced the healthcare spin-off, we\u2019re committing to offsetting the impact of the stranded overhead cost that result from the spin. This restructuring program will do that and will make us more efficient at the same time. Restructuring program will also give us more flexibility to invest in our brands, to invest in our targeted growth initiatives and to build the capabilities that will help us win in the marketplace. This restructuring is a result of a global assessment by our functions and by our business teams that identified the ways that we could streamline the organization structure, simplify the way we work and make our overhead spending even more competitive with the best-in-class companies.  Our organizations in all major geographies will be effected by this program. Workforce reductions are expected to be in a range of 1,100 to 1,300 people and primarily affect salaried employees. Majority of the reductions are expected to occur by the end of next year. The financial details for the restructuring are included in this morning\u2019s news release, but to recap this whole cost for the program were expected to be $130 million to $160 million after tax, charges will begin in the fourth quarter of this year and it will be wrapped up by the end of 2016. Savings will begin in earnest next year and should total 120 million to 140 million pre-tax by the end of 2017 that\u2019s nicely above the stranded overhead cost from the spin which are about $85 million. Cash cost will be about 80% of the total charge, so the cash payback on the restructuring is less than one and a half years. This restructuring effort is further evidence of how we manage our company with financial and cost discipline.  Now let me move to the outlook for the full year. Although the macroeconomic environment remains volatile, there have been no significant changes to our full year input cost or currency rate assumptions from the outlook that we provided to you in July. Still most currencies have weakened relative to the U.S. dollars just the last month, as a result we expect that currency overall will be a sequential headwind in the fourth quarter as compared with our third quarter results. We also continue to closely monitor the environment in Venezuela. Access to letters of credit to pay for imported raw materials there continue to be inconsistent. Going forward if we don\u2019t receive adequate amounts of letters of credit, we could curtail some of our production as necessary rather than further increase our U.S. dollar exposure. Now in terms of our business overall, we have good top-line momentum with more than 4% organic sales growth of the first nine months of the year. We expect the full year to be at least at the midpoint of our 3% to 5% target. On the bottom line, our guidance for the year is consistent with our previous outlook adjusted for the healthcare spin-off. We expect to adjusted earnings per share will be between $5.93 to $6.03 assuming the spin-off occurs at the end of October. This guidance includes a $0.10 per share impact from the spin-off of the last two months of healthcare's 2014 earnings. Our previous guidance was between $6 and $6.15 a share and included a full year of healthcare results. So adjusted for the spin-off, the midpoint of our current outlook is equivalent to the midpoint of our previous guidance. Following the spin historical results for healthcare business will be reported that earnings from discontinued operations so included in our 2014 outlook is $0.47 of adjusted earnings per share from discontinued operations. That means our outlook for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is $5.46 to $5.56 a share.  So summary, we continue to deliver good financial results and we\u2019re on track with our plans for the year, we\u2019re taking further steps to improve our business and we are convinced that successful execution of our global business plan will continue to result in strong returns for our shareholders. That wraps up our prepared remarks and now we\u2019ll begin to take your questions. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen, at this time the floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail Glazerman - UBS: Just starting on the restructuring program, do you think the benefits you could see next year can at least offset the stranded costs? I know you\u2019re not looking for much impact, but can they at least offset that? Tom Falk : I think between the combinations of the benefits we\u2019re going to get plus we\u2019ll have some transition services agreement income, we should be able to cover the stranded cost hit next year. We\u2019ll give you more guidance on specifics on that in our January fourth quarter release when we\u2019ll have more specific guidance for 2015. Gail Glazerman - UBS: Okay, and just turning to Personal Care, can you talk a little bit about both the adult incontinence market and the strength that you saw particularly in light of P&G's reentry into the market, as well as diapers? And is there something strategic and big that you need to do to start to get that growing again? Tom Falk : Sure, I\u2019ll cover both of those. In Adult Care, we probably would say that we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of preparing for the entrance of Procter into the category, so we\u2019ve been able to launch a lot of innovations. We\u2019ve actually strengthened our distribution in the face of their launch. So we feel like we\u2019re on track with our plan for the year, and yes, I am sure you\u2019ll hear from Procter later this week. My guess is they\u2019ll say they got the distribution they were looking for and their launch it on track. And so it could be that both those statements are true and the rest of the category is feeling the tension in terms of ten on private labels is where most of the share gain that Procter\u2019s got and so far has come from, but good strong growth there. On the diaper front, what you\u2019re seeing is, is a trading up trading down phenomenon. Our super premium segment of our category grew double digits in the quarter picked up a couple of share points, but we\u2019ve lost more than that in Huggies main line and Love\u2019s picked up a fair amount of share. And so there is some product performance things we\u2019ll be addressing and we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re watching the value gaps with Love\u2019s to try to stabilize that business and deliver a better performance. But you can rest assured that we\u2019re not happy with the U.S. diaper business at this point in time. Gail Glazerman - UBS: Okay and just lastly on K-C Professional, I guess there is a way from home increase in the market can you just give us an update on how that\u2019s proceeding? Tom Falk :  Yes, we\u2019ve probably had limited benefit from that and as you saw in the quarter, we had negative price in KCP in North America. So you\u2019re seeing some price erosion in the low end of that business and so any net price gain has been pretty minimal at this point in time, and I think you\u2019re seeing a fairly stagnant economy is probably not helping much on that front. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein : So a couple of things, first one to push a little bit more on diapers and as a broader category because in North America, because you talk a little about price mix improving slightly but then in North America in particular clearly the Huggies volumes were down and I am trying to understand whether you\u2019re seeing any resurgence into Pull-Ups versus what used to be any improvement from the consumer trade up there? And also any birth rate changes, we\u2019re starting hear rumblings of positivity there? Tom Falk : : Yes, we'd say in the birth has been very slight positive signals so far, which in a sense is good, it\u2019s not falling anymore. So that\u2019s probably good news. I wouldn\u2019t say it has turned into a baby boomlet yet on that front. And then in the Pull-Ups category, we really aren\u2019t seeing much traction yet and so still moms staying in diapers a little longer, still seeing size six growing as moms are choosing to stay at that level, so those things we\u2019re working on to make sure we\u2019re driving the right innovation in Pull-Ups. We did have a very good, GoodNites quarter as we launched some new innovation on GoodNites and so our total childcare volumes were pretty flat in the quarter, but Pull-Ups was down and GoodNites was up, and didn\u2019t show up in the share number because there is a lot of GoodNites stuff as pipeline fill. Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein : Okay and then on North America consumer tissue looked like volumes were good, price mix was down three, can you talk about the effect of de-sheeting on that price mix (obviously) [ph] it might have rolled off? And in particular how much of that is related to what we\u2019ve been hearing for years now, but sounds like it\u2019s down in the ground and producing the private label pad technology trying to compare with Europe pad? And moreover what do you think the price volume equation looks going forward? Tom Falk : : I think the -- good question. So, I\u2019ll say on consumer tissue, we\u2019ve rolled off most of the de-sheeting impact, so there wasn\u2019t much in the quarter on that front at all. We did step up promotional activity from second quarter where we were not competitive in the marketplace. It was competing with other branded activity in the market where some of our competitors have stepped things up in the second quarter. We picked it up in the third quarter and you saw that show up in the volume growth so business that response well that we were more competitive we were not leading the price down but we were trying to make sure we\u2019re matching up to the future pricing in the marketplace and saw a good volume growth across the board and a good back to school season on facial and saw high single digit growth there. Good growth on Cottonelle and a solid growth on Scott Tissue, Viva Vantage\u2019s launch is pretty much on track and towel growth was up mid-single digits overall. So, just good execution and making sure you\u2019re competitive on shelf every day. Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And the last one if I can just throw in is on Halyard in your health care business. So, is it fair to think about the overall dilution I mean we mentioned and we talked about it about 9% on a full year basis excluding any adjustments. But then if you go through and look at the transition services agreement you look at the share repurchases that you\u2019re getting from the payments they\u2019re giving you, and then this incremental cost cutting. Is it fair to think about the net dilution of something like 4% to 5% on an annual basis is that the right way to think about it? Tom Falk : : Yes, I think you\u2019re probably in the ballpark. We\u2019ll give you a little bit more specific guidance on that in January. But I\u2019d say, we\u2019d expect to try to minimize that as much as possible. And we\u2019ll be looking in our January guidance to give you on a continuing ops basis a plan that looks like our global business plan with consistent top line and high single digit bottom line, a mid to high single digit bottom line as we\u2019ve done in the past. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America : Good morning. Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers behind international growth because that continues to be quite robust first half past for the categories growing now have seen any changes in the categories since the quarter ended? And are you gaining more share in existing retailers how much of that is incremental distribution? Tom Falk : Yes, I mean there is a lot going on in emerging markets and they\u2019re pretty exciting place from a lot of dimensions this year with a lot of volatility and a lot of some political instability mixed in. So, it\u2019s been a pretty exciting place and our teams there have done an awesome job of executing, driving innovation in the market. And so, if you think about Russia and Eastern Europe, we\u2019re up 25% in the quarter done a great job of launching diaper pants in boy/girl there and have really taken off a fairly tough currency environment, managed to get price to offset a lot of the currency hit. So, we\u2019d say we\u2019re growing ahead of the category there. But the category is probably growing high single low double digits and we\u2019re -- as you look at the broad Russia and Eastern Europe markets together, Russia is probably a little slower than that but good execution from our team on the ground. China again 25% growth in the quarter that\u2019s on a 45% comp last year, so very strong growth. We\u2019re in the 100 cities now that was our goal to be in a 100 cities by the end of the year. So, we\u2019ve picked up distribution which is part of it. We\u2019ve done well in e-commerce which is the fastest growing segment in China. And so we\u2019d say the Nielsen data would looked at the categories not doing much, our guess would be that China diaper category is probably growing high single or low double digit at this point. And we have not seen a big shift since the end of the quarter that I know of. And moving to Latin America, good execution in Brazil with the launch of boy/girl diaper pants there as well in the face of a Unicharm launch and a pretty aggressive Proctor investment and so our business there performed pretty well. And we\u2019d say we\u2019re going to again, probably growing a little faster than the category in Brazil and across Latin America. Argentina would be another market where a lot of economic turmoil but the team has done a great job of delivering price increases and volume increases in the market. So, it\u2019s been an exciting year in international with good innovation, good execution in the market and it\u2019s shown up in good results. Olivia Tong - Bank of America : Thanks. Appreciate the comprehensive review. And just following up on that, you talked a little bit about the dollar strengthening and where you got price in Russia. How do you think about profitability for KCI going forward obviously with the dollar strengthening beyond just Russia? Tom Falk : No, I think that it will be a headwind in the fourth quarter for sure, we guess that probably sequentially it\u2019s much of $0.10 headwind on currency third quarter to fourth quarter. And we\u2019ll pull a plan together for 2015 that continues to look at preserving the shape of that P&L and continuing to drive growth in local currency and we\u2019ll be transparent with you on how that shapes up in terms of dollars. Olivia Tong - Bank of America : Would you expect KCI margins to be up year-over-year next quarter? Tom Falk : They make good progress this quarter, and they had a good cost savings quarter. They\u2019ve done a great job of getting price where we\u2019ve had currency weakness. And so I\u2019d expect certainly margin stability sequentially. We had terrific margins across our segments in the third quarter so that\u2019s maybe a tougher comp. But I would say if you look at our year-to-date averages in the segments, that's certainly a good predictor of what we\u2019re capable of, and would expect that to continue. Olivia Tong - Bank of America : Got it, thanks. Just if I could add one last question, I know you\u2019re right now not ready yet to give fiscal '15 EPS outlook but on raw materials with crude and natural gas down pretty dramatically recently would you expect raw materials in places to decelerate next year or does the stronger dollar and still higher pulp and resin more than offset that? Thanks. Tom Falk : : I think this recent move hasn\u2019t floated its way into the supply chains yet. So, if you looked at pulp outlook it was still it looked like its trending higher in \u201915, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the recent moves in the dollar are fully baked into that yet. If you looked at polymer, polymer is going up right now, not down like oil has done but I would expect if oil stays where it is that the polymer supply chain would start to reflect some of that. And so we hopefully have a bit more clarity on that when we talk next in January. Operator :  Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo :  Hey, good morning. Tom, I hate to get into \u201915 again, but I am only doing it because you said a couple of things that I just want to make sure I can pull together correctly, right so you said that this synergy was 85 million, I think you said that you think you could offset that in 2015, I want to also understand how that works with your 2014 continuing operations base of 546 to 556. So that fine 546 to 556 includes all of this synergy, right so you will be offsetting 85 million or call it $0.15 plus a share in \u201915 if you can offset that, is that the right way to think about it? Tom Falk : : Yes, so we\u2019re going to get some transition services in common and in \u201915 it will lost a portion of the 85 million and then we should get the additional restructuring benefits that we think should have a shot at offsetting the rest of it. So, I think the answer to your question is yes, to the extent I understand it. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo :   No, that\u2019s helpful, I guess I am just trying to understand what the growth rate will be offered. So that 546 to 556 should have a deflated date, if you were to have sort of a long-term planning algorithm EPS growth rate that you just cited sort of mid to high single-digits in \u201915 it would be above and beyond that 85 million of cost offsets, is that right? Tom Falk : : Yes, I think that\u2019s directionally right, on the other hand we\u2019ll have other investment opportunities, currency, commodity cost issues and so that\u2019s the rest of the picture that we need to bring together into a plan and share that with you in January. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : Okay. And then I guess on SG&A, the 2014 levels were, I mean even in dollars below 2013, below 2012 levels even. I know you\u2019ve said you\u2019re pretty pleased with cost savings and that\u2019s a good number. But is there anything specific that was going on this quarter in SG&A that we should think about and the sustainability of that sort of trend? Tom Falk : : You have to put more focused attention, I think as people were getting ready for the restructuring they were already starting to cut cost in many areas, good management of the control levels things like travel and other things were lower in the quarter than normal. And so, I think that\u2019s part of it and if you looked at the comp versus third quarter last year, we had more compensation increases last year and we had a little bit of compensation decreases as we adjusted some of our long-term plans in the quarter that might be the only thing that might qualify as a little unusual although those things get adjusted every quarter up or down. Third quarter last year was on the up note and this year was a little bit a little bit lower as we reflected some of the currency implications and other things and on our sales impact on the three year count that\u2019s rolling every year. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : That\u2019s right. Can you just one last quick one, can you just say where the Venezuela growth was for the quarter? Tom Falk : : Volume growth was pretty flat and so I don't know if Paul has looked at total top-line, but\u2026. Paul Alexander :  Yes, we did have a little bit of price benefit, but you\u2019re right Tom there was no volume growth in the quarter in Venezuela. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : Thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from a Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners :  Hi, this is James Armstrong for Chip. How are you today? The first one is going back a little bit to the cost overhead reduction charge that\u2019s taking place in the fourth quarter. If we\u2019re seeing most of that charge in the fourth quarter, why aren't we seeing the full benefits until 2017, could you help walk us through a little bit of timing behind that? Tom Falk : : Yes. Sure, we\u2019ll book the severance so we made the decision even though of the separations won't occur and will roll out over all of \u201915 and even some in the \u201916. James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners : That helps. And then switching to tissue, is tissue volume strength coming at the expense of the other national branded players or do you think you\u2019re gaining share versus private label? Tom Falk : : If you look at the share charge, private label shares were pretty stable sequentially and actually are up a bit year-to-date and our shares are up a bit year-to-date as well. So with the primarily taking share from other player, other branded players. James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners : And then lastly as you look at the demographic trends and coming back to this a little, with millennial households forming, what\u2019s your forecast in births in the coming year? And how do you expect that to impact diaper demand as we go out into the 2015, \u201816, \u201817 timeframe? Tom Falk : : I\u2019d say our -- we talked about birth rate in a couple of earlier questions and our prediction is relatively flat, very slow growth in the U.S. birth rate. So, we can quote you a number offline but we\u2019re not seeing much at this point. I would say that\u2019s going to be a big driver of category growth in the next couple of years. But I\u2019d say, we\u2019re also continuing to tinker with the model to be better at predicating at our more recent models looking at household formation. And unemployment levels have been reasonable coming out of the crisis, I am not sure they\u2019re going to be as useful as we move into a more stable economy and find the next driver of growth rate is something that we continue to look for. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with KCC. Wendy Nicholson \u2013 KCC: Hi, my question has to do with Venezuela, in light of sort of how long that\u2019s been as difficult as it\u2019s been for you and others; is there a scenario where you would exit Venezuela like Clorox has decided to? Tom Falk : : Wendy, at this point, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an option for us. We\u2019ve been consistently profitable in Venezuela, which is I think different from the situation that was there at Clorox. We have substantial Bolivar reserves in the country in cash to continue to finance our operation. Our issue is access to U.S. dollars to import raw materials and so Mark and I have set an overall U.S. dollar cap that we\u2019ve reached for that business. And so as long as we continue to get foreign exchange, we\u2019ll be able to find ways to continue to run the operations there. We\u2019re also looking at more local sourcing, can we find more raw material that we can buy with the Bolivars that we have to run that business. And at end of the day, we\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re serving the moms in Venezuela that need diapers and need bathroom tissue every day to care of their families. We\u2019re trying to provide the employment in a stable way for our employees that are there, and as long as we can do that and operate ethically, we\u2019ll continue to operate in Venezuela. Wendy Nicholson \u2013 KCC: Got it and your market shares there are stable or strong? Tom Falk : : Our market shares have been stable although because we have been limiting our exposure. We know we\u2019re not in full throttle of growth there, so we\u2019ve walked away from business because we didn\u2019t have foreign exchange to bring products in. And as you know from probably reading about that place, there is shortages all over the place, so market share is in a relative driver. I mean, our driver of that business is access to U.S dollars. Wendy Nicholson \u2013 KCC: Got it and then just back on the U.S. business, obviously to the extent commodities come down as we expect them to and that flows into the market place, I mean it seems like there should be or could be a lot of more flexibility on both your part as well as your competitors' part, just simply get more promotional? And is that a concern for the category, I mean I know you got to be frustrated by your market share trends, but is your plan really to bring innovation to market or is it more marketing or is there a risk that we get into some sort of down and dirty price competition like we\u2019ve seen in some other categories in the U.S.? Tom Falk : : At this point, you\u2019re not seeing the commodity wave flow our direction, in fact if anything, I think polymer went up $0.08 a pound this month or something, so you\u2019re not seeing the benefit flow through that would support the first part of your statement and pulp has been sticky. You\u2019ve seen eucalyptus come down, but it\u2019s still at the high end or even slightly above our full year outlook. Northern softwood hasn\u2019t come down and it is above our full year outlook. So you\u2019re not seeing the commodity underpinnings of that that would lead to more price competition. And at the end of the day in every category, the value that mom gets as a combination of price and performance, and we got to make sure we\u2019re delivering the right product performance at a competitive price, and that\u2019s probably true the world over. Operator : Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : I am wondering about the restructuring you\u2019re now undertaking, so it looks like it is bigger than the stranded overhead, so my question is excluding the savings that you\u2019re going to get from it, do you think you have enough money to spend defending and growing your categories in diapers and adult incontinence or did you need this program in order to be able to invest more? Tom Falk : : No, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about this is that -- we started out looking at the restructuring program saying first priority is we've got to cover the stranded cost because those are not going away and we\u2019ve got to make sure we do no harm with the spend that we protect the core business. Second priority then is to say what else can we do to create more capacity, to invest in our business to invest in growth ideas, to invest in innovation. And our business teams around the company really rallied to that and came up with an aggressive plan and it's never easy to do these things, and these are people\u2019s jobs and employees' lives that are effective by it but it is something that we need to do to allow us to invest and grow the business. And actually the question is, is it enough, it\u2019s probably never enough. And we\u2019ve also had a great quarter of cost savings in our forced program and we need more from there as well. And so we\u2019re continuing to look at opportunities to get more productive in every aspect of the business to make every P&L line item work for us to allow us to compete and invest and grow our business wherever we\u2019ve got opportunities to do that. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. So are the restructuring programs, you said something I found interesting. Are the restructuring programs essentially designed by the business units or are they more top-down directed? Tom Falk : Well it was a little bit of both. And the functions that had the most stranded cost there we had a clear target and each of the teams went and worked for that target. On the business unit side they did a lot of competitive benchmarking and said we\u2019re the best in class companies operating in each of the major functional areas that serve each of the businesses and came above up with a list of ideas and initiatives that we supported and decided to go forward with. So like every good plan it\u2019s a mix of top-down and bottom up. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. If I could just ask one final question on Venezuela, I mean, assuming that the three official exchange rates converged to one over time, it\u2019s not going to be towards the stronger end of the currency rates it will be towards the weaker end. So, if these levels converged to say like 30 boulevards or 40 boulevard to the dollar, what\u2019s the impact on you since you\u2019re still at the official 6.3? Tom Falk : So several things, first of all, the balance sheet would get re-priced so we\u2019ve got little over $400 million I think $435 million will be disclosed in the Q today of exposure that will get re-priced that whatever that new rate is so that\u2019s mostly in cash but it\u2019s -- so that will be effect on that line. And then the next question is again what price are you allowed to sell at so when you have that level of currency devaluation typically there is particularly for imported products finished product price adjustments all those prices are controlled by the Venezuelan government so there would be application for price increases depending on how those go and what level of prices you\u2019re able to charge would determine on whether you\u2019re going to be able to bring in imported products or not or even bringing imported raw materials and convert it to finished products. And so we take a look at that environment and try to come up with a business plan that made sense. But again you kind of come back to the key driver of it is whatever rate they pick, are you going to get exposure or access to U.S. dollars to be able to pay for the materials and products that you need to sell in that market. And so we\u2019ll work through that whenever those decisions are made by the Venezuelan government. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could speak to the acquisition environment obviously the step up in the share repurchase expectations for this year is fairly pronounced. And so I just wondered if that indicated anything about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of valuations for potential acquisitions? Tom Falk : We are a big acquirer, we\u2019ve done some tuck-ins and [indiscernible] actually most of the tuck-ins we\u2019ve done over the years have been in healthcare. Quite honestly our corporate team has been full consumed with the spend this year and with the -- as well as getting ready for the restructuring. So we\u2019re out of capacity of human capitals to go look at very many deals. But we haven\u2019t seen much likely that was of interest to us. Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar: Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. And then just in light of the competitive environment, I wondered if you could speak to just the kind of your assessment of your overall distribution? And if there are areas of opportunity to further extend distribution of your products into specific channels that would be helpful? Tom Falk : Sure, and the interesting thing is around the world they\u2019re all different kinds of channel migrations occurring so you continue to see the traditional retailers for our consumer products but we\u2019re also seeing more ecommerce in markets like China and Korea, that\u2019s growing very rapidly and is taking a bigger and bigger share of the category. In markets like Argentina there are small panulerras neighborhood diaper stores that are growing rapidly in China, there is these baby stores with a high end diaper baby clothing, baby formula kind of a store that\u2019s a very prolific channel. So one of our key focus points is to make sure our products are available wherever mom wants to buy them and make sure that we get the right offer and the right mix of products on sale and really is tracking those channels and staying connected to mom digitally and finding out where she wants to buy, how she wants to buy has been a key opportunity for us and been a lot of fun for our marketing teams to be able to work on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital : My first question actually follows on just what you were discussing in terms of distribution and ecommerce. I feel like I\u2019d love to get some color on what efforts you're making in the U.S. because I feel like a cross both baby care and also the tissue business, you\u2019re probably bit under exposed in ecommerce channels, could you discuss what you are doing if anything to sort of to change that? Tom Falk : Yes, sure, I'd say while ecommerce is certainly -- we were a little bit late to the party in the U.S., we\u2019re probably ahead of the curve in markets like China and Brazil and Argentina and others, fully competitive in Korea and places like that. So, we\u2019re catching up in the U.S. and have got a good relationship with many of the large ecom players both in the traditional brick and mortar retailers that are going in that space, the Wal-Mart\u2019s and Targets and Sam\u2019s Clubs and Costcos of the world as well as Amazon and diapers.com and places like that. And clearly all of the ecom retailers just like our traditional retailers want the young family as a loyal customer and because of the basket size that those shopper suddenly begin to buy and the lifetime value of that is really important to them and so, we worked a lot on that front. Tissue and -- we\u2019re present the logistics of that and the cost of distribution a higher bulk lower value item, the last mile to a consumer home isn't as obvious although there is some activity going on in that space and we\u2019re working with our ecommerce partners to try to figure out where does that make sense and how do we do it most efficiently.  We\u2019re interestingly doing probably more work now with adult care and so depends and poise are probably areas where you would see a little bit more consumer discretion and you might have a desire to send the product as a care giver to a family member and so there is a kind of a natural opportunity for us to be able to use that and make it easy for consumers to get the products that they need in that market online. Still very small and early days but there is a lot of activity happening there. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital :   Okay, great. And then also on adult care, also small and early days, I was hoping you could discuss the impressive test market and I am guessing also very early but anything you can share on that would be really interesting? Tom Falk : Yes, I mean we think that\u2019s an interesting idea and could be a very exciting product, it's very early days in the test so we don\u2019t have a lot of data to even read yet. But we\u2019ll see what happens and hopefully we\u2019ll have something to talk about as it comes through the test next year sometime. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital :   And how are you going about just spreading word of mouth on that because I think new --not necessarily new to world but new to the over the counter consumer market and I think education and awareness is a huge piece of it, has that even being viable. So, what are the plans? Tom Falk : We have a long tradition of talking about new categories in different ways as you look at coming out. We were the first to talk about feminine protection with Kotex back in the 1920s and then depend and talking about incontinence in the 1980s. And so, I think you\u2019ll expect to see with all the new digital tools that we got available opportunities. There we were also connecting with the appropriate medical community as well that with the logical recommenders of product forms like this. So they are exploring some of those different avenues in the test and we\u2019ll see which of those have the biggest return and move the needle and then we\u2019ll try to do more of that as we think about launching. This maybe a product that takes a bit of time to build and we\u2019ll see how that plays out in terms of consumer behavior change. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital :   Okay, great. And last thing is just very subtle, and I think I picked this up correctly, that you talked about Russia and Eastern Europe as a bucket rather than just being Russia and why the change? Tom Falk : Well we've actually, whenever we\u2019ve said Russia before it always included Eastern Europe, it's just Eastern Europe was pretty small and has gotten bigger, that we thought we should get them into headline so our business in the Ukraine has actually also doing really well. Our business in the stans, the Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan all those countries that none of us have visited very often those -- that part of the world has also grown nicely and it's new geography for us and so we\u2019re going in and building a good business there on the collection of that is actually delivered quite a bit of growth this year. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital :   Okay. So those numbers are comparable, it's just giving Eastern Europe. Tom Falk : Yes. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital : Okay. Thank you so much. Tom Falk : (Multiple speakers) to talk about a little bit more. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital :   Okay. Thanks, Tom. Operator :  Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research :  Hello. Good morning, everyone. I have a follow up on China, Russia and Brazil. You mentioned that category growth is still at least high single-digit. So, if you could tell us whether this is actual volume growth or is it inflationary pricing, whether you are seeing still trade up, I mean what part of, if you can help us understand in these three markets whether you are seeing a still consumers trading up or is it trade down because of the difficult economies. Could you give us a little bit more of a view of the customer in these three markets? Tom Falk : Yes, I think a good way to think about all of these markets is that you are still seeing GDP per capital go up in all of these markets. As the middle class builds and builds and more people are employed and are able to enter the middle class and afford our products, so even if they have a downtick in their GDP growth rate, the GDP per capita is still increasing at a descent rate and that\u2019s fueling the expansion of consumable categories. And so I'd say the three markets are pretty different and that's since China there hasn\u2019t been much price. You typically are seeing consumers\u2019 trade ups, so the lower tiers are moving up into the upper tiers. The golden baby phenomenon is still very much alive or mom wants the very best products for her baby, and so you\u2019re seeing more rapid growth in e-Commerce in China. So, if you looked at Nielsen numbers, you wouldn\u2019t see that kind of category growth rate, but if you -- it's in precise data in China is difficult to get but our guess is that you\u2019d see high single low double digit growth in the category with very little price.  In the case of Russia and Brazil both, there was some price this year and so Paul, I don\u2019t if you\u2019ve got any more detailed numbers, but in the high single double digit -- double digit growth in both in Russia, you probably had half of that was price, I'd guess in the period and not everybody took it, not at the same time. And there has some innovation in launching diaper pants that is a premium price offering that the consumer has traded up into and so you are seeing some mix improvements in both Brazil and Russia. But both also got some price to offset currency that was a factor in the category growth. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : And when it comes to -- that is very helpful, Tom, actually when it comes to what Unicharm is doing in Brazil, is it similar to what it is in China? Is it super premium product? Or is it different? Tom Falk : It's a super-premium product and it\u2019s actually priced quite a bit higher than everything else in the market, and so far hasn\u2019t gotten much traction at least in the measured shared data. Both Procter launched aggressively as did we every kind of diaper pant, we know how to make and occupied I think all of the [indiscernible] positioning that Unicharm might want to go do and so we never take them for granted or underestimate them, but so far our defense plans in Brazil have been working pretty well. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : And finally if I may on Mexico which is completely different from the dynamics in Russia, China and Brazil, could you explain us a little bit of what\u2019s happening? Why the JV income profits are down by some much? What is it pricing environment, could you explain that better? Thank you. Tom Falk : Those -- Pablo Gonzalez will be hosting a call on Thursday, we'll then go in more detail on their numbers. So I don\u2019t want to scoop in too much. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s been a continuation of the trend where it\u2019s been a slower growing economy than was predicted, that\u2019s showed up in slower growth in lots of categories, and more investment in price to try to simulate category growth and I think that hasn\u2019t been fully effective. So we\u2019ve invested in price which has hurt the top line and hurt profitability to hold and stabilize share positions, which we\u2019ve been successful at doing. But it\u2019s been a much more challenging economic environment, I think they\u2019ve had commodity cost inflation as well and a little weaker peso, so it\u2019s been -- they\u2019ve had a number of factors that have combined to suppress their results from what they\u2019re hoping for this year. But Pablo can give you more color on that on Thursday. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : My favorite topic, toilet paper in the U.S., it seems like there is a price war that\u2019s kind of emerging, I mean how problematic do you see that being because I know your pricing has been negative at least in the scan channels for a while, but it seems like P&G has finally kind of bit the bullet and taken their pricing down pretty substantially in the last three or four months, so do these trends continue and kind of where does it end because like the latest round of data was actually pretty damming in terms of substantial sequential price cuts, so any commentary there would be appreciated? Tom Falk : I mean the investment level certainly picked up in the late second and early third quarter and we matched up to it in the third quarter, and you saw that in our price numbers. We also saw it in pretty good volume performance, when I look at the overall margins in our consumer tissue business and the uptick that we got in the quarter, this is a kind of near-term high watermark for us. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re balancing the marketing mix and driving the premium variance where we can and investing in price to make sure we\u2019re competitive on future price points. And that\u2019s kept the momentum going in that business which obviously we\u2019re watching what P&G and GP cope to in this environment, but we\u2019re weathering the strong reasonably well. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Great thanks and then just the 45% of KCI that\u2019s not LATAM, Russia and China, it looks its growing low single digits and I am assuming that those three are up like 17% or something at quarter, so what\u2019s the story there? I mean it\u2019s an opportunity to accelerate growth in those markets. I know Australia is kind of slowing growing, market in South Korea is probably the same, but is there anything else there that is perhaps an opportunity or threat? Tom Falk : I\u2019d say Korea is actually on track with their plan this year. Again, but it is a slower growth market than a lot of the rest of Asia. Australia, you paint that one correctly and now we\u2019ll have some big currency headwinds in the fourth quarter as they roll forward. The rest of Latin America is mixed bag and in Costa Rica and Central America is a little bit more developed, had a little bit more competition in the quarter so we\u2019re working on some things on that front. But I\u2019d say Australia and Korea are by far the two big players in the balance of KCI that we talked about. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Great, thanks so much. And then one last final, the call has gone a long time, the growth rate in diapers in Brazil is like half in the latest periods. Do you know what\u2019s driving that because it was sort of like pretty substantial like 20%-ish range and I fell to like 10%, 11%? Do you know if it\u2019s like a temporary spiders or something more sinister going on there? Tom Falk : No, I mean it\u2019s a more competitive environment. So everybody is spending money like crazy, Proctor is spending aggressively, we are as well, Unicharm is launching. And so I would say delivering double digit growth in that environment has been a pretty solid performance especially against a weaker economic backdrop which probably hasn\u2019t helped on that front. And we\u2019ve had a terrific performance in fem care in Brazil. And so, there is a lot of good things happening in that business overall that we\u2019re pretty happy with. Operator : Mr. Paul, at this time, we have no other questioners. Paul Alexander : All right, thanks for all the questions today. And we\u2019ll wrap up with quick comment from Tom. Tom Falk : Once again solid execution with greater results in K-C International lots of opportunities as we spin Halyard, so congratulations to the Halyard team. And we look forward to the successful transaction completed in the end of next week. And once again thank you all for your support at Kimberly-Clark. Paul Alexander : Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning\u2019s presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines, and thank you for joining us.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today\u2019s presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today\u2019s first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s year-end earnings conference call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.  Now here is the agenda for the call. Mark will begin with a review of our 2014 results, focusing mostly on the full year. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and then address the [indiscernible], and we\u2019ll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our website. That presentation and this morning\u2019s news release both include our detailed planning assumptions for 2015. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We\u2019ll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning\u2019s news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark. Mark Buthman : Thanks, Paul. Good morning. Let\u2019s start with the headlines for the year. First, we generated mid-single digit growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations. Second, we improved our margins, boosted by significant cost savings; and third, we delivered another strong performance managing our balance sheet. Now let\u2019s cover the details of our results. Fourth quarter sales were $4.8 billion, down one point versus prior year. That brought full-year sales to $19.7 billion, up one point compared to 2013. If we exclude currency and restructuring impacts, our organic sales were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the full year. Our momentum in KC International continues to be strong as organic sales were up 7% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 33.9% with the full year at 34.3% - that\u2019s up 20 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 15.9% in the fourth quarter, 16.1% for the full year - that\u2019s up 70 basis points compared to the prior year. I was really encouraged to see our operating margins up in North America, in Europe, and in KC International.  We delivered $320 million of force cost savings in 2014. That\u2019s the second-highest amount we\u2019ve ever achieved. We expect another strong year in 2015 with a savings target of at least $300 million for the year. In addition, we expect to deliver $60 million to $80 million in savings from our 2014 organizational restructuring program. We absorbed $240 million of input cost inflation in 2014. Currencies were also a drag on earnings. Translation was a $75 million negative and transaction effects were also unfavorable. Equity income was down 29% in 2014, and that\u2019s well below our original plan for the year. That was driven by performance in KC de Mexico, which continues to face challenging economic and competitive conditions in Mexico. Because the Mexican peso has depreciated significantly over the last few months, we now expect that equity income will be down somewhat year-on-year in 2015.  Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.35, bringing the full year to $5.51. That\u2019s up 5% year-on-year. That growth is consistent with the 4% to 7% target we set at the beginning of 2014.  Our overall capital management was strong in 2014 as well. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Cash from operations was healthy at $2.8 billion, although we were down somewhat year-on-year. Comparisons were impacted by higher tax payments and transaction costs related to our spin-off of the healthcare business. We reduced primary working capital in 2014 with a seven-day improvement in our cash conversion cycle. Return on invested capital improved nicely, climbing 160 basis points to 19.1% for the year. We returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2014, and for 2015 we expect to repurchase $800 million to $1 billion of KMB stock. Regarding the dividend, we expect a mid-single digit increase this year, consistent with our growth and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2014.  So now let me briefly recap segment results for the year. In personal care, organic sales rose 6%, continuing our track record of delivering strong growth in this segment. Full-year operating margins were solid at 18.7% - that\u2019s an increase of 90 basis points. Moving to consumer tissue, organic sales were up 2%. Operating margins of 16% were up 110 basis points, driven by cost savings and higher net selling prices. Lastly, KC Professional organic sales increased 4%, operating margins were a healthy 17.8%, although they were down slightly year-on-year. Now I want to cover two additional topics, and I\u2019ll start with Venezuela. As you\u2019d expect, we\u2019ve been closely monitoring events and conditions in the country for some time. Given the increased uncertainty and inconsistent liquidity, at the end of the year we decided to move from measuring results at the official exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar to using the government SICAD II floating exchange rate. The SICAD II rate has been trading at about 50 bolivars per dollar recently. As a result of this change, we re-measured our year-end balance sheet in Venezuela at the SICAD II rate with a resulting charge to earnings of $462 million. Looking ahead for 2015, using the SICAD II rate to translate results in Venezuela will reduce total company sales by about 3% and adjusted operating profit by about 4%.  Now to wrap up, starting next quarter we\u2019ll be making a small change in how we talk about our businesses outside of North America. As you know, we\u2019ve spent the last year bringing our European operations together with our KC International organization. That integration is right on track, and as a result starting next quarter, we\u2019ll describe our businesses outside of North America in two groups : developing and emerging markets, and developed markets, and that will replace KC International in Europe. Developing and emerging markets will comprise Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific, and will exclude Australia and South Korea. Developed markets will consist of western and central Europe, Australia and South Korea.  So for some perspective, in 2014 our D&E markets business represented 33% of our company sales, 30% if you take into account the currency rate change in Venezuela. The business generated organic sales growth of 11%, excluding Venezuela, and improved operating margins year-on-year. We expect high single digit to low double digit organic growth in 2015 for our developing and emerging markets business. Our developed markets business was approximately 21% of company sales in 2014. Organic sales were up 1% with healthy and improving operating margins. That wraps up my comments, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Falk : Thanks Mark, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll share my perspective on our full-year 2014 results, and then I\u2019ll address our outlook for 2015. So let\u2019s start with 2014. We delivered on our financial commitments while making strategic changes to further improve our company. As Mark just mentioned, our organic sales grew 4% in 2014, and that was right in line with our long-term target. KC International had another great year, including excellent progress with our key growth initiatives. For example, in our diaper business in KCI, organic sales were up 25% in Eastern Europe, 25% in China, and 10% in Brazil. We continue to benefit from innovation in these markets, and in China Huggies diapers are now sold in 105 cities, and that\u2019s up from just 90 cities at the end of 2013. We\u2019re targeting to be in 115 cities by the end of this year. Our feminine care organic sales rose as a double-digit rate in KC International. We continue to grow our brands and launch innovations in this category around the world. Our adult care organic sales were also up double digits in KCI, and baby wipes rose high single digits. Elsewhere in KC International, our KC Professional sales, organic sales were up double digits. This is now a billion-dollar business for us with attractive margins, so we\u2019ll be making additional investments in this part of our portfolio to drive further growth in the future.  Moving to our North American consumer business, we generated solid sales growth and launched innovations on several brands in 2014. That included Viva towels, Goodnites youth pants, Huggies baby wipes, and our Poise and Depend adult care brands. Our North American market shares were up or even with the prior year in six of the eight categories that we track. One of our businesses had a soft year in North America, and that was mainline Huggies diapers. To improve our performance in 2015, we will be making investments in innovation, marketing and relative value to key competition. Turning to KC Professional in North America, we delivered high single digit volume growth in safety products while volumes were down in washroom. We have made some investments to be more competitive in this category, and with better execution and an improving U.S. economy we expect to drive more growth in this business in 2015. Mark\u2019s already highlighted how we continue to manage our company with financial discipline, so I\u2019ll just add that I\u2019m pleased with our cost savings, our margin improvement and our cash returns to shareholders during the year. I\u2019m also pleased that we delivered on our bottom line growth target in a challenging environment. We also made some important strategic changes to the business this past year. We successfully executed the spin-off of our healthcare business, and that\u2019s allowed both Kimberly-Clark and Halyard Health to further increase focus on their own strategies. We initiated our 2014 organization restructuring. This will help us improve our efficiency, will offset the impact of stranded overhead costs from the spin-off, and will increase our flexibility to invest in future growth. We expect to make significant progress with this program in 2015.  We also completed our European strategic changes initiative and we are realizing the benefits we expected. Over the past two years, our European consumer business has increased operating profit by 10% and improved operating margin by 300 basis points, and we\u2019re growing volumes in our high margin childcare and baby wipes businesses. So all in all, I\u2019m encouraged with our accomplishments in 2014 and our teams are focused on driving further improvements going forward. Now let\u2019s move to our outlook for 2015. The environment has become significantly more volatile recently, particularly with currency rates and commodity cost, so planning in this environment has become much more dynamic. Regardless, our teams continue to focus on our global business plan strategies and the fundamentals that create long-term shareholder value. In 2015, we\u2019ll leverage our brands, our growth initiatives, our innovations and marketing investments to drive organic sales growth. We\u2019ll deliver healthy levels of cost savings to improve our margins and fund reinvestments in the business, and we\u2019ll generate strong cash flow, improve our return on invested capital, and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. In terms of our specific 2015 targets, on the top line we expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. We\u2019ll continue to focus on driving rapid growth in personal care and KC Professional and developing in emerging markets. We will launch innovations throughout our businesses. Near-term activity in North America will include upgrades on Huggies diapers, Huggies baby wipes, and in our adult care business. Internationally, we\u2019ll introduce new or improved products across a number of categories. To support our innovations and growth initiatives, our advertising spending should be up somewhat as a percent of sales.  On the bottom line, we\u2019re targeting adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.60 to $5.80. That\u2019s up 2% to 5% compared to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2014. Similar to this past year, we expect that earnings in 2015 will be higher in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. Like other multinational companies, we\u2019re facing significant currency headwinds. Including the rate change in Venezuela, we expect that translation effects will reduce our sales by 8% to 9% and reduce earnings by 9% to 10%. Adding in transaction effects, currency is likely to hurt our bottom line by more than 15% in 2015.  On the commodity front, the outlook has improved some in the past three months, but at this point we are not planning for a big commodity windfall. Oil-based costs have started to fall recently, but not nearly as much as the drop in oil prices. We expect pulp costs, including secondary fiber, to be similar to last year or even up slightly. We\u2019re also assuming that local inflation will continue in some of our international markets. Adding it all up, our plan assumes cost deflation in 2015 of zero to $150 million. At the midpoint, that\u2019s only a two point benefit to the bottom line, so the primary ways that we\u2019ll offset currency headwinds will be by raising selling prices where we can, delivering cost savings, and controlling our overhead spending.  We will continue to focus on cash generation and capital allocation in 2015. Cash provided by operations should be similar to 2014 or perhaps up somewhat, despite the lost cash flow from the spun-off healthcare business. We expect to allocate at least $2.1 billion to dividends and share repurchases in 2015. That represents a cash return of about 5%, based on our current market capitalization.  So in summary, we delivered on our growth targets in 2014 while making strategic changes to improve our company. We continue to focus on the fundamentals that drive our long-term performance and we remain optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns.  That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we\u2019ll begin to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi. A few questions for you. One, I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into North American consumer tissue, given the price mix was down quite a bit. I get that you\u2019re rolling off the sheeting, I get that there is competitors in the marketplace, Georgia Pacific in particular that was aggressive. But can you tell us a little bit of how you think it should go forward? You said pricing actions. I wanted to get a sense of what you think that should look like going forward, and if you can give us any more detail if it is a capacity issue - I know we\u2019ve all heard about [indiscernible] capacity coming online, if there\u2019s anything around that that you think is more sustainable from a pressure downwards. Thomas Falk : Yes, I guess the way I\u2019d look at this, Ali, is probably the fourth quarter was more of a year-on-year impact than timing of promotions. If you looked at it sequentially, I\u2019d say tissue pricing in the market was pretty similar third quarter to fourth quarter; and again, we wouldn\u2019t see a big swing going forward, so I\u2019d say second half was a little bit more competitive than first half, but pulp prices have been pretty stable and aren\u2019t moving around very much, so there\u2019s not a lot of driver for competitive pricing at this point in time. Ali Dibadj : Okay, so the capacity issue is not an issue, it sounds like, so no change there? Thomas Falk : I mean, I think industry operating rates are still hovering around 90%, so that may be down a tick. As we look at the industry capacity increase in 2015, it looks like there\u2019s maybe net 1% additional capacity coming online. That\u2019s pretty much what the market grows every year, so there is not a huge imbalance at this point in time. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about how that will play out. Ali Dibadj : Okay, two other ones, one on Venezuela. Just wanted to get a sense of what\u2019s changed over the past several months that makes you change the way you\u2019re accounting for it, and moreover as we look at it going forward, how much historically, w whether it be between consumer tissue or personal care, you are benefiting from price mix from Venezuela that affects KCI, and we see good price mix in Latin America, for example, for PC, how much of that was Venezuela and how we should expect that going forward. So what\u2019s different and then kind of going forward on the Venezuela pulling out from a price perspective. Thomas Falk : Yes, you know, I think it\u2019s something that Mark and I have been spending a lot of time watching and working with Elane Stock and the KC International team to kind of monitor what\u2019s going on on the ground in Venezuela. Really if you look at what happened with the oil price shock and that economy is so dependent on oil, we really expected probably some other deflation or devaluation action to happen, and we got to the end of the year and felt like it was the right thing to do, to move to a rate that was maybe more reflective of economic reality on the ground. We\u2019re still getting foreign exchange at the 6-3 rate, but translating in our U.S. dollar results felt like we should use a rate that was a little closer to the economic reality, so something that we spent a lot of time thinking about and talking about in the fourth quarter. But the drop in oil prices certainly made a difference.  It\u2019s also a key that we--you know, as we said in the last call, that we\u2019ve kept our U.S. dollar exposure there, and so we started to take some down time in the country due to lack of foreign exchange, and that also was a factor in our decision.  In terms of the impact on Venezuela, it\u2019s been about a one point tailwind to KCI growth if you look at it in total, or if you took Venezuela out of the KCI growth rate, it\u2019d probably drop by about a point, if that makes sense. Ali Dibadj : It does help. So last question, and it\u2019s something I asked a little while ago, a few years ago actually, and I just want to revisit it and get your point of view again, which is 2014, dividend plus repurchase was $3.3 billion, which was very impressive. But yet again, that was higher than your free cash flow, as it has been for the past several years, and it sounds like back of the envelope it will probably be the same type of return to shareholders higher than your free cash flow in 2015 as well. I want to get a sense of how you think about that, especially as you describe in a more volatile environment, and whether it\u2019s sustainable. Thomas Falk : Yes, that\u2019s a good question. In 2014, basically the difference was the Halyard dividend, and so as part of the spin, we pulled the Halyard dividend out, so that boosted us up to the top end. But Mark, maybe you want to give a little bit more color on 2015 and how you\u2019re thinking about that. Mark Buthman : Yes Ali, I think it\u2019s a fair assessment. As the company grows, we\u2019ve grown our balance sheet a little bit in line, but our target is to be a solid single-A credit. Heading into the year, we expect free cash flow to equal dividends and share repurchases. This year coming into the year, our outlook was to increase debt just a little bit associated with the healthcare spin, and we felt we had a little bit of capacity. But there\u2019s nothing changed about our target to be a solid single-A, and we watch those metrics pretty closely. Ali Dibadj : Okay, thanks for all the answers. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara : Thanks guys. Good morning. So I guess you\u2019re looking for one to two points of pricing in \u201915. You did about two in \u201914. I guess I\u2019d like to get a sense of your confidence level that you\u2019ll be able to take incremental pricing, especially in light of where crude is sitting, from a competitive standpoint, and how much of that maybe is follow-through pricing that you\u2019ve already taken, like how much is incremental pricing in \u201915. Thomas Falk : Yes, good question. So a fair amount of it is follow-through, and it\u2019s not going to be broadly based, so it\u2019s going to be targeted in key markets. Where you\u2019ve seen big currency moves, like Russia, Argentina, you\u2019ll see a disproportionate amount of pricing in markets like that. If you see a market like Australia where you\u2019ve had currency weakness, or the euro zone where you\u2019ve seen currency weakness, it will be much tougher to get pricing in those markets, and I think the commodity factor that you mentioned as well will make it more difficult. But in a market like Russia, you could see double-digit, mid-teens kinds of pricing in Russia and Eastern Europe, just because of the shock that you\u2019ve seen to currencies in those markets. Chris Ferrara : I guess more specifically, I think in the personal care KCI blurb in the press release, you talked about Brazil volume being down there, and relating it to pricing. Is that the risk--I mean, volume fell off pretty markedly, I guess, in KCI without a lot of incremental pricing relative to last quarter. Could you talk about that risk a little bit? Thomas Falk : Yes, I mean, Brazil we took some pricing on November 1, and so we had a little bit of a late third quarter, early fourth quarter buy-in ahead of that, so it was a little softer in the end of the quarter as a result of that. We were probably--year-over-year, our promotional timing was not quite as heavily back end-loaded, so I\u2019d say overall we felt pretty good about our volume in Brazil being up double digits in diapers for the year. We\u2019ve got great momentum and innovation coming, and I\u2019m expecting them to have a very solid year in 2015. Chris Ferrara : Thanks. Just lastly, real quick, the mainline Huggies diapers, obviously that\u2019s where you\u2019ve been losing share. You commented on it, and one of the things you noted, I guess, was adjusting relative value to key customers or versus competition. Could you talk about how big a piece price will be to what you end up doing in mainline diapers, and what kind of timeframe you expect that at? Thomas Falk : Yes, I think value, as you know Chris, is a combination of performance and price, so we\u2019ll make sure that we\u2019re competitive in our promotion calendar, that we\u2019ve got the right amount of display activity, that we\u2019re executing it well at retail. So I wouldn\u2019t expect anything major from a list price standpoint; it\u2019s really more of just making sure we\u2019re executing and more competitive with at least our fair share of display activities at competitive prices in-store, and then we\u2019ll have some product news as well coming with some mainline improvements in late first quarter and additional improvements coming during the year, just to make sure we get off to a better start and have a much better year on Huggies in 2015. Chris Ferrara : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Great, thanks. Appreciate it. On commodities, most of your assumptions are ahead of where current spot rates and external estimates are. Broadly speaking, I understand that many forecasters guess that prices will stabilize higher for oil, but can you give more color on your other forecasts, including pulp, and also what you\u2019re thinking in terms of resin? Thomas Falk : Yes, from a pulp standpoint and secondary fiber, it\u2019s looking fairly stable in the outlook. I mean, they see some--we\u2019ve actually in recent weeks seen eucalyptus going up a little bit and northern softwood coming down a little bit, secondary fiber has been pretty firm - it\u2019s maybe trended down just a bit, but our outlook for both of those is to be pretty stable during the year. They don\u2019t seem to be affected as much by some of the big currency moves maybe as they have been in the past, and the underlying supply-demand balance has been fairly stable and even tight in some grades of pulp, and in some markets for secondary fiber. So on the polymer side, we would say that over time it generally follows oil. It seems to be a little slower at this point in time, and there\u2019s been some supply constraints on polypropylene, which we use a lot of, that has held pricing up a little bit more than maybe you would expect. That one\u2019s been the toughest one to forecast, and there aren\u2019t as many good forecasting services out there for that. There is a little bit of a forward market, but it\u2019s not that reliable and not that heavily traded. So we\u2019d expect us to get some benefit on that zero to 150 million of cost deflation, and polymer is a pretty good chunk of that, but that\u2019s the harder one to call for the year, probably. Olivia Tong : How have your discussions with retailers gone, particularly in the U.S., given what has happened with prices at the pump? Thomas Falk : Well with the fourth quarter, we still had $55 million of cost inflation in our quarter, so we still had polymer and other materials going up $30 million, pulp was still up $15 million, distribution costs, unrelated to fuel surcharges, but just rates were up $15 million. So we haven\u2019t had any deflation yet to talk about, so I think at this point they\u2019re all watching it closely but it hasn\u2019t been that noisy at this stage. Mark Buthman : The other perspective I\u2019d add, Olivia, is that as inflation has been moderate for the last few years, we really haven\u2019t recouped that on the way up, so that may help us if costs go down a little bit in 2015. Olivia Tong : Got it, thanks. Just if I could follow up with one quick question on the organic sales, you guys give that by key emerging markets. You gave for the full year, but can you give it to us for Q4? Mark Buthman : Yes, are you referring to the diaper business, Olivia? Olivia Tong : Right, diapers - Brazil, Eastern Europe - exactly. Mark Buthman : Yes, so China was up almost 30% in the fourth quarter in diapers, Eastern Europe was up about 25%, and Brazil was down slightly due to the pricing action Tom described. Olivia Tong : Got it, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Schmidt with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmidt : Hey guys, good morning. Just had a few questions. So was there any pre-buy ahead of all these price increases, especially in Eastern Europe and Russia, that might have impacted things a little bit on the volume side in the quarter? Thomas Falk : Not so much in Eastern Europe, and some of their pricing--they\u2019ve been getting pricing all year, and there\u2019s some more going in in the first quarter. As we talked about in Brazil, there was some forward buy that probably boosted late third quarter, very early fourth quarter, and then it was a little lighter in November and December in Brazil. Bill Schmidt : Okay, thanks. Then did you exit Italy, because I didn\u2019t see a press release, but I looked at some of the Nielsen data and it looks like volumes there are down 30, 40%. Thomas Falk : No, we\u2019re still selling in Italy in diapers and in tissue, so. I haven\u2019t seen that in the Nielsen data. I\u2019d say our business was a little softer in the fourth quarter, but it wasn\u2019t to that extent. Bill Schmidt : Okay, and then as I look at the raw material guidance, the zero to $150 million, you kind of look at the different pieces, maybe I\u2019ll just confirm some of the assumptions. But I thought that every dollar move in oil was $6 million to EBIT, and then you gave us the other assumptions on polypropylene and super-absorbers, and the numbers I\u2019m getting to are significantly higher than your zero to $150 million, so I\u2019m just trying to figure out where I\u2019m wrong. Mark Buthman : Yes, those are the rules of thumb we\u2019ve given. Those rules of thumb aren\u2019t working right at the moment, so I think eventually they\u2019ll probably work, but it\u2019s going to take a little longer for it to flow through the pipe at this point in time. So yeah, you would expect that over time if oil stays at this level for an extended period of time, that you\u2019ll see more of that flow through, but it\u2019s not going to happen at this point in the first half. We may get a little bit more as the year progresses - we\u2019ll see, but at this point based on what we know, we\u2019re not calling for that windfall to flow through at the same level as our traditional rules of thumb would have indicated. Bill Schmidt : Yes, the reason I bring it up is that if oil really is--just oil alone is $6 million per dollar move, that alone should be $225 million next year, right? Mark Buthman : If you got it all in one year, but it\u2019s got to flow through adhesives and packaging materials, and that\u2019s just taking a little longer at this point in time. We\u2019ve seen nowhere near that kind of drop-off in the cost of polymer at this point. It\u2019s come down modestly, and as we said, in the fourth quarter we still had inflation in those material areas so we didn\u2019t see any benefit yet at this stage. Bill Schmidt : Okay. Not to keep belaboring this, but oil is exclusive to the polypropylene and the natural gas, right, so oil is the $6 million and then it\u2019s the different buys also in the different raw materials - is that correct? So I\u2019m not double counting in terms of the $6 million, right? Mark Buthman : The oil--the rule of thumb that we\u2019ve given you was intended to kind of roughly cover all of our oil-based materials. We don\u2019t have that much direct oil exposure at all. Bill Schmidt : Okay, all right. That makes sense. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail Glazerman : Hi, good morning. Could we go back to the North American diaper situation? Your volumes have been pretty weak for a while. Have you started to take any of the actions that you\u2019re talking about, and as you think of your plan for 2015, how concerned are you that with a potential deflationary environment, the competitive environment is only going to get worse? Thomas Falk : I\u2019d say that\u2019s started, to take some of the competitive action, yet; but it takes a lot longer to effect retail or promotion plans, so much of that work was started in \u201914 and will play out in \u201915. So a little bit better in late fourth quarter, but it didn\u2019t show up much in the numbers. We know it\u2019s a competitive environment out there. It has been, and we\u2019re going to be competing harder and we\u2019ve anticipated that there will be some competitive response in our outlook. Gail Glazerman : Okay. Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in private label? Obviously Amazon made some noise earlier this week, as well as a few weeks ago. Are you seeing any incremental or less pressure there? Thomas Falk : I would say the Amazon thing was kind of here and gone fairly quickly, so that one didn\u2019t have much of an impact in the marketplace. It probably generated more media interest than consumer interest, I would say. Private label shares didn\u2019t do much this year, so you\u2019re seeing more of the activity probably has been with Luvs and the value segment has been where more of the action has been this year in terms of share growth. Gail Glazerman : All right. Can you talk a little bit about North American [inco], just kind of your latest thoughts on how Procter\u2019s return to the market is playing out? Thomas Falk : Yes, I think they\u2019ve done pretty well on the light end, the part that would compete with Poise. They\u2019ve probably--I think they\u2019ve picked up seven share points. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve lost our fair share, but have defended pretty effectively in terms of promotion; and the category has grown a little bit, so our volume actually was flat overall in the quarter, despite a big competitive launch. We\u2019ve done better on the Depend end of the spectrum where we really haven\u2019t lost any share and have done well in that segment of it. We\u2019ve got more innovation coming in that space and feel pretty good about our business around the world. As we noted, we\u2019ve had double-digit growth in adult care globally as well, so it\u2019s an exciting category, on trend, and we\u2019re going to keep driving hard to get at least our fair share of the growth there. Operator : Our next question comes from John Faucher from JP Morgan. John Faucher : Good morning. Just want to talk a little bit about the view on the promotional environment. This came up a little bit, but right now, given how the competitive environment is looking, the balance between marketing spend and trade promotion, do you feel like you\u2019re in the right situation there, and have you seen any risk of any of the competitors maybe tilting a little bit more towards promotion in advance of some of the raw material benefits flowing through? Then also, can you just talk a little bit about some of the timing of some of your innovation in terms of how we should see that playing out over the course of the year? Thanks. Thomas Falk : Sure. On the trade versus strategic, I think it\u2019s a little early at this point in time because there hasn\u2019t been much deflation that\u2019s made it into anybody\u2019s P&L yet. On the tissue side, you certainly haven\u2019t seen pulp costs come down significantly, if at all, so that\u2019s not really driving anything there. You\u2019re not seeing it really either on the personal care side that would be driven by oil particularly, so it\u2019s not a factor at this stage and we feel pretty good about our mix of marketing spend going into 2015. We\u2019re trying to make sure we can drive even better performance off the trade money that we spend, so we\u2019d love to drive more volume for the same investment by executing it better at retail and coming up with the right strategic price points, the right kinds of display activity that tie into the things that retailers are supportive of, so we want to get better at that around the world where we can. So I think from an innovation standpoint, you\u2019ll see some of the diaper stuff happen in first quarter. There\u2019s some adult care activity that\u2019s happening in the first half as well, so pretty strong calendar around the world, but quite a few things getting started already early in the year. John Faucher : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks, good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment in diaper pants? I know that\u2019s been a place where in emerging markets, you seem to be a bit ahead of the game, but Procter talked about launching a new and improved in the second half of the year, so just curious if you see any change in dynamics in that category in terms of share, or even a deceleration in the diaper pants segment as the economies in emerging markets have been a bit tougher. Thanks. Thomas Falk : Yes, that\u2019s been a pretty exciting business around the world, and really we\u2019ve been a strong player but also Unicharm and Kao, two Japanese competitors--you know, in Japan diaper pants are the majority of the diaper category, and they\u2019ve got terrific products, so we\u2019ve been competing with them for some time. We have been launching diaper pants pretty aggressively around the world, and Procter has recently kind of entered that part of the category both in China and Russia, and a few other places - Brazil, so there\u2019s a lot going on there. It\u2019s really a strong source of category growth everywhere. Not seeing it slow down at this point in time. I think it will be interesting to see what happens in markets like Russia with the economic activity that\u2019s playing out there, but at this point it didn\u2019t seem to slow anything down significantly in the fourth quarter, so we\u2019ll watch that one closely going forward. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Also just on Russia, you talked about mid-teens kind of pricing but still had really strong volume. Are you anticipating that volume decelerates because of the pricing, or do you think the consumer is going to be able to bear the pricing? Thomas Falk : This is a bit of uncharted territory. If Russia and some of the other eastern European economies decline by mid-single digits, which is what some of the forecasters say, we\u2019ll see how that plays out in terms of consumer purchasing power. At this point, our momentum looks pretty good. Our team over there is pretty motivated, and while the size of the P&L is going to wiggle around with the exchange rates, they are really focused on improving the shape of the P&L and making sure they take market share, they drive their innovation hard, they\u2019re improving their margins, trying to get pricing where they can, and come out of it with a much stronger market position as the crisis starts to move forward. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Then just finally on KC Professional and kind of the cyclical exposure to an improving U.S economy, in your comments it sounded a little bit like there is some investment in price necessary, so can you talk about in what segments of business that might be, and has that been holding the business back thus far? Thomas Falk : It\u2019s probably typically been to hold some lower tier volume, where we\u2019ve had to make some price investments to make sure we were competitive, so that\u2019s probably one soft spot. We\u2019re trying to not chase low margin business, but there are some strategic pieces of business that you have a fuller range of products in that you might be more competitive on washroom, if you\u2019ve got their safety and wiper business. But broadly, secondary fiber prices actually have continued to go up, so there have been some industry price increases still in that market as well, so that\u2019s offsetting the kind of price drag to be competitive in some markets with some customers as well.  But overall, we think that KCP, and we\u2019ve talked to our distributors, they\u2019re looking to have a better 2015 as the U.S. economy continues to recover and employment levels are pretty good, so they\u2019re a little bit more bullish than they were a year ago. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Lash from Morningstar. Erin Lash : Thank you for taking my question. A lot of my questions have been answered at this point, but I was wondering - and you kind of alluded to this a little bit earlier - but I was wondering with regards to just the logistics and transportation costs, if you could talk to whether the degree to which truck driver shortages is impacting you to any meaningful degree and offsetting some of that benefit that you might otherwise see from the decline in oil prices. Thomas Falk : Yes, as we talked in the quarter, of our $55 million in cost inflation, $15 million was in distribution, and virtually all of that was rate increases related to driver availability. So that has been a big problem for the industry overall, and it\u2019s actually caused us some customer service issues in some of our businesses for periods of time where there was an inability to get trucks in certain lanes. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to watch, but that certainly was a bigger drag than any benefit we got from lower diesel prices in the quarter. Erin Lash : Got it, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. I was wondering if you could just speak to just across your channel exposure, if there is any opportunity to further penetrate other alternative outlets - dollar stores, or if there\u2019s any areas where you feel you\u2019re under-penetrated to this point. Thomas Falk : We try to sell our products wherever mom wants to shop, so we\u2019re doing pretty well across the channels. I think we were probably a little late to ecommerce in the U.S. - we\u2019re catching up quickly. We\u2019ve probably been ahead in ecommerce in markets like China, where we\u2019re doing quite well there, but we\u2019re also trying to make sure--you know, there\u2019s a channel of baby stores in China which is very popular, that we do well in. There are small format diaper store in markets like Argentina where they might have 6,000 little tiny mom-and-pop run shops that just sell diapers and baby formula, so our customer teams around the world are constantly challenging to say, where else is mom looking to shop, what\u2019s emerging, how do we make sure we get on the front end of it so that we\u2019re there with the right offer. Erin Lash : Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Hi, good morning everyone. I would like to talk about the 2015 forecast for operating profit growth to be up 1% to 4%. In Slide 27, you basically said that the currency impact, including transaction costs, is going to be 15%. So essentially, what is the currency-neutral EPS growth that you guys are planning, like 20%? You cannot get there, even having all the full savings flowing through the P&L, having all the restructuring savings going through the P&L, and even taking $150 million in commodity benefits. You don\u2019t get to 20% operating profit growth. So if you can help me understand this commentary of the currency impact on profits being more than 15%, that would be very helpful. Thomas Falk : So Javier, was that a question or a performance review? I just was-- Javier Escalante : Well, I don\u2019t see how you can grow currency-neutral profits at 20%. Thomas Falk : So if you looked at it, it kind of--I\u2019d say it\u2019s a fair question. There are some big moving parts in the P&L, maybe more than we\u2019ve seen in the past, so if you looked at it in big buckets and said, okay, currency translation and transaction is probably $500 million to $600 million, and if we get the price that we\u2019re talking about of one to two points of price, that offsets maybe half of the currency drag. You get some commodity deflation, which is another chunk, so if you can get price and commodity deflation, that probably offsets two-thirds of the currency translation and transaction. Then you\u2019ve got to get benefits of volume growth, benefits of our cost savings program and our organization restructuring program, cover other costs increases, and deliver your profit growth year-on-year. So you\u2019ve got probably bigger buckets of activity moving through the P&L than maybe we\u2019ve had in the past, but the math actually works. Javier Escalante : So what would it be, then, the currency-neutral EPS growth that you are forecasting? Thomas Falk : Well, the question would be, as you said, some of the price we\u2019re getting is because of currency, so--and these things, if you think about currency, commodity costs, and price, they\u2019re all somewhat related. So you could look at it in the absolute sense, but you might be kidding yourself that you could still get all the price in a currency neutral environment. Javier Escalante : But it\u2019s not that currency-neutral EPS growth, it\u2019s over 20%? Thomas Falk : Well as you said, if currency translation and transaction is 15-plus, and we\u2019re growing our bottom line EPS 2 to 5, you can do the math and add it to the 15, and that\u2019s the underlying growth. It\u2019s going to come in cost savings, volume improvement, price mix, and commodity deflation. Javier Escalante : But do you think that your forecast is conservative or it\u2019s aggressive for 2015, because it seems like everything has to go well to grow EPS 2 to 5%. Thomas Falk : Well Javier, we usually try to give guidance right down the middle of the fairway, that it\u2019s the best estimate we have at this point in time of what we think is going to happen. I will tell you, there is more big moving parts flowing through the P&L, so if currency moves suddenly in one direction and we don\u2019t recover quickly enough on price, that\u2019s a risk. On the other hand, there have been other questioners on the call saying, well gosh, what if commodities stay down longer and lower than you thought and you get some benefit? So I think we will do the best we can in the environment we\u2019re in, and we\u2019ll give you visibility as we go through the year on how we\u2019re tracking against these big assumptions that we\u2019ve made. Javier Escalante : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets. Pat Trucchio : Hey, good morning. It\u2019s actually Pat Trucchio on the call for Connie. Just first, can you talk about some of the big forest projects for the year? Thomas Falk : Yes. We\u2019ve got three big buckets of activity around forest. One is negotiated material savings, and our global procurement group is ramping up again to deliver against that. They delivered more than $50 million of bottom line benefit in \u201914 and are looking to do that, or even better, in \u201915. Productivity for us is another big opportunity area. We are driving lean continuous improvement, design for value around our organization, and are continuing to get benefits from that and would expect that to be another strong contributor. Then material specification changes, so how can we get even more effective on the product design so that we\u2019re giving mom everything that she wants and able to take cost out of design by the choices we make on that front. So those will be three big factors again, and we\u2019d expect that to roll forward to deliver $300 million in cost saves again for another strong year for us. Mark Buthman : Pat, we probably have 25% of our capital goes to productivity and waste-type cost savings projects as well, so in addition to just kind of the way we work, we\u2019re also putting some capital behind cost savings and margin improvement. Pat Trucchio : Okay. Then lastly, how is Poise Impressa doing in tests? Is the test regional or nationwide, and is it being expanded? When might the product come to market? Thomas Falk : Yes, that\u2019s really just a test in one market at this point in time, in Kansas City. I haven\u2019t seen the read of the test so far. They\u2019re testing a lot of different combinations down there, so I\u2019ve generally heard it\u2019s going well but I haven\u2019t seen the output, and we\u2019ll have final launch plans once we get a read on the test and what exactly we\u2019re going to do with that. It\u2019s an interesting product, and we\u2019ll see where it plays out. Pat Trucchio : Okay, great. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy : Good morning. Thanks so much. I\u2019d just like to understand better what happened in U.S. diapers. It just seems a quite dramatic market share loss and volume decline, and if you could just--you know, maybe see what you hadn\u2019t foreseen, because I\u2019m sure this was a lot below your projections. Thomas Falk : It was about a point share loss sequentially, and I\u2019d say the trend has continued all year. Essentially, Luvs has been the big share gainer - I think Luvs has picked up two share points so far this year. They\u2019ve been on promotion really every week with a particular key retailer, and that\u2019s one that we\u2019ve been working hard to make sure we do better in that particular category with that particular customer. In the meantime, we\u2019re working to drive the business across the country with better product performance, making sure we\u2019re competitive on shelf with the right display activity and the right offer. So it\u2019s really the basics of execution in that business, and we didn\u2019t do as good of a job as we needed to in 2014, and we will do a better job in 2015. Caroline Levy : It isn\u2019t just about price, though? I mean, doesn\u2019t it just require you to lower your prices, or shift your mix in order to compete? Thomas Falk : No, I mean, I think--well, value is always a function of performance and price, so will we be more competitive on shelf and our promoted pricing? I would expect that will be a part of it, but it will also be product improvements and news and innovation that drive mom\u2019s preference in these categories. Caroline Levy : So to that point, there\u2019s some optimism about the U.S. consumer. Do you think that we, or are you seeing any signs of consumers being willing to trade up or of demand improving in your U.S. business? Thomas Falk : Well, when we look at our Huggies super-premium diaper, we are seeing that - we\u2019ve picked up probably half a share point this year on our super-premium Huggies diapers in the U.S., so mom will trade up for real innovation. We\u2019ve got more innovation coming behind that segment of our line-up as well, so it is also focusing on that trade-up consumer. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen an uptick in the numbers of consumers heading in that direction at this stage, but it\u2019s pretty early days in this oil price cycle as well. Mark Buthman : And Caroline, that\u2019s true across categories. If you look at super-premium bath, it\u2019s growing as a percentage of the category and our share is growing. Our Viva Vantage launch in the super-premium end of the towel category this year has been a case, and continence is largely being driven by the super-premium end of the category. So even through a tougher economic time, the categories are growing not only in the value tier but the super-premium segment as well. Caroline Levy : Right. Okay, thank you. Then just to ask about Russia, and getting back to if you take double-digit pricing, have you done that already, or is that something that\u2019s coming and therefore the demand impact has not been felt? Thomas Falk : There were multiple price increases during 2014 as the economic crisis unfolded, and then there is another wave of pricing coming to that market in early 2015 with the recent fall of the ruble. Caroline Levy : So do you think that the price elasticity is well below one-to-one? Thomas Falk : I think when you see an economic shock like this, we\u2019re all going to find out what this consumer is going to do in a negative GDP growth environment. But in the meantime, there\u2019s so much of these products are based on imported raw materials, even though we make the diapers in Russia, the polypropylene and packaging materials are all dollar-based, the pulp is all dollar-based, and so you\u2019ve got to get some pricing just to cover the huge shift in the cost of those imported materials in local currency. Caroline Levy : Got it. Then just to your equity income line, you talked about Mexico being down because of the peso. If you were to take out the currency impact, would you be--are you seeing a recovery in sort of the local operating dynamics in Mexico, or are you still under pressure there? Thomas Falk : Well, I think they saw--Mark and I were just down in Mexico earlier this week, and we met with Pablo and Claudio and the team down there. I think their volume growth or their organic growth was up 5% in the quarter, but it was off an easier comp in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Their shares are stable - they\u2019re north of 60% in bath and diapers, which are their two big categories. It\u2019s a tough competitive market. The consumer is still pretty weak. There\u2019s been lots of reforms down there that have probably affected consumer purchasing power in the short term. On the other hand, they're optimistic that there\u2019s going to be better economic growth and a better consumer environment in the medium to long term. In the meantime, they\u2019ve got a fairly tough peso exchange rate that gives them a little bit of the impact of imported material costs, because a lot of their costs are dollar-based as well.  So it\u2019s a challenging environment, but we\u2019ve got a very strong position down there and a great team to operate the business. Caroline Levy : Thank you. I have one last one, just on China and demand there. You\u2019ve done just unbelievably well taking share for a lot of years. Are you seeing anything out there as you head into this year that suggests that the growth is going to slow or that competition has picked up their game, online in particular? Thomas Falk : There\u2019s lots of competition in China and has been for years. Pretty much every multinational CPG in the world is doing something in China - you know, the Japanese are aggressive competitors, Proctor is aggressive, SCA just bought Vinda, which is a local tissue player, so they\u2019re in there now in some categories. So we\u2019ve got a terrific team, great innovation, and we\u2019re executing pretty well in that market, and that has been translating into terrific business results. So Mike Zhang and our China team, and Achal Argawal and our Asia team have done a great job of executing in that market, and we feel like we\u2019ve got great momentum and more good things coming. Caroline Levy : Thanks so much. Operator : Mr. Falk, at this time we have no further questioners in the queue. Thomas Falk : Well once again, everyone, thank you for your support of Kimberly-Clark. We had a terrific year in 2014 in executing and delivering great value for our shareholders, and we\u2019re headed into a more challenging environment in 2015 but rest assured that our global business plan is pointing us in the right direction. Thank you again. Mark Buthman : Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines and thank you for joining us today.",

Alexander - VP, IR Analysts : Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein Gail Glazerman - UBS Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Brian Doyle - CLSA Russell William Schmidt - Deutsche Bank Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research John Faucher - JPMorgan Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience in holding, we now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today\u2019s presentation we will open the floor for your questions. At that time instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today\u2019s first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul J. Alexander : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. Here with me today in Dallas are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller. Now here is the agenda for our call. Mark will begin with a review of first quarter results, Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We\u2019ll finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our website. And as a reminder we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements.  We\u2019ll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning\u2019s release. The news release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark. Mark A. Buthman: Thanks Paul and good morning. Let\u2019s start with some headlines. First we achieved organic sales growth of 5%. It was highlighted by 11% growth in developing and emerging markets. Second, we delivered strong cost savings, margin improvements and growth in adjusted earnings per share. And third we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. So let\u2019s cover the details of our results. First quarter sales were $4.7 billion, down 4% including a nine point drag from currency rates. Our underlying organic sales rose 5%. Adjusted gross margin was 35.6% in the first quarter, that\u2019s up 140 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating profit was up 7% versus a year ago with an operating margin of 17.4%. That\u2019s up a 180 basis points compared to the prior year.  I am really encouraged by our margins and our cost savings performance, as we start the year. We delivered $90 million of FORCE cost savings and we are off to a very good start relative to our full year target for savings of at least $300 million. In addition our organizational restructuring is on track and generated $10 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were at $10 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $10 million benefit in the quarter, that\u2019s the first time in more than two years that we experienced cost deflation.  On the other hand we absorbed significant currency headwinds. The total earnings drag from currency was approximately $0.25 per share or about 19% in the quarter. On the bottom line first quarter adjusted earnings per share were a $1.42. That\u2019s a strong start to the year and up 8% compared to last year. Now turning to cash flow, our cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $20 million. That\u2019s compared to $437 million last year. The decline was primarily due to higher pension contributions, currency effects and operating working capital and the impact of last year\u2019s spin-off of our healthcare business. In February we made contributions which we financed by a debt offering to our U.S. pension plan in conjunction with the annuity transaction that we announced. As a result of these contributions we now expect that cash provided operations in 2015 will be down somewhat year-on-year. In terms of primary working capital first quarter cash conversion cycle was down seven days compared to full year 2014. So we are ahead of our three to four day improvement objective for the year. Now moving to capital allocation, first quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled $0.5 billion. We continue to provide a top tier dividend payout among our peers and in February we announced our 43rd consecutive annual increase in the dividend. As we mentioned in this morning\u2019s news release in the first quarter we acquired the remaining interest in our subsidiary in Israel for $150 million. As a result we are now targeting full year share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $900 million. Full year dividends and share repurchases should be at least $2 billion or about 5% of our current market capitalization. Now I will highlight a few areas from our segment results for the quarter, in Personal Care, organic sales rose 6%. Performance was led by developing and emerging markets with organic sales up 16%. Overall Personal Care operating margins were 19.7% in the quarter. That\u2019s up 50 basis points year-on-year.  Moving to Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up a point, including strong bathroom tissue volumes in North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 18.5% were up 330 basis points year-on-year, with a strong cost savings performance and lower between the line spending. And lastly, K-C Professional organic sales increased 7%. Organic sales were up 8% in developing in emerging markets and 4% in North America. The total KCP segment top line also benefited from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited term supply agreement. Overall KCP margins were 16.9%. That was even with a year ago. So that wraps up my comments. To recap we are off to a strong start in the first quarter led by organic sales growth at the high end of our 3% to 5% full year target. We delivered strong cost savings, improved margins and growth in adjusted earnings per share and we continue to focus on allocating capital in shareholder friendly ways. Now I will turn it over to Tom. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. I will share my perspectives on our first quarter results and then I will address our full year outlook. But before I do that some of you may know this is Mark Buthman\u2019s last conference call as CFO for Kimberly-Clark. We tried to figure this out the other day and we think he has done 49 or 50 of these earnings in a row and that\u2019s an amazing record. In fact you should know that we had a box of our fine Kleenex facial tissues sitting next to Mark on the table in case, just in case a tear appears in the corner of his eye because I know how much he\u2019s going to miss doing these. But seriously I would like to take a moment just to thank Mark for all the contributions he has made to Kimberly-Clark. He has been an outstanding Chief Financial Officer and a terrific leader and friend throughout his career. So I am pleased that Mark will be able to achieve his long-term goal of retiring later this year. Maria Henry, who is an experienced CFO, some of you may know her from her work at Hillshire brands will join Kimberly-Clark next Monday and will succeed Mark as Chief Financial Officer and Mark and Maria will work together over the balance of this year to ensure that we have a smooth transition. We are all looking forward to working with Maria as we continue to focus on creating shareholder value through our global business plan. So now let me turn back to our results and our outlook for the balance of the year. Overall we delivered very good financial results in the first quarter and we are executing well in a challenging environment. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 5% with benefits from our targeted growth initiatives from innovation and from selling price increases in some markets. As Mark just mentioned our business in developing and emerging markets had another strong quarter and it was led by our Personal Care segment.  Organic sales in diapers rose high-teens in these markets as we continued to benefit from innovation, expansion of the diaper pant and category development overall. So this business has been growing rapidly for some time and you may not know but our diaper business in developing and emerging markets is more than 1.5 times the size of our diaper business in North America. In terms of key growth markets organic sales in diapers increased 55% in Eastern Europe, 35% in China and 15% in Brazil. Huggies volumes were up nicely in all three markets and we have innovation launching in the next few quarters to drive additional growth. We've also increased selling prices in Eastern Europe and Brazil to offset some of the currency declines that have happened in those places. We're also doing well in our other Personal Care businesses in developing and emerging markets.  Organic sales in fem care were up mid-teens. That included very good performance in Latin America led by Brazil and also in China. Organic sales also increased double digits in baby wipes in our adult care business.  And K-C Professional grew organic sales high single digits in developing and emerging markets in the first quarter, also a very good performance. So overall we're delivering excellent growth in the developing and emerging markets and I expect our momentum there to continue going forward.  Turning to our developed markets business outside North America, organic sales in the quarter were even with the prior year. On the bottom line operating profit and operating margin increased significantly and that included very good results in Korea with additional progress in Western and Central Europe.  Moving to our North American consumer business, sales volumes were up nicely across a number of our brands. That included Huggies baby wipes, Poise and Depend and adult care, goodnight suit pants, Cottonelle bathroom tissue and Scott and VIVA paper towels.  On the innovation front in North America we introduced improved Huggies baby wipes, we started shipping new Poise pads and Depend briefs. And in March we began the re-launch of our mainline Huggies snug and dry diapers. This relaunch includes product upgrades, a new marketing campaign and increased promotion support and this new product should be out on the shelf in about 80% of our retail customers in North America by late April.  In K-C Professional at North America we had solid volume growth in our higher margin faster growing wiper and safety products businesses. In wash room our volumes were up low single digits, which is a step in the right direction after a softer performance last year. In terms of the bottom line, as Mark mentioned we had an excellent quarter, improving margins, our focus on profitable volume growth, raising selling prices where we can and then driving cost savings helped us overcome some pretty significant currency headwinds.  Then finally as Mark already highlighted we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways which is a key strategy of our global business plan. So all-in-all I am encouraged by our first quarter results.  Now let me move to the outlook for the full year. Our teams continue to focus on delivering their plans for the year and creating additional flexibility to further invest as appropriate. While we\u2019re only one quarter of the way through the year and the environment out there remains very volatile I'm pleased with our execution so far and despite a more negative currency outlook we're well positioned to achieve our earnings commitments for the year.  On the top line we continue to target organic sales growth of 3% to 5% for 2015 and on the bottom line we continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.60 to $5.80 and while currency headwinds have increased over the last three months we have good momentum with our growth initiatives and with our cost savings programs. And the commodity cost outlook has improved slightly compared to where we were at the beginning of the year.  Our updated currency and commodity cost assumptions are included in this morning's news release, if you want to refer to those. So in summary we're off to an excellent start to the year. We continue to focus on the fundamentals that drive our long term performance and we remain optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns. That wraps our prepared remarks and now we will begin to take your questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen at this time the floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey guys, how are you. Thomas J. Falk: Hey Ali. Ali Dibadj : And Mark congratulations to you. I hope [indiscernible] joy not dealing with us any more on these calls, congratulations. Mark A. Buthman: That's exactly, Ali absolutely. Ali Dibadj : A couple of questions. One is, it looks like you are starting to enter this sweet spot, as we call it of commodities really being a tailwind and not having to put back a lot of that into pricing in the category, in promotions in the category. Historically you guys used to say 60% or 70% of the commodity tailwind you have to put back into the categories somehow or reinvest it. Is that what you are expecting going forward in this environment, is little bit more, is little bit less and are you yet at that run rate of reinvestment or should we continue to see an expansion in the sweet spot? Thomas J. Falk: I think that\u2019s an interesting call. As you look around the world you are still seeing some inflation in some markets, and so as local currencies are really around places like Argentina for example or even Brazil, and so we had 10 million of deflation in the quarter which is good and we think that our guidance of 50 to 150 for the year is probably the right ballpark.  I think given that last year we had close to $250 million of inflation and didn\u2019t fully recover price on that front, I hope that prices will be a little sticky on the way down. I think the other big driver historically has been pulp, and pulp is not moving around as much as the oil-based commodities and pulp has probably driven pricing more than any of the other commodities overall. Ali Dibadj : So sounds like you think you will be able to hold on to more than historically given what\u2019s happened over the recent history of prices? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, that would certainly be our goal going into it. Ali Dibadj : Okay, so something that you said, actually linked to another question I had which is just FX and pricing. So if you look at Personal Care, developing and emerging you say negative 20% FX plus fixed price. If you look at developed non-U.S. there is a miss match there, negative eight FX pricing little lower than that, the same thing on consumer tissues. So looks like the GAAP between the currency headwind and the pricing you are able to take in those markets has widened a little bit and want to get your perspective on that as it relates to the health of the consumer that you are seeing broadly or competition as well. Thomas J. Falk: It\u2019s tough to get full reflection of the translation impact of currency. So if you can get the most of the transaction impact covered you are doing reasonably well and so in most of these markets we are seeing that. We are getting the transaction partially or mostly covered, but we are not covering the full translation impact. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And then last thing on pricing in North America Personal Care and Consumer Tissue negative again, is there any risk of that becoming or is it already in this kind of irrational zone, I guess to use a heavy word or do you think this is just kind of normal competition? Thomas J. Falk: Lot of this is really stuff that happened last year and so it\u2019s preferred [ph] to being annualized. It started in second quarter, we sort of stepped up in third quarter. So it\u2019s really more the comparison. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten significantly or sequentially. You will see some pockets where there are some lower price points but overall I would say it\u2019s been pretty consistent. Ali Dibadj : Okay, thanks again and congrats again, Mark. Mark A. Buthman: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail Glazerman : Hi, good morning. Thomas J. Falk: Hi, Gail. Gail Glazerman : Hi. Can you talk a little bit about your operating performance in consumer tissue, is a fair bit stronger than I would have expected, you are looking at 2% volume, 1% price decline, it\u2019s not intuitive where the improvement was coming from. Can you just talk about what really drove the earnings recovery? Mark A. Buthman: Yeah, I mean a lot of it was in the U.S. where we were plus five in volume. It was very strong quarter good execution, Cottonelle continued to do well, and some of it was in the non-measured outlets where you would see, or you wouldn\u2019t necessarily see it in the Nielsen data and then we called out kind of a VIVA Vantage launch and so good strong growth there. And typically it\u2019s a strong facial tissue selling season. Facial tissue was okay, although it was being driven more by Cottonelle\u2019s Scott, Bath and Viva towels. Gail Glazerman : Okay and can you talk a little bit about the U.S. diaper market. Last quarter you kind of talked about having to step up and may be -- address some of this share loss. How do you think you are doing and when do you think you will see the full benefit and is the [indiscernible] volume decline a reflection of comp more than actions or is that a reflection of some of the actions you have taken to-date? Mark A. Buthman: No, it\u2019s probably the comps are getting little easier. We are up about a share point sequentially, but the re-launch of our main line Huggies didn\u2019t really start to roll until mid-March and it will roll through the end of April and so the better price getting on-shelf, we are getting better, better execution at store, stronger advertising claims are coming. So I think we'll have to see how that plays out over the balance of the year more than, than we saw in the first quarter. Gail Glazerman : Okay. And just the last question, just any comments on the U.S. consumer, any changes in behavior or buying pattern in terms of whether there is more willingness maybe to spend up on premium, purchasing in different channels, purchasing different sizes, just seeing any response to I guess improving confidence and lower gas pricing? Thomas J. Falk: Yes, I wouldn't say we've seen a ton yet, as I think a lot of retailers I've talked to, have said that a lot of the lower fuel prices either been saved or has been spent inside the gas station buying an extra cup of coffee or something like that and so I wouldn't say we've seen that in category demand. So the trends have been pretty stable. It's not getting worse but it's not, we're not seeing a big shift up either at this stage. Gail Glazerman : And are you seeing anything in the K-C Professional business, that might give you encouragement or is that pretty much more of the same? Thomas J. Falk: I'd say, I was talking to our KCP guys recently. We just had a big meeting with lot of their U.S. distributors and they were more bullish. I mean they're seeing the continued slow steady growth in the U.S. economy, the job growth maybe it's been disappointing to some but it's been positive and pretty consistent and so they were more bullish this year, and I think last year with the top weather in the Northeast which we call out as a reason why -- partly while we were down it was still a tough winter but it wasn't as bad as it was last year. So everybody had a little bit stronger start to the year which was good. Gail Glazerman : Okay. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks Gail. Mark A. Buthman: Thanks Gail. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara : Hey, thanks. Guys, hey how are you? Thomas J. Falk: Good. Mark A. Buthman: I'm really good, Chris. Christopher Ferrara : Congratulations. Gross margin, look there has been a lot of question around pricing right and obviously pricing slowed a little bit sequentially but gross margin was up pretty substantially in the quarter and when you do the math on what currency must have done to gross margins, and you look at FORCE, FORCE is good, but it wasn't a particularly extraordinary FORCE number, cost savings, restructuring savings were okay $10 million but not moving the needle, right so can you talk a little bit more about where did all of the incremental gross margin expansion come from in the quarter and how sustainable is that, right because trends, if you look at where commodities are going, where currencies going you think that you probably build on that increase. So I was hoping you could talk that through a little bit. Thomas J. Falk: I'll let Mark dive into the cost savings numbers, just a little bit, but essentially Chris if you think about it gross profit essentially was flat year-on-year. Sales were down 4%. So gross margin was up 180 basis points. So essentially it took cost savings, volume benefits, selling price increases all of that collectively to cancel out the translation and transaction impact on currency and so we had a great start on cost savings and maybe Mark can add a little color on where we over delivered on the $90 million. Mark A. Buthman: Yes, Chris, as the year progresses typically we build our cost savings program, so to start a year $90 million is really a good result coming out of the gate and it's a combination of leveraging our global sourcing organization, productivity and waste improvements and then a big contributor in the quarter was product design, which are the three typical buckets that we have. I would say the other thing is our operations are performing very well. So if you think about tissue, when we run tissue machines full I know they have low waste and high productivity. There is really good absorption. We actually don't see that element coming through in FORCE. So I would say it's just a combination of good start to the year in cost savings and just overall good operations. Christopher Ferrara : And I guess can we dig a little bit deeper into the state of U.S. diapers. So obviously we just had the mainline re-launch of Snug and Dry right and I guess are we seeing or will we be seeing in April the sum total of everything you're doing to get that turned and I guess how are you feeling about the brand equity there, right. How are retailers responding to it, have you gotten and have you held shelf space, have you maybe even gotten a little extra. I guess just any more detail on the prospects for that area of the business would be helpful. Thomas J. Falk: Well, I think a couple of things. The super-premium end of that business end of that business has grown really well and had a very strong first quarter. All of our share improvement sequentially was in the super premium and we saw great innovation, winning products out there and strong claims and saw that continue. I think on the Snug and Dry the mainline business we have a much stronger plan this year than we had last year, better product on shelf, stronger advertising claims and we have got a better retail execution plan with more distribution, more feature and display activity. And so we will watch and see how that plays out. Again we didn\u2019t lose all the share in one swoop, and so I am sure it won\u2019t all come back in one quarter, but I do expect to make steady progress and see some improvement in that business this year. Christopher Ferrara : All right. Thanks guys. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Good morning. Thomas J. Falk: Hey Olivia Olivia Tong : How are you? Thomas J. Falk: Pretty good. Olivia Tong : All right. Congrats Mark. Best of luck, first. Mark A. Buthman: Thank you. Olivia Tong : And I guess first question just, you started the year at sort of a high end of the three to five range. So it sounds like you are keeping the range, at least at three to five, which you know in Q1 certainly makes sense. But can you talk to what\u2019s going on for the remainder of the year, that could potentially just result in growth decelerating from where you started the year? Mark A. Buthman: We will get pretty good momentum, but the comps gets little tougher in the back half, as you recall we finished pretty strong in the second half of last year and so particularly in some of the emerging markets we will see that happen. While everyone is talking about the China slowdown we haven\u2019t seen it yet in our business, but it is affecting some other competitors. So that\u2019s something we will watch as well. We've got aggressive product innovation plans going there.  First quarter on the volume front in places like Eastern Europe we had some big price increases that took place on April 1. So we had a little bit more volume that went in the first quarter. On the other hand we will get the benefit of those price increases in the subsequent quarters. So we still should see some organic growth a little bit more of volume in place. So overall I would say we feel pretty optimistic and we kept the same range. As you said it\u2019s early in the year and this increases the confidence that we can achieve our plan for the year and maybe even give us the opportunity to think about areas that we could reinvest to set up for an even stronger 2016. So it\u2019s nice place to be at this point in the year. Olivia Tong : Got it, thanks. And then also you had mentioned that FORCE typically gets better as the year progresses and starting at a $90 million. If we just sort of roll back for the year that clearly suggests something quite a bit higher than just at least $300 million. So can you talk through some of the savings of the cost, I am sorry, the savings this year relative to years past and whether it just was a particularly good start to the year or there is quite a bit of potential upside to your existing FORCE target? Thomas J. Falk: Olivia you have taken a page out of the CFO handbook. Take good performance and just annualize it and so for us we did have a good start to the year, I would say, given that the nature of the environment that we are dealing in with all the currency challenges and competitive challenges around the world, the teams really were focused on savings as a lever that we control heading into the year and we sort of decided while it\u2019s a good start to the year to hold our outlook for the year, phasing should typically get better, but we started a little faster. So we will give you an update when we get to the second quarter and it feels good to start but we are going to keep delivering. Mark A. Buthman: I think we made a really strong first quarter in the emerging markets on the cost savings front and so that was a big plus, for some places we have had big currency headwinds. Those teams are looking at price and cost savings to make sure they can try to give us cost to the US dollar [indiscernible] as they can and I think that also helped get us off to a good start. Olivia Tong : Does the cost savings FORCE target include the impact of currencies relative to the dollar target? Mark A. Buthman: Yes, typically that\u2019s what we would disclose that they would aim at. In some individual markets they may have local currency targets that they aim at but at a regional level they all are measured on a dollar basis. Olivia Tong : Understood, thanks again. I appreciate it. Mark A. Buthman: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. Thomas J. Falk: Good morning Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : I was just curious, going back to the consumer tissue profitability or I just -- I looked -- my model goes back to 1999 and there is not a quarter with 18.5% margin, so\u2026 Mark A. Buthman: Well there is now Lauren Lieberman : Don\u2019t know, exactly, so just curious to what degree you think you\u2019ve structurally changed the profitability of that business. I understand 5% volume in North America will help a lot, but still the base was already quite good, and I guess for that question for consumer tissue, but even for the company overall, because as you pointed out it\u2019s been two years of inflation, you can\u2019t even say deflation is driving this. So I am just curious your views on whether there\u2019s structural possibility the portfolio is changing it. And if so how and why? Thomas J. Falk: Lauren I think as you know we have been -- we have really been working hard on this over the years and we did the tissue restructuring several years ago, that had us exit some businesses and close some tissue facilities. We did the European restructuring which had us exit diapers but also had us shape our tissue portfolio. So we have really been trying to focus our business in the higher margin targeted growth areas of that business and we have been making steady progress on the margin front. It feels pretty good to be here and I think the team is excited and is looking for areas where they can invest behind great brands in profitable ways to keep that momentum going. Lauren Lieberman : Do you feel like -- is the margin profile of the emerging markets, what does that look like? I know we can see North America versus rest of world, but I am just wondering if the D&E market profitability is also a mixed benefit. Thomas J. Falk: In tissue specifically or broadly? Lauren Lieberman : I guess both, since you offered it. Thomas J. Falk: I would say that we saw a good margin performance in emerging markets as well and the developing is still lower than developed, but they are narrowing the gap and it is a pretty solid performance. So I don\u2019t know Mark if you want to add anything any other color there or you\u2026? Mark A. Buthman: I mean that their goal is to grow at or better than the underlying growth rate in the local market and close the margin gap overtime. So I think you just saw us making progress on the first quarter. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, and when you said that you have covered the transaction expense, with 9% FX headwinds at topline but 19 on the bottom line, I mean guessing you didn\u2019t mean just the pricing, that when you say you covered transaction you also mean by virtue of the cost savings? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, I would say because in many markets you have transaction impacts like in Western Europe and Australia it\u2019s very difficult to get any selling price and there has been a pretty good size currency hit in markets like that. In places like Brazil and Russia and Ukraine we probably had a better opportunity to close the transaction gap, but overall a combination of cost saves, volume growth, pricing we have been able to offset the currency impact. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, all right. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks Lauren. Operator : Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Brian Doyle : Hi, this is actually Brian Doyle in for Caroline, just had a couple of questions. If you could comment on the just the share trends in the U.S. adult care overall and for the Poise brand in particular? And then the second question was if you just clarify the sales to Halyard in the release it read like you were saying that was most of the 6% segment organic growth. Is that accurate and how long does the agreement run? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk: All right, I will take the first one and I will throw Mark the second one on Halyard. On adult care trends, we probably would say we successfully defended [indiscernible] earlier this week that they successfully launched, and so we have lost less than our fair share. If you look sequentially I think we were down about a 0.5 point overall. I think if you look year-over-year Paul, we are down what? Paul J. Alexander: We are down about four points. Thomas J. Falk: A little bit more on the Poise side, less on the Depend side. We are launching more innovation this year and are aggressively competing and promoting as is our primary competitor. And so I think private label and the other small branded player have lost more than their fair share and the -- and the category growth has picked up. So we saw solid high single digit category growth which may be a little over stated because of the amount of couponing that\u2019s out there in the marketplace, but it is still a strong performance. Mark A. Buthman: Yes, Brain on Halyard that 3% impact which we reported as mix and other in KCP as kind of less than half of their organic growth for this quarter. So it was an important component, but it wasn\u2019t really the underlying driver and the agreement will run for two years and I'm sure there is a small markup on that. I'm sure the Halyard team\u2019s looking for alternative supplies as quickly as they can but the agreement commitment is two years. Brian Doyle : Great, thanks a lot. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks Brian Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Schmidt of Deutsche Bank. Russell William Schmidt : Hey good morning guys. The market\u2019s been a great run. Yes, the [indiscernible] probably on you I hope. First question is where are you getting all this extra distribution in non-scan [ph] channels because again there is a big disconnect from some of the Nielsen stuff we\u2019re getting but it seems like it\u2019s pretty clear and I think you will agree that you\u2019re doing very well on some of the non-track channel. So what are those channels and is that distribution gains or is it just better relative growth? Thomas J. Falk: You are talking about any market in particular? Russell William Schmidt : In North America, I think, the U.S. stands out the most. Thomas J. Falk: Yes, I mean North America, it\u2019s essentially Club is the biggest non-scan channel and we are probably underweight historically in Club and tissue products. And so that\u2019s been an area that we\u2019ve been trying to crack into with Cottonelle and VIVA and Scott Tissue and things like that and so had some success in the first quarter and that enabled some of that growth. If you look more broadly, particularly in Asia e-commerce is probably by far the biggest non-track channel that we\u2019re outperforming in relative to the track channels. So Korea and China in particular would be places where we\u2019d see a lot better growth in the track channel. Russell William Schmidt : Got you and is there like a long term sort of defense strategy against kind of what the P&G is trying to do in Russia and China, Brazil and then is there any incremental impact from some of the Japanese guys, mostly Unicharm but maybe Kao [ph] as well are probably going to start using some of the currency to get more aggressive. So what have we done so far and kind of what\u2019s the plan going forward? Thomas J. Falk: Yes, I mean it\u2019s a tough competitive market place out there Bill as you\u2019ve noted and pretty much everybody wants the ER launched somewhere. So we\u2019ve got strong global competitors. We\u2019ve got some strong local competitors and so we kind of have good innovation in the competitive on price and execute well everyday to keep it going, and so we see that with some other things that Procter is doing on diaper pants that we\u2019d also would say Unicharm and Kao in many ways have still the best performing products that we benchmark against and so we\u2019re up against those guys in lots of different places and I'm really proud of the way the teams have executed and got better performing products with good execution in market. Mark A. Buthman: And I would say Bill that our categories are largely local. Our stuff doesn\u2019t ship long distances. So you might get some currency change like on commodity inputs and things but largely the battle is fought locally and I think with our model we\u2019re set up to do that as well as anybody. Russell William Schmidt : Okay, this makes sense and then just -- what\u2019s my last one, oh, China. Can you just disaggregate, it\u2019s impossible to figure out what is like the real comp store sales growth and how much of it is distribution expense and I think you are going to add another ten cities this year plus or minus, so is there any way to kind of look at that massive growth and separate between the two? Thomas J. Falk: It\u2019s tough. I think if you look sequentially I think our city counts didn\u2019t change much if you look versus the first quarter last year it\u2019s 105 versus 90 last year. But I\u2019ll also tell you e-com probably was the bigger growth factor than the city count change and so some of that is category penetration or channel growth that\u2019s helping those consumers get products in a different way but Mark was just in China about a month ago, so he\u2019s probably got more relevant snapshot of what you saw when you were over there so maybe you can give us some local color. Mark A. Buthman: Yes, I would say Bill to that the market is still growing at very healthy rates. I mean it\u2019s down from where it was but our team still is very excited and executing well in bricks and mortar but e-com is the only place where they have -- we\u2019ve invested a lot and were over indexed. And as Tom said that\u2019s probably the place where we have driven more of the relative share gains. I think the category is still growing at high single to low double-digit. Thomas J. Falk: Yes, double-digits this year. Mark A. Buthman: Yes, so we\u2019re growing at a multiple of that and city expansion is a piece of it but I would say e-com and channel expansion\u2019s the bigger component. Russell William Schmidt : Got you. Just a brief follow up to go, do you guys co-locate in China like some folks do in the U.S. with the e-commerce players. So I mean are they sharing the distribution space with your manufacturing? Thomas J. Falk: Yes, our China team is working with our e-com customers to figure out and cost out the whole supply chain. So we\u2019ve done some of that in larger cities as well. Russell William Schmidt : Great, thanks guys, I appreciate it. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Hi, good morning everyone. My questions had to with the SG&A line item that were much lower work than a year ago. My calculation is $48 million down. Is that something that has to do with savings or is it has to do with market expanding because you are -- it\u2019s an issue of timing ahead of their re-launch of the Huggies Snug and Dry diapers and then I have a couple of follow-ups? Thomas J. Falk: Our marketing, the SG&A overall, the top line I mean on advertising spend standpoint we were down 10 basis points versus as a percent of sales, versus prior year but it was basically 10 balance sheet higher than the average of advertising spend for the full year of last year. So it was in the ball park of what we would expect around 4% of sales. On the SG&A probably had a little bit of currency benefit that would affect it but maybe Mark\u2019s got some additional color on that. Mark A. Buthman: Yeah, no, Javier, I think currency when you look at the absolute dollars, currency is a big, a big shift. We obviously, if you look at the difference between gross margin and operating margin we have got some between the lines efficiencies that the business are driven but currency\u2019s probably the biggest impact. Javier Escalante : And when you can see the launch of the Huggies diapers, is that because we already have data through mid-April and sales are down 6% in direct channels. So if there is timing issue with regards to again marketing spending that you are doing on shelf because this is the weakest quarterly, I mean monthly data that we have seen for you guys in a long time. Thomas J. Falk: I guess I\u2019d say we have been getting the distribution started in mid-March and we should be in about 80% of channels by late April and that\u2019s really when you will start to turn on more of that marketing effort at that point of time. We are probably seeing a little bit better consumption data then I would say, you are quoting from the data that you are seeing but it is still early days on the re-launch at this point. Javier Escalante : And finally what drove the 55% growth in Eastern Europe, and how to think about that? Thomas J. Falk: Two factors, I mean yeah, I would say two-thirds of it was, or 25% of it was volume and the balance, the 30% of it was price. So some big price increases. Some of the volume was buying ahead of an April 1 price increase but I think if you talk to that team it\u2019s a double-digit volume growth in Eastern Europe, is the right way to think about what they are aiming at for the year and then they attempting to get as much prices they can to offset the currency impact. Javier Escalante : In the second quarter we should expect emerging markets to decelerate then? Thomas J. Falk: Eastern Europe you would see less volume growth but we will get the benefit of the price increase that went in. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily assume that you will see a big deceleration. Javier Escalante : But is 55 the right number, is it 20 or 15 for Eastern Europe? Thomas J. Falk: 55 is probably higher than you typically expect to see going forward. So you will see some deceleration on Eastern Europe overall, but I think emerging markets should still have another strong quarter. Javier Escalante : Thank you. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks, Javier. Operator : Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan. John Faucher : Yes, thanks. Mark congratulations and I wanted to sort of go back to the CFO playbook you mentioned because this is something -- a comment that comes up multiple times on calls which is if the productivity is heavier towards the end of the year why don\u2019t we see that end of the year productivity carry over in the first-half. So you guys are alone in terms of saying that but it seems that it sort of good sustainable cost saves and I am not trying to question them. It just seems like that would end up sort of rolling over. And then my main question goes back to some of the comments about female incontinence and the category growth accelerating here and I guess sort of I understand that there is some couponing which is probably leading to some pantry loading, but I guess how long do you know sort of how big this category can be?  You do hear that when you get a new product launch from a big competitor that can make the category bigger and I look at some of the advertising you guys have out and looks like you are encouraging some switching in terms of Poise. Can you talk about sort of A, how big the category can be? And B you know how do you feel about categories switching out fem care into incontinence. How does that work for you guys from an economic standpoint? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk: Let me take the cost savings one first. John, I think it\u2019s how the math works and little bit of programming. So typically we will work out an annual budget cycle and the teams are focused on kind of annual incremental programs and you are exactly right. The programs that we had in place last year don\u2019t stop. They are delivering but we also launch and think creatively about new programs to kind of help us hit our near-term target and I think it\u2019s just a matter of the phasing as we go to those. The underlying programs sort of roll in to your base and then you are looking to build on top of that as we go. So you look at cumulative cost savings overtime, that\u2019s a pretty big number, but they build on each other overtime. And it\u2019s just kind of the way the planning process goes and how the businesses behave. Mark A. Buthman: Switching to Adult care, we know for a long time that a lot of women that have white water leakage issues, and one in three women at some point in their life experience white water leakage, that they have used fem care as a solution and so given that we have a much larger share with our Poise brand in that space than we do in fem care we would love to shift into that space as a better solution and it\u2019s a place where we are going to get more than our fair share of those new consumers.  And so you are seeing a little bit of that, of the growth and Poise has been a bit of a decline in the Fem Care category and overall we should benefit from that and consumers will get a better solution for the issues that they are trying to treat. John Faucher : Okay, thanks. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks, John. Operator : At this time we have no further questioners in the queue. Paul J. Alexander: All right. We thank everyone for the questions. And I will turn the call back to Tom. Thomas J. Falk: So usually I get the last word on these calls, but since this is Mark\u2019s last call I am going to throw it to Mark and let Mark have the last word today. Mark A. Buthman: Well, I am just grateful to work for Kimberly-Clark. I have a cold today. So I have the world\u2019s softest facial tissue right at hand and also have anti-viral, so I don\u2019t transmit my germs to my fellow conference call mates. I have had a good fortune that to build a career at a great company like Kimberly-Clark and work with great leaders like Tom, who always got the best out of me, work with great people like our investors, our Board of Directors, the leadership team that Tom has, my leadership team and it\u2019s been a very good one. I am really proud of what we have accomplished but I am also optimistic about the future. Tom has made a great selection for my successor. Maria is fantastic and she is going to see opportunities that quite frankly being around for long time, I just didn\u2019t see. And so I am optimistic about the future and committed to helping Maria and the new GSLT [ph] get started up. So thanks for your support and thanks as always for your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thomas J. Falk: Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and thank you for joining us.",

Sir, you may begin. Paul Alexander : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today in Dallas are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller. Here is the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with a review of our second quarter results, after that Tom will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We\u2019ll finish with Q&A. As usual we have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our website. Now as a reminder we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We\u2019ll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning\u2019s news release. The news release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul. Good morning everyone. I am happy to be in my first earnings call as part of the Kimberly-Clark team. I had the opportunity to meet some of you and I am looking forward to meeting many more of you as I begin travelling to meet with investors [indiscernible]. Let me go ahead and turn to our results for the second quarter, starting with some headlines. First, we achieved organic sales growth of 4%, in line with our full year target of 3% to 5%. Second, we delivered excellent cost savings and margin improvement and solid growth in adjusted earnings per share. And third we continue to improve our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders. Now let\u2019s cover the details of our results, second quarter sales were $4.6 billion, that\u2019s down 6% driven by a 10 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales rose 4% highlighted by a 10% increase in our developing and emerging markets. On profitability adjusted gross margin was 35.8% in the second quarter up 140 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 17%, that\u2019s up 130 basis points. Operating margins were up in each major geographic regions North America, developed markets and developing and emerging markets. Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund the investments that we\u2019re making behind our brands. Second quarter FORCE savings were $105 million equaling our previous all-time high. For the full year we now expect that FORCE savings will be at least $350 million that\u2019s up from our previous expectations of at least $300 million. In addition our organizational restructuring is on track and generated $20 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $40 million benefit in the quarter mostly from oil based materials. We now expect that deflation for the full year will be between $100 million and $200 million. On the other hand we continue to experience significant currency headwinds the total earnings drag from currency was approximately $0.30 per share in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect that currency will negatively impact earnings by more than 20%. On the bottom-line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.41 that\u2019s up 6% year-on-year and includes an approximate 3 point benefit from a lower share account. Now turning to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was healthy as $772 million, compared to the year ago quarter that was down $70 million driven by the spin-off of the healthcare business. Our second quarter working capital cash conversion cycle improved seven days compared to the 2014 full year average. We now expect our full year improvement to be six to seven days and that\u2019s ahead of our original three to four day improvement targets. This is mostly driven by additional progress on payables. In terms of adjusted return on investment capital halfway through the year we are up 220 basis points including benefits from the spin-offs. We expect full year improvement on ROIC to be at least 250 basis points. On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $400 million the full year total should be at least $2 billion or about 5% of our current market capitalization. Now let\u2019s take a look at the segments. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 5%, performance was led by developing in emerging markets where organic sales were up 13%. Overall Personal Care operating margins were 20.5%. The 190 basis point improvement year-on-year was enabled by three things, organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input cost. Moving on to consumer tissue, organic sales were up 1%, including volume growth of 5% in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins of 17.3% were up 260 basis points. Result from this segment benefited from strong cost savings and lower between the line spending. In our third segment K-C Professional delivered organic sales growth of 5%. Within that organic sales were up 8% in developing and emerging markets and up 2% in North America. The segment top-line also benefited from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited term supply agreement. Overall K-C Professional margins were 17.6%, up 20 basis points year-over-year. I am encouraged that K-C Professionals margins remained healthy and above the corporate average. To summarize, we had a good quarter as we achieved mid-single-digit growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share, we delivered strong cost savings and margin improvements and we continue to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tom. Thomas Falk : Thanks, Maria and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll share my perspective on our second quarter results and then I\u2019ll address our full year outlook. So, overall we delivered another quarter of good financial results and we are executing our global business plan strategies very well. As Maria just mentioned our business in developing and emerging markets had another strong quarter and that was led by our Personal Care business. Organic sales in diapers rose low teens in these markets and we continue to benefit from innovation from expansion of diaper pants from the category development in many areas and from higher net selling prices in some places. And in terms of our key growth markets, organic sales in diapers increased 30% in China where we continue to drive strong growth even though competitive activity has picked up somewhat recently. Huggies diapers are now sold in about 110 cities in China and that\u2019s up from 105 cities at the end of last year. Our organic sales in diapers also rose by 30% in Eastern Europe the growth this quarter was driven by price increases to offset some of the currency declines that have happened in that market. In Brazil, our team continues to execute well in a challenging economic environment. Total Personal Care organic sales were up about 10% in Brazil and that included 5% growth in diapers. We\u2019re also doing well in our other Personal Care businesses in developing and emerging markets organic sales in fem care were up double-digits in the second quarter and that included excellent performance in Latin America led by Brazil. Organic sales also increases strong double-digits in baby wipes and in adult care. And our K-C Professional business had high single-digit organic sales growth in developing and emerging markets in the quarter. So overall we delivered excellent results again in the developing and emerging markets and we expect our momentum to continue there going forward. Turning to our developed market business outside North America organic sales in the quarter were down slightly. We had solid growth in South Korea, but market conditions were relatively soft in Western and Central Europe. Nonetheless I am encouraged that operating margins were up year-on-year in the developed market overall. Moving to our North American consumer business, sales volumes were up nicely on a number of brands that included Huggies baby wipes, Goodnites Youth Underpants, Cottonelle bathroom tissue, Viva paper towels. On Huggies diapers while still early day the second quarter relaunched of mainline Huggies Snug N\u2019 Dry diapers is off to a pretty good start. In terms of upcoming innovations in North America, we have product upgrades coming on both Huggies premium diaper and Pull-Ups training pants and in adult care we\u2019re launching Poise Impressa, which is a unique innovation that helps prevent Light Bladder Leakage. And in K-C Professional North America volumes increased mid-single-digits in our higher margin faster growing wiper and safety products businesses. In washroom products volumes were up low-single-digits as market conditions continue to improve modestly. Since Maria has already discussed our profitability balance sheet and capital allocation I will just add that I am pleased towards our performance in all of these areas. So all-in-all I am encouraged by our results in the second quarter and in the first half of the year. Now let\u2019s move on to the outlook for the full year. Our teams continue to focus on delivering their plans for the year and investing further as appropriate for future growth. On the top-line we continue to target organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. With organic sales up 4% halfway through the year we\u2019re in good shape relative to this target. On the bottom-line we've raised the low end of our previous guidance by $0.05 a share. Our new guidance range for adjusted earnings per share is $5.65 to $5.80 a share. This change reflects our strong performance in the first half of the year and our progress on FORCE costs savings that Maria highlighted. We\u2019ve also stepped up investments in our brands and our targeted growth initiatives from what we originally planned. As we continue to be optimistic about the growth opportunities that we have in front of us. In terms of external factors our current expectation is that the net impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices probably similar to our original plan that we communicated to you in January. The commodity outlook has improved somewhat, but we expect that price realization will be a little less positive than what we expected earlier in the year. And as we said in April we expect more currency headwinds than we had in our regional plan for the year. We continue to focus on delivering on our annual commitments that said as you look at the back half of the year I\u2019ll point out that last year\u2019s earnings profile was unusually skew to the third quarter. Third quarter last year had more than normal amount of other income, had a strong quarter in Venezuela and had lower than expected G&A spending. So in summary we delivered very good results in the first half of the year, we continue to focus on the fundamentals that drive long-term performance and we remain optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder return. So that wraps up our prepared remarks and now we\u2019ll begin to take your questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen at this time we\u2019ll open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please go ahead. Windy Nicholson : Hi, I have two sort of buckets of questions if that\u2019s okay? The first one just on a diaper numbers that you break out, okay so the 5% in Brazil can you clarify how much of that is a slow down just in the macro just in the macro is a slowdown in the consumer off-take, is it inventory destocking and is that number sort of in your mind in terms of what\u2019s going to process over the next couple of quarters? And then totally separately, Maria sort of as you come into the company fresh perspective, new look I mean the FORCE savings that Kimberly has been generating are just phenomenal, and I guess as you look at the cost structure sort of with a fresh set of eyes is this rate of cost cutting sort of something that you think is sustainable for the next few years or are we coming sort of to the end of that part of the story? Thank you. Thomas Falk : Okay, sure. I\u2019ll take the first one and I\u2019ll let Maria answer the second question. So in terms of Brazil, I mean overall we\u2019re pretty happy with our performance in that market on the consumer side. We didn\u2019t talk much about our KCP business. But on the B2B side that economy has slowed down. There is no question about it and we are seeing that in our KCP sales in the industrial side customers and at this point we\u2019d say that the category is a little slower on the other hand we had a great quarter in fem care. So we\u2019ve been able to bring innovation, we\u2019ve seen that continue to drive the business. And so we\u2019re going to continue to invest in innovation and diapers and we think we can do a little better than we did this quarter overall. But it\u2019s a more challenging market from an economic perspective that\u2019s for sure. Maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Maria and she can comment on cost saves and her perspective on that. Maria Henry : Hi Wendy, thanks for the question. On the FORCE savings, first let me say I\u2019m really proud of the Kimberly-Clark organization on a global basis for delivering just an outstanding quarter in FORCE savings of over $100 million in the second quarter. If you look at the rates for the - of at least $350 million. That\u2019s a really strong savings rate and I believe that we can continue to do this. If I think about the percentage of annual savings that we\u2019re able to deliver off of our cost of goods sold base we are in a good place in terms of what we are delivering and with the addition of Sandra MacQuillan to our team, who is our new Head of Global Supply Chain. I think Sandra will be able to work with the teams around the globe to unlock some additional savings as we go. So I feel really good about the rate of savings that we are delivering and I\u2019m very confident that we\u2019ll able to continue to deliver strong productivity in our supply chain area. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Bill Schmidt with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Russell William Schmidt : Hi guys, good morning. Thomas Falk : Hey, Bill. Russell William Schmidt : Hey, a couple of questions. Can we just like draw a little bit deeper in the emerging markets starting with Brazil. I think if you look at some of the shared data of Hyper Mark [ph] out which is value brand is gaining share do you think that\u2019s a change in sort of consumer preference or is it macro, is it permanent? And then I think SA [ph] also exited the market. So is that an opportunity and then in China can you just talk about I think you said 110 cities now. What\u2019s the sort of end state opportunity is like how many cities aren\u2019t you in and then what channels and price tiers maybe? And then lastly on Russia I just wanted to check on the health of the distributors and how they are getting [indiscernible] product in and if there is I think you can just sort of help them out given the macro? And then I have a follow up if I can. Thomas Falk : Okay sure. If I remember all those also Brazil I\u2019d say EPRA markets is up a little bit and that business is for sale, as you probably know I think there is some stuff that they are doing a kind of push those sales in the short-term. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen a lot of trading down in this market and spend the consumer shock hasn\u2019t been as big as you\u2019ve seen in other economies over time and so you are seeing a huge trade down at this point and we\u2019re still driving premiumization across our line up in Brazil and you saw that in the fem care numbers as we launch better performing products that consumers want to trade up on that front. So again I\u2019d say the news of FCA leaving in some consolidation there I mean there are probably more competitors in Brazil today than your normal market at this stage. And so it\u2019s not unusual to see a little bit of consolidation happening and typically that\u2019s good for the big global players. In China we are at 110 and I\u2019d say it\u2019s truly every city you add is a little smaller than the last, on the other hand these cities still have like a million people and so they are pretty good sized and there still quite a bit of opportunity. I would say at least 200 cities in terms of channels. We are actually really developing e-commerce quite well and we\u2019re also spending a lot of time on the premium baby stores and those are both rapidly growing channels. Today probably a third of our diapers sales in China are done through e-commerce and the baby stores are a real super-premium channel where all the high end products are typically sold and you don\u2019t see much in the value segment in that space. I don\u2019t expect we\u2019re going to go deep into the low tiers in China, we\u2019ve got quite a bit of growth ahead of us in the mid to premium tiers and expect us to stay in that space. And on Russia, I was in Russia earlier this year actually I met with one of our KCP distributors and at that point they seem to be managing through the prices pretty well probably we\u2019re little more optimistic than even I was going in terms how things were going to play out. I think the oil prices has stayed down little longer is probably going to put a little bit more pressure on that economy. So it\u2019s something that we\u2019re continuing to watch, we do manufacture now in Russia so that does help us a bit in some of our cost base in local currency and doesn\u2019t require us to import as much, but that\u2019s a challenging market for sure and we\u2019ll keep an eye on that going forward. Russell William Schmidt : Great, thanks. And if I just ask one follow-up on fem care in North America, I mean the category itself is pretty soft I think the shares are little soft as well is any of that due to your now having like a focus competitor in Edge well and obviously they have some pretty ambitious growth targets. So are you seeing a lot more aggressive competitive activity from them? Thomas Falk : I would say there was a little bit more competitive noise in fem care in the last quarter that accounts for some of the share decline, we\u2019re also looking to see are we executing as well as we could and we have enough news and innovation in commercial activity, but I would say that was a soft spot for us in the consumer business in the second quarter. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question will come from Ali Dibadj with Sanford. Please go ahead. Ali Dibadj : Hey, how are you? So, couple of questions. One is I want to dig into Personal Care just a little bit more in terms of where your growth is coming from clearly it\u2019s the emerging and developing world. That growth rate again continues to slow, it\u2019s still good that continues to slow. So trying to get a sense of where you think that kind of growth rate gets to on a steady state, you say the momentum is continuing, but is that momentum is slowing momentum, so that\u2019s one part of the Personal Care of business. And then the other part I want to get a little bit more into the details of the Snug and Dry re-launch in the U.S. so it still looks like the North America business for you on Personal Care isn\u2019t really showing great results from the Snug and Dry launch is it just too early because on the other hand in the Nielsen data it looks like you might be seeing some improvement, so want to really understand what we should expect from Snug and Dry in particular and how you think that may change your Personal Care results in the U.S. going forward? So those two pieces first please. Thomas Falk : Okay. So Personal Care growth rate, I mean we\u2019ve said high single low double-digit growth in developing and emerging markets for us going forward and Personal Care is going to be the centerpiece of that and while there is some little bit of growth slowdown in some places there is also new markets that we\u2019re continuing to open up like Nigeria and Kenya and places like that where there is pretty high birth rate. So we do feel like there is a pretty long way to go to continue to penetrate these categories and GDP per capita is still improving even though the overall economic growth rate is slowing in some of these markets. And so consumers have more purchasing power in their pocket to buy our products going forward. And so we also see categories like Adult Care, baby wipes that are still very under penetrated as we bring those into those markets there is a big opportunity to build those out overtime. And so we\u2019ve got some GDP per capita levers to drive that we\u2019ve got some new category expansion to drive as well as some still some remaining geographic expansion to drive it and those factors I think will provide a lot of growth for us for future. On the Snug and Dry re-launch I mean if you look at kind of the spread I think if you look at the Nielsen data and probably say we were up a percent in the quarter that\u2019s probably pretty consistent as we would look at our consumption or our shelf off take would be pretty similar to that as we look at it across the parts of the category that aren\u2019t covered by Nielsen and our sales were down about a percent, our share was up about half a point sequentially. And so the difference between our sales and the retail consumption is probably inventory change in channels which obviously going to be sustained. So we\u2019d say we\u2019re broadly on track with our expectation on that re-launch and pretty good execution across retail consumers like the product the early reads and all the social media activity is very high four and five star ratings. And so that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re looking for and expect to continue to drive that in the back half, we\u2019ve also got some news coming on the super-premium end of our Huggies line up, which will help that, we haven\u2019t seen much canalization on little bit of share growth that we\u2019ve had which is great. So, so far I think the team we would say we\u2019re pretty much on track. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And then follow-up just on a former response in terms of Personal Care in the emerging market, I mean I guess just to be very specific, do you expect the growth rate to continue to slow given kind of large numbers et cetera as it has done. So maybe answer that and I\u2019ll come back with another one. Thomas Falk : I mean I think it was what 11 in the first quarter and 10 this quarter. So I would say that\u2019s a modest slow down. But I would expect we\u2019re going to be in that high single-digit, low double-digit range for a while I mean they vary a little bit depending on the quarter and what\u2019s going on. Ali Dibadj : Okay, cool thank you. So my last one is just around the CapEx uptick that we saw in a part has been see it. But can you give us a sense of where that's from what we should expect going forward? Thomas Falk : Yeah we\u2019ll probably move to Maria you can add some color on this, but we\u2019re probably a little ahead of our typical run rate it seems to be more backend loaded. But I think we\u2019re still expecting to be in the range, but Maria I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got any other color you want to add to that? Maria Henry : Yeah, I think that's right. I would expect given where we are and the projects that we have on top for the second half that we will come out at the high end of our CapEx range for the year. Thomas Falk : More of it's outside the U.S. than inside, as you would expect. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail Glazerman : Hi, good morning. Thomas Falk : Hey, Gail. Gail Glazerman : Can you talk a little bit detail about what\u2019s going on in the U.S. bath tissue market. You guys obviously had great volume probably due to promote. How do you see the overall spend in the promo activity there? Thomas Falk : Yes, probably competitive activity has probably picked up just a little bit. We are continuing to do well with Cottonelle and have seen that take off another selling quarter behind Cottonelle Scott Tissue is also continuing to do well in the market. So probably maybe the competitive frequency has picked up just a bit and you are seeing that a little bit in the pricing number. Some of our price numbers as well affected some of the promotional timing. And so I wouldn't necessarily say that the uptick this quarter was fully reflective about what's happened in the market. Some of it had more to do with timing of promotions than the overall market activity. Gail Glazerman : Okay and depends from of course the birth rate is starting to pick up and I was just wondering if you could just talk about are you starting just kind of see them, what are you thinking as you look out over the next year or two? Thomas Falk : Yeah, we\u2019ve seen that as well and so it\u2019s small positive upward momentum, which as we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. The things that have been more predictive of that our male unemployment, household formation and consumer confidence and we\u2019re seeing slow steady progress in those in the U.S. economy and that's just driving the birth rate up a bit which is good. Gail Glazerman : Alright. And in terms of your deflation outlook for the year, can you just talk a little bit about where you expect to see the incremental deflation over the second half, I mean what is the little bit better than what you might have expected three months ago? Thomas Falk : Yeah, pretty much all of our deflation is oil related material. So if you look at pulp and secondary fiber those are pretty close to our original estimates for the year. So we\u2019re not seeing those move around much, I mean eucalyptus is a little stronger, [indiscernible] is a little weaker and so the net-net it's about where we thought it was going to be. And so it's more polymer super absorbent, things like adhesives, packaging materials anything that's made out of a petroleum molecule. Obviously with oil being a little lower than... for a little longer than maybe we thought in our original guidance more that\u2019s kind of flowing through in our lower material cost than we would have expected at the beginning of the year. Most of that lines up in Personal Care from a segment stand point. So consumer tissue and KCP don't get too much of that. Operator : Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Nick Moody [ph] with RBC. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, thanks for the question. Just two real quick one for me. Tom, maybe if you could just remind us on how you are thinking about acquisitions in terms of criteria and if you were to do an acquisition it's just really kind of building scale in existing categories or would you look at kind of wide space? And then the second question is on e-commerce it\u2019s obviously becoming a very important trend for some of your categories so just wanted to get an update on that side of the business? Thanks. Thomas Falk : Absolutely yeah the M&A we have not been big acquires and so where we have done things has been more tuck-in and I think we\u2019ve got so many great organic growth opportunities in our businesses around the world that we really want to make sure we're fully funding those and that we're resourcing those in the right way and that's I think the most valuable form of growth for our shareholders and we want to make sure we\u2019re pursuing that. And so there may be tuck-ins and individual markets that we've considered from time to time, but we want to make sure we deliver on our organic growth framework. On the e-com front, we basically we want to make sure that our products are available wherever mom wants to shop. And so if she is shopping at a nearby traditional retail outlet that's great we want to make sure we\u2019re there with the right offer and the right product form. If she wants to shop online absolutely we want to make sure she can find Huggies and are lineup is easy to navigate and we will make it easier to find what she needs there. And so we try to make sure that we\u2019re building capability around the world where e-commerce is developing in where mom wants to shop. So that we have the skill sets to make sure that our products is represented in a digital space at the same level of professionalism that is represented in a physical store. And so that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve learned we\u2019re probably in the front foot on that in China. We\u2019re probably little late to the game in the U.S. but we\u2019re catching up quick. And that we\u2019re kind of monitoring and investing ahead of the curve and individual markets around the world where we see e-commerce starts to play out. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And Tom is there any way you can give us just rough how big the current e-commerce business is and how fast it\u2019s growing just so have a sense of reference? Thomas Falk : Yeah, I mean the statistics are probably difficult because if you sell to an offline retailer who has an online presence it's hard to tell exactly what flow through each part of their business, but it varies quite a bit by markets on the U.S. it\u2019s probably less than 5% of our sales, in China and our diaper business is probably a third of our sales. In Korea from a category standpoint in the diaper space it's approaching 60% of the category. And so overall it's probably still in the 5% or less of our sales just because some of our categories like tissue and KCP are not as well developed from an e-com standpoint yet. Unidentified Analyst : Excellent, thank you so much. Thanks. Thomas Falk : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from the Caroline Levy with CLSA. Please go ahead. Caroline Levy : Good morning. Thank you very much. Thomas Falk : Good morning, Caroline. Caroline Levy : I just wanted to ask a couple of things on the U.S. the adult diaper business and the fem care business. Can you talk about the competitive environment and what the outlook is for innovation there and is P&G growing the adult category or are you seeing some share loss there? Thomas Falk : Yeah. I think in adult care Procter re-launched last year with their always discrete product and category growth rates did pick up. We lost a little less than our fair share of market share. Probably done a little bit better on the Depend side, they picked up a little bit more share on with always discrete against Poise, but private label and SCA kind of brand loss probably disproportionately more share than we did. If you look at the second quarter both Depend and Poise our share was up about a point sequentially but we were still down year-over-year from where the launch had occurred. It\u2019s quite a bit of innovation happening we\u2019ve launched quite a bit of new products over the last year or so and with more coming under both Depend and Poise. The most recent launch news is a totally new product called Poise Impressa which we had in test market in Kansas City and this is a product that actually helps prevent bladder leakage. And so it\u2019s a new space and we're going to be investing behind that in the later part of the year. On fem care again we talked about that a little bit earlier probably a little bit more competitive promotion activity in the quarter I think we are down about a point year-on-year and pretty flat sequentially on share, but some of it is the categories more competitors some of it we\u2019re going to make sure we're doing all the right things to execute in that space. So we\u2019re making sure we got the right offer in the right messaging to drive that category. Caroline Levy : Thanks. And then just a follow-up on China, can you help us scale how important that business is to you because it\u2019s been growing so fast for so long it wasn\u2019t necessarily disproportionately large within the whole business Brazil was generally your biggest market can you help us just understand the key drivers of EM? Thomas Falk : Brazil still the biggest at about $1 billon and China is gaining fast. So it\u2019s what Paul probably 3% of sales something like that. Paul Alexander : Yeah. China was 3% in the full year of last year and it\u2019s going to be a bigger percentage this year. Caroline Levy : Thanks so much. Thomas Falk : Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Christ Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Christopher Ferrara : Hey, good morning guys. Thomas Falk : Good morning Chris. Christopher Ferrara : Good morning. Wanted to dig a little bit more into I guess the specifics around U.S. volume, so it sounds like you guys in the press release you called out volume being down slightly in adult child and diapers and I guess specifically diapers the gap there with Nielsen is really wide right, so Nielsen showing something like mid-single-digits volume increases during those months then you have Unilever this morning talking destalking in the U.S. so I am wondering can you reconcile that a little bit I know it\u2019s Nielsen, but the volume piece specifically I guess? Thomas Falk :  Yeah I mean as we would look at the - Ali asked this question a little bit earlier, as we would look at the U.S. diaper category in the quarter we\u2019d say looking at everything that we can see and from a consumption standpoint shelf off take was probably plus 1 and our volume was minus 1 on diaper. And so there is a little bit of inventory change some of it also has to do with that we shift some of the promotional activity in March for some of the snug and dry re-launch that that would up selling through in the second quarter. And so I would say we\u2019re about on track with our expectations from that standpoint. And our stuff typically is pretty high queue, pretty high velocity. So there is usually not very large inventory swings. So we wouldn\u2019t typically see a big destocking effect. Christopher Ferrara :  Okay, great. And then can we talk about the incremental brand, I mean I guess that\u2019s above and beyond what you\u2019d expected I think you sort of framed it around continued optimism around growth opportunity. So I guess can you talk about how much of that incremental brand investment you expect to be in the form of pricing right, which kind of came up a little over this quarter versus advertising behind initiatives? Thomas Falk : Yeah. I think the way I would think about it is yeah we\u2019re little bit ahead of our plan so far this year and we want to make sure we deliver the plan, but we also if we have the opportunity to invest more in innovation or in some of our key markets where we\u2019ve got good growth opportunities in a strategic way we\u2019re going to look for opportunities to do that in the back half and maybe more than we have in past years, which is a great opportunity for our teams to be whether they\u2019re thinking about where do I cut programming to make the year we\u2019re looking at and we fully funded here the things that we can do to increase our investment. So, where we\u2019ve had good innovation, where we\u2019ve god market momentum those would be the kind of places that we\u2019d been asking those questions it would be much more strategic front, but I\u2019d say advertising as part of it, digital coupon I guess another part some of that stuff might wind up as a reduction of sales if it\u2019s a digital coupon, but it\u2019s going to be more strategic rather than any kind of price cutting. Christopher Ferrara : And just to be clear you guys have considered this more offensive than defensive relative to competition? Thomas Falk : Yeah. I think in general yeah, you want to make sure if you have competitive threats in markets though that you are fully defending. So we\u2019ve mentioned that the China diaper - with the right offer and [indiscernible]. So I think there is an element where you plan to offence and you also want to make sure you\u2019re fully competitive. Christopher Ferrara : Got it. Thanks a lot. Thomas Falk : Thanks Chris. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thomas Falk : Good morning Olivia. Olivia Tong : Good morning. How are you? Thomas Falk : Pretty good. Olivia Tong : Good. So first question, just want to dig a little bit deeper into the earnings outlook because you raise your expectations on commodities enforced by let\u2019s call about $100 million cumulatively. And clearly that\u2019s slightly offset by the slight uptick in currency pressure, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be flowing fully through to your earnings outlook. So is it a function some of the incremental brand investment that you just refer to? So or is it another thing so maybe can you talk through some of the puts and takes that offset some of the positives on the expense line to start? Thomas Falk : Yeah, that\u2019s the right way to think about it. We took the guidance up, the bottom end of the range up a nickel and that's part of it. We had better - a little bit better commodities we expected a little bit worst currency than we expected and then we took FORCE cost savings are tracking ahead of plan and we\u2019re investing some of that strategically in key markets and products in the back half of the year. So you get the right elements and the mix of that is what translates into the guidance. Olivia Tong : Got it thank you. And then just two follow-up questions, first on North American diapers, is Huggies spending right now fully rolled out and as you think about sort of rebuilding share at the low end how concern are you about the competitive environment at the entry level price points given where commodities are right now? And how do you think about the price volume mix? How do you think that looks going forward? And then just overall on the promotional environment which you referenced a couple of times already, but how is the competitive environment looking right now overall? I mean we talked a little bit about North American consumer tissue, but just to reassume your thoughts on the overall basis as well? Thanks so much. Thomas Falk : Sure. Yeah on diapers I mean, I think the near-term commodity weakness isn't resulting in any significant price movement and if you kind of look at over the last couple of years we\u2019ve had pretty good amount of commodity increases, but there was no price recovery for us. So if you looked at the net-net of it we are still even though the deflation we\u2019re going to have this year is less than the inflation we had last year that we didn't get any pricing for. So I would say in the range that we are in I don't think it's going to move price significantly. I also think the consumer is in the stronger position than they were a year ago. And so we want to make sure that we get the right offer and that we get a very good performing product at a competitive price in the market place, which is sort of in the heritage of Huggies for many years and we\u2019re really making sure we stay true to that. In terms of the competitive environment, if you look all over the world there is plenty of people that get up every morning wanting to take your business. And so we look at the Japanese competitors, [indiscernible] are quite aggressive local Chinese competitors like [indiscernible] are aggressive, we got local competitors in Latin America with CMPC and then SCA is popping up in lots of places. So and obviously P&G is a formidable global competitor as well. So we know we've got to be moving pretty fast every day to bring right innovation to execute well in the market to continue to deliver on our business plans and our teams are up for that challenge. Olivia Tong : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for the question. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks, good morning. Thomas Falk : Familiar with Barclays it\u2019s great. Lauren Lieberman : Actually this is Lieberman regardless. Can you talk a little bit again sorry to beat a dead horse, but just on fem care at least in the Nielsen data, it looks like private label has actually been gaining some ground. So when you are talking about kind of making sure you have the right offerings and revisiting market again and so is it primarily what you are seeing day to day as well the private label is the really the one kind of making some inroads? Thomas Falk : Finally the shares are up a little bit I'm just kind of looking at the share data. But it's.... I don't know if you get it Paul. Paul Alexander :  About a point. Thomas Falk : About a point. But I would say it's been more the competitive price points from some of those smaller players in the market that has been making some noise, as we\u2019ve last year consolidated our everything under the U by Kotex name and that execution went pretty well. But we still think with that we can do even better in terms of how we merchandise that in store and make sure we\u2019ve got the right product and right offer. Our super-premium our U by Kotex line was a little slower growth this quarter and so that's one that we are really focusing on and make sure we got the right innovation messaging there. And so again some of it\u2019s the category and some of it is we probably say we can do better on the innovation and execution front. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. And as you are thinking about the reinvestment dollars the back half of the year and even further beyond, how much of that mix is skewing online social et cetera? Particularly I think about things like where to reach people entering the fen care category, what you'll be doing with Impressa going forward and what\u2019s your kind of learning trajectory on how to do online best? Thomas Falk : That's a great question, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re spending a lot of time on and so we\u2019ve got lots of digital marketing work going on all over the world and are trying to make sure we\u2019re investing in that capability in each individual market and then where we find something that work to share best practices at a faster pace. And so I think that\u2019s something that every CPG out there is doing. And particularly in the target market of fem care for late teen girls I mean they are very connected in their social experience and we want to make sure that we\u2019re relevant there. So for example in China with our re-launch of our Kotex brand there it\u2019s been nearly 100% digital marketing really almost no network TV in that space just because of the importance of that channel that consumer. And so we\u2019ve had some real successes and we\u2019ve also learn some things along the way of what not to do and but we\u2019ve got a lot of good work going on in that space. Lauren Lieberman : When did Kotex re-launch in China? Thomas Falk : We launch that it was like early last year or late \u201813? Paul Alexander : Yes. Thomas Falk : Late \u201813 I think was the first shipment that really kind of sort hit strides in \u201814. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. And then in - fem care in Brazil couple of times today, so was there also a re-launch for Kotex in Brazil? Thomas Falk : Yeah. Our brand there is Intimus like Kotex which is a brand that we acquired, but we\u2019re upgrading that with some of the global innovation that we\u2019ve done in other markets along the lines of the U by Kotex things that we\u2019ve done in the U.S. and seeing a very good response when we picked up brand leadership in Brazil in fem care for the first time in the long time and have good momentum going in that market. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Last details is it branding on end product in terms of you by Kotex carry over in the U.S. or is it just sort of the product itself? Thomas Falk : It\u2019s more of the product itself and it\u2019s actually it\u2019s more of a global innovation a lot of the stuff that U.S. guys are launching that was invented in Korea or China or elsewhere and so that global team is probably doing the best job of any that we have of driving an idea consistently around the world. Five years ago probably would have been our most disapproved product form everywhere and today we\u2019re all on went roughly the same product chasse we\u2019re trying to take that learning and do it other areas so some of the things we\u2019re doing on diaper pants and baby wipes are tapping into that where our local teams still have local optimization, but we\u2019re able to drive a more consistent message around the world. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. So, thanks so much. Thomas Falk : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Thank you for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Paul Alexander : Alright. Since we have no more questions on the line we thank you for your interest today and we\u2019ll close with the comment from Tom. Thomas Falk : Once again a good quarter of top and bottom line results and good execution by the team and we really appreciate your interest and support in Kimberly-Clark. Thanks very much. Paul Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a wonderful evening.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Paul Alexander. Sir, you may begin. Paul Alexander : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, CFO; and Mike Azbell, VP and Controller. Here's the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with the review of third quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year, and we'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our Web site. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information on these adjustments, and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I will turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry : Great. Thanks, Paul. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for our third quarter results. We achieved organic sales growth of 5%. That's at the high end of our full year target. We also delivered excellent cost savings, gross margin improvement, and record adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations. And finally, we continue to improve our capital efficiency, and return cash to shareholders. Now, let's cover the details of our results, starting with sales. Third quarter net sales were $4.7 billion. That's down 7%, driven by a 12 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales rose more than 5%, including 10% increase in developing and emerging markets. On profitability, adjusted gross margin was 36.1% in the third quarter, up 120 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 17.5%. That's up 10 basis points, despite unusually low G&A spending last year, and a 70 basis point drag in other expense. Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund the investments that we're making behind our brands. Third quarter FORCE cost savings were $85 million. In addition, our organizational restructuring is on track and generated $20 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $45 million benefit in the quarter, mostly in oil-based materials. Full year deflation should be about in the middle of our previously estimated range of $100 million to $200 million. Now, on the other hand, we continue to experience significant currency headwinds. The total earnings drag from currency was approximately $0.45 per share in the third quarter. For the full year, it's likely that the currency headwinds on our bottom line will approach 25%. That's a more significant impact than we expected coming into the year, and when we spoke to you on our last earnings call in July. On items below operating profit, we had modest benefits from lower share counts and the adjusted effective tax rate, along with higher equity income. On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.51. That's a new all-time quarterly high on continuing operations basis, and up 1% year-on-year. Now, turning to cash flow and capital efficiency; cash provided by operations in the third quarter was healthy at $849 million, although down versus a very strong year ago quarter of $976 million. On adjusted return on invested capital, through nine months, we have improved this metric 350 basis points. That improvement includes benefits from the spin-off of Halyard Health. On capital allocation, third quarter dividend payments, and share repurchases totaled nearly half a billion dollars. We expect the full year total will be $2.1 billion, or about 5% of our current market capitalization. Now, let's look at the segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 9%. That included 14% growth in developing and emerging markets, and a 7% increase in North America. Overall Personal Care operating margins were 20.5%, up 100 basis points. This improvement was enabled by organic sales growth, cost savings, and lower input costs. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up 1%, including volume growth of 6% in North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 17% were up 20 basis points despite unfavorable currency effects. In K-C Professional, organic sales increased 5%. Within that, developing and emerging markets grew 6%, and developed markets outside of North America grew 4%. The segment top line also benefited from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited term supply agreement. You can see this benefit in the mix other number for this segment. K-C Professional margins were 18.6%, off 30 basis points year-on-year. Overall, the margins in this segment remain healthy, and above the corporate average. To summarize, we had another good quarter as we achieved mid single-digit growth in organic sales, we delivered strong cost savings, gross margin improvement, and record adjusted earnings per share, and we continue to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Falk : Thanks, Maria, and good morning everyone. I will share my perspectives on our third quarter results, and then I will cover our full year outlook. Overall, we delivered another quarter of good financial results, and we are executing our global business plan strategies well in a challenging environment. As Maria just mentioned, organic sales growth was strong at more than 5% in the quarter. So let me spend a few minute and unpack some of our top line growth strategies for you. As you know, we are focused on pursuing targeted growth initiatives. We are launching product innovations and making high return investments in our brands. These strategies are working. Our biggest targeted growth initiative is in the developing and emerging markets. We had another excellent quarter in this part of our portfolio with 10% organic sales growth overall. Organic sales in diapers rose double digits in these markets. We continue to benefit from innovation, expansion of diaper pants, category development, and higher net selling prices in some places. In terms of some of our key growth markets, organic sales in diapers rose about 45% in Eastern Europe. That was driven by price increases in Russia and the Ukraine to offset currency declines there, along with double-digit volume growth in Russia. Organic sales in diapers increased more than 15% in China. Volume growth remained very strong, while net selling prices were down due to increased competitive activity. Huggies diapers are now sold in 115 cities in China, that's up from 105 at the end of last year. We are launching product improvements in the fourth quarter of this year to further improve our Huggies franchise in China. In Brazil, our team continues to execute well in a very challenging economic environment. Total Personal Care organic sales increased more than 10%, including 5% growth in diapers. Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our overall feminine care organic sales rose high-teens in the third quarter. Our momentum remains strong in Latin America, led by Brazil, and we made further progress in China. Organic sales also increased double digits in baby wipes and in adult care in the developing and emerging markets. So, overall, we delivered a strong organic sales growth quarter in developing and emerging markets, and we are optimistic about our future there. In our developed markets business outside of North America, organic sales were down slightly in the quarter. We continue to generate solid growth in South Korea, while market conditions remain relatively soft in Western and Central Europe. Moving now to North America in our consumer business, we have excellent volume growth in the quarter behind innovation, brand investment, and good execution at retail. In baby and child care, volumes were up low double digits on Huggies diapers, and high single digits on Huggies baby wipes. Our second quarter re-launch of new Snug N' Dry mainline diapers is on track, and I'm encouraged that our Huggies volumes are improving. In our adult care business, our innovation, brand investment, and category growth helped us deliver double-digit volume growth in the quarter. Pipeline shipments for Poise Impressa occurred in the last half of the quarter, and we are watching the consumer response there very closely. In consumer tissue, Kleenex facial tissue volumes rose high single digits. We had very good execution around the back-to-school season, and paper towel volumes were up double digits, led by promotional activity on Viva. Shifting to K-C Professional in North America, volumes there increased mid single digits on our higher margin, faster-growing wiper products. In washroom products, organic sales were even with last year, and that's roughly in line with the overall market and category. Since Maria has already discussed our profitability, the balance sheet and capital allocation, I will just add that I'm also very pleased with our performance in those areas. So, all in all, I'm encouraged by our results in the third quarter. Now, let's move and talk about the outlook for the full year. Our teams continue to focus on the fundamentals that create long-term shareholder value, while delivering on our near-term financial commitments. In terms of our growth targets for the year, we are raising the low end of our previous guidance ranges for both organic sales growth, and adjusted earnings per share. On the top line, we are now targeting organic sales growth of 4% to 5%. Our prior target was 3% to 5%. Through nine months, we've delivered growth of about 4.5%, and that compares favorably to many other peer CPG companies. On the bottom line, despite a worsening currency environment, we've raised the low end of our previous guidance range by $0.05 per share for the second consecutive quarter. That's largely due to our improved expectation for organic sales growth. Our updated outlook is for adjusted earnings per share this year of $5.70 to $5.80. So in summary, we delivered a very good result in the third quarter. We raised the low end of our top and bottom line growth ranges for the full year. And we remain optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we will begin to take your questions. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. We will now open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail Glazerman : Hi, good morning. Tom Falk : Good morning, Gail. Maria Henry : Good morning. Gail Glazerman : In terms of the diaper business in the U.S., has any of that promotion activity started to roll off in the fourth quarter? And if so, can you give any sense of how sales have progressed? Tom Falk : I would say that it wasn't as much promotion-intense as getting the everyday price, and innovation fundamentals right. And so that is continuing in the fourth quarter. And we've got a good momentum in the diaper business overall, and expect to see that continue. Gail Glazerman : All right. And I apologize if I missed it, but can you give some insights into the trends you are seeing in North America in feminine care? Tom Falk : Our fem care business was sort of flattish on volume in the quarter. We got some more activity coming in the fourth quarter. There was a little bit more promotion activity in tampons in some of our competition in the third quarter. That probably affected our growth a bit, but we've got more action coming in the fourth quarter. Gail Glazerman : Okay. And in terms of developing and emerging, are you still comfortable that you can compensate for currency with price, or do you think you've tapped out your ability to use price as a lever at this point? Tom Falk : I would say -- and you saw it a little bit in this quarter, that we've had less price overall than maybe we've had in some markets. The rate of currency deterioration hasn't been as severe as it was, say, a year ago. On the other hand, there's still some opportunity for price in some markets. As we look at, particularly in Latin America, where you are seeing some pretty significant currency moves. Those have been places where we've been able to get some price to compensate with that. And then other markets around the world, it's been a little bit tougher to get price, particularly places like Western Europe or Australia, where there's been some currency softness. Gail Glazerman : Okay. Thanks very much. Tom Falk : Thanks, Gail. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Jason English. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hi guys, thanks for the question. A couple of housekeeping items, and I apologize if I missed this in the prepared remarks. You referenced the deflationary number ex-fiber in the press release. Can you talk about what you are seeing in the fiber complex? And then also give us a little more color on what's driving the higher administrative cost? Tom Falk : Yes, I think a couple of things. Fiber was about a push in the quarter, it normally would be in that number, but -- so you are seeing fairly minor movements up and down on different grades of fiber. Eucalyptus is a little higher, Northern softwood is a little lower. Secondary fiber has been a little lower. So there's not been a lot of movement on that front. As we look -- rolling forward we will see how that plays up, but we haven't seen much push from fiber. What was the other part of your question, Jason? Jason English : Higher administrative costs this quarter. Tom Falk : Oh, yes, G&A was more of a comp [ph] to last year; it was an unusually low quarter, so \u2026 Jason English : Got it. That's helpful. And one more question just in terms of China expansion strategy. I appreciate that you continue to build out brick-and-mortar presence in more markets. Can you talk about how your strategy may be evolving with the booming eComm business, as well as opening in more free trade zones and more participants in those markets or in the free trade zones? Tom Falk : Yes, we've been a leader in eComm in China. It's probably been at least a third of our diaper sales. And eComm grew faster than our overall business in China in the quarter. And so, we are aggressively going after that. And China, as you may know, has been a place that's been pretty competitive for a long, long time. So I think everyone in the world sees the opportunity in China, and has been investing there pretty aggressively. So we see the Japanese competitors, other U.S. competitors, some of the European competitors are there. And so, it's a competitive marketplace for sure. Jason English : Great. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll the pass it on. Tom Falk : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Ferrara : Hi, good morning. Tom Falk : Hi, Chris. Maria Henry : Good morning. Chris Ferrara : So I guess, on the U.S., are you seeing any competitive reaction to Snug N' Dry? I know to some extent Snug N' Dry is -- the re-phasing of it is a competitive reaction as well. But are you seeing anything from competitors with respect to promo? And how optimistic are you that the share gains that you're picking up are sustainable at these sharper price points? Tom Falk : Yes, that's a good question, Chris. I'd say, it was a -- we saw increased coupon activity, which may be not be as visible to you in some of the Nielsen data. We saw pretty heavy advertising investment by key competition. And so, which I'd say is about the kind of competitive reaction we would expect in a major re-launch like that. We would be approaching it the same way if one of our competitors was re-launching, where you try to make sure you protect your franchise as much as you can. Yes, I think the share gains to this point have been fairly modest. If you look at our fourth quarter share, which is maybe our low point, year-to-date we are maybe up a point versus that level. And so, this quarter, our shipment share -- our shipment volume was a little bit ahead of our share progress as we -- we had some retailers that built inventory because we had a few out-of-stocks that they wanted to try to take care of. In the second quarter, that was sort of the reverse situation, and so we caught up a bit in the third quarter. Chris Ferrara : Got it. Thanks. And in, I guess, China. I think you said net selling prices ran a little bit lower, and volume really didn't decelerate very much. I guess, A, is that right? And then can you characterize what type of competitive pressure -- I mean is this diaper pants and Procter generally, I guess? Any more color on that would be really helpful. Tom Falk : Yes, in China, our total diaper volume was up 15 -- our total diaper organic was up 15, volume was north of 20. So you can do the math. Price was the balance. I would say it was, in some cases, some of our non-U.S. competitors, the Unitherms and Kaos where they've had a relatively weaker home currency, were a little bit more aggressive on price, more so than other competitors in that market. Chris Ferrara : Okay. Thank you. Tom Falk : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great, thank you. So Korea had a pretty nice quarter in personal care. But can you comment on the sustainability of that volume growth, particularly as you move into 2016, and you start to cycle some tougher comps? And then just longer term, how do you think about pricing, particularly in North America? Because it looks like the moves that you've made on price have obviously resulted in better volumes than what the track channel data would imply, but just curious how you think about the volume versus price dynamic going forward. Tom Falk : So those are great questions. So, yes, we've got a very strong innovation pipeline coming, and really good execution in emerging markets. So we are still very bullish on that. We are still seeing the super premium segment of our categories grow in most of our major markets. Even in Brazil, where there's been a pretty severe currency hit to that economy year-on-year, and quite a bit of price inflation, you're still seeing mom want the very best product for baby. And we're seeing that in Russia. We're continuing to see that in China. There's no question that the consumer is under pressure in some of those markets from a purchasing power standpoint. So we're watching that to see if category growth decelerates; have not seen that to a great extent on the consumer side, seeing a little bit more of a reaction on the B2B side. So, our KCP business was slower in the quarter in Brazil than our consumer business was. And so, that is one that we are watching the dynamic in those markets where you've seen a lot of pressure. In the U.S., the pricing that we've done has been either surgical to get our value equation right on Huggies Snug N' Dry to make sure that we got the right price gap versus our nearest mid-tier competition. And we're seeing reasonable returns from that in terms of the volume growth. On the tissue front, where there was a little bit of price weakness in the quarter, that's been a story that's been going on for awhile. I'd say sequentially it was slightly better in terms of the competitive deep promotion price points pulled up a little bit, so we are not seeing as much of that. So again, it's more about trying to make sure we are competitive on shelf with the right offer, and bringing the right value to the consumer. Olivia Tong : Got it. Thanks. It's really helpful. And then just following up, on fem care, you had mentioned some incremental activity coming in Q4. Do you mean incremental, like innovation, or more pricing, promotion type adjustments? Tom Falk : I'd say some of both. We'll have some product news and then some commercial innovation. So it will be a combination of strategic marketing. We'll do some things in the advertising and digital marketing front, as well as some in-store activity, but I wouldn't view it as -- it's not going to be a straight hot price promotion to move volume. It's more strategic around product news. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks a bunch. Tom Falk : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. Tom Falk : Good morning, Lauren. Maria Henry : Good morning. Lauren Lieberman : On North America, two questions. So, one is on the personal care volume growth. I know, Tom, you started to mention there was a little bit of a catch-up or truing-up on inventory levels at retail and shipments versus 2Q. But, just if you could talk about I guess the Nielsen data, which shows something close to 3% sales growth for you guys in terms of takeaway, but you reported 7%. So how much of that do you think is the Impressa pipeline till at the end of the quarter, some catch-up where they've been out-of-stocks last quarter. So that would be one bucket of question. The other would be on pricing, the sequential deceleration. How much of that was maybe sampling or couponing on Poise, any kind of new activity on other areas of incontinence or in fem care? Because it did -- got a little bit more sequentially, and I believe that all of the price adjustments on Snug N' Dry had been in there last quarter. Thanks. Tom Falk : Yes, that's fair. I think on the volume front, if you think Poise and Impressa, it's fairly small dollars in the quarter, really just getting started. So, if you looked at our total adult care business in North America was up double digits overall on organic. If you took Poise and Impressa out, it was up high single digit. So it didn't move the needle even in adult care all that much, but we do think it's going to be a nice category for us as we start to roll it out. On the price overall, I'd say it was a -- that probably most of it was in diapers, and so, we do have a little bit of a more training pant promotion in the summer months, so you saw a little bit of that in the third quarter. We had some -- we'd launched an improved Pull-Ups product, in August. And so we put a little bit behind that to get that going. But those were the -- largely it was, most of price promotion activity was in the diaper category. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then just, sorry Tom, just to finish up on the volume, so the Impressa piece was small, but do you think, other than I guess the true-ups versus 2Q was what we saw in terms of shipments versus takeaway, if we assume Nielsen [indiscernible] engage for takeaway. Do you think you're back to even 2Q, 3Q combined, and 4Q is sort of shipments and consumption match a little bit better? Tom Falk : Yes. I would think that's the case. I think a lot of the inventory that went in was either to support customer service levels. We had some high out-of-stocks for the couple of customers. And so we -- as we added the inventory, we saw better in-stock, and better performance at retail. And so, hopefully that investment continues to pay off for us and our retail partners. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then if I could just ask one more in personal care margins; margins, up 100 basis points in that business, even with the down-drop in North America pricing, and the 13% FX headwind to top line. So, can you just talk a little bit about what's really driving that? I know you loosely said cost savings, but it just seems like an enormous gap that you guys overcame. Tom Falk : Yes, I mean I would say cost savings were good. Virtually all the deflation -- the raw material deflation hit personal care, because tissue and KCP is mostly fiber based. And fiber was basically even sequentially, and so -- or year-over-year. So they got virtually all the benefit there. We also got some price in some markets around personal care, where we had some currency devaluation. And so, that helped as well. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Thank you so much. Tom Falk : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Nyet Nuin with Xbodia Capital. Please go ahead. Nyet Nuin : Hello. Thank you for your talk. And I have a question on the outlook that you have for the Q4. You said organic sales growth contribute 3% to 4%. I wonder why you dropped the percentage of growth from this quarter to next quarter. And then the second part is about the cash flow. I see that the cash -- the free cash flow has been reducing. So I wonder what is the reason why behind that. So there are two questions I have. Tom Falk : Sure. I think we adjusted our organic sales growth outlook for the year. So, we're at 4.5 year-to-date. And we said we'd be four to five for the year, and that's up from three to five in the previous quarter. So, we got the fourth quarter by definition, it is going to be pretty close to our trend rate for where we've been. On the free cash flow, like everything else in our financial statements, has been affected by changes in currency rates. And so as currencies weaken, it's -- our sales are smaller, our profits are under pressure from it, our balance sheet is smaller, and our cash flow is little smaller. And so, we've got lower cash earnings to start, but predominantly due to currency, and then that flows through the overall cash flow statement. Nyet Nuin : Thank you. And just a follow-up on the currency question; so I see that a lot of companies are hurt by the stronger dollar compared to other markets. And since your company has a lot of sales in the emerging markets, do you have any other remedies or any other solutions in terms of trying to improve the situation beside endure the pain by the market? Tom Falk : Well, essentially, we are -- our strategy is to maximize our local currency net income. And so, we make most of our products in the country that we sell them in. And so -- and part of our costs are denominated in local currency, and then a part are in dollar-based commodities, and we try to hedge that where we can. But we want to win in the local market, and gain market share in the local market by delivering products that are relevant, and meet the essentials for mom to care for her family. Nyet Nuin : Got it. Thank you. Tom Falk : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ali Dibadj : Hi, guys. So I wanted to get some help thinking about how you feel the quality of your numbers are this quarter. Usually it's pristine, and this time, the top line is still very good, but driven by, as you mentioned, price promo, some inventory, some things that make it sound like the top line isn't quite as sustainable going forward truly, if there's more competition. Your margins were a little bit worse than anticipated. FORCE was a little bit lower, but you made it up through taxes being a little bit lower, at least, at least than we had modeled, and certainly some higher buyback. So, for a company that's usually very pristine on the quality, you're clearly dealing with these tough times. I'm trying to figure out how we should think about this as a little bit different than what we've seen over the past several quarters, I guess. Tom Falk : Actually, Ali, I was pretty happy with the quality of it. So I -- as we looked at the 5% organic top line, is pretty solid in this environment, and have been at the high end of the range that we've been aiming at, all volume. So really not any help from price to get there were in other quarters, we've been in the four to five range with three volume and two price. So, I mean, I'm pretty happy on the top line front. In this environment, where we're not getting as much price and we still got all the transactional currency hit to cover it with cost savings and still deliver improved gross margin and improved operating margin was a pretty good performance. We held our advertising and promotion investment rate as a percent of sales in the quarter, which is a positive. The year-over-year margin and present [ph] G&A was really a low watermark for us last year, and we did indicate that that probably wasn't going to be repeated. And then other income and expense was about 30 million swing year-over-year. Last year, we had a gain from an asset sale, and this year we had currency transaction losses. And so, when you net all that down, you would say pretty good performance to have margin improvement in both gross and operating margin. And then below the line, taxes were benefit. Mexico had a good quarter though, and Mexico was a nice uptick for us which while it doesn't show up in all the operating line is still a very solid performance. So all in all, I would say we feel pretty good about the quality. Ali Dibadj : Okay. So many levers to pull, and in a tough environment you can pull on them differentially to get to, again, good numbers throughout. If you could comment on FORCE, it sounds like that's just this quarter a little bit lower than it's been in the past, but feels like that's just kind of ramping up and may be a transition to new plan, and then another comment if you could share \u2026 Tom Falk : Yes, on FORCE, I mean we delivered 85 million, and we are at 285 for the year-to-date. So, we are on track with a 350-ish kind of number, which is \u2013- so 85 is pretty close to the run rate you would expect. And so, again, I would say good solid work on negotiating material savings, and specifications, and productivity, all delivered a solid result. And we do think there is more to come as we continue to build our global supply chain capability. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And I just want to pick your brain because you guys are usually very open and have a lot of insight on kind of the market broadly. I want to know what you thought about this whole Walmart Wednesdays as we're calling it in terms of their panic and basically saying our margins will never be this high, and trying to react to what they believe is a normal trend in the consumer. How do you think CPG companies will interpret that or feel any repercussions of it? Not short term, but longer term. Tom Falk : There is certainly lot of change going on at Walmart and we see them investing in the store experience. And if you have been in the Walmart a year ago and were in one today, I think you would see a difference, and we are saying our business with them is continuing to perform well. We are also investing in eCommerce. So I think they are doing a lot of right things, and our job is to make sure we are winning with all of our customers wherever mom wants to shop and that we've got the right product and right offer on shelf. And so, we are continuing to do everything we can with them and our other customers to make sure we got the right things happening in the retail space. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Thanks very much. Tom Falk : Thank, Ali. Operator : Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. Tom Falk : Good morning, Javier. Operator : Mr. Escalante, please make sure your phone is put on mute. Javier Escalante : I am sorry. Good morning everyone. It was in mute. I would like to have some clarifications on the emerging market piece. If you can remind us, what percentage of your sales are in Eastern Europe, which is growing at 45%? And how sustainable is that? Is it that -- I can see that the double-digit volume growth in Russia suggests like there is no price elasticity and that you have a ton of pricing power in Russia. So could you help us understand what's happening in Eastern Europe that is growing 45%? Is it that you are gaining share to competitors? Is it that the category is on fire? So that would be my first questions. And then I have a couple of follow-ups on Brazil and China. Thank you. Tom Falk : Yes. I mean Russia and Eastern Europe is about couple of percent of our overall company sales. So it's relatively small market for us. And when you've seen what the Ruble has done over the last year, you've seen lots of price inflation in that market. It is not unlike some of the Latin American markets, where you had a significant inflationary impact, and where you got a lot of imported materials in your product, you wind up having to take price just to keep your margins reasonably whole. And we are seeing good response to diaper pants in that market, and so it's not just a straight price increase, we've also brought innovation, and we are trying to watch and make sure we've got the right price pack architecture to hit the purchasing power that mom has got during her monthly purchase cycle. Javier Escalante : And on China now, the 5% price decline, does it have to do with increased competition from Procter as they launch this premium baby line, or is it more like price mix as you go into lower tiers, or what exactly is driving this 5% down? Should you expect this to continue, that there's going to be some price erosion? Because I have a little bit of problem understanding the trade-up dynamic that you describe with the price decline that you are also citing. Tom Falk : Yes, in China, more of the price pressure has come from our non-U.S. competitors, particularly a couple of Japanese competitors that are in that market. They've had a relatively weaker home currency, and have invested some of that as they lost some share in China, as we've been gaining share. So we are trying to make sure we keep our volume momentum going, and that we match up with the right price points. Javier Escalante : And finally, coming back to Brazil, you basically mentioned the personal care piece that is up 10%, which is very good. The diaper growth in China, the 5%, is all pricing. Did volumes decline as other companies are mentioning that is happening in Brazil? Do you have positive volumes in Brazil in diapers or did they decline? Tom Falk : Our volumes in Brazil were pretty flat in the quarter. So, all of the improvement was price mix, and we did take share leadership on diapers in the quarter in Brazil, but that was really more of our other competitors shrinking a bit, and we've also got fem care -- our leadership in fem care in Brazil as we have driven some innovation on both tampons and pads in that market. So, we continue to see even in a challenging market, when you bring innovation and product news, and bring products that mom wants, consumers are still willing to invest in your category. Javier Escalante : I guess what I'm trying kind of to finalize with picking up these three BRIC countries has to do with the state of emerging markets because, back in the summer, the markets sold off thinking that emerging markets after what is happening in China would decelerate further. You haven't seen at the end of the day any change on the consumer side or something -- it's certainly not reflected in your numbers, so it doesn't seem that you are gaining significant amount of share. So, do you think that -- have you seen any step down, say, in consumer demand in any of these key emerging markets, you didn't see it versus earlier this year, prior to the sell-off of China equities and the world, China going bankrupt? Thank you. Tom Falk : I think, Javier, we're seeing some very modest slowdown in category growth, but less than you would think and less than you've seen in some other B2B categories. And so, GDP per capita is still going up in most of these markets, not the one, not the economies that are in recession obviously, but China for sure, and lot of the Asian economies. And so, consumers still have more money to invest in our categories. We are also still seeing super premium segments growing in a lot of these markets. So, even in Brazil, where the upper tiers of the diaper categories are growing at a faster pace, and they haven't slowdown appreciably. Javier Escalante : That is very insightful. Thank you very much. Tom Falk : Thank you, Javier. Operator : Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Iain Simpson with Societe Generale. Please go ahead. Iain Simpson : Thank you very much. I missed the start of the call, so apologies if these have already been asked. But firstly, you quantified the translational currency impact on profit. Are you able to give any sort of steer as to how we should think about the transactional impact? That would be extremely helpful. Thank you. Tom Falk : Yes. If you look at -- in the quarter, our translational was about 12 points on the top line. Translation and transaction combined was approaching a north of 30 points. If you look at it on a year-to-date basis -- Paul, is it 25 points, something like that? Paul Alexander : Yes. It's about 10 points on the top line for translation, and the all-in impact on earnings is approaching is 25%. So, 2 to 2.5 multiple of translation impact is a good rule of thumb. Iain Simpson : Extremely helpful, thank you. And just secondly, if I may, you talked about eCommerce being about a third of your China diaper business. Are you able to give any indication as to how that's I guess trended over the past sort of medium-term? What that number would've been a couple of years ago or five years ago, or just anything to give us a sense as to kind of where that's come from and perhaps where it's going? Thank you. Tom Falk : Yes, I think five years ago, eComm in China for us was probably near zero. Or if it was there, we weren't tracking it. And so, we have put more resources against this and have grown that part of the business. And eComm in China is growing at a faster rate than our overall business. So, we continue to see good returns there. And ultimately, we are trying to be present with the right offer wherever mom wants to shop. And so, we are not necessarily trying to shape the category in a particular direction. We just want to be there whatever outlet or form she wants to buy her products. Iain Simpson : Thank you very much. Tom Falk : Thanks, Iain. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Bill Schmitz : Hi, Tom. Good morning. Tom Falk : Hi, Bill. Bill Schmitz : Are you concerned at all about some of the trade down in a lot of the emerging markets, and like will you sort of adjust to that by maybe trying to launch some stuff at lower end, specifically in Brazil and China? Tom Falk : We were just talking about that on one of the other questions, and so far we are not seeing as much as a trade down as you would think. And we are still seeing -- we launched boy/girl diaper pants in some of the super premium kind of tiers. We are seeing good response and growth there. So we are watching it. And obviously, particularly the economies that are in recession like Brazil and Russia, we are watching that see how the consumer performs and make sure we got the right offer, but we are also seeing really good innovation. Mom still wants the best for her baby. These are not expensive products relative to other things and she is still willing to buy those little luxuries for her family. Bill Schmitz : Okay. I mean just because if you look in China and in Brazil, it's like Hypermarcas has taken a bunch of share, and I know they're for sale. We talked about that last time, but even like Jiangnan, it seems like they're making a pretty big comeback in some of the Nielsen data. Obviously, your share is growing as well. It seems like some of mid-tier players are the ones that are getting hit. Tom Falk : Yes. In eComm and super premium baby stores in China is stuff that isn't tracked as well, and that's where the lot of the growth in the category is. Bill Schmitz : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I know you don't want to give guidance for next year, , but when do you think you're going to get sort of the peak benefit from falling commodities sort of net of the currency becoming less onerous? And I know you sort touched on it a little bit, but has there been any sort of pushback by retailers on some of the pricing stuff, especially on the diaper side, because obviously polypropylene prices are way down? Tom Falk : We will give you guidance in January, and at this point, it's still pretty volatile environment. You look at exchange rates at the end of September and then today and they have moved quite a bit in both directions, depending on where you are at. Commodity costs have been a little bit more stable, but if you still look at lot of the forecast for oil at a $20 barrel higher next year than it is right now. And so, we are still wrestling through that and we'll have a point of view for you in January when we are little closer to the year actually getting underway. At this point, we still believe our model is right continuing to look to 3% to 5% organic and delivering a positive result in margin improvement in that kind of an environment. Bill Schmitz : Okay. And the retail discussions, are they getting any more aggressive because obviously they see what's happened at least with some of the spot prices in some of your categories on the commodity side? Tom Falk : I would say not in the U.S., and I think and in emerging markets, the currency impact dwarfs any commodity cost benefit in most markets. Bill Schmitz : Okay. All right, that's very helpful. Thank you very much. Tom Falk : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Please go ahead. Tom Falk : Hi, Caroline. Caroline Levy : Hi. Good morning. Hi. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about adult care in the U.S., and just how P&G's entry has impacted you. I think Impressa is a different issue I guess. It only just launched, but in general sort of the non-diaper personal-care business, specifically looking at adult as well. Tom Falk : Yes. Since Procter has launched, the category has grown a little faster, and so we've seen -- we went from mid to high single-digit growth to double-digit growth and seen that happened pretty consistently. We had double-digit growth in the quarter, including the benefits of Impressa, which were relatively modest, but still helped us. We have launched a lot of innovation in the last year to make sure that our consumers have the very best products we could offer available. And so, as a result, I think we probably say we successful defended, we have lost less than our fair share as Procter has come in and have delivered solid growth. I'm sure when P&G talks about this later this week they will talk about a successful launch and they will probably hit their share goals. So, private label and some of the other brands have taken a disproportionate hit from the P&G entry. And so, in the meantime we are just keeping our foot on the gas to make sure we've got a great innovation coming in that space, employees in Impressa is just another good example of that. Caroline Levy : That's great. Thank you. I know you talked about Mexico getting better again. I also missed part of the call because Coke was going on at the same time. But it seems like Brazil is deteriorating as an economy. What is going on in Mexico that you see, good and bad, over the next 12 months from where you stand? Tom Falk : Yes, Mexico is -- I am cautiously optimistic there, and Pablo and the team will be on a call later this week, and can give you more color, but that seems executing well, and they are getting some price to cover some of the currency impact that they've hit, seen good volume growth, and good cost savings, and good margin performance. So we are encouraged by what we are seeing there. The economic growth and the economy has been a little slower than they would have hoped at the beginning of the year, but we also see some optimism that that's going to improve going forward a bit, particularly as the U.S. economy improves a bit. Caroline Levy : Thank you. And then just China, briefly, I think you started to talk a bit about fem care, which was not really in the conversation before. Can you talk about that in more detail? Tom Falk : Yes. We are still a very small player in fem care in China. We re-launched probably a little over a year, probably a year and a half ago, now, Paul; and saw double-digit growth in the quarter. And we are seeing some share improvements. We are not in as many cities with fem care yet as we are with our diaper business, but we are growing nicely and have good innovation there, and it's around the U by Kotex type positioning with -- aimed at the late-teen, early 20 young women as she is making some brand choices for a wife and making sure we got a relevant interesting product with a good commercial execution for her. Caroline Levy : Thanks so much. Tom Falk : Thanks, Caroline. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the conference back over to you. Paul Alexander : All right. We thank everyone for your questions today, and we will end with a comment from Tom. Tom Falk : Well, it's another good quarter of great execution from our team, and we are committed to continue forward and deliver on your expectations as our shareholders, and we thank you all for your support at Kimberly-Clark. Paul Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Year End Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, our Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, our CFO; and Mike Azbell, VP and Controller. Now here's the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of our results focusing on the full year and after that Tom will provide his perspectives on our results and our outlook for 2016 and we'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The news release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I will turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start off with the headlines for our 2015 results. Our organic sales grew 5%. That's at the high end of our 3% to 5% target. We achieve excellent cost savings and margin improvements, helping us deliver adjusted earnings per share towards the high end of our original guidance. And finally, we continue to improve our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders. Now let's take a look at the details for our results and let's start with sales. Fourth quarter net sales were $4.5 billion, that's down 6% with an 11 points rise from currency rate. Full year net sales were $18.6 billion down 6% down 6% including a currency headwind of more than 10%. Organic sales growth was about 5% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. On profitability, fourth quarter adjusted growth margins were 36%. The full year was 35.9% up 160 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin were 17.2% in the fourth quarter. The full year margin was 17.3%, that's up 120 basis points compared to the prior year. I am encouraged that operating margins were up in all three business segments and across all three geographies, both America, developed markets and developing and emerging markets excluding the impact of the Venezuelan devaluation. Our teams delivered $365 million of FORCE cost savings in 2015. That was above our initial target of at least 300 million and just $5 million shy of our all time record. We expect another strong year in 2016 with a savings target of at least $350 million. In addition, our organizational restructuring is on track and it generated $65 million of savings in 2015. We expect additional savings of at least $50 million from this program in 2016. Commodities were $150 million benefit for the year mostly in oil based materials. That was at the high end of our original assumption for the year, but on the other hand currency declines severely impacted our earnings. For the year the all-in earnings drag was about 25%, well above our going into the year assumption for a drag of more than 15%. On the bottom line, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.42 bringing the full year to $5.76. That was up 5% compared to the results from continuing operations in 2014 and towards the high end of our original guidance range of $5.60 to $5.80 per share. Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency, cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion for the year versus $2.8 billion in 2014. A number of factors drove the lower cash amounts including our debt financed pension contributions, the Halyard spin-off and higher total working capital. I expect a significant improvement in cash generation in 2016. We reduced our primary working capital cash conversion cycle by eight days in 2015 as a result of extending payables terms. On adjusted return on invested capital we improved this metric 350 basis points including benefits from the spin-off at Halyard Health. On capital allocations, in 2015 we've returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. For 2016 we plan to repurchase between $600 million and $900 million of Kimberly-Clark's stock. We also expect to increase the dividend at a mid single digit rate that's generally consistent with the 5% growth in adjusted earnings per share that we delivered in 2015. Now let's look at the segments. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 7% continuing our long track record of delivering strong growth in this segment. Our Personal Care business grew 14% in developing and emerging markets. Operating margins were 20.5% in Personal Care, up 180 basis points. The improvement was enabled by organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up more than 1% including volume growth of 6% in North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins were 17.5%. That was up 150 basis points and includes benefits from another year of excellent cost savings performance. In K-C Professional, organic sales increased 4% overall with 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. The segment top line also included a 1.5 point benefit from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited term supply agreement. So sales should be somewhat lower in 2016. K-C Professional operating margins were healthy at 18.3%, up 50 basis points year-on-year. To summarize, our fourth quarter results capped off a very good year overall as we achieved mid single digit growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share, we delivered strong cost savings and broad based margin improvements and we continued to improve ROIC and allocate capital in shareholder friendly way. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Falk : Thanks Maria and good morning everyone. I will share my perspectives on our full year 2015 results and then I'll comment on our outlook for 2016. So starting with this past year, we delivered another year of good financial performance in a challenging environment. As Maria just mentioned our organic sales grew about 5%. This reflects very good execution and it compares favorably to many other consumer packaged goods companies. Our volume growth was 4% and that's our best performance since 2007 on this metric. Our business in the developing and emerging markets had another great year with 10% organic sales growth. This performance was highlighted by 14% growth in Personal Care. That's the fifth consecutive year this part of our portfolio has grown organically at a double-digit rate. Looking at some of our targeted growth initiatives in the developing and emerging markets and in diapers our organic sales increased more than 35% in Eastern Europe, 25% in China and 10% in Brazil. Innovation across all these markets continues to help drive our growth and in 2016 we will launch more product upgrades on Huggies throughout the developing and emerging markets. In China Huggies diapers are now sold in 115 cities and we are targeting to be in 130 cities by the end of the year. And in Brazil as a result of the continued decline in real we have recently initiated price increases across these categories. Elsewhere in Personal Care, our organic sales in feminine care rose double-digits in developing and emerging markets. Our performance in fem care was especially strong in Latin America led by Argentina and Brazil. We also had a very good year in China and then the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa on fem care. In addition, our adult care and baby wipes businesses also grew organic sales at double-digit rates in developing and emerging markets. K-C Professional organic sales rose mid-single digits in developing and emerging markets even though demand has slowed in some places towards the end of the year. Overall our business in the developing and emerging markets was 30% of company sales in 2015. Even though volatility has increased and economies are slowing in some parts of the world we remain very optimistic about our growth prospects. For 2016 we are targeting organic sales growth of at least high single digits for our business in the developing and emerging markets. Turning to our developed markets business outside of North America organic sales for 2015 were even with the prior year. We continue to generate very solid growth in South Korea while market conditions were relatively soft in Western and Central Europe. Moving to our North American consumer business we delivered 5% volume growth and excellent operating profit performance. In adult care we delivered high single digit volume growth with benefits from innovations, brand investments and category growth. Our market shares improved sequentially as the year progressed with shares up 1 point in the second half of the year compared to the first half. In baby and child care volumes were up mid-single digits on Huggies baby wipes and low single digits on Huggies diapers. Our second quarter relaunch of Snug \u2018N Dry diapers is on track and helped deliver volume growth in 2015. In consumer tissue, volumes were up mid-single digits with benefits from market share gains, good retail execution, and increased promotion support. Performance was led by Cottonelle bathroom tissue and Viva towels. In K-C Professional in North America, volumes increased mid-single digits on our higher margin wiper products business and our washroom products organic sales were up low single digits, roughly in line with the overall market. Maria has already highlighted how we continue to manage our company with financial discipline, so I'll just add that I'm encouraged with our cost savings delivery, our margin improvements, our improvements in return on invested capital and the cash that we've been able to return to our shareholders. I am also pleased that we delivered bottom line earnings growth towards the high end of our original commitment even though currency rates were much worse than we had planned for the year. So all in all I am proud of our team's accomplishments in 2015. We have good momentum overall and we're focused on driving further improvements going forward. Now let's move on to our outlook for 2016. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals that create shareholder value. So in 2016 we will deliver healthy levels of organic sales growth, cost savings and margin expansion. We will improve working capital, cash from operations and return on invested capital and will return a significant amount of cash to shareholders again in 2016. At the same time we will continue to invest in our brands, our growth initiatives and our capabilities in order to improve Kimberly-Clark over the long-term. In terms of our specific 2016 targets, on the top line we expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, that's consistent with our long-term objectives. On the bottom line we have targeted adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.15. That is up 3% to 7% year-on-year. Similar to this past year, at this point we are expecting that earnings will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Like other multinational companies, we're facing continued currency headwinds. We're planning that currency translation will reduce sales and earnings by 5% to 6% this year. The all-in drag on earnings including currency transaction is expected to approach 15%. These projections are based on forward exchange rates as of a couple of weeks ago which are pretty consistent with recent spot rates in most cases. To reduce the impact of currency headwinds we plan to raise selling prices in some of our international markets. We're expecting a relatively benign year on the commodity front. We're starting the year planning for a total impact between $100 million of cost deflation to $50 million of cost inflation. Although some commodity costs should benefit from lower oil prices, others like polypropylene resin in North America are being impacted by market specific dynamics. In addition, cost for materials in some international markets are expected to increase due to local inflation. So as we said before, it is important to look at currencies, commodities and selling price assumptions together since they are all somewhat related. On average we're expecting the net impact of these three factors to result in a high single digit drag in our 2016 earnings. With that in mind, the underlying growth of 3% to 7% EPS growth that we've included in our outlook is pretty healthy. As we always do we'll continue to closely monitor the environment and we'll provide updates on our progress and outlook each quarter as the year unfolds. So in summary, we delivered another year of good financial performance in 2015. We expect to continue our momentum in 2016 and we remain very optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns through our global business plans. This wraps up our prepared remarks and now we'll begin to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eve Powers [ph] of UBS. Stephen Powers : Hi, yes it is Steve. Thanks. Tom, maybe starting with first looking at North America, it looks and sounds like competition and promotional intensity held roughly flat sequentially, would you agree with that? And if so, what's the assumed outlook there as you look forward to calendar 2016, just given it is all that's happening in that marketplace in P&G in general? And a similar question on China given the general demand conditions there, but also obviously a highly competitive market there too? Thomas Falk : Yes, I think broadly the market was pretty similar Q3 to Q4, but also there was more activity in the second half of 2015 than there was in the first half. So if you looked at percent sold on deal [ph] and the level of A&P support across the category was probably increased for all the major brands. We got quite a bit of innovation coming in 2016. We believe are our primary competitor does as well. So I would guess that the current level of competitive activity will continue. We'll forget about the progress in our unit volume growth on diapers in North America and we feel like we've got good momentum on diapers and training pants for sure. In China, we saw a bit more competitive pricing being spent in the market by some of the competitors which we matched up to at some extent, but we saw some of that in the third quarter as you may recall, but had a very strong volume quarter again and again have lots of innovation coming. So still tons of competition around, but I wouldn\u2019t say it is getting worse, but it is continuing. Stephen Powers : Okay, thanks. And then shifting gears a little bit, given another round of devaluation in markets like Brazil and Russia et cetera, what is your confidence on the continued ability to push through incremental pricing? You mentioned another round in Brazil, but is there a level at which it just becomes too difficult to maintain an incrementality? Thomas Falk : Yes, I think we're watching the consumer carefully, particularly as you see GDP [ph] per capital go backwards in some of these markets. In Brazil for example we saw category volumes decline a bit in the fourth quarter for both diapers and bathroom tissue which you don\u2019t see that too often in Eastern Europe. The Ukraine in particular has been a market that has been hard hit if you look at category volumes. Some of that is because there has been quite a bit of parallel imports there that because of some value-added taxes that they put in place. So we are watching the consumer. On the other hand we've got real transaction exposure hitting these markets. You are trying to cover the transaction cost just to try to keep the shape of the P&L in order. And I think every major CPG [ph] is in that balancing act right now. Stephen Powers : Okay and lastly Maria, if I could, so based on the dividend and buyback outlooks and then combine that with CapEx and defined benefit contribution, it looks as though maybe we should assume and you might be adding it again to your debt balance in 2016, is that a fair assumption or is there something I'm missing in there? And if it is fair can you just talk about how you view the borrowing environment given all the volatility we're seeing in capital markets generally and if there is a certain profile of incremental debt that we should assume or perhaps some timing that will be great? Thanks. Maria Henry : Sure, the way that we think about it is we are very focused on maintaining our single A credit rating. So at any point in time, we're looking at whether our effected cash flows, our focus is on continuing to fund the dividend to spend CapEx at healthy levels given the significant opportunities that we have in our business for high ROI return types of projects and then we look at share buyback to balance out what we do with the remainder of both our cash flow and our remaining debt capacity under that single A credit rating metrics. So we'll see how that unfolds during the year. You know that we set our debt up in 2015 and entered the year at $7.8 billion, but as a reminder, a bit chunk of that came from the debt financed pension contributions that we made in 2015, but going forward we expect stronger cash flows in 2016 from operations. And so we'll balance those things out as we go through the year. Stephen Powers : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Wendy Nicholson : Thomas Falk : Hey Wendy. Wendy Nicholson : Hi good morning. A couple of things, number one, I think you gave us the organic sales growth breakdown for China, Eastern Europe and Brazil just for the full year. Can you give us those for the fourth quarter specifically? And then with regard to Brazil pricing, do you intend to raise prices consistently across all the segments? I know there is a very big gap between the various segments and I'm just wondering how much risk of trading down there might be. Thomas Falk : Paul will give you some of the quarterly details and then we can talk about pricing in general. Paul Alexander : Yes, Wendy, for the quarter, so Eastern Europe first of all was up about 25% largely due to higher selling prices. This is in diapers. In China, organic sales were up more than 15%, all driven by volume. Volume was a little bit north of 20% in the fourth quarter. And then in Brazil Personal Care was up about 15%, diapers was about 10%, with both higher volumes and selling prices. Thomas Falk : Yes and then to your other question, we are trying to be smart as we look across categories, the level of pricing also is affected by the amount f innovation that we have coming. So we can bring a better performing product, we will probably be a little more aggressive on pricing in that space, but we're also looking at it by peer to see what's possible. Part of that is also driven by how much is the local content of a particular product makeup versus the U.S. dollar components for using a ton of imported materials, you are going to be more likely to have to price up for that. Wendy Nicholson : And then thus far have you seen much trading down across the segments in Brazil or not so much? Thomas Falk : We've seen a little bit of the trading up, trading down phenomena like we have seen in other markets where the super premium segments are growing where you\u2019ve got real innovation and some differentiation and then you\u2019ve seen some uptick in the value and the middle segments have taken a bit of a hit. We\u2019ve seen that in other markets and some other situations. Wendy Nicholson : Got it and then I just had one last one on your regional operating margins, means the progression in North America just continues to be fantastic, but there's still a lag or the international margins are still significantly below and that makes total sense. But my question is going forward just given that we continue to see such outsized growth from your international business, there is obviously an inherent drag there on your overall margin expansion, I\u2019m just wondering kind of conceptually the FORCE savings or cost savings sort of the margin expansion priorities, how much of those are oriented towards the international business versus North America, so at what point do you think we will start to see that gap close? Thomas Falk : Well, the good news is our international business is closing the gap and so their margins have improved this year. So even though the sales from [indiscernible] they came much closer to the dollar target than you might think given the size of the currency hit that they took. And so they really use very minimal margin drag on the company. In fact this year because they shrunk as a percent of the company\u2019s overall sales we actually had a slight margin tailwind this year from a mixed standpoint. But getting back to the root cause we tend to focus on gross margins in emerging markets and trying to narrow that gap, and narrow the gap is a little closer than operating margin, because in some markets where we are investing in A&P or building infrastructure to support a larger business, we're not quite as efficient between the lines in the international market share, but that\u2019s one that the team is working on and our markets that are at scale like Korea you'd see margins there that are at or above the North American levels in individual categories. Wendy Nicholson : Terrific that\u2019s very helpful, thank you. Thomas Falk : Thanks, Wendy. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Schmidt with Deutsche Bank. Thomas Falk : Hi, Bill. Bill Schmidt : Yes, good morning. Hey, just one quick one, how big is Argentina both sales and profits directionally and do we start getting concerned about what\u2019s going on down there? Thomas Falk : What last year or this year Bill, it\u2019s a little small for this year\u2026? Bill Schmidt : Right. Thomas Falk : I think it\u2019s 2% or 3% of sales and probably similar from profits, had a great year last year and part of the other expense that we took in the quarter was the devaluation that happened in mid December, that part was a $0.03 hit to our fourth quarter results. But I actually feel pretty optimistic about Argentina over the long term and so as we see the new government coming in place and they\u2019re opening up their markets, so there is some product categories for example that were imported. Like our K-CP business for example in Argentina had to import all their safety products and we didn\u2019t manufacture anything locally there well over the last year. So we were not allowed to import. So you had to kind of go out of that business. That\u2019s all going to open up in 2016. So there will be a translation and transaction hit, but I\u2019m more optimistic about the future of Argentina going forward. Bill Schmidt : Okay, great. Actually just one another quick one, on the working capital side is working capital going to turn positive next year because I know that's a pretty significant use this year? Maria Henry : Yes, our working capital use was a bit higher in 2015 than we would like. There were a number of factors that impacted that including the negative impact of currency on our derivative settlements and we also had a tax receivable that moved up into accounts receivable at the end of the year. I mean despite the use of cash we made really good progress on our per working capital metrics as I talked about in my prepared comments. So for 2016 working capital is clearly an opportunity for us and we'll be sure to get at that and as I said our cash from operations to be significantly higher in 2016 versus 2015. Bill Schmidt : Great, thanks very much. Thomas Falk : Thanks Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks, good morning. Thomas Falk : Hi, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : First thing on the other income line of expense, so the hit from devaluation Argentina this quarter is that kind of a one quarter effect or should we think about it being at these elevated levels throughout the year? Thomas Falk : No, you pretty much had the right year of payables down on the data devaluation occurred, so I don\u2019t know Maria, if you've got anymore color on that? Maria Henry : Yes we took a significant hit on the devaluation in the fourth quarter and then it will just depend what happens to the currency from here and how we have to re-measure the balance sheet moving forward. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then on K-C Professional, you mentioned sort of slowing demand at the end of the year in emerging markets, can you talk about that also for North America if you\u2019re seeing any slowing in demand there and your outlook for that business being the more cyclically tied piece of the portfolio? Thomas Falk : Yes I would say this, we had probably different causes and different market sets and they are little softer fourth quarter on the top line than we were expecting overall for the year they had decent organic growth which is what we tend to look at. In North America, we saw some distributor inventory destocking because we look at our out-the-door sales versus our in-the-door sales in the fourth quarter. They sold more out-the-door than they purchased in-the-door. So I think those guys at calendar year end and they were doing some inventory level trimming as they hit their year end. I\u2019d say in other markets like Brazil, which is a big market for K-CP, there you see more just a decline in GDP has had a pretty big impact on business activity. It has affected the key K-CP market much more than the consumer market for the year. In other markets China kind of a mixed bag with a little weaker quarter for us and yes some of that was execution on our front that we need to improve and there is plenty of competition there, probably a bit of the economic slowdown, but again that market is still growing overall, it\u2019s just not at the same pace that it once was. So lots of different issues in individual markets that kind of added up to a little less than we were thinking we\u2019re going to get on the top line. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then on cost savings, so certainly notable that you\u2019re starting the year talking about FORCE being $350 million, to the question on restructuring though, I think sort of came in at the lower end of the expected range for savings in 2015. If I layer on then the $50 million you\u2019re expecting in 2016 those still have you kind of below the $120 million to $140 million in the total realized, so does this mean it extends a little bit further into 2017 or is it just going to be kind of a lower end of the range on the total program? Maria Henry : Yes, our overall restructuring program is firmly on track. We delivered savings of $65 million in 2015 and that brings the total to date to $70 million and our guidance for 2016 is another $50 million of savings putting our cumulative level within the target range of $120 million to $140 million for the full program and we still expect to realize some additional benefits in 2017. So we\u2019re clearly on track in terms of the savings that we expect to realize for that program. Paul Alexander : Lauren this is Paul. I would just build on that. Remember we said the charges would end in 2016, but as Maria has mentioned the savings is really through 2017. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Perfect and just a final quizzing on SG&A, I know in the release you mentioned FX was impacted and I just wanted to check if there was anything else in SG&A because it was a little bit higher than it might this quarter and just thinking it was mostly FX or any other kind of investments in marketing? Maria Henry : Yes, there is a couple of things you mentioned FX that clearly has an impact on the reported expense levels. But our expenses are higher as we\u2019re investing in capabilities and we also had some higher variable compensation expense in the fourth quarter and for the year given our strong performance. And when you look year-over-year I think it\u2019s probably also worth noting that we have lower levels of spend in the second half of last year, so organization was really focusing on the spend and the restructuring program which is a lot of work. And this year as we said on our second quarter earnings call again we were intending to invest in capabilities and we did that. Lauren Lieberman : And Maria can you still elaborate on those capabilities? I mean is that, is it people, is it mostly in selling, is it in marketing or is it actual dollars in the marketplace already? Maria Henry : Yes it\u2019s in a number of areas. Clearly and our selling capabilities is an area that we\u2019re focused on investing in, in marketing capabilities particularly around electronic commerce as we grow in new channels and then we also had some investments in the area of IT in terms of data analytics and things like that all focused on supporting our organic top line growth efforts. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Thank you so much. Thomas Falk : Thanks Lauren. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Thomas Falk : Hi good morning, Chris. Chris, are you there? Operator : Chris your line is open, you need to un-mute your line, if you are muted. Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Hi good morning everyone. My question has to kind of the bigger picture of the company's earnings power right, if you step back and look at 2015 you got 25% impact of currency and yet deliver, if my calculation is correct, nearly 30% currency neutral earnings. This year you\u2019re targeting something about 20% currency neutral earnings. So if you can help us understand kind of like this sustainability of that, how much of this earnings growth in 2016 has to do with savings versus leverage versus that kind of smart because one of the things that are not seen now is that the share repos are coming down relative to the past, so basically the financial side of the EPS growth is less of a contributor. So if you can explain us what is - what do you think is the earnings power of this company because 20% on top of 30% currency neutral EPS growth is pretty substantial? Thank you. Thomas Falk : Yes Javier, I think maybe the way to think about it is looking at the net of price of currency and raw material inflation or deflation and when you net those three things together, it\u2019s a little smaller drag as we talked about for 2016 is probably a high single digit drag. So then to deliver 3% to 7% growth puts your real earnings power more in the low double-digit range which is still above where our historical average has been. So the things that helped us get further along in 2015, it will help us again in 2016. There has been strong volume growth and so good organic top line and a strong cost savings program and we\u2019ve been ramping that up over the years and it\u2019s been never more important than in times like this. And so, if you look at the organic top line drivers we feel pretty good about the innovation program that we\u2019ve got as well as a portfolio of markets that we\u2019re growing and where the categories are still growing there is still opportunity for geographic expansion. On the cost savings front, the three factors that are driving us there are negotiated material savings, our basic productivity programs and material specification changes and we are getting organized to deliver that on a even more consistent basis going forward with some of the works that we\u2019re doing with a new global supply chain leader. So I feel pretty good about volume growth and our cost savings performance and hopefully that delivers the earnings power, it overcome some of the currency drag and other things that we have got facing us. Javier Escalante : And finally on North America again, tissue pricing in North America down 2% is that a temporary promotional activity or do you see think that this is elements of the pass through of lower commodity prices starting to kick in and is it something that is led by you or is it something more of a reaction to say your competitors, thank you. Thomas Falk : Yes, on the tissue front they didn\u2019t really get too much of benefits from deflation in the year and more of it was oil related which benefited the Personal Care segment. They got a little bit of transportation benefit from lower diesel and things like that but beyond that it wasn\u2019t much benefit from deflation. The pricing was a little bit more competitive in the marketplace and we tried to make sure we matched up to that.  I think any time you have a discussion about this it is always the other guy that started it. So I\u2019m sure there are some cases where we were aggressive behind innovation and trying to drive our business and that may have precipitated a response or maybe the converses through. But I do think the overall market was a little bit more competitive. We\u2019ve seen that for several quarters and we feel good about the volume performance. We grew share in 5 of 6 of the North American consumer tissue categories and we saw good margin improvement behind cost savings. So overall, I think the execution was there and we delivered on the plan and expectations for the year. Javier Escalante : But as if I understand correctly, so you basically see the Q4 is slightly aggressive pricing as something more like a one off I suppose to the pass through finally kicking in because the category has been very positive, so in terms of very constructive in terms of pricing, do you think that this is sustainable into 2016? Thomas Falk : You haven\u2019t seen much commodity benefit again, so our forecast is calling eucalyptus data a little bit in \u201916 so, that will help at the movement I\u2019d say the competitive environment is going to be a pretty similar in \u201916 to what it was in \u201915. Javier Escalante : All right, thank you very much. Thomas Falk : Okay, thanks Javier. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Moody [Ph] with RBC. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thanks. Hey, I was wondering if may be you can give us kind of a state-of-the-union on category growth globally? I mean clearly we\u2019ve seen some dramatic headlines on the economies in general across the world, but just curious what you\u2019re seeing from a category perspective, and you are expected to be flat going into 2016 or kind of decelerate or accelerate any thoughts around that would be helpful? Thomas Falk : Yes, I'd say broadly we still let\u2019s say the category opportunity is 3% to 4% on average. If you look at a market like China, we'd still say high single digit growth. It is going to be the year of the monkey in China which is a good year and so you typically have a little bit of an uptick in the birth rate, restarts with the forecasters were calling for, the birth rate in the U.S. is actually ticking up. I\u2019d say there are places we're watching our markets like Brazil and the Ukraine which are going negative where the GDP is as happened to see us as a very short term category issue or is there a bigger trend in place? But let\u2019s say if you guess the category growth rate was three to four or may be rounding down closer to three reflecting some of the challenges in some markets around the world. Unidentified Analyst : Great and then just one last question, as you take pricing in many of these emerging markets, have you seen the price gaps and dislocate with some of the local players that may not be under the same currency pressures, just any context on the magnitude of may be some of the dislocation would be helpful? Thomas Falk : Yes, most local markets we are playing in local currency and so you\u2019re turning to look at transaction exposure as the driver for pricing. So and most of these places most of the competitors including local players, by pulse this is denominated in dollars or they buy super absorbent that\u2019s denominated in dollars or they buy not lot of them that are using polymer that's priced in dollars. And so, there is a transaction exposure that affects everybody and that tends to drive pricing more than trying to price for the translation exposure. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks so much. Thomas Falk : Thanks, Nick. Operator : Our next question comes from John Purcell with J.P. Morgan. Thomas Falk : Hey, John. John Purcell : Hi, yes just a little bit of a follow up there on sort of the last comment on the pricing. You guys are looking for a little bit more price mix sequentially in 2016 versus 2015 and the gross margin performance has been amazing with less pricing that what we\u2019re generally seeing from peers, is that something where the markets are, you have good visibility because the markets are letting you take that or it\u2019s pricing that went in later in 2015 that sort of rolling through into 2016 so, I guess just, what\u2019s the visibility is that, more transactional pricing rolling through mix what have you? Thomas Falk : Yes, there is a mix of that I would say, if you look at the markets where we\u2019ve been most successfully getting pricing is turning to be Latin America, Brazil had, had quite a bit in \u201915 we\u2019ve announced some of the recent currency moves more in '16. We'll see my guess is when Argentina the dust finally settles and the pricing rules right down there more visible there will likely be some pricing opportunities in that market. Eastern Europe has been the other place where you have seen real currency volatility or everyone in those markets has been pretty aggressive on pricing and so that would account for most of it. If you looked at a lot of the other developed markets like Australia, where there has been a little bit of currency movement or even Western Europe, you\u2019re probably not going to get a lot of pricing for the sized currency moves that you\u2019re seeing there. It will be very low single digits if at all and so I think, that's sort of the way it's shaking out is we've got a few hotspots where there has been big currency swings where you get price recovery because everybody is being hit with the same wave of transactional cost hits. And then there are lots of other markets where you have and then manage with cost savings and mix or innovation or other things that are going to drive your revenue realization. John Purcell : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thanks John. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys. Thomas Falk : Good morning, Ali. Ali Dibadj : Hey, just a few questions, one is on cash flow sources and uses and if you think first at level of a more detail on the working capital kind of impact this year and then how and why it's expected to go down next year so from the sources perspective? As well as, why your CapEx remains in this kind of billion dollar range even after Europe and how you\u2019re got spun-off so that\u2019s from the sources perspective? And on the uses side, your buyback range is lower than has historically been the case and if you add that to your dividend guidance you\u2019re kind of the shareholder return seems to be a little bit off course versus what we\u2019ve seen recently and so I\u2019m trying to get a sense of it that\u2019s just kind of macro concerns trying to be cautious or if there is something else going on and I am trying to adjust for Europe and Halyard Health and kind of both those, so both sources of news please. Maria Henry : Sure, let me take a crack at it and then and Tom can certainly jump in here and let me start with CapEx. We\u2019re fortunate to have a lot of opportunity to invest in high return capital projects that support both our top line growth and savings. As you think about our CapEx, you can think of the spend in three areas, growth which supports expansion capital and also investment behind our innovations. Cost savings, which is a second category a lot of that supports the four savings that you\u2019re seeing come through and that we talk about. And then the third category on maintenance if we funds are operations to adequately maintain, productive and safe manufacturing environment. So those are the three categories and I think the range of $950 million to $1.50 billion is about right for our business now given the opportunities that we haven and the size of our operations and the opportunities that we have for expansions in some of the geographies. We\u2019ll continue to monitor that over time. As you know we hired a head of global supply chain and wondering how our organizations will work with the finance team and the local operators to make sure that we continue to make sure that we\u2019re optimizing our CapEx spend as we move forward. On working capital, I said that I thought out working capital usage was a bit higher than we'd like it to be. I think they are areas of opportunities that we have in 2016 are around areas like inventory. We talked about strong performance on payables in 2015 and so, again with our global supply chain organization working with our local teams will be focusing on what we can do on the inventory side and then in \u201815 we also had some negative impacts on working capital from currency on our derivative settlements that we used to manage our exposures on the balance sheet, and then also we had a large tax receivable that moved up into AR at the end of the year, so when you look at the numbers after in there, that\u2019s in there too. I think the third part of your question was around buybacks and that is back to what I said earlier that we\u2019re very focused on maintaining our single A credit rating. So there is, as you know at certain metrics around single A and we watch those very closely and then look at how did the cash flows come in and make sure that we fund the dividends in that churn business through CapEx and then the remainder just remains how much we buyback and we use the cash flow and then any capacity that we have on the debt side within that A rating to really fund buybacks. So depending on where the results of the operations come in will depend on the flex \u2013 within the range on the share buybacks for 2016. Ali Dibadj : Okay, okay and I guess it has been over the past several years you've certainly been giving back more \u2013 then you have been carrying from few capital perspective so that obviously has an impact going forward. Switching gears on taking prices up more in the particularly developing an emerging markets, I mean the FX headwinds for both the Personal Care and the Consumer Tissue business in this quarter, has been there for a while and been quite significant. So like negative 23%. We\u2019re only talking about 6% price mix say in those in that market or in the Personal Care business. So there is still a very large gap between the currency and what you\u2019re taking from a pricing perspective. In your goal of taking prices further up, what gap should we think about between those two numbers as a target? Thomas Falk : Well the way to think about it in terms of how we\u2019re approaching it is, we are not necessarily trying to cover the translation exposure, which is probably the biggest piece of it, we are trying to cover the transaction exposure, but as you look at our net income impacts that also includes things like the balance sheet re-measurement in Argentina that flow through other expense or any other hedging gains or losses. And so, they\u2019re looking more like the run rate transaction exposure and the impact on imported materials and what their ongoing cost of goods is going to be and using that to think about pricing going forward and then balancing that with what your innovation plan looked like, what are the things can we do to substitute the local source material and avoid the transaction exposure and so it\u2019s a market by market approach. And again I would say in Latin America and Eastern Europe is where you found both of those markets are just I'd say used to dealing with high inflation and so when you get hit with this people aren\u2019t shy about taking price, but other markets you\u2019re not going to see that in Korea, you\u2019re not going to see that in Australia. Ali Dibadj : And so my last question is a little bit on that in terms of just the growth rates you\u2019ve seen obviously in developing and emerging have been still very strong. You have to decelerate a little bit to high single digit as opposed to low doubles, but still very, very strong. Can you try to help again with how much of that is kind of shelf space gaining or distribution gaining versus same-store sales and focus if you could and then answer a little bit on China, specifically given the massive volume improvements you\u2019ve seen in massive growth you\u2019ve seen volumes as opposed to pricing and perhaps you guys have seen it we\u2019ve certainly seen it the disconnect in the Nielsen data in China which clearly is not perfect if you think of all channels, but there is a very quick deceleration in the backend of the quarter last year and do you see that being in disconnect because online is growing more or the data is good or what\u2019s going on there because you\u2019re going to have to continue to get very good numbers in terms of growth in China to make some of your top line targets for this year, so I\u2019m trying to figure out data and how that\u2019s a disconnect there? Thomas Falk : Yes and I think the biggest disconnect is e-commerce in China, Ali and so Singles Day was November 11 which was huge for us as well as for all of the online players. So that probably skewed the Nielsen data which tends to look at measured and baby stores because there was a lot of online activity in particularly in November. But again I\u2019d say if you were to decompose our growth in China, we increased the number of cities and I think we started the year at 105, we ended the year at 115, we'll be at 130 by the end of this year. Now each incremental city is incrementally a little bit smaller, but we still are seeing good geographic expansion. We\u2019re still growing share in the cities that we\u2019re in. We\u2019re doing a ton in e-commerce and that channel is growing pretty dramatically in China and so it\u2019s probably a third of our diaper sales were in e-commerce which is overweighed the rest of the categories. We\u2019re still seeing good mid-tier super premium segment growth where we tend to do better. So again, I\u2019d say China we are pretty bullish, lots of competition but good growth in innovation coming and some geography expansion as well. Ali Dibadj : Thanks very much. Thomas Falk : Yep, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Oh, thank you. Thomas Falk : Hi Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Hi sorry. I just wanted to know if you could update us on your fiber mix because I thought it was interesting you didn\u2019t mention you are planning assumptions for Northern Softwood. So I was just wondering what the balance was between Eucalyptus and Northern Softwood currently? Thomas Falk : Yes we\u2019ve been talking about eucalyptus for a while that is the biggest grade that we buy, so I don\u2019t know Paul, it\u2019s probably what two thirds of our fiber mix on the virgin pulp side I would guess, is that right? Paul Alexander : It would be two-thirds of if you\u2019re just looking at Eucalyptus versus Northern Softwood, then also consume some fluffed pulp and [indiscernible]. So overall I\u2019d say Eucalyptus is still roughly half of our fiber mix. Thomas Falk : So, it\u2019s a bigger single grade, which is why we started quoting that one versus Northern Softwood. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, and do you have a range for the Northern Softwood outlook? Paul Alexander : We have not given a range, I mean but it should be down a little bit year-on-year. Thomas Falk : We\u2019re part of this take whatever receives as looking as essentially what our forecast would be. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Do you have a sense for how your fiber mix currently compares with some of your bigger competitors in tissue in North America, like is there a difference in terms of your fiber mix and then obviously what you are looking for in terms of inflation or deflation versus your competitors? Thomas Falk : So I haven\u2019t looked at that in a while my guess would be laws that were pretty similar to P&G and GP might have a little bit more variability just because some of their tissue mills are more connected to their own internal pulp sources, but that would be might my hypothesis. And then on the K-CP front we all run with a lot of recycle fiber on that front, so we will be pretty similar on the K-CP front. Lauren Lieberman : Okay and then move to Eucalyptus, do you think that happened kind of in parallel or was P&G more biased towards Eucalyptus earlier then you were? Thomas Falk : Well, I think this is probably more fiber morphology than you are interested in on a Monday morning, but Eucalyptus helps make tissue soft, but it is not as strong as Northern Softwood. So you get that right now, Hardwood makes it soft and Softwood makes it weak or makes it soft or makes it strong. So we\u2019ve been trying to drive more softness and use more Eucalyptus and you\u2019re trying to figure out what is to make the tissue stronger using other mean so that you don\u2019t give up the strength that Northern Softwood will bring you. So, but I think there are even some markets where we\u2019ve run a 100% Eucalyptus sheet and are able to do that and still hit adequate strength targets. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, all right. Thank you so much. Thomas Falk : All right, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Thomas Falk : Hey, Jason. Jason English : Hey good morning folks. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess I'll pick up one question\u2026 Thomas Falk : Hey Jason, we take all our calls here this morning. So yes, we'll be here until you guys run out of questions. Jason English : Oh goodness, hopefully I\u2019m the last. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll just want to be on the call all day. But I\u2019m going to take up where we left the last one of the questions around fiber and the outlook many people including ourselves see downside risk to pulp prices as we go to next year clearly your forecast is not coined for that only modest deflation. Curious first if there are factors you see into that that would prevent more downside to where pulp prices go? Thomas Falk : Yes that\u2019s a tough one to call, we tend to just look at the, we take two or three industry forecast - being one and I think we\u2019ve looked at a couple of others and we don\u2019t apply an immense amount of judgment to that. We tend to take a look at what the predictions are calling for. I do think the weakening of the U.S. dollar in some of these local markets may not be fully captured in the forecasters because they\u2019re looking at forward currency rates as well. And so if you look at our Brazilian producer who is selling their products in dollars or Canadian producers selling their products in U.S. dollar there is certainly you could make an argument that there could be some price decline. From a capacity standpoint, there the Canadian market should be pretty stable for a while, they have to run their mills this time of the year or they freeze up, there is some additional capacity coming on in Brazil, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be until the end of 2016. So we will see what happens at this point \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 we are seeing a little bit of weaker spot prices for Northern Softwood, but the Eucalyptus market has been relatively balanced and there is not a huge spot market on that at this stage. Paul Alexander : And Jason, I would just add that remember as we talked about earlier these are lot of big moving pieces in our planning assumptions but think about all of them together, so if pulp does weaken more than we are expecting you could see some offsets in a bit higher promotion spending. Jason English : Sure, especially in context of the higher promotional spending without any cost relief this past year, you talked a little about those dynamics earlier, can you elaborate more and give us a sense of sort of where you see the competitive activity settling out now and if we do see pulp relief how much worse do you think it could get? Thomas Falk : I would say the competitive activity has been relatively modest in tissue. We've been \u2013 we've had a lot of news between Viva Vantage. We've had some improvements on Kleenex. We've had some upgrades on Cottonelle and so we want to make sure we get our fair share of the quality promotional support as have some of our other competitors. The good news is you didn\u2019t see much private label movement in the fourth quarter I think private label shares were pretty flat. I think it was private label is up half a point on the year on bath, was up a little more on towels, but we were up in both categories so I think it is just the normal competitive environment and we'll see what happens going forward if you do see a big move in pulp that typically would lead to a change I think relatively modest moves that we are talking about, shouldn\u2019t have a major impact on promoted pricing. Jason English : Got it. Thanks a lot guys, I'll pass it on. Thomas Falk : All right, thanks Jason. Operator : And at this time we have no further questions in the queue. Paul Alexander : All right, thanks everyone for the questions and we'll conclude with a comment from Tom. Thomas Falk : Well, once again we wrapped up the year with a very solid performance in 2015. We've got great momentum and we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thanks for joining us today. Paul Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines. Thank you.",

Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience and holding. We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, CFO; and Mike Azbell, our Controller. Here's the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of our first quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. Now as a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the risk factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We'll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The news release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up more than 2%, mostly due to higher volumes. We achieved strong cost savings, margin improvements and growth in adjusted earnings per share. And cash generation was healthy and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. Now let's cover the details starting with sales. Our first quarter net sales were $4.5 billion, that's down 5% with a 7-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales rose more than 2% in the quarter. That was slightly below our 3% to 5% full-year target, and Tom's going to provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes. On profitability, first quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.6%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 18.3%. That's up 90 basis points. In addition to this overall improvement, I'm encouraged that our margins were up in all three business segments. Our FORCE cost savings for the quarter were $95 million, so we're off to a good start relative to our full-year target of at least $350 million. Our FORCE cost program continues to help us offset currency headwinds and fund growth investments on our brands. Our Organization Restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $30 million benefit, mostly in oil-based materials. Offsetting those benefits, the total earnings drag from currency this quarter was more than 20%. In addition to translation effects of about 7%, that figure includes substantial transaction effects in developing and emerging markets. Despite this headwind, our margins in the D&E market were essentially even with year-ago levels, mostly from the benefit of price increases and cost savings. On the bottom line, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53. That's up 8% year-on-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 6 points of that earnings growth. As we said in January, the quarterly tax rate could be more variable this year. This is the result of timing of benefits from tax planning initiatives. For the full year, we continue to expect the tax rate to be between 30.5% and 32.5%. Now let's turn to cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $553 million and in line with our expectations. On capital allocation, first quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $500 million. In February, we announced a 4.5% increase in our dividend, taking it to $3.68 on an annual basis. This was our 44th consecutive annual increase in the dividend, helping us maintain our top tier payout in the CPG industry. We continue to expect that full-year dividends and share repurchases should total between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion. Looking at the segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales rose more than 4%. That included 7% growth in developing and emerging markets. Overall Personal Care operating margins were 20.3%, up 60 basis points. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input cost. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were even with year ago as growth in North America was offset by declines in developed markets. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 18.7% were strong and up 20 basis points. Our K-C Professional business grew organic sales 1%. That included 4% growth in both North America and developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by about 2%. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.7%. That's up 280 basis points year-on-year, and includes benefits from organic sales growth and cost savings. Before wrapping up, let me go ahead and recap. We delivered growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share, along with significant cost savings and margin improvements, and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Since Maria just reviewed the financial details of the quarter, I'll focus my comments on organic sales growth and our full-year earnings outlook, then we'll open it up for your questions. So starting with the top line, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales increased more than 2% in the quarter. North America had a good start to the year with volumes up nicely in all three business segments. Internationally, we continue to grow, although at a lower than normal rate this quarter. Let me review our top line results in a bit more detail, and I'll start with our international business. In developing and emerging markets, organic sales increased 5%. Looking at some of our key growth markets, in Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers rose 25%. That's on top of a 55% growth rate in the year ago period, which included significant volume gains in Russia in advance of a price increase. In China, organic sales in diapers were up about 5% compared to a very strong growth rate of 35% last year. Our volume growth in China remains healthy, although results were impacted by competitive promotion activity. We expect better organic growth for the full year on Huggies in China, particularly in the second half, and that reflects our plans for innovation, brand investment, city expansion, and improving category growth. In Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care fell about 5% compared to 20% growth in the base period. Volumes were impacted early in the quarter, particularly in diapers, by the price increases that we initiated in January. Category demand also continues to be down in Brazil. Nonetheless, our sales improved as the quarter progressed and we expect better results across the balance of the year. Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our feminine care and adult care organic sales were both up double-digits in the quarter, and baby wipes organic sales were up high single digits. So we remain very optimistic about our developing and emerging markets businesses, and we continue to target high single-digit organic sales growth for the full year. Stronger results in Brazil and China, along with more benefits from innovation launches and selling price increases, should help us deliver higher growth compared to the first quarter. Moving to our developed markets business outside North America, organic sales were down slightly. We continue to generate good growth in South Korea, while market conditions were challenging in Western and Central Europe. Turning to our North American consumer businesses, our teams there delivered another strong quarter, with 4% volume growth and healthy market shares. Innovation, great marketing programs, and good retail execution continued to drive results across our portfolio. Adult care volumes increased double-digits in the quarter with strength on both Poise and Depend. Baby wipes and child care volumes each rose mid-single digits. Consumer Tissue volumes improved 3% with growth in all categories led by Viva and Scott paper towels and Kleenex facial tissue. Overall, our brand positions are healthy in North America. Our first quarter market shares improved or were even with prior year levels in seven of the eight consumer products categories in which we compete. And that includes diapers where Huggies' shares were up more than a half a point year-on-year and up almost two points sequentially. Looking ahead, we have a number of near term innovations launching in North America. That includes our best ever Pull-Ups training pant, upgrades on Huggies diapers and baby wipes, and new and improved Poise and Depend adult care products. Finally, in K-C Professional in North America, our organic sales were up 4% in the first quarter. Execution and volume growth was good in both washroom products and our higher margin wiper category. Now, moving on to our outlook for the year. We continue to target organic sales growth of 3% to 5% for 2016. Compared to the first quarter, we expect more benefits from targeted growth initiatives, product innovations and improved net realized revenue. Our currency and commodity markets remain volatile. As we mentioned in this morning's news release, our current assumptions have improved somewhat compared to three months ago. And while this helps our U.S. dollar results, it also means we're expecting less benefits from selling price increases this year. As we said before, it's important to look at currencies, commodities and selling prices together since they are all related. We're now planning that the net impact of these three factors will be a mid to high single-digit drag on our bottom line growth this year, and that's slightly better than what we shared with you in January. If this turns out to be the case, we'll have added flexibility to invest more behind our top line growth initiatives. So putting it altogether, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15. That represents 3% to 7% growth year-on-year, which we continue to believe is a good outcome in this environment. So in summary, we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies, we expect to deliver on our financial commitments again this year, and we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive, long-term shareholder returns. So that wraps up our prepared remarks, and now, we'll begin to take your questions. Operator : Our first question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Just on D&E in Personal Care, you've been pretty clear on your view and optimism that it will get better from here. The comparisons weren't a surprise. That was known. So, what was it in the quarter that ended up being a negative surprise? You said it was early in the quarter. Is there anything in particular you can call out that took you by surprise? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, I mean, I wouldn't say surprise so much as it was a little bit tougher situation in a couple markets, Brazil in particular. The category volume for diapers and bath tissue is probably down about 4%, at least in the measured from Nielsen. Category value is pretty flat from pricing. So, you don't see category consumption go negative in markets in diapers and bath very often, so that was probably a bit unusual. It reflects the, kind of, the tougher economic conditions in Brazil, I'd say. So that was probably one that we'll be facing this year. On the other hand, we pushed hard on price in January. Some retailers pushed back, so we had a little bit of volume hit on that front that picked up sequentially as the pricing went into the marketplace. And so, that gives us some confidence that through price and a little bit better volume in the back half of the year, we'll put a better result on the board in Brazil. China had more price competition in the quarter. We had a very strong fourth quarter with a big push on Singles Day and e-commerce. Had a strong January with some Chinese New Year stuff and I think some of the other competitors spent a little bit more aggressively. And we wanted to make sure we sustained our momentum, so we met competitive pricing where we needed to to make sure we kept our volume growth growing and had good double digit volume growth in China. And so, I expect that to continue as well. And if you look going forward in China, price cut competition kind of did heat up in the second half of the year, so our comps get a little easier on that as we roll into the back half of this year. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. And on Brazil, I guess, one would be, are you assuming that this kind of negative volume growth persists through the year? Is that part of the forecast at this point? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say we're still trying to figure out how much of it is household inventory destocking, or am I just buying smaller count packs? And is that part of it versus how much of it is, have I shifted into the category, am I consuming less? And so, I'd say, we're probably not modeling it to be as bad as it was in the first quarter, but we're not expecting a robust category growth story in Brazil this year. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just finally overall on demand in emerging markets, I did think it was interesting that K-C Professional actually looked pretty solid. And you hear sort of macro-wise, is it perhaps industrial production, things are getting better. So, any view on kind of the lag or the relationship between KCP being a leading indicator for where consumer demand ultimately goes? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I tell you, in North America, we had a strong quarter. We probably picked up some share. We had better execution, so the kind of 4%-ish growth that we saw in North America is probably ahead of category. And again, the shares aren't as robust and reliable as Nielsen, but what we have seen would say that we've picked up a little bit of share in North America. In developing and emerging markets, I think what you're seeing in addition to the underlying economic growth is a positive trend toward better workplace conditions. And so, better access to having towels and tissue in the workplace, more awareness of need for safety gear, and having the right gloves and glasses and ear protection, et cetera. And so, I think that's a trend that will continue as more and more companies are really held to the same worker safety standards. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with the Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, Tom. Good morning. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Bill. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, can you just talk about the pacing of the organic growth throughout the quarter both for you guys and the category? I know it's still really early, but how's April sort of shaping up? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Actually, I haven't seen a ton of data on April because I've been spending some time getting ready to explain the first quarter. But I would say the momentum throughout the first quarter, particularly in some of the key emerging markets, they had a stronger March than they started the year, and so that's a positive sign. I was just with a lot of our international teams recently at our brand week, and I would say everybody is expecting their results to improve as the year progresses, so. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And then just on the 9% emerging markets growth, what do you -- and this is probably an industry question also, but as the pricing rolls off, doesn't volume become a much bigger component of the sales algorithm? And what does that mean in terms of advertising spending and what you need to do when you shift from inflationary pricing to volume growth? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, no. Absolutely, volume growth and category penetration, category development is going to be a key part of it. And so we've continued to invest more in emerging markets, particularly as you're opening up new market areas. So, as we've gone into Africa and places like Kenya and Nigeria, you do wind up spending ahead of your sales value to develop the category. So, yeah, but again, I don't think it's going to be one that's going to shift our P&L in a dramatic way to achieve that. I mean, we are getting some efficiency and moving more to digital and getting some pretty good ROIs on that move as well. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And then just one quick last one on the gross margin outlook. How do you see it pacing throughout the year? And the reason I ask is I think you did sort of $30 million of commodity deflation this quarter. So, that's a little bit less than half at the midpoint of the full-year target. So, is that the way to kind of look at the gross margin outlook? And I know there's probably some currency puts and takes, as currency gets a little bit more favorable probably in the gross margin line in the back half. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I mean, Bill, that's probably a hard one to call just because there are such big, moving factors in it. It's going to be the combination of how does pricing commodity costs and currency hit in any particular quarter. So, I'd say we're pleased with the progress in the first quarter, and are looking forward to that continuing as the year progresses. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Hey. So, I want to go back to the top line acceleration expectations for the rest of this year. And you mentioned three drivers. Targeted growth initiatives, would love to understand what that means. Product innovations, is that to gain share or grow price or kind of more context about product innovations, if you can? And the last one is improved net realized revenues. And I'm trying to figure out how you do that one, especially if there's more competition in China in particular. It doesn't look like it abating in the U.S. If there's a little bit of a tougher consumer market in Brazil and in Latin America broadly. And I'm trying to understand how you're saying improved net realized revenues will drive a top line, but at the same time in the 2016 outlook, you say benefits from higher net selling prices are expected to be somewhat lower than prior assumptions. So, I'm trying to figure out what that difference means. So, those three buckets, but really more time obviously on the net realized revenue and what sounds like a contradiction in your strategy. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, well, let me come at a different way, Ali, and say, so if you look at diapers in China and Brazil, which were the two soft spots, and set those aside for a second and say, gosh, fem-care was up double-digits in D&E, adult care was up double-digits in D&E, baby wipes were up high single digits in D&E. So, really a continued strong performance of the trajectory that we've been on, pretty broadly based across lots of markets, behind good innovation, behind great marketing, behind good execution in market. And so, that's all going to continue. And so, I think on the China and Brazil question, we talked about those. So, China, underlying volume growth in diapers was good. The price competitiveness was tougher than maybe we expected going in. On the other hand, we're going to lap some \u2013 when that started in the second half of this year. And so, we'll see where it goes from here, but our expectation is that it's not going to get worse. And in Brazil, that's probably one where the categories have had some more challenges. And so, we have been aggressive on pushing price, given the currency transaction hit that's taken place there. And to the question of the contradiction, I mean, I don't think it's a \u2013 we're comparing to two different things. So, one was compared to our original guidance for the year. We're probably going to get a little less price than we thought because currency is a little bit less negative than we thought. So, the need to get prices is not as great. On the other hand, sequentially, we still are going to get year-on-year benefit from price as we roll through the year. So, we didn't get it all in January. We announced it during the quarter, and so we'll get some benefit as the year picks up, but not quite as much as we thought going into the year. So, we're just trying to provide you with those two perspective, versus the plan and versus prior year, to help you see it the same way that we're seeing it. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, what I'm trying to understand is then what gets better, right? So, pricing is one of the ways things get better, but you're going to be taking less than you expected, how does that get you out of the hole you're, right, that you are right now? And you can talk about it with or without soft spots in China and Brazil. I mean, there's a hole in the top line growth and I'm trying to find out \u2013 I'm trying to understand if it's not pricing, because that's going to be a little bit worse than you expected, what is it that you're changing, right? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the pricing comps are going to get better, so, I mean, some of the prices \u2013 so, in U.S. diapers, for example, we started a lot of the Huggies Snug & Dry price alignment in the second quarter. So, there was a first quarter comp there that was still negative. That will get \u2013 that comp will get easier in the second quarter and second half. China diapers, the pricing and competitive environment started to heat up as we rolled into the second half of last year. That comp gets easier as we roll into the back half of this year on the price front. So, the comps get a little easier on the pricing standpoint, and I think that first quarter was probably the low point for that. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But that's \u2013 so I apologize for this, but that's not new, right? You're saying just for take pricing, you were going to take pricing, the comps get easier. But you knew that and you're saying now you can't take as much pricing as you planned to at the start of the year, right? That's what the outlook statement says. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But you're also saying you're going to take pricing to offset the slower growth this quarter, which is clearly below your expectations. So, I'm just trying to figure out how to bridge that gap, right? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, no, Ali. I'm not saying, we're not going to take price to offset the slower growth this quarter. I think we are saying that we are going to take more price as the year progresses in markets where we've had that, but not quite as much as we thought going into the year. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay, so can \u2013 on another note, can you talk about the cost savings ramp-up that you had, looked pretty good for the quarter? What specifically are you seeing in terms of opportunity that allows you to ramp up the cost savings plan this year? Thanks. Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, we're happy with our FORCE cost savings in the first quarter. We delivered $95 million, and so that's a good start against our full-year target of $350 million in savings. The teams delivered across all three of the major areas that we look to, to drive cost savings, so negotiating material prices were very strong in the quarter, the global procurement team did a great job to start out the year. We \u2013 the progress in optimizing the cost of our products specifications, and we also got improvements in productivity waste within our supply chain and manufacturing operations. So good start to the year, happy with what we were able to deliver on FORCE. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks very much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Ali. Operator : Our next question will come from Stephen Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Hey, thanks. Maybe just following up on Ali's question on the top line there, not to belabor it, but you obviously talked \u2013 you talked about what's in your control, the innovation, the distribution gains. Can you just be a little bit more specific about what you're assuming from here sequentially on both the macro environment, stable, better, worse; as well as the competitive environment, stable, better, worse, versus what you saw in Q1? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Any particular geography you're interested in or just broadly? Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Well, broadly. And then I've got a drill-down question on China specifically. So I want to \u2013 but yeah, broadly. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : If you look at the macro environment, we put a lot of the assumptions in the guidance deck. But it's essentially, we're not assuming spot currency rates. We're assuming \u2013 we look at forwards, so we \u2013 the rates in our guidance probably aren't quite as favorable as what's in today's spot, but it's somewhere between where it was at the beginning of the year and where the spot rates are at this point in time. So if spot rates stay where they're at, there's probably more favorability on currency and maybe more risk on pricing. On commodities, pulp got a little better in this forecast than where it had been. In terms of underlying economic growth in individual markets, again, we continue to say relatively modest growth environment. We're not predicting a huge falloff or any other kind of economic crisis developing in a major market anywhere in the world at this point in time. Brazil is probably the one that we're watching most closely as obviously expecting slower category growth getting back to a \u2013 for them getting back to a flat organic growth number for the year will be the first priority given that they started out the quarter with negative 5% on diapers. In terms of the U.S., actually, we saw probably better growth in our business than the underlying category growth because we picked up share in a number of markets and consumers are still responsive to innovation. We saw private label shares flat to down in nearly every category that we're in, which is again another sign of health of the consumer for us, and are probably maybe more bullish on the outlook in North America at this point in time than maybe we would have been even at the beginning of the year. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And competitively, are you \u2013 is there any pockets of \u2013 where you're expecting more competition than what you've seen so far? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say China is probably one that has become more competitive. It's a terrific market. There's still great category growth. We're still expanding into more cities. The consumer is very responsive to innovation and it's worth investing in. The good news in China is that even though it's been more price-competitive, we've also been very aggressive in China on cost savings. So our gross margins in China have been stable or even a little bit better despite the price investment to stay competitive in those markets. So our team in China has done a terrific job of executing their plan and improving the shape of their P&L. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And in China specifically, we too had picked up on intra-quarter sort of intensity picking up, especially in fem-care, online, and especially in the value tier. But from your comments, this kind of confirms my fears that \u2013 sounds like it was a little bit more broad-based. Would you say it was more focused in one category, one price tier, one channel specifically, or is it \u2013 was it broad-based? And it sounds like you expect it to persist. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I would say for us, our fem-care business had a pretty strong quarter, probably a little bit less price sensitivity than we saw in diapers. We're probably not as well-developed on fem-care and e-commerce as we are in diapers. And certainly, e-comm was a more competitive marketplace, but then, yeah, that also drives pricing in your more traditional brick and mortar channels because everyone's got price transparency in what the deals are everywhere these days. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And last and I'll move on. But is \u2013 any comments you might have about the cadence of marketing spend throughout the year as you follow through on the new innovations that you called out? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we got a lot of launch activity coming. And so, I'd say our first quarter, we were, I think, down slightly year-on-year and up slightly from our prior year average. But we've got a lot of stuff coming in \u2013 launching in the second quarter in a lot of markets. So you probably will see it slightly higher, although again, it's not a big driver of our P&L. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Olivia. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. How are you? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Pretty good. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : In terms of the year, is there more innovation this year than in years past to provide \u2013 to help out that acceleration come along? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I don't know if we have a good way of measuring that. On the other hand, I feel really good about our innovation across a number of categories. And so we've got some terrific things coming on diapers in lots of markets, diapers and diaper pants. And that's going well. We've had a lot of innovation on baby wipes and have seen good responsiveness to that. Our fem-care team has great innovation coming. Adult care is launching innovation in lots of places. We had some good things happening on Consumer Tissue as well. Our K-C Professional team has had lots of new products in the market. So we've got a lot of things to talk about. And we were \u2013 I was just with a lot of our key customers in the U.S. at our \u2013 at the National Association of Chain Drug Stores Annual Meeting where you do one-on-ones with customers across all classes of trade that run drug departments. And our customers are pretty happy with the innovation that we've got coming and are pretty excited about pulling that into their retail environment. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Tom, that sounds great, but it doesn't sound like the innovation delta relative to years past is going to change materially. So if China is getting more competitive and price was clearly a bigger factor in Q1, and that's here to stay, and emerging markets are so much more challenging in Consumer Tissue that volume is actually taking a big step down, what drives that acceleration then as the year progresses? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'd say the underlying volume growth in China was very, very strong. Yeah, it was still strong double-digits in diapers and in fem-care. The pricing comps get easier because some of the pricing competitiveness started in the second half of last year. So I'm confident China is going to post another solid growth year, even though they started out in diapers a little slow due to the lapping or the rollover of the pricing initiatives. And as you look across our markets, Brazil, we talked about, had a little bit of a slow start. Expect that to pick up and close the gap. But we had good underlying performance in really most of our other markets, so I'm pretty confident in the team delivering the plan this year. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then on the diaper volume being flat in North America, obviously, it's hard to tell sometimes with the Nielsen data, but the Nielsen data did look fairly favorable, and typically, correct me if I'm wrong, some of the non-tracked channels, particularly online, does better than the tracked channels. So was there an inventory issue or were there just divergents in terms of trends in tracked versus non-tracked? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I mean, there had to be some inventory change in there because we picked up share. We were up 2 points sequentially and up a half a point year-over-year. Last year, we were selling in the Snug & Dry relaunch, so there could have been some effect of that. We had a strong fourth quarter, so there could have been some early January promotional buying that got shipped in December. But by and large, I'd say we look at our weekly consumption and we're pretty happy with the trends, and eventually, that shows up in volume. So I'm not too worried about that one. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks so much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Olivia. Operator : The next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, John. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, Tom. So, I guess as you think about Brazil, I guess, I understand why the trends at their current level really aren't \u2013 you expect a bounce-back. But I guess as I look at this, right, we look at the Latin-American pricing and the FX-driven pricing rolling off, where does the volume come from? Is it market share, right? Because birth rates aren't changing in that context. So as the volume improves sequentially, is it market share because U.S. brands are less uncompetitive from a pricing standpoint? Do consumers use more diapers, what have you? So does that question make sense? Why would the revenue get better as the volumes sort of need to catch up as you lose the FX-related pricing? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, maybe let's shift markets, John. And so we'll talk about Colombia, which has also had a big currency hit. Right? And it's not one that we usually talk about a lot because it's a relatively small market than the Indian market, but they had 20% organic growth last year, I think they were up 25% in the first quarter. And it's challenged, it's got some linkage to the oil trade, although not as much as others, but they've suffered from some of the same currency devaluation and have pulled through it. You look at Eastern Europe, what's going on in Russia and CIS. Big currency devaluation, strong price increases, some negative GDP, and yet, we're still seeing reasonably strong underlying volume growth and category demand. And so Brazil is a little bit of an outlier right now and we're trying to make sure we understand what's actually going on there from the consumer standpoint. On the tissue front, you saw in lots of markets this quarter, slight negative volume and positive price because we were pushing hard to get price in that market, especially because you're buying pulp in dollars and you've got a big transactional impact, and you've got to recover some of that to hold your P&L in shape. And that eventually will work its way through and you'll return to the more normal population-driven growth on Consumer Tissue, I think. But, yeah, I do believe that Brazil will get better, but it's probably going to be a challenging year there this year. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. So the way to think about that is maybe on the tissue side, the consumption gets whacked more by the pricing. Because on the diaper side, again, I guess it doesn't seem like it'd get hit that hard, but tissue is one where you feel like the actual pound consumption usage does get hit harder by the pricing. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's one that when you push pricing in a market like Brazil where there's a substantial amount of general trade, initially, they will push back. So January sales were soft as we pushed pricing and they said, no, thanks, and you take a volume hit. As we look at our shares in Brazil, we only have January and February, we don't have March data yet, but we were down about a point in diapers in the first two months, up a couple of points in fem-care and I think relatively flat in bath tissue. So I'd say not a big shift from a share standpoint despite the volume hit. And as March volumes were better, I would expect that we got a lot of that share back. And at the end of the day, you want to make sure you're holding or gaining share in those markets amid all the volatility of commodity and pricing changes. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, John. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could kind of delve into a little bit more detail in terms of the competitive environment in China. And you talked about increased promotional activity, and whether that increasing competitive pressures are from other national players or whether you're seeing that from the locally domiciled peers in the market? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I would say in China in particular, the toughest competition of late has been our two Japanese-based competitors, Kao and Unicharm. Obviously, the weaker yen last year helped them support that in a way. At least it didn't have as big of a negative impact on them relative to what was going on in the U.S. And so they've been more aggressive, Kao in particular. We've been gaining share, Kao has been gaining share, Unicharm has been losing share. And so there's been more competition in that direction. Huangong (39:03), we do run into at the low end of our business and the high end of their business, but I wouldn't say they've been the aggressor as much as the other multinational competitors. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you. That's very helpful. And then I think you mentioned earlier in the call about more of an increased propensity to spend in North America. One of the categories that had been challenged, I think, over the last few years has been Pull-Ups in particular, given that consumers haven't necessarily been placing their kids in Pull-Ups and keeping them in diapers when potty training. I know you talked about a new Pull-Up launch innovation coming to market later this year. I just wondered if you could kind of bridge that gap, and whether you're already seeing improving trends within that product category or whether you foresee that happening later in the year into next year. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we've actually \u2013 it was nice to see a good mid single-digit volume growth on our childcare business this quarter. And that was ahead of the product launch, which is rolling out literally as we speak. And so we're really excited about what this new product can do, and we hope we will see some category uptick as we roll into the summer season, which is typically a bit of a seasonal peak for Pull-Ups, and we'll see how that plays out over the second quarter and third quarter. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. The mid single digit volume growth was across childcare, though, right? So that was both diapers, as well as Pull-Ups, as opposed to Pull-Ups exclusively? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The \u2013 no, childcare was \u2013 we define it as essentially just Pull-Ups, GoodNites and Little Swimmers. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So diaper volume, we would measure separately. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And really, in that childcare space, it was really all driven by Pull-Ups. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Long term... Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So it was a little early in the first quarter (40:42) Little Swimmers volume. That's more of a second quarter and third quarter business. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Got it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, Tom. Thank you, guys, for the question. I feel like we're beating this up pretty good, but I do want to come back to Brazil real quick. You referenced the January-February data out of Nielsen. And when we look at that data, it shows your sales up 5% when it's lagging the category up plus 9$. Reflective of the 100 bps of share loss, it's still positive. So \u2013 and you sort of referenced (41:36), some retailer reaction. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: How much of the weakness in Brazil do you think was maybe just that, a bit of a destocking effect or retailer backlash? And you said you saw a pickup in March, at least from a shipment perspective. Can you give us a sense of sort of where you're running as you came out of the quarter? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : On the Nielsen data, as you know, it doesn't cover the traditional trade very effectively, and that's probably where we had more of the volume hit in the first part of the quarter. And that is the part where they will have more inventory swings. I know you hear that from other CPG folks as well. And so, in terms of as we exited the quarter, I don't know if I've got any specific data other than it was a nice, sequential uptick from where they've been running in the first two months. So, we'll see what the shares look like. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. So, you're seeing a little bit of improvement at the end of the quarter. North America maybe a little inventory shipment, so maybe that was subdued. So, some reason to believe it does get better on the forward. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Jason, I'm way more bullish than the rest of the guys on this call. I have a lot of reasons to believe actually. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, good. I'm glad. I'm glad. I hope it all plays out in the numbers on the forward. A question for ... Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : By the way, Jason, hope is not a strategy. So, we're going to make sure we deliver it. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right on, Tom. That's exactly what we love to hear. Quick question for Maria on the FX impact. The 20% number is a big number. It implies much more of a multiple on sales than we've seen in the past from a transaction hit. Just back of the envelope, it suggests that maybe the transaction that EBIT had on the sales was around a 29% margin versus 19% last year. Why the uptick on transactional leverage? Anything unique to be aware of? And as we think about the forward, I think on the last call, you had said sort of all-in, a 15% drag. Where does that number stand today based on sort of, at least, your currency assumption even if it's not on spot? Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. The relationship between the top line and the bottom line in terms of the currency hit depends on where the currencies are moving and, in particular, for this quarter, we had significant impacts in places like Eastern Europe, Russia, and in Latin America, Brazil. And given where the mix of the currency changes, the biggest currency impacts hit, that's what drove the bottom line impact to be a stronger multiple of the top line impact than what we're typically used to seeing. So, it's mostly mixed-driven. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And that 15% figure from last quarter? Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : 15% was the combined impact of currency, commodities pricing for the overall \u2013 the \u2013 Paul, remind me on the 15%. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, let me just build on that. So, yeah, we said last quarter approaching 15% for an all-in currency impact. As you see in the release, we said that translation impact is expected to be toward the low end of the 5% to 6% range. So, adding in a reasonable multiplier effect, it should be in the low double-digits of a drag for the year for currency. Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Just on the currency side. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Jason. Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Caroline. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Hi. I wonder if you can update us on the Poise Impressa product. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Sure. I would say, so far it's going quite well. And so, it was \u2013 Paul, what, a couple points of our growth in Depend in the quarter. So, we're up double-digits in the U.S. We would have been about 8% ex Impressa. So, it's having a meaningful impact. We were just with our retail customers at the Chain Drug Store Convention as I mentioned, and they were very, very bullish on what they're seeing so far. We're doing some work to kind of assess what we've learned since the launch, what price points work and how do we get even more impact and improve our mix at shelf. And so, we'll be making some adjustments on shelf position and promotion strategy as we roll through to help it go even a little bit faster, but so far so good. And obviously, this is one that will take a bit of time for consumer behavior to change, but it is an exciting solution for an issue that some women have and another approach for them to help them improve their quality of life. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. That actually gets to the second part of the question just on innovation in general. Would you say that, in general, you're premiumizing and getting pricing through mix when you innovate? It's a sort of broad-based question across all categories. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I would say that you want to try to create value from your innovation at whatever tier you innovate in. So, if you're innovating on something we're doing on Scott tissue, you want to also be able to create value for your consumer and for your business if you can. So it isn't \u2013 we are trying to premiumize where we can, but some of the things we're doing, we're launching more of a value-tiered diaper pant in many markets, but it's a better solution. It's a premium to other value-tiered diapers, but it's still aimed at the value consumer. And so, we are trying to make sure we're innovating at relevant price points across our product spectrum. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. And then just thinking about your pricing being flat overall for the company for the quarter and down in Europe/South Korea, up 5% in EM, flat in North America, I would have thought South Korea/Europe was a much smaller percent of the volume. And so net-net you might have had some benefit of pricing. Can you tell us how to think about that today and also going forward? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, sure. In our developed markets outside the U.S., so Western Europe, Central Europe, Korea, Australia, primarily, those are markets that are traditionally fairly challenging to get pricing in. Those are also markets where we do some hedging of our transactional currency exposure more regularly. And so, the need to get price to cover your transactional currency hits is also less than you would see in a market like Brazil or Russia. And so, I would say, yeah, we typically go into the year not expecting to get much price. If you do get revenue realization, it's going to be more through mix or innovation than through absolute list price change. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : But do you think that trick continues to trend down in those developed markets? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : In terms of price or volume, or... Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Price, price. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, no. I would say we don't expect to get much of any price realization this year. And in markets like Western Europe, you could see some price erosion as those markets are a little bit more competitive. South Korea, overall, is a very strong market for us. We had a terrific first quarter, had very strong volume growth. You continue to see some move to e-commerce in that market, and so that sometimes can result in a bit of a price drag as the channel shifts to that direction. But by and large, we're not seeing much price move up or down in the developed markets. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, just lastly on that, thank you so much, but if you think about e-commerce growing incredibly rapidly in, say, China and some of the Asian markets, I think that probably foreshadows what's going to happen more globally. Do you think net-net that is negative for pricing, online growth? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We are looking to see how e-commerce does scale. And it's certainly in a market like China, where it may be skipping a generation of retail development, you don't have as many retail channels developed in a lot of those markets, and you are seeing very dense population, very high smartphone penetration, and a much lower delivery cost to get that last mile delivery. But I think almost every retailer these days is looking at an online option, even if it's click and collect in their existing retail space. And so, I think what you are seeing is more price transparency, and so that probably has an effect on particularly retailers that have a high-low strategy. But I think we'll have to wait and see how e-com develops as more and more traditional retailers get in the game with click and collect and other things. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks so much. That's really helpful. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Caroline. Operator : Our next question is from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hi, good morning. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Javier. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hello. How are you? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Very well. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : I need a couple of clarifications on the pricing front. In the U.S., I've been trying to reconcile the commentary on volumes and market share and yet this low top line. Is it an issue of that the relaunch of the Huggies Snug & Dry has a lower price realization and you're seeing negative mix, or is it more that you spend a lot on the trade to push innovation and you didn't get the lift that you expected to get in North America? And I have another clarification in China. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Are you just talking about diapers, Javier? Because, overall, our North American volume was pretty good. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Diapers. Diapers. Diapers. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : I know. I understand the volume was pretty good. But I'm looking at diapers, and in general, say, diapers/Pull-Ups, say, training pants. Not just specifically diapers/child care. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, in diapers, we started the Snug & Dry relaunch last year in the second quarter. And that was with a price reduction to narrow the gap and get the value right relative to some of the other more value-oriented products that are in the market. And so, we've seen, since that, a better performing product at a more attractive price, consistent progress on volume and share. First quarter was a little light on volume. We talked a little bit what might have caused that. Some of that could have been sell-in last year for the Snug & Dry launch; some of it could have been a little stronger December. But by and large, as we look over since the relaunch, our volumes are up nicely, our share is improving. Long way to go; we're not declaring victory on that front. On the Pull-Ups front, if you look out over multiple quarters, we really realigned some of our pack count price architecture in the second half of last year, saw some better performance in the category late in the year. Still not where we want it to be. Had a better start to the year in the first quarter but the Pull-Up's strongest selling season is typically second and third quarter. We've got a new product out and we'll see how it goes in the second and third quarter, but we're optimistic about it. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Just to clarify, again, in North America. Did you increase trade spending and that's why that contributed to the lack of pricing in the quarter or not? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And so, whether it's a trade or list price reduction, to us, we would treat it the same way. It's a price reduction. And so, on Snug & Dry, we did reduce the price into our retail partners to narrow the value gap. I don't know if we did it through a trade promotion allowance or through a list price change, but the effect is the same in the marketplace. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. And finally, on China, again, just one clarification. So, the competition seems to be more on the (54:27) because this is where Kao and Unicharm operates and also in the main cities in China. Procter just launched \u2013 or launched a few quarters ago a premium diaper. Could you comment whether that launch somehow had a negative impact on your own trends and whether that diaper is priced below yours, if you can clarify that? I mean, The Premium Pampers that Procter had been working on? Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I know Procter has launched -- again, I would say we would see more aggressive competition from some of our other multinational competitors and we try to make sure we're competitive on pricing across the spectrum of products in the same tier that we're in. So, we want to make sure our super premium products are competitive with other super premium and our premium would be the same. Now, in any given retailer on any given day, could somebody have a hot promotional price? They could. You try to look at it over a marketplace in a period of time. And so, again, I would say we're competing, as is Procter, as is Unicharm, as is Kao, and it's sort of normal business. But a lot going on in China and it's a big, attractive market that I think a lot of people are investing in. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : But the one thing that \u2013 the push by Kao, (56:06) and Unicharm had been for a long time. So, basically the one new additional pressure seems to be coming from Procter. Now is when it coincides with your commentary about price competition, about your commentary about volumes being up, organic sales being lagging by a lot, volume. So, that incremental launch and pressure from Procter is what is making the market more competitive, because Procter still is much larger than you are in China in the diaper category. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, Javier, I guess I don't see it that way, but you'll have a chance to ask the P&G guys on their call in a little bit. And I would actually say I think the weaker yen gave the Japanese competitors a little bit more headroom to price competitively. There are some other things around free trade zone and imported product that benefited them over a short term. That's sort of closing off now. But there are some other things in that marketplace caused price to be a little bit more competitive in the first quarter, and we'll see what Procter has to say about it, next week sometime. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Yeah. We will ask. Thank you very much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Hey, sorry. Didn't expect to get back in. Just one last lingering question on Brazil was just the degree which you're saying trade down or some of the, like, local players gaining some share, is that kind of you're accounting for volume declines in the market? Is that a dynamic you're seeing there at all or not really? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I wouldn't say the local players gained share. I took a quick look at the share coming in. We were down about a point on diapers, and I think Procter was the one that was up, Paul. But I don't remember looking at it in diapers for the first two months. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Pretty flattish. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Pretty flattish, yeah. And so, not a lot of big movement. And then on fem-care, we were up, like, 2.5 points in the Jan-Feb shares. But there's more national players there. So, I wouldn't say -- we are watching for that, though. Are they trading down even within our business within tier? And so, I think we are seeing a little bit more what we would call Tier 2 or the more value-oriented product mix shifting a bit, which is another sign of the consumers under pressure in that market, but we'll continue to watch that and see how it plays out. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And that value-tiered diaper pant you mentioned, I'm sorry. Did you say which markets it was launching in or where or when? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : There's a bunch of markets that we're launching that in. So, really in a number of D&E markets across Latin America and Asia, in particular. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : All right, then. We appreciate all the questions today and we'll end with a closing comment or two from Tom. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, once again, we appreciate the interest in Kimberly-Clark. We've had good momentum, we've got a strong plan for 2016, and expect us to continue to deliver on our commitments. Thanks, again, for spending time with us this morning. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation.

It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Second Quarter Earnings Conference call. Here with us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, CFO; and Mike Azbell, VP and Controller. Now here's the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of second quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of forward-looking statements. We'll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. Let me start off with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up 3% with volume growth of 4%. We achieved significant cost savings, improved our margins and grew adjusted earnings per share. And we also increased cash flow, improved our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders. Now let's cover the details starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down 1% with a 4-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales rose 3% in the quarter. That included a 7% volume increase in North American consumer products and 5% organic growth in developing and emerging markets. Tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few moments. On profitability, second quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.3%, up 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 18%. That's up 100 basis points. Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund growth investments on our brands. Second quarter FORCE cost savings were $95 million. We have had strong performance on cost savings in the first half and we're now targeting $350 million to $400 million in FORCE cost savings for the full year. In addition, our organization restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities continued to be favorable, delivering $20 million of benefit, mostly from lower fiber costs. We expect full year deflation of $25 million to $125 million, which is broadly in line with our previous assumption. While currencies have improved since January, they remain a significant headwind year-over-year. The total earnings drag from currency was more than $0.15 per share in the second quarter, and we now expect the full-year drag on EPS to be at least 10%. On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53, up 9% year-on-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 5 points of that earnings growth. We expect the tax rate will be significantly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was strong at $860 million. That's up 11% year-on-year. On adjusted return on invested capital halfway through the year, we're up 100 basis points. So, we're on track to easily exceed our long-term goal of 20 basis points to 40 basis points of annual improvement. On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $0.5 billion. The full-year amount should be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion. This will be the sixth consecutive year that dividends and share repurchases will total at least $2 billion. Looking at the segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 5%. That included 6% growth in developing and emerging markets and 4% improvement in North America. Overall, Personal Care operating margins were healthy at 20%, although off 50 basis points year-on-year including significant currency headwinds. Moving on to Consumer Tissue. Organic sales were up 2%, led by 4% growth in North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 18.4% were up 110 basis points with the benefit of organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs. In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were up slightly, including 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by more than 1-point. K-C Professional operating margins were 18.6%. That's up 100 basis points year-on-year driven by cost savings. Before wrapping up, let me recap. We achieved growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share, we delivered significant cost savings, margin improvements and cash flow. And we continued to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Maria, good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our second quarter results and then I'll comment on our full-year outlook. So overall, we continue to deliver good financial results and we're executing well in a challenging environment. Starting with the second quarter, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales increased by 3%. We made progress on targeted growth initiatives and product innovations, and that helped us achieve volume growth of 4%. In our developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 5%. Let me comment specifically on some of our key growth markets. In Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care rose about 10% with both selling prices and volumes up year-on-year. While underlying category demand remains down in a tough economic environment, I'm encouraged by our second quarter results following a soft start to the year in the first quarter. Moving to China, our diaper volumes there continue to grow at strong double-digit rates in the quarter and our market positions remained healthy. Nonetheless, because of increased price competition, our organic sales fell high single-digits and that compared to a 30% growth comp last year. Competitive activity picked up during the quarter in China and we responded to protect our market share position and maintain our volume momentum. So I'm very bullish about our business in China. While the current pricing environment is dynamic, we have plans to continue to deliver strong volume growth with benefits from innovation, city expansion and category growth. Moving to Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers there rose more than 15%. Volumes were up at a double-digit rate led by Huggies in Russia. Selling prices were also up modestly as we've now lapped most of the increases that we took last year. Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our feminine care organic sales were up double-digits in the quarter, including strong performances in Latin America, and adult care organic sales were up high single-digits. For the full year, we're now targeting mid-single digit organic sales growth for our developing and emerging markets business. We've lowered our expectations for selling price increases, primarily due to an improved currency outlook in Latin America and Eastern Europe. We have also taken into account the dynamics in China and slowing economies in some parts of the world. I continue to be optimistic about our business in developing and emerging markets. Our market positions are generally improving, or holding steady in most of the key markets we compete in, and we've got lots of innovation coming to help drive our future growth. Now let's turn to our North American consumer businesses. Our teams there delivered another strong quarter with 7% volume growth and healthy market shares. Product innovations, great marketing programs and good retail execution continues to drive results across our portfolio. Promotion activity was also a little higher than average in the second quarter. Our adult care, child care and feminine care volumes each increased by about 10% including benefits from innovations on Poise and Depend, Pull-Ups and U by Kotex. Our Huggies diaper volumes rose mid-single digits and market shares improved by about a point as we continue to make progress following last year's Snug & Dry relaunch. Consumer Tissue volumes improved 6% with mid-to-high single-digit growth in the all categories led by Kleenex facial tissue. So overall, our brand positions are very healthy in North America. Through the first half of the year, market shares improved or were even with prior-year levels in seven of the eight consumer products categories in which we compete. So our volume comparisons will be more difficult in the back half of the year, but I'm encouraged by our execution and our momentum in North America. Moving beyond sales, I'm also encouraged that our teams around the world continue to manage our company with financial discipline. At this point in the year, our FORCE cost savings are tracking to an all-time high. Our adjusted operating margins and return on invested capital are both up 100 basis points, and cash flow has picked up significantly. And Maria has already highlighted our shareholder-friendly capital allocation. So these results demonstrate to me the continued strength of our business. So all-in-all, we've made progress in several areas in the first half of the year. While we've got opportunities to improve further, we're broadly on track with our plans for 2016. Now let's move to our outlook for the full year. On the top line, we expect that currencies will reduce sales by 4% to 5%. Our prior assumption was for a negative impact toward the low end of the 5% to 6% range. In terms of organic sales, we expect growth will be at the low end of our 3% to 5% target range. This assumes less benefits from selling price increases, primarily due to the improved currency outlook. Volume growth, which was 3% in the first half of the year, should drive the vast majority of our organic sales growth for the full year. On the bottom line, we continue to target adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.15. That's up 3% to 7% year-on-year despite an expected high-single digit drag from the combined impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices. Through six months we're on track relative to our full year earnings impact. That said, as Maria mentioned, the tax rate should be higher sequentially in the back half. We also continue to closely watch currency and commodity markets, competitive activity and economic conditions. So in summary, we continue to execute our global business plan strategies well. We expect to deliver on our financial targets again this year, and we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive long-term shareholder returns. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. I wanted to spend a little bit of time just on your top line and the guidance. You decided not to change the guidance. You just kind of pushed people to the lower end, but even to get to the lower end, one would have to expect a little bit of an acceleration going forward, especially because the comp gets a little bit tougher with the 5% organic sales growth. So I'm struggling again to figure out what exactly is going to get better that you anticipate to get to even the low end. I guess you could round there, but just really to get to the low end, feels like a little bit of a stretch given the comps that you have. So a little bit more detail there would be helpful to start. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think, to your point, the volume comps get tougher, but some of the pricing comps get easier in the back half. So some of the Chinese activity that we talked about, that started to accelerate in the back half of last year. And so we'll see that sort of bleed-off. And we've got a lot of innovation coming in the back half and we feel pretty good about the volume momentum in a lot of places, including North America. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So just go back to China in particular, recently you've been saying Brazil you expect a little bit of a bounce back, China still kind of being tough. Can you update us on those two markets in particular, because those seem to be a little bit of a fulcrum for your top line guidance going forward? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I mean, I think Brazil, if you look at it how the year has played out, it was a pretty start tough to the year with negative volume trends as we pushed pricing into the market. Second quarter the volume was positive in diapers and then a significant amount of price. We'd expect to see more volume in the back half, and so I'd say on \u2013 if you look at share positions in Brazil, we're up a couple points in fem care and have a good momentum there, and are down about 0.5 point in diapers and would be looking to close that gap in the back half of the year. In China, we're really expecting the birth rate to pick up as we'd expect to see a little bit more volume come there in the back half. Pricing has been more competitive than we'd anticipated, and we're expecting it's going to continue to be competitive in the back half of the year. And that's probably one of the shifts in our thinking from the first quarter when we talked last. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So on that, I mean, there's kind of a recurring theme throughout the release in your commentary about product mix being tough. I think it's the first time in many quarters that we've seen that promo being somewhat unfavorable in lots of regions. How much of that is centralized on China? It certainly doesn't seem that way. It feels like it's across the board. And how much of that I guess is consumers trading down versus competitive situation? And why do you think that gets better? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I mean, a lot of the negative mix in the quarter was actually in North America and it has a lot to do with large-count packs. And timing of promotional activity in some of the larger format retail was probably the biggest single driver of that, and that had more to do with, did we promote in the second quarter versus the first quarter or the third quarter last year, and we had a little heavier activity this year in the second quarter, and that's probably a part of it. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Ali. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Ali. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Wendy. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit more about China? And I guess my question is maybe bigger picture. It seems like in baby care, there's been tremendous downward pressure on pricing and lower price competition. But from other companies, we hear the opposite; that consumers are appealing to more premium-priced products. What's the difference with baby care? Do you think it lasts? Do you think there's something just structurally about the economics of the category that will keep it a category that's subject to consumers trading down as opposed to up? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean, actually the consumers are trading up in terms of product format. So if you look at the Tier-5 super-premium type products, those segments are still growing. And so the issue is you've got \u2013 it's one of the largest diaper markets in the world. It's probably one of the fastest-growing diaper markets in the world on unit volume, and so you've got us and a couple of big Japanese players and P&G all competing in that same space. And I know everybody thinks the other guy started the fight, but it's gotten more price competitive. And there's also a channel issue whereas we're \u2013 e-commerce is growing dramatically in that space and retailers are also trying to make sure they don't lose their share of that young family's market basket. And so there's a lot of competition and promotional activity and the manufacturers like us are certainly fully participating. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): But I'm trying to think of in the past in any other market where you've had so many players all trying to eke out their share of the market, and granted, the market is growing and that's great, but I'm just struggling to say why is it ever going to get any better from a pricing perspective now that you've had a whole bunch of companies invest in the market, et cetera, et cetera. I don't see what breaks the logjam, if you will. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we say in the short-term, we're not projecting it's going to get better. I mean, our comps get easier because some of this started in the fourth quarter of last year. You can also see some of the \u2013 as the yen has strengthened, you would think that there's more pressure being put on some of the other international competitors that import. But I'd say in the short-term, we'd expect that China is going to be a pretty competitive market. It's more competitive than we anticipated. On the other hand, we've generated innovation and cost savings and our gross margins there are still attractive, and we think the growth is still a place that is worth investing in. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got it. And then just a quick follow up. I noticed, I think that you bought in your joint venture, the 50% you didn't own that Hindustan owned in India. And I know it's a tiny business but I was just curious what drove that decision? Was that them putting their interest to you or did you want to consolidate that interest, and how is that business for you? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, sure. It's a small deal. And so the deal hasn't happened yet. I think Hindustan was required under local Indian law to announce that they were considering a transaction. It's a business that we like and like most JVs over time eventually one partner buys it up and takes full control of it. I'd expect that's what will happen here. We're bullish on India long-term, and we'll expect that to happen at some point. But it won't have any significant impact on our financials this year for sure. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks so much. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Wendy. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Steve Powers, but okay. Thanks. Operator : Sorry. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : So given that the lower organic growth you now expect is attributable to lower pricing given the less adverse FX, does that mean you're now reversing some pricing that you already had in place? Are you adding promo, for example, in China, as you called out? Or is it more you not taking additional planned increases as the year progresses? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's probably \u2013 is there a D, all of the above, that I could choose on that one? So it really depends on the market. So there'll be place like Russia and Eastern Europe where we put price in place, it's in the first quarter. Some competitors didn't follow, so you spend some of it back competitively on trade. We have rolled back in a couple of markets those price increases, but then you also don't fund your trade temporary price reductions at the same level. So it doesn't have that much sequential \u2013 as much sequential impact on your net price realization. There are other markets where we had more increases planned for the back half of the year that we probably won't go forward with them given that currencies have eased and there's really no economic justification for it, and we don't think it would be likely to be accepted in the marketplace. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That helps. And then I guess in order for things to get better in the back half, given the more adverse volume comparisons you called out, it seems like you're betting a lot on new innovation benefits to carry you through and push that acceleration. Can you help us with where you expect to see the biggest impacts of H2 innovation, whether by geography or category? I'm sure it's broad-based, but just some directional help would be useful. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, sure. I mean we've got a lot happening in diaper pants and open diapering in a number of our key markets and that will roll market-by-market in the back half. We've got a pretty good lineup of feminine care product innovation coming across the globe, as well. And so you're seeing that fem care, I think we've had, what, Paul, four, five quarters in a row of double-digit emerging market growth and expect that continue to go. Diaper pants was a strong double-digit growth again in a lot of our key markets and expect that to continue. So good pipeline of activity which is essentially what we've been doing. Expect it to continue going forward Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And in North America, was the bigger push in Q2 versus H2? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, North America had a little easier comps versus last year. I think we were only up 2% in volume last year. We were up 5% in the back half, partly because of the Huggies Snug & Dry relaunch. But we've got really good momentum across the business. Tissue volumes were up 6% and expect to see good momentum as we roll through the back-to-school season with Kleenex and have some good things coming there, as well. In Pull-Ups with a double-digit volume growth was the first time we've seen that in a while, saw a little healthier category dynamics, as well, which is probably good innovation on our front, probably a little healthier consumer on the front, as well, and so we'd like to keep that going Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, and I'll pass it on after this, but just to clarify. Will it cost you as much in the back half to keep that momentum going? Because the promotion investment in Q2 to get that volume growth was pretty steep Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's a pretty good spend. I would say in a couple of places, it wasn't as much trade funding as it was either FSI coupons or digital coupons in a couple of categories. We also did a few more bonus pack promotions which affect \u2013 that gets shown as a reduction of sales. So you'd see our \u2013 more of that I would say was strategic, designed at driving innovation in specific categories as opposed to broad-scale trade funding that would tend to be viewed as negative price. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Thanks very much, guys. And just a couple of questions from me, just to go back to China. I mean I might have missed something here, but you're saying you've got good double-digit volume growth, but that overall, organic sales growth was kind of down a fair bit in the second quarter. I mean just mathematically, that suggests that you're saying pricing in China that's kind of negative to the order of mid-teens best and potentially worse than that. If you could comment at all on the kind of impact that's having on your gross margin position there, as kind of everyone's got different cost structures, I guess? And then in terms of Brazil, it's \u2013 clearly, you're gaining a lot of share in fem care there. But are you seeing underlying consumer recovery there as well? And should we sort of project that as the run rate for the rest of the year? Any insights would be very welcome. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Yeah, on China gross margin, I'd say the team there has done a great job of driving premium mix where we can and taking cost out as well. So our overall K-C International team did a phenomenal job of delivering on their FORCE cost savings, and China certainly was a part of that. And so our Chinese gross margins were down a bit, but nowhere near the level of price change in the market. And so, again, we'd be pretty happy that China's an investable business and with strong gross margin and OP margin potential. On the Brazilian consumer, you're still seeing some negative category trends, and the economic outlook is still not terrific. Although I was on the phone with our guy who runs Brazil last week, and I think there are some early signs of optimism perhaps there that they're things \u2013 expecting things to be a little bit better in 2017. And so we'll see. I think the economy's run on expectations and, hopefully, the Brazilian consumer will start to be a little bit more optimistic. And we'll see that translate into category growth. But I would expect for 2016, it's still going to be a challenging category story. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Thank you very much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Iain. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : You showed in Q2 your comfortable weighting volume growth over pricing broadly and that's true in China, but as a result for the whole business. And yeah, it starts \u2013 maybe this is hugely counter cultural versus some of your U.S. based peers. So I guess I'm wondering, do you see loyalty and repeat as bigger opportunities in your categories and especially some of those strategic areas you just identified versus what your peers are seeing? Or is there something \u2013 and as going forward, if commodities continue to go from being a tailwind to flat, maybe if they became a little bit more of a headwind, how would you sort of look at that commitment to building loyalty and repeat through maintaining the volume momentum? Thanks very much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Jonathan, it's kind of a deep philosophical question this morning. But my general approach to this and our general approach to it over the years is to say, you're really trying to develop loyal consumers that have a strong habit of using your brands to care for their families. And so you typically want to drive volume growth at least ahead of or tracking with your category that you're in, so that you're improving your volume market share and the percentage of time she's going to use your product to care for her family. And many of our products, particularly as you think about things like feminine care or bath tissue or facial tissue, you start using a product and you use it for your entire life if you find a solution that works for you. And so we typically generate price when there's big commodity swings or when there's big currency swings. Other than that, we tend to plan for core volume growth as the lever to drive our business forward. And I don't know enough about my competitors' strategies in-depth to know if that's that different from the way that I think about it, but \u2013 where you can mix through premiumization and through up \u2013 driving the consumer into a better performing product. That's also an important element of our strategy, but that's really about giving them good value for a product that works better in the end. So, again, I think where we can drive volume, that's I think the healthiest form of organic growth for us and our business model. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : That's real helpful. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks Jonathan. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to ask you again about mix in Personal Care emerging markets, because I believe you guys reported that as being negative just 1%, but it's the first time I can recall seeing mix as being a drag. And I mean \u2013 I just scrolled back, it's at least two years, probably longer. So if you could just talk a little bit about what happened there? Is it a timing issue? Something with innovation? But are you seeing any kind of less interest in the more premium end of the categories or is it necessarily trade down? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. There's nothing I would call out, but I'll let Paul give you a little bit more color if there's anything else you'd highlight there. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. Not real big swings, Lauren, as you mentioned, only down 1%. In a few markets, we actually had really strong growth in diapers in some of our smaller sizes. So, Newborn and then Size 1 and Size 2, which is actually good because we're getting the consumer into the category early on. But those, on average, are a little bit lower price points. So, that's probably the only thing to comment on that really moved the number. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. You got more diapers in the bag, and we sell it at the same price so you get negative mix. It's not necessarily trading down. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Right. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. That's great. Thank you. And then maybe for Maria, sneak attack with a question for Maria, but I wanted to talk a little bit about cost savings that... Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Maria loves questions, Lauren. Ask her all the questions you want. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: But going back a couple months now, maybe almost a year, Maria, you started talking about opportunities for kind of raising the company's game in terms of annual productivity. So, could you talk about any update to that line of thinking? I know you raised the targets for this year a bit, but just bigger picture, can those annual numbers go higher? And where are you on the process of identifying and starting to institutionalize that thought process? Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Our global supply chain team is up and running, and already having an impact on the organization. You see that in our year-to-date performance on FORCE cost savings. If you remember coming into the year, we set a strong expectation for ourselves for 2016. And given the strong performance there, we did raise our outlook for that to $350 million to $400 million. So, we're pleased with that. The add-on benefit that we're getting from the efforts in the global supply chain area are that we're also seeing improvements in inventory, and so we had a very strong cash flow quarter. Our inventory's improved and so, we're seeing good performance across the board. I continue to be optimistic about what we can do in this area. I think that the numbers that we had talked about are, over the long-term, to get to best-in-class, we'd be at a 4% to 5% cost of sales productivity number on an annual basis, and my outlook there hasn't changed. Now again, that's over the long-term, so I'm still bullish on the long-term and very pleased with the performance this year. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just one final thing, sorry, was on advertising spending, just brand investment in the quarter, kind of up, down, flat. Any change to the outlook on spending for the year? Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. There's really no change in advertising spend on a percent of net sales. What we do see is we do see a shift in some of our categories where we're doing more digital couponing versus advertising. And we're also seeing a stronger shift overall to digital advertising. On certain forms of digital couponing and promotions, they actually are a reduction to net sales. So, there's a little bit of a shift from advertising up to net sales, but in general, we would expect to see our advertising percent to sales be relatively consistent to what you saw last year. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Just trying... Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Olivia. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. How are you? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Pretty good. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good. In terms of the dynamics in D&E in Personal Care, just trying to understand your take, because the mix is down but you attributed to entry earlier into the category, Newborn, Size 1, Size 2, et cetera, which would suggest a positive feeling on the macros, but then also you're saying that the macros are challenging. So, can you just help us understand that a little bit better? And then in terms of pricing, specifically to North America in Personal Care, how much of this is promotion to support some of the new products that you have versus just normal defense against competition? How long do you expect that promotional activity to stay elevated at those levels? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. On the D&E mix question, I'd just say, some of the category fundamentals, things like Brazil, we've talked a little bit about where you're actually seeing category unit volumes decline by a couple of percent. That's probably been worse and stayed worse longer than we would have anticipated in our model for the year. And then you're seeing some other economies that are moving a little slower than would have been expected across Latin America, some parts of Eastern Europe as well are probably not quite as robust as they were in our plan at least going into the year. Having said that, in markets like China where you're expecting a little strong birth rate this year, a little uptick in the birth rate, we are investing in newborn and early category entrants to make sure we get more than our fair share of the new babies born in some of those key markets. And so you can see a little mix drag from that. It wasn't a big \u2013 a super big impact, but it was big enough to talk about, I guess. As it shifts to the U.S., we had a lot of good stuff happening with the Pull-Ups relaunch continuing through the second quarter, and had strong double digit growth there. Fem care really had a lot of good execution at retail happening, and that was a little bit more promotionally intense, on the other hand, we saw double digit volume growth, which was the first time we've seen that in our fem care business in a while. Adult care, we haven't lapped the Poise Impressa launch, so some of that was lapping that from last year, but we still had high single digit growth in our adult care business ex-Impressa. And have got more good innovation coming. The comps get a little tougher in the back half, but again a lot of it was some of the bonus pack activity, some of the digital coupon activity, as opposed to more trade funding. If anything, I'd say the trade funding levels were pretty consistent year on year. It was maybe more the other strategic marketing investment that was probably a little elevated this quarter. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks. That's very helpful. I hate to ask the question, but just given the divergence in trends in Brazil between fem care and diapers, do you think that Zika is playing any part in terms of the diaper demand? And then just the last question I have is on K-C Pro with volume down in North America, flattish in D&E. Can you talk about your view on these trends because I thought you picked up some share there last quarter, I know part of this reflects the Halyard comp issue, so can you just remind us when that anniversaries, and then your overall thoughts in K-C Pro? Thanks so much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, sure. On the Zika question, we don't really have a good read on that. Again, it's \u2013 we're still in the kind of nine-month gestation period where before you would really I think see any impact from that on the birthrate. And so I don't know if some of the negative category trends we're seeing in Brazil have something to do with the source of the data, our consumers shifting into some less-measured outlets doing more in the down the trade, lower quality products, are some middle class becoming poorer, and not able to afford even the basics. And so I think we're still trying to figure out what's happening with the category. I wouldn't blame much of it on Zika at this stage at least from what we can tell on the data. On the K-C P question, I would say we were happy with some of the emerging market growth on K-C P kind of mid-single-digit and probably a little slower in some of the developed markets in Europe and North America. The Halyard stuff is kind of burning off. The supply agreement, I think, officially wraps up at the end of this year, and we may continue to supply each other after that at some level, but we'd expected that there was going to be a spike last year and it would probably burn off this year and that's kind of playing out. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Olivia. Operator : Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Caroline. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. Hi. It's Caroline Levy with CLSA. But thank you. I just wanted to ask to clarify, in China when you're talking about pricing being down \u2013 high \u2013 call it 15%, whatever it is, roughly around there. That does not include the impact of exchange rates, that's not the dollar number; right? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. That's correct Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Yeah, I thought so. Thank you. I'm wondering if we could just talk a little bit about Mexico because I think the underlying business in that JV was very strong. What would the equity income have been without the currency translation? Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : It would have been up pretty nicely. The peso is down something like 15% year-on-year, so they certainly would have been up. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : 15%. And they would have had some transactional impact as well, because they buy a lot of their raw materials in dollars, as well. So, no, they had a very solid quarter and good performance in local currency. And given the currency impact didn't translate into as many dollars, but they're still executing well on the local market. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Got it. Thank you. And then could we talk a little longer term about the adult diaper opportunity and Impressa. What you've learned so far with Impressa? And I think adults is still a relatively small percentage of your volume globally. If we could just talk about that for a few minutes it would be helpful. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, sure. The adult care category is probably what, about a billion-dollar category in the U.S., and for us it's a much smaller business outside the U.S. So there's a huge growth opportunity, and there's some international markets where it is, if you looked at Japan for example today, which we don't participate in to any great extent that the adult care category is larger than the diaper category there. And so there's a huge opportunity as the population ages in many parts of the world, and we've got, our adult care business grew high single digits in developing and emerging markets. We also had pretty good performance in Korea. We've got a good adult care business in Australia. So there's pockets where we've seen this start to play out. But we've still got a long way to go to really fully take advantage of the opportunity, I think, and so our teams are focused on getting there as quickly as we can. In terms of Impressa. Again, I would say, so far so good. It's probably maybe a little slower than expected, but it's also one in a new product form. It's sometimes hard to predict how quickly consumers will change habits. So, so far retailers are happy with the movement and we're continuing to look at generating trial. Our repeat rates are where we would hope for. So now it's really focusing on how do we make sure we're getting trial rates up where we'd like them to be and some of that's retail execution, some of that's making sure we're getting the marketing messaging out. And so our teams are continuing to check and adjust, and continue to drive this exciting opportunity for us. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. Thank you. I have one last question, which is more technical. Just given the strong volume in Personal Care in the second quarter, is some of that going to take away from the third quarter? I know you've said you've got a lot of activity, but should we assume, though, that some of it did shift out of the third quarter? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It shouldn't. I mean, we typically don't load customers, and so our stuff is kind of bulky and expensive to ship and store, and so customers typically want it to flow right to the selling floor. And so we should continue to expect consistent results as we move from quarter to quarter. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you so much. That's great. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Caroline. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): I just wanted to follow up on the emerging market diaper business, in particular. There's been a lot of discussion this morning in terms of the mix impact and the smaller sized diapers selling better. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about usage trends among those consumers and the extent to which they've maybe increased their usage of daily diaper use and that sort of \u2013 in that context. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I would say overall as a general statement, as GDP per capita increases, a consumer's ability to participate in a category increases. So we see diaper rate usage per day go up as they get more income. And so in a market like China, in the higher income households, you'd see diaper usage per day very similar to any other developed market. And in the more rural markets in China where you have very low GDP, you might see consumers that either use no diapers at all or maybe use one a day just for overnight. And so I think that's when you \u2013 as you think about like a market like Brazil, if you've got a middle class consumer who became poor, she may still use diapers for overnight, but she may not use them as frequently during the day. And so I think that's the \u2013 in terms of how the economics of the category play out, that's \u2013 I think that's true across a number of consumer staple spaces. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just one last question. In terms of \u2013 I know there's been discussion about the lower or I guess a reduced need to take pricing in emerging markets given what we've seen with FX rates. But I was just wondering if you could kind of talk about the retail reception to some of the price increases that you've already put through, and the extent to which you've maybe received pushback or whether that continues to be more of a seamless endeavor? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Erin, it depends on the geography. I'd say in markets where they have \u2013 where it's pretty common to have big currency swings, if you looked at most \u2013 a number of Latin American markets or Eastern European markets, the retailers are quite understanding of the need for their imported products to \u2013 or products with imported raw materials to take price. I mean, that's kind of the way the market works. And in probably more established markets, if you looked at like Australia and the U.K. and maybe even China, the currencies have been pretty stable and they've had a history of being pretty stable and you don't typically get a big price-driven impact from currency. For example, the sterling has weakened a bit since the Brexit announcement. I don't think you're going to see a lot of suppliers taking price in the U.K. because A, it wasn't that big of a swing, and B, it's a challenge to push price through with a U.K. retailer, if that color gives you some context for the way you think about it. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Yes. That's very helpful. Thank you so much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Erin. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Iain. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Thanks very much for allowing me a follow-up. Hey, I just wondered if we could talk... Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're here all morning, so we just keep taking questions until you guys get done asking them so... Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): All right. We'll keep going until we get bored. Just on fem care, you guys are doing very well in that category clearly; so is a certain Swedish competitor of yours. I mean, you know, clearly there's got to be some fairly chunky share data that's (46:47) going on in that category. I'm guessing both of your U.S.-based competitors. I just wondered if you're seeing anything changing in the competitive intensity within fem care markets in which you participate, or if those guys are just kind of happy to sit there and seemingly lose a little bit of share each quarter and not really do much about it? Thanks very much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, fem care is probably one of the more complex competitive sets out there. And so it is a bit more regional. So in the U.S., we would have P&G would be the largest competitor and then the Edgewell spinoff of Energizer, which includes some of the Playtex and former J&J brands would also be a player. And a pretty competitive market, but I'd say pretty normal competitive. And we've been driving innovation. We've been doing a lot with our U by Kotex brand to really make sure we've got the right offer at the right price point and bringing news to the marketplace. If you go to a market like Brazil, you'll see P&G is there, but you'll also see some other local players. CMPC is there, actually a Chilean player, along with others. And we're the \u2013 we've just recently become the share leader in Brazil and continue to have good momentum there with our Intimus by Kotex brand there. You go to China, and you've got some of the Japanese players are in that market as well as Hainan, which is a local Chinese company. Hainan is probably the overall share leader in that market, and we're a relatively small player. We're growing nicely, but we're only about a 4% share in China. And so it's really probably one of the most diverse competitive maps. We've got a pretty consistent positioning aimed at a 18- to 24-year-old young woman as she's adopting her brand choice and really trying to drive innovation against that target around the world and have been pretty successful at it. But it \u2013 you do have to adapt it to win in each local market. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Okay. But there's nothing changing in the kind of competitive landscape, and we shouldn't expect any reaction I guess from the kind of pretty impressive share gains that you guys have pumped out for a few quarters now? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So far we've got plenty of competition every day. They want to eat our lunch, and we want to get our fair share of the category. And so far we've been holding our own. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Great. Thanks very much, guys. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Iain. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Be careful in offering your time to answer all of our questions. Let me chat about one thing... Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : At some point you guys will hang up, and it will just be us here. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So obviously we've been all \u2013 I think with good reason \u2013 asking about this year's 3% to 5% organic sales growth number and can you make the bottom end and kind of what's going to drive that, but I wanted to pull up a little bit and to add to that your view of 3% to 5% target kind of for the long term. We've sort of been started to be accustomed I guess since 2012 with the 4% to 5% type organic sales growth number mostly because of the opening up of the emerging markets for you, but before that it was kind of 3% to 4%, right? And so I think we've all forgotten about that timeframe, and wanted to get a sense from you about whether there's anything that you're seeing that would suggest that we're kind of back about thinking of 3% to 5% as a real range as opposed to it always being at the high end of the range kind of like you're seeing perhaps for his year? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, no. That's a really good question, Ali, and I think it's one that we think about a lot. I think we've been at 3% to 5% for a long, long time. If you go back far enough, you're probably right that at various points, we were struggling to get into the low end of the range, and then the last several years with explosion in emerging markets we've been bumping up against the high end of the range. We've even had some investors suggesting whether we take it up to 4% to 6%, and we said 3% to 5% still feels about the right range long term. You think categories are probably growing 3% to 4% typically if you looked at the kind of long term trend data. So if you deliver that with some innovation and some share growth, you can see your way clear to playing in the full space of that range. You look at some more recent trends where emerging market economies are under a little bit more pressure like they are today when the categories are going negative in Brazil. That affects that model a little bit, and I still think 3% to 5% is the right range. And in any given year, we're going to be aiming to be solidly in the middle of that. There will be times where we'll over-deliver either through our good category tailwinds or great execution, and there might be times where we're at the lower end of it because if either one of those things doesn't go the right way. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And so it's a great \u2013 thank you. The way you're saying category growth 3% to 4% kind of over long term, so you have to gain share to get above that. Obviously given some of the woes of P&G, it feels like it might have been \u2013 and frankly some of the Japanese players being behind the eight ball as well in technology \u2013 it feels like it was recently a relatively \u2013 easy is never the right word, right? But a less contentious time to gain share perhaps? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Do we get any credit for good execution, Ali? Or no? Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: No. I want to be careful with that. Absolutely you guys should get full credit on excellent execution, but certainly on a relative basis. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, okay. I think I feel better. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But do you think \u2013 for example P&G is stepping up. Are you seeing any changes there? Do you think the competitive atmosphere gets that much tougher because you do have a big heavyweight who is clearly struggling? And so maybe share gains are tougher going forward? Not that you're executing any worse, but share gains are just tougher going forward. Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think that's a fair question, and if you looked at China, for example, you'd say we kind of pioneered the super-premium segment five years or six years ago. Lots of other players are piling in there, and they're doing it at maybe narrower premiums than we were initially structuring. And so that's made that segment a little bit more competitive certainly, and the Japanese competitors as well as P&G are playing. We were probably a little bit early at e-commerce and had more than our fair share of that space. Lots of other players are piling in there, and e-commerce is more competitive now than it was several years ago. So, yeah, it's certainly a competitive environment, especially when categories aren't growing as fast and everybody is still trying to get their volume growth. That makes for a little bit more competitive environment, and so you're probably seeing some of that, I'm sure, in our results. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks, Ali. Operator : Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hello. Good morning. Just had a quick question on North American pricing, because I know you're lapping your pricing, your price cuts. But it looks like P&G is lowering pricing on Luvs now. So just wanted to get your take on how do you see the pricing environment and what your outlook is going forward? Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think what we've seen with P&G in the diaper category in North America is, they've probably have been doing a lot of stuff with couponing. They're also spending pretty aggressively on advertising on both Pampers and Luvs. And so it's been a pretty strong competitive response not unanticipated and that may have been why some of our competitive activity was a little higher in the second quarter was making sure we continue to show the value on Huggies. The good news is we still saw mid-single-digit volume gains on Huggies and we're up a share point. So we feel like we're on the right track and anticipate that P&G will continue to be competitive. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. So it sounds like a common theme coming out of the line of questioning and prepared remarks and responses has been that, slower for longer up top is probably the right base case scenario, particularly with the pricing lever out of the equation in the near term. In that context, can we turn into the belly of the P&L and talk a bit more about the cost saves and the inflation/deflation? This was \u2013 certainly the deflationary benefit has subsided into this quarter following the abatement last quarter, as well. And I think this is the first time in a while that fiber's been the primary driver. So two questions there. First, is it fair to say that the benefits of lower oil derivatives is now behind you? And secondly, what are you seeing in the pulp markets? Because certainly what we're seeing shows a market that's been a bit more stubborn than we would have hoped. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, okay. So Maria and I will probably tag team this one. And on the pulp market I'd say our outlook has moderated very modestly quarter to quarter. I think we were looking at $820 to $850 eucalyptus in April, we're $840 to $860 eucalyptus now, so it's slightly worse. Current spot prices are slightly higher than that. We've probably bought a little bit more spot tonnage in some of the Northern softwood area which gives us a little bit more benefit because there has been some good availability at attractive prices there. So, again, I would say not too much change sequentially in our view of the pulp market and we'll see what happens going forward. I don't know, Maria, if you want to comment on any oil-based materials and how you're seeing that. Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, on the oil-based materials, remember that we're buying oil-based derivatives where, on the polymer front, we were actually seeing inflation versus deflation. So the benefit that you would typically expect for us to get from the lower price of oil isn't as much given the derivatives that we purchased there. I'll follow up just on your line of questioning beyond the commodity situation where we did narrow the range of expectations for the year. I commented on the FORCE cost savings earlier and the fact that we increased our outlook for that in 2016 with good performance there. And then as you go down the P&L, on the cost side we still continue to invest in some areas, particularly selling and research. And we still have some local inflation on our general cost base that you can see come through in the numbers. But overall, we continue to focus aggressively on cost structure and to look to take money out of areas that add less value and to invest in areas that have more value and help us achieve the top line growth. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. That's helpful. One quick follow-up. I'm not trying to push you into any sort of foreshadowing of your guidance for next year, but as you step back and look at your productivity pipeline, how does it look and how are you feeling about cost savings as we go beyond this year? Maria Henry - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I don't think we want to get into guidance. As I mentioned, I'm very happy with what the teams are delivering on the FORCE cost savings this year. We are optimistic about what we can achieve in that area over the long-term. We also continue to have a lot of opportunities to invest in our business as well. So we'll have to see how all of that comes together as we close out this year and look at next year. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very good. Thank you very much. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jason. Operator : And at this time, we have no other questioners in the queue. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : All right. Well, we will conclude the call. We appreciate all the questions, and we'll let Tom wrap up with a closing comment. Thomas J. Falk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Once again, a solid performance, really aiming against continuing to deliver long-term shareholder value and we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thanks very much. Paul J. Alexander - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines, and thank you for joining us this morning.",

At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, CFO; and Mike Azbell, our Controller. Here's the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of third quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish as usual with Q&A. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. Now, as a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements this morning. Please see the risk factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We'll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now I'll turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were basically even year-on-year including 3% growth in developing and emerging markets. We achieved significant cost savings and margin improvement, and we increased cash flow, improved capital efficiency and returned cash to shareholders. Now let's cover the details starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down about 3% including a currency drag of more than 2%. Tom will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes. On profitability, third quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.4%, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 18.2%. That's up 70 basis points. I'm encouraged that our teams continue to improve the shape of the P&L even in a tougher environment. Our cost savings initiatives continue to be a key driver of margin improvement. Third quarter FORCE cost savings were $105 million, equal to our previous all-time record. Through nine months, FORCE savings are $295 million. So we're tracking to be toward the high end of our $350 to $400 million full year target. In addition, our organization restructuring generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were favorable by $10 million mostly due to lower fiber costs. Full year deflation should be toward the middle of our previous estimate of $25 million to $125 million. On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.52, up 1% year-on-year. That's despite a currency drag of more than $0.10 per share, mostly from transaction effects. Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $948 million. That's up 12% year-on-year driven by improved working capital. On adjusted return on invested capital, through nine months, we're up 100 basis points, nicely ahead of our long-term goal of 20 basis points to 40 basis points of annual improvement. On capital allocation, third quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $550 million. The full year amount should be approximately $2.1 billion. Moving on to segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales rose more than 1%. That includes 4% growth in developing and emerging markets. Overall Personal Care operating margins were healthy at 19.8%, although off 70 basis points year-on-year including significant currency headwinds. Moving to Consumer Tissue. Organic sales fell 2%, driven by results in North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 18.1% were up 110 basis points with benefits from cost savings and lower input costs. In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were down 1%. That included a 1-point impact from lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.6%. That's up 100 basis points year-on-year, driven by higher net selling prices and cost savings. So, overall, it was a soft quarter on the top line and a tough environment. Nonetheless, we delivered significant cost savings, improved our margins and increased cash flow. We also continue to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. I'll now turn it over to Tom. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our third quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook. So starting with the third quarter. As Maria mentioned, our organic sales were about even year-on-year and reflected a more challenging economic and competitive environment. Regardless of the reasons, I'm not satisfied with our top line results, and I expect some improvement in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, I am broadly encouraged with our current market share positions, so we are holding up well in a challenging environment. Let me give you some details about our third quarter sales and market conditions. In developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 3%. That compares to a 5% growth in the second quarter as performance improved in China but softened in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. In Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care fell about 5% year-on-year due to lower volumes. Results were impacted by competitive promotion activity and an even more difficult economic environment. We'll be launching more innovation in the next few quarters in Brazil while making sure we protect our brands appropriately. In Argentina, while selling prices were up in the quarter, volumes were down low double-digits in a challenging consumer environment. Category volumes are declining at about the same rate as our volume decline and have worsened over the last three months. Now looking outside of Latin America. In Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers increased 10% due to broad-based volume growth on Huggies across the region. In China, organic sales in diapers were up low single-digits as strong volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices. Looking ahead in China, we expect our volume momentum will continue with benefits from innovation and healthy category demand. We also expect the promotion environment will remain competitive. So, overall, while organic growth in developing and emerging markets has moderated this year, that's mostly because of slower economic growth which has resulted in weaker category dynamics. In most of our key businesses, our market positions are generally improving or holding steady. I'm still very optimistic about our long-term growth prospects in developing and emerging markets because of the inherent category penetration opportunities that exist in this part of the world. Nonetheless, given the volatility in the current environment, it's difficult to predict when growth will pick back up significantly. Turning to our North American consumer businesses. Consumer Tissue volumes were down about 3%. The comparison included impacts from changes in the timing of promotional shipments and 6% growth in the year ago period. Year-to-date, our volumes were up 2% in this business. That's a good indicator of our ongoing performance. And in addition, our market shares in the third quarter were relatively stable sequentially. So we expect better volume performance going forward compared to the third quarter. Personal Care volumes in North America were up 1% compared to 10% growth last year. Child care volumes were up double-digits. They benefited from innovation and category growth. Baby wipes volumes were also up double-digits in the quarter. Volumes were off low single-digits in diapers and mid single-digits in adult care. Both businesses had double-digit growth last year with increased promotion shipments and benefits from innovation. Competitive promotion activity has also picked up somewhat recently particularly in adult care. Our market shares in the third quarter were stable in diapers and down about one point in adult care. In terms of overall market shares in North America, our positions remain healthy. Shares improved or were even with prior year levels in seven of eight consumer categories on a year-to-date basis and in five of eight categories in the third quarter. Now moving beyond sales. We continue to manage with financial discipline. As Maria highlighted, we delivered another quarter of strong performance on cost savings, margins, return on invested capital and cash generation while we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. These results demonstrate the continued strength of our business. Now moving on to our outlook. We remain optimistic about our long-term future. We'll continue to execute our innovation, marketing and targeted growth initiatives to grow our brands. We'll also continue to focus on improving the profitability and efficiency of our businesses. In terms of our guidance for full year 2016, we expect organic sales growth of 2%. Our previous target was 3%. On the bottom line, we're targeting full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.05. Compared to our previous guidance, we've lowered the top end of the range by $0.10 per share to reflect our new organic sales estimate. Our earnings outlook represents year-on-year growth of 3% to 5% which I believe is pretty solid performance in this environment. Over the next three months, we'll continue to assess the environment and finalize our detailed operating plans for 2017. And as we always do, we'll provide our guidance for the coming year in January when we announce year end earnings. So, in summary, while it's been a more difficult environment to generate top line growth this year, we are competing effectively and our market positions are in good shape. We're managing the company with financial discipline, and we continue to execute our global business plan strategies for long-term success and shareholder return. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: David, are you there? We're ready for questions. Operator : Our first question is going to come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Can you guys hear me? Tom? Paul? Hello? Operator : Our question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hey, Lauren, sorry. We had a little mix up there. Good morning. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's okay. No problem. Good morning. Okay. So first I actually wanted to ask about was margin performance. Because you showed really good margin expansion in both Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional even with volumes down. So is that \u2013 is it because those businesses have been where most of the cost savings activity is, or is it more about the deflation? Because I think that's sort of an interesting dynamic to think about as we look into next year. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I mean if you looked at the cost savings by segment, I mean it was relatively proportionate. In fact, if anything, Personal Care was probably a little heavier than Consumer Tissue. I think, yeah, you probably had more of the competitive pricing activity particularly in some of the emerging markets like China affecting Personal Care. On the deflation side, it was only $10 million, but again most of it was pulp. So that did benefit Consumer Tissue probably a little bit more than Personal Care. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And when you think about the margin expansion and the productivity work, a couple places in your remarks you mentioned the promotional environment. And I think I'm having a hard time getting my arms around how much of the sort of deceleration that you've seen, not just this year but also with it getting more severe this quarter, would you tie to the competitive environment, the macro environment and whether or not you think there'll be a need or desire to spend back more to kind of continue to protect market share positions or to stimulate category growth? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: That's sort of the interesting question I think in this environment. So I'd say there's question that there's less growth out there in lots of places. And so Latin America was certainly the case where categories have gone negative in a big way due to some of the economic impacts in places like Argentina. And there's just as many people chasing that growth, and so that does make it more competitive. On the other hand, you saw some pretty heavy up activity in some markets in the third quarter that probably won't repeat at the same level. There was some very heavy adult care couponing in North America, for example, by both of our primary competitors, think $14 digital coupons on a $13 item. We don't see that reoccurring. It was probably more of a one-time thing. We also saw some pretty big easy ups couponing, more like a $5 coupon, which is way above normal in that market as they were launching a new product. And again, don't see that continuing at that level. And we didn't match those offers, but that does affect your short-term volume while that stuff is working its way through the market. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So is that the expectation because particularly it sounds like in North America Personal Care, some of the promotional activity, you're assuming it doesn't continue and that helps with the \u2013 because you need things to accelerate pretty significantly Q4 versus Q3 to do the 2% for the full year total company. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I think it's not as big a step up as you think. There are a lot of things across the company that should be better sequentially. So, if you looked at KCP, we had about a point drag from Halyard. That rolls off in the fourth quarter. Europe was also very weak in KCP which some of that was Brexit-related. That's gotten a little bit better sequentially. So we'll see how that plays out in the fourth quarter. If you looked at Consumer Tissue, there was more of a promotion timing 2Q versus 3Q. If you look at our year-to-date volume, we're up a couple percent on Consumer Tissue in North America and expect to have a solid fourth quarter versus the negative trend in the third quarter. So there's a number of things that were probably working against us in the third quarter that will make the comparison a little easier in the fourth quarter. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And so it sounds like particularly KCP and Consumer Tissue \u2013 those are the two? I think the Personal Care comparisons was something a lot of people had their arms around, but the volume seeming shortfall in KCP and Consumer Tissue is what really felt pretty surprising. So it feels like (16:21) Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: (16:21) the biggest miss versus our plan as well. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you so much. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Lauren. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Good morning, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. I guess I want to pick up first on Lauren's line of questioning, maybe from a slightly different angle. As you think about your categories and the growth trajectory in the markets which you operate, do you have a sense of how fast they were growing last year and how fast they're growing now? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, we don't measure that on a quarterly basis. We would have said last year the global growth rate was somewhere in the 3% to 4% range. We haven't redone the math for this year, but I would say it's going to be at the low end or even slightly lower than the low end if I would have to guess. Just when you see places like Argentina where we were tracking mid single negative category growth through the first half of the year and saw kind of double-digit category dips in the third quarter. That and Brazil would be the other big market that's had kind of mid single-digit negative category growth comps. Those would be things that would be a bigger drag on that standpoint. Yeah, that and the pricing environment of China's probably the other one that's a big shift this year relative to what it would have been doing last year. And so we'll take another look at it going into 2017, but I would guess it's certainly lower than the 3% to 4% we had estimated last year Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. And speaking of going into 2017, I know you're not in a position to give guidance, so I wouldn't ask you to at this point in time. But we can't help thinking about the business's trajectory into next year with some of the fading momentum we have right now. It sounds like year-to-date, I think FX all-ins have been about a 12% headwind. Consuming sort of flatlined in the fourth quarter. You're looking at sort of maybe a 9-point drag to EPS this year. Implying constant currency despite the top line decel, you're still posting pretty solid double-digit earnings growth. Assuming rates hold, FX abates next year, what are some of the offsets that would prevent you from kind of getting to that sort of constant currency growth rate whether it be sort of inflation, what you see on that front, clearly slower end markets, et cetera? Any thoughts you can provide on that front would be appreciated. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, again, you're right. We'll give you a more complete look in January. And I'd say for us, it tends to start with our outlook on category growth and some of that's driven by what's going on economically, and so we're \u2013 every economic forecast it seems like that we look at lately has a lower GDP growth number than the one before it. So we're not expecting a snapback from category growth. In terms of \u2013 as we tend to look at the combination of input price, currency and commodity costs, that probably still net feels like a drag year-on-year going into 2017. On the other hand, we've also seen lots of big swings between now and the end of the year. And so we have a number of other events happening between the presidential election and two more Fed meetings. So we'll see where we're at on that calculus a couple of months from now. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very good. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it on. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hi, Wendy. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I just had a quick question sort of following up on Brazil specifically. Because when we visited you guys down there, I mean we were struck by just how strong the business was. You specifically chosen to play in the higher tiers, and historically, and even last year when things were tough economically you guys were still doing really, really well. So I'm just wondering if you can just speak a little bit more about Brazil. Is it specifically the diaper business or is it the fem care business more that has deteriorated and is it \u2013 do you really think it is the economic situation? Are people trading down? Are they doing without? Or is it just the competitive environment? If you can speak to the pricing environment specifically that would be great. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, sure. That's an important market. So it's \u2013 I would say if there was all of the above on your \u2013 as an option for your answer, I'd probably \u2013 it's probably a little bit of all of those things but let me go category by category. So fem care for us, doing really well. I think we're up three share points year-to-date. Category leadership, have launched a bunch of innovation, and I'd say that business looks pretty solid overall. Diapers has been more competitive. Category has been weaker. There has been some trade down in the category as well, and you see more tier two growth. It's been more competitive. And so from a pricing standpoint, promotion standpoint, there's been more activity on that front as well. And I think within that, you've seen some either it's household inventory destocking or it's moms who were using four or five diapers a day now using three or four diapers a day. And so you take one diaper a day out of the equation, and that's a double-digit category decline for that consumer. And so I think it takes a little while to get household panel data to really understand what's driving that. But it's gone on for long enough now, it's probably more than just inventory destocking where you're actually seeing the middle class in some cases in Brazil are getting poorer and having to make tough trade-offs. You'd certainly see the same kind of phenomenon in Argentina as well as they're moving to more of a market-based economy in some areas that's putting big pressure on consumer wallet. So while we're still well positioned and bullish long-term on Brazil, it's been a tough economic environment. You've had a recession for the second year in a row. Their overall outlook is not that optimistic. And economies run on expectations and until people start to believe it's going to get better, it's not going to snap back probably. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And if you see people really trading down or even not leaving the category but just using less, I mean would you contemplate a more aggressive pricing action there to sort of spur consumption? Or are you still happy to play at the relative premium end and you want to preserve that position? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: And then in Brazil, we have a very strong tier two business. So we are \u2013 we actually are continuing to drive that and are benefiting in that area. But net-net if the whole category is down, it has been \u2013 it hasn't been enough to stimulate the consumer to use more at this point anyway. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then just ballpark, I know you don't break out advertising as a percentage of sales on a quarterly basis. But of the sort of roughly high 3%s, 4%, I mean this year, are we trending kind of at that same level. Or has there been any change, up or down for you? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: No, I think year-to-date, we're almost right on. As a percent of sales, it's 3.8% or 3.9%, something like that. So very little movement. And I think the thing that you don't see is that we're probably doing more digital couponing which shows up as a reduction of net sales, which can factor into our price column of our analysis of change in sales. But there's been more competitive couponing activity as well. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. Okay. Thank you so much. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Wendy. Operator : Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hey, Caroline. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. Thank you. Hi. I'd like to ask for a little more explanation of what you think is going on in China. Our surveys there are not \u2013 I guess the retailers and distributors are not really talking about price discounting, but you're obviously seeing it. So I'm just wondering if you can talk by channel where the pricing pressure is coming from and maybe even by competitor? Just trying to understand what's going on. And I don't know if you have any more specifics on the volume growth. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I mean the volume growth for us was very strong, particularly in newborn, and we're expecting and seeing a stronger birth rate in China that was back end loaded this year. And it's really across all classes of trade. We tend to look at modern retail baby superstores and then e-commerce as our, sites that we have data and insight into, and we're doing well and growing strong double-digits in both \u2013 in all of those categories. In terms of the pricing, I think, again, that's a place where it's one of the fastest growing markets in the world, and you're seeing lots of competitors chasing it. So the two Japanese competitors as well as P&G are all very aggressive, and it's probably one of those things, Caroline, where everyone thinks the other guy started the price war, but we're all trying to drive our business in that market. And our shares are pretty stable overall, and we've got good innovation in the market and more coming. And so we feel pretty good about our position in that market. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : So, yeah, just on that innovation, do you have different product by channel? So, for example, for online, would you have different innovation? And what's been driving the growth this year? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: No, I mean it's a pretty similar product lineup. You may have different pack counts or pack sizes by channel. And for us, as we said, newborn has been a strong driver this year, but our premium lineup is continuing to do well in China overall, tier five, which we would call it. But our top-of-the-line Huggies products are doing well in China. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Just last question, do you see this persisting, this competitive environment? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I don't think it's going to get any easier any time soon because China is one of the best growth opportunities available in the world right now, and I think it's going to be the biggest consumer market at some point in time in just about every category. And everyone's trying to build a position there, and we're certainly among them. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you so much. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Caroline. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hey, Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I'm not sure I'm getting a very clear picture about the split of the slowdown between competition and just the economy around the world. So I know it's tough to tell, but is it 50-50? Is it 60-40? How should we think about splitting that? Because going forward, between competition and economic slowdown, we obviously try to figure out which one of those is going to get better. But maybe start with kind of what's the split here? Is it P&G and the Japanese companies we've heard them before, just like you just said a second ago getting super aggressive in China? Is it economic slowdown? Can you just give us some more quantification of which one is really driving it? Because it sure feels like, in my editorial comment, it sure feels like since basically Q4 last year, we've been hearing, look, China's just a one-time thing. It was single day. And then we heard, oh no, people are getting more aggressive in China, but it's really because it's VAT issue. And then now it doesn't sound like it's that benign. And then similarly, in the U.S. and in Latin America, we kept thinking, look, things are okay, things are okay, and things will slow down quite dramatically. So I'm still trying to unearth this economics versus kind of competition. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, that's fair, Ali. So, if I were to give it to you regionally, I'd say in Latin America, it's probably more category decline than competitive activity. Although, when the category is declining, you do still have more competitive activity as everyone is trying to hang on to their share of the business. In China, it's more competitive activity. The categories are fine. The birth rate is fine. In China, you're seeing good underlying category growth on a unit volume standpoint. In North America, honestly, on a year-to-date basis, we're fine. We had a tougher third quarter. We had tougher comps for sure in a lot of areas because of some of the launch activity last year. But if I looked at Consumer Tissue in North America which had a negative comp, it had more to do with we had a little heavier promotional schedule in the second quarter where we had great volume growth than we did in the third quarter where we went backwards. We're expecting to finish with a strong fourth quarter, and that business is on track from a share perspective. Europe \u2013 Eastern Europe \u2013 I'd say Western Europe and the U.K. was pretty weak overall economically. Some of the reaction to the Brexit vote, you had a lot of people that didn't want to hold inventory for a while and had fairly weak growth in both the consumer and the KCP side. Eastern Europe is essentially fine. It's competitive, about like normal. Categories are performing reasonably well. So it is more of a region-by-region assessment. You do have some of both factors in both places. But I don't know if that helps you understand it better, but that's probably how I would break it down for you. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: No, it certainly helps. And to tie that a little bit to your share position, so healthy shares on average, not \u2013 it sounds like when you're saying not, not losing share. So should we expect your competitors to deliver kind of zeros organic sales growth, or are there things that you think may make the category be growing faster than you're growing, e.g., tough compares or what have you. Because it just \u2013 it feels like a lot of this is \u2013 if you're not losing share, everyone else is going to have to be feeling some pain as well. Is that a fair assessment? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Well, we'll find out I guess this week. So \u2013 but that would be my assessment. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I mean I think, Ali, I would just add it's probably better to look at results through nine months. As Tom said, there was a lot of noise in the third quarter, and I think if you look at through nine months, that's probably a better reflection of how we're doing. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then the last thing I just want to throw in again on this topic is kind of almost what I started with in terms of how should we \u2013 why should we expect this getting better? I mean it feels like competition is not going away yet. I don't know if you guys are seeing anything that suggests the macroeconomic situation in Latin America or whatever is getting better. You hear from Walmart that they're going to have to put in more private label to fight all the (31:50) in the U.S. It just feels like there's more brewing here that may make it tougher before it gets better and wanted to just get your reaction, given you guys see many more things than we do. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I mean, I would agree with the statement that it's not going to get better quickly. I don't expect a snapback here. On the other hand, there are some green shoots in some places. I'm encouraged by the volume growth in China, the birth rate in China. We've got lots of good innovation coming in lots of places. I look at our fem care business, for example, where we've seen share growth in the vast majority of the categories that we compete in around the world, and there's consumers still responding to innovation. We still got good growth opportunities for adult care overall. And it's a little bit more competitive in North America, but we've seen good growth outside North America. And so, while there's \u2013 maybe we're going through a tougher economic period of time. I do think in the long-term, there's still lots of room for category penetration here. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, as usual. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Ali. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Yeah, I may have missed a bit. Can you talk a bit more about what drove the Tissue mix \u2013 or sorry, Tissue miss in North America? I know you cited the promotional timing shifts into Q2, but that should have been foreseeable. So I'm just trying \u2013 I'm trying to figure out where the miss versus your own expectations resided? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I mean it's one that, again, we didn't give you guys quarterly guidance, but it was one that we expected to do a little bit better in the third quarter than we did. Some of it was our primary competitor in North America probably did a better job of executing against the Olympics promotions, and while we had activity, it didn't compare at the same level. And so we'll have a little stronger program in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, we did have a very strong second quarter. And last year, our comps were tougher. So it made it look worse than maybe it would. If you looked at it on a year-to-date basis, it looks fairly similar. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then if I can drill into Russia, you seem pleased with the Eastern European trends in general. But if I just triangulate it, it seems like Russia is a little bit softer than what I would have expected based on your commentary coming out of Q2. Can you just expand on that a little bit? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I mean, overall, I mean it was up double-digits in the quarter across Russia, Ukraine, CIS which would be what we would all bucket into those categories. And I'd say, Russia and CIS are probably performing the best. Ukraine is maybe less negative than it was in the past, but that's still an economy that is under quite a bit of stress with everything else that's going on in that market. But overall, I'd say our Russian business is on track for the year with our expectations. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. And then lastly if I could. I know you don't expect a snapback, but to the questions earlier, the Q4 outlook implied in the full year guidance does feel like somewhat of a snapback to more or less normal. Is all of that Consumer Tissue renormalizing, or should we expect sequential improvement in both Personal Care and Tissue. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I mean, it's one that I think to hit our revised full year guidance, we only need, Paul, what, about a point of growth in the fourth quarter... Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: ...versus zero in the third quarter. So it's not a huge uptick to be able to round (35:23) the 2% growth for the year. So it's one that, again, I think that's doable across a number of places. But overall, I would expect the ones that were off the most in the third quarter will have the biggest opportunity to close the gap. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia tong with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Tom, first question is just when you characterize your market shares as sort of broadly healthy and you're broadly encouraged by them, are you talking about dollar share or volume share? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: We typically look at dollar share. We look at both. But the one that we probably focus more on is dollar share. So when you hear us talk about it externally, it's typically dollar share. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Because when you talk about specific categories, you talk a lot about volume. And when I look across Nielsen data it looks like a couple of the categories you are sort of trending downwards particularly in some of the developed markets, U.S., for example. And then a couple of the emerging markets so just wanted to clarify that. And then also, going into Q4 and also into 2017, when you think about what's driving that improvement, is it coming primarily from volume or \u2013 and what do you think about mix in price and roles that they play in terms of driving that organic sales acceleration? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I would expect that the sequential improvement will be mostly volume based particularly in North America. I don't expect to see any big pricing improvements. There's no major price increases that are happening in any of the categories. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And then just can you update us on your view of sort of what the industry is growing at in your categories? More so for the medium-term rather than the very short- or long-term and has there been any change in terms of what you think the industry will grow at. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, so we had commented on that a little earlier. Typically, our long-term outlook has had the categories growing 3% to 4%. And we haven't remeasured that for what we think actually happened in 2016 or what we think might happen in 2017, and we'll give you another look at that when we give you guidance in January. My guess is that it had slowed down just because of the category declines that we've seen in Latin America as well as the pricing activity that we've seen in China. Those two together would probably \u2013 those are all large markets and would definitely bring down the category growth rates a bit. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Olivia. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Good morning. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you, guys. Good morning. I just want to ask about the cash flow. The last time, I mean, excellent cash flow performance. And I'm wondering two things. The last time you spent at this rate on CapEx which you lowered for the full year, it was back in 2009 when obviously there were some very different macro dynamics. And I guess with a very strong cash flow performance, is that something we should expect going forward? What are your sort of priorities for allocation with this outperformance? And does that signal anything about your expectations for structural growth? Because I think in prior periods, it probably did. Thank you. Maria Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Sure. We did have really strong cash flow in the quarter as you saw, and we had really good performance in working capital particularly in reducing inventories. And that came through to help our cash flow numbers. In terms of CapEx, we do expect that we'll be below our original guidance that we gave coming into the year. But that is driven by a couple of things. First, we have had really strong productivity this year and you see that showing up in our FORCE cost savings as one of the levers that we use to drive that. And we also do have slower volume and sales growth than we expected coming into the year. And so we're very rigorous on what we spend capital on and making sure that we're matching up the timing of when we're putting assets in the ground with our expectations and with slower volume growth this year, our capital is lower than we expected. This is an area that we continue to drive. You know that we've set up a global supply chain organization last year, and that organization is partnering with the finance organization and the operating teams are continuing to drive added rigor into our capital process. And so we're not changing our long-term expectation there, but we are incredibly rigorous on that. And we'll flex the CapEx spend with the needs of the business. I wouldn't take it as a signal for anything else other than just where we are as a company this year. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask specifically about China and the growth, the organic sales that you cited with regards to diapers, seem to be an improvement. How much maybe was that driven by the just overall category demand as opposed to innovation? And then more broadly with regards to innovations across the categories that you compete in, I guess in light of the tough macro backdrop as well as intense competitive activity, do you see your innovation skewing either more to the premium or the value end or has that not really shifted in light of what's going on? Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, those are good questions. And so I mean, if we look at China today, the birth rate is definitely helping. And we expect more live births this year. And it could be as much as 7% more live births in 2016 than there was in 2015. You're still seeing GDP per capita go up in China so more consumers have more money to spend in categories like ours, which helps. We're continuing to drive our city expansion, so we're in now 130 cities where we started the year at 115. And so we've got more geography to cover as well which is fueling our growth. And we continue to launch innovation. And so we've been driving some improved newborn products, and that has really helped drive a lot of our near-term volume growth. But we've also \u2013 we're also driving diaper pants hard across a number of tiers both mainline and premium tiers. And so I think there's a combination of those factors has really helped our volume growth this year. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): And then with regards to innovation more broadly I guess across the categories in which you play where that kind of maybe \u2013 if that's skewing one way or the other? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: China tends to skew a bit premium. The golden baby phenomena is alive and well in China, and Chinese moms and dads invest a lot in their child and hopefully children as they go to more than a one child policy. And we tend to see the best for baby as a strong pull for our business in China. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. And then in a more competitive or I guess challenging economic environment like Brazil, would that still skew more premium or would that be more balanced or skewed maybe to value? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, Brazil you are seeing a bit more trade down, more growth in the lower tier products. There still is a segment of the consumer that has money to spend and will pay more for best for baby, so you've got to balance your innovation across those tiers. But you are seeing more emphasis on the value equation in markets like Brazil and Argentina. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you very much. That's helpful. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Erin. Operator : Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hello, Iain. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Thanks very much. Hi there. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions from me. I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about the pricing environment in Chinese diaper? I know you have touched on it, but I seem to recall at the second quarter stage you talked about it being down about mid teens year-on-year. I was just wondering if that was a sort of similar level in the third quarter. And also I think in some kind of other infant channels. We've seen some destocking in the C2C channel. I just wondered if there were any signs of that there? And then moving on to Tissue, really high level, but your comp in the Q4 is a couple of points tougher than your comp in the Q3 yet you're talking about an improvement despite that. Any color you can give onto the drivers of this a bit more on whether you think there's a risk that lower input costs from pulp coming down does translate into a tougher pricing environment would be great. Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Okay. On China pricing and \u2013 broadly, I would say the market got a little bit more competitive in Q3 than in Q2. And so again, you saw lots of innovation, lots of good global competitors trying to drive their business. And the Chinese consumer is the beneficiary of that for sure. I wouldn't say we've seen any significant destocking impacts in any of our businesses. I mean we have a pretty big e-comm presence in China, and that business tends to be relative for us at least, relatively efficient low inventory. And it flows pretty directly to the consumer. So again, China \u2013 good growing competitive market. We're competing well, and we feel pretty good about our position there. On the Tissue comps, I mean again, we had a weaker promotional calendar in the third quarter as it turned out than we needed, and we expect to have a stronger quarter going into the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter is also typically a little bit better facial tissue quarter, so we'll see how cold and flu shapes up. And on the pulp question, at the levels of pulp chains that we're seeing, I wouldn't expect that to have much impact on pricing. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Thank you very much. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Iain. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Tom. (46:32). Hey, can you just talk a bit more about the timing of the promotional activity? Because it seems like you probably were planning on some promotions in the back half of the year, and they didn't come through. So how does that happen I guess is the first question. I think it was Cottonelle and Huggies and Diva had like a really good back half last year. And so you have to lap it again, I think this year. And then a couple follow-ups. The fourth quarter year guide to get to 2% is between 1.5% organic and 5% organic. So, if I heard you right, you kind of think it's going to be the low end of that 1.5% to 5%. Is that fair? And then the last one is just on the SG&A leverage which was great. Can you just talk about what's driving the SG&A growing substantially lower than sales and how sustainable that is? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Okay. You've got a pretty eclectic list there, Bill. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I know. I wanted to get them all in. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, on the Tissue growth, some of it is timing of promotions and when they ship. I think overall we had a pretty good promotional calendar. On the other hand, we probably underestimated the impact of front-of-ad circular Olympic stuff and how much lift that would provide to a primary competitor. So, in some cases, we had the promotion, we just didn't get as much of it as we thought we were going to get. And that obviously has lapped, and we'll expect a little stronger performance going into the fourth quarter. And so we feel pretty good about the lineup we've got, and again, year-to-date, we feel like the Tissue business in North America is at or ahead of its plan. So we're comfortable with what we're doing on that front. The fourth quarter comps, essentially I would say is that to get to the low end of our guidance, we only need to deliver one. So to put that in perspective, I wouldn't say I was predicting that, and we'll see what it looks like when we post it in January. As you guys know, I'd rather give you guys annual guidance anyway, and this is the one quarter of the year where I have to give you quarterly guidance, otherwise I'd just rather talk about where we're going from an annual plan and not manage the business quarter-to-quarter. SG&A growth. We are maybe Maria, you want to comment on that, because we are really trying to make sure we're focused on controlling that element of our P&L that we can control. Maria Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Sure. We also have some currency FX when you look on the face of the P&L and SG&A. If you unpack that and look, locally, we actually have SG&A increases in some places, particularly in Personal Care where we continue to invest in our capabilities and building that business out in developing and emerging markets. We also operate in some high inflationary environment. And so again, when you strip the currency, we have increasing SG&A in some places because of inflation. But we balance it out. We continually look at our SG&A spend to make sure that we're directing as much of it toward growth-oriented initiatives and then have extreme rigor on the more discretionary non-growth oriented core SG&A spend. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, we have no further questioners in the queue. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: All right. Well, we appreciate all the questions, everyone, and we'll wrap up with a comment from Tom. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Well, once again, thank you all for spending some time with us this morning. We hope to deliver a little stronger performance in the fourth quarter, and thank you again for your support of Kimberly-Clark. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines, and thank you for joining us this morning.",

At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul J. Alexander: Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Here with us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, CFO. Here's the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with a review of our 2016 results, focusing on the full year. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish with Q&A. As usual we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. Now, as a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the risk factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We'll also be referring to adjusted results, which exclude certain items described in this morning\u2019s new release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now I'll turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks Paul good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start off with the headlines for our full year results. Sales and earnings for the year were consistent with our previous outlook. We achieved record cost savings and excellent margin improvement. We generated strong cash flow, improved capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders. Now let\u2019s take a look at the details of our results, starting with sales. Fourth quarter net sales were $4.5 billion with organic sales growth of 1%. Full year net sales of $18.2 billion were down 2% and included a 4 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales growth was about 2% for the full year in line with the guidance we provided back in October. On profitability we had very strong performance in 2016 and we expect to make more progress in 2017. Our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 37%. Full year gross margin was 36.6%, up 70 basis points year-on-year. Our adjusted operating margins was 18.9% in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year 18.4%, that\u2019s up 110 basis points. Adjusted operating profit for the year rose 4%, right in line with our original target of 2% to 5% growth. Our team has delivered record FORCE cost savings of $435 million for 2016. That was well above our initial target of at least $350 million coming into the year. Saving were 3.8% of our cost of sales, up nicely from 3.1% in 2015. I'm encouraged by the progress our business unit and supply chain teams are making on this front and I continue to believe there is long-term potential in this area. Our savings target for 2017 is at least $400 million. In the fourth quarter, we successfully completed our 2014 organization restructuring. We generated $70 million of saving in 2016, bringing the cumulative benefit to $140 million annually. I'm pleased that we were able to achieve the high end of our savings commitment one year ahead of plan. Commodities were $65 million benefit for the year. In 2017 we expect commodities to change from a positive to a negative for us. We're expecting a modestly inflationary environment and we're planning for cost inflation between $50 million and $200 million. Currency declines continue to impact our results in 2016. For the year the total earnings dragged from currency within the low double digit. The net impact of changes in currencies, commodities and net selling prices reduced our earnings by about 10% just above our original plan of a high single digit drag. In total, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.45 bringing the full year to $6.03, that was up 5% year-on-year and in line with our previous outlook of $5.95 to $6.05. Now turning to cash flow and capital efficiently. Cash provided by operations was $3.2 billion for the year, up 40% year-on-year and somewhat ahead of our plan. The increase was driven by improved working capital and lower pension contribution. We expect another year of strong cash generation in 2017. However, it's likely that our cash flow will be down a little bit, given our over-delivery in 2016 and our expectation for higher tax payments this year. We reduced primary working capital cash conversion cycle by two days in 2015 that was at the high end of our original improvement target of one day to two days. We're planning for a one day improvement in 2017. On adjusted return on invested capital we improved these metric 120 basis points. That's well above our long-term target of 20 basis points to 40 basis points. On capital allocation in 2016, we returned approximately $2.1 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends. That marked the sixth consecutive year that we\u2019ve returned at least $2 billion to our shareholders. In 2017, we plan to repurchase $800 million to $1 billion of Kimberly-Clark stock. In addition as mentioned in our news release we\u2019re increasing dividend in 2017 by 5.4%. This is our 45th consecutive annual increase in the dividends. Now let\u2019s take a look at the segment results for the year. In Personal Care organic sales rose 3%. That included 5% growth in developing and emerging market and 4% volume growth in North America. Personal Care operating margins were healthy at 20.5% even with last year. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were even with the prior year. Consumer Tissue operating margins were 18.7%, that\u2019s up 120 basis points, including benefits from cost savings and lower input costs. In K-C Professional, organic sales were up slightly with 5% growth in developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by more than 1%. We don't expect that drag to repeat in 2017. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.1% that was up 80 basis points with benefits from higher selling prices and cost savings. So to summarize, our full year top and bottom line results were consistent with our previous outlook. We delivered record high saving, improved our margins nicely and increased ROIC. We generated strong cash flow and continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks Maria and good morning everyone. In terms of our full year 2016 results, I\u2019ll focus my comments on organic sales on our market shares and current market conditions. Then I'll address our outlook for 2017. So starting with our results. As Maria just mentioned, organic sales were up about 2% for the year. In developing and emerging markets, we delivered 4% organic sales growth even though we were impacted by category declines in some markets and by price competition in China. Let's take a look at some of our key markets. In Eastern Europe organic sales in diapers increased by more than 15%. Results there were led by Huggies in Russia with double digit volume growth and 1 point of market share improvement. In China, organic sales in diapers were up low single digits as strong volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices. Our market share was pretty similar year-on-year in China. Looking ahead in the China market, we expect another year of significant volume growth. Category demand should remain strong and we have lots of innovation coming on Huggies including a new super premium diaper pants that we recently launched on Singles Day in November. Based on market trends in the last 2016 were cautiously optimistic that pricing in China will be less negative than 2017. Turning now to Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care were down slightly for the year. Category volumes fell throughout 2016 and competitive activity on diapers picked up in the second half of the year. Our market share for the year was down in Brazil 1 point diapers, but up 2 point in feminine care. We expect that market conditions will remain difficult in Brazil in 2017 particularly in the first half of the year. In Argentina, volumes in Personal Care were down high single digits and that\u2019s similar to the overall category. Conditions were more challenging in the backup of the year and we're continuing to closely watch the dynamics in this market. Our adult care and feminine care businesses in developing and emerging markets had very strong organic sales growth, double digits for adult care and high single digits for feminine care. In developed markets outside of North America, organic sales were even year-on-year. Moving now to North America, our consumer businesses achieved 3% volume growth and had excellent operating profit performance for the year. Overall, market shares were stable year-on-year in a pretty competitive environment overall. Looking at key categories in North America. In child care volumes were up high single digits with benefits from category growth and innovation on pull-ups training pants. Baby wipes volumes increased mid-single digits. On Huggies diapers volumes were down low-single digits while market shares were up about half a share point. In adult care, volumes rose mid-single digits aided by category growth and innovation on Poise and Depend. Then lastly in feminine care and in Consumer Tissue, volumes in both businesses were up low single digits. Moving to K-C Professional in North America our organic sales were up 2% and we think that\u2019s a little bit ahead of the market in that space. So overall while we experienced challenging category conditions in 2016, particularly in some of the developing and emerging markets, our market shares are broadly healthy and holding up well in this environment. Now moving beyond sales. I'm very encouraged with our performance on cost savings, margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. Results on these metrics were excellent and we\u2019re ahead of plan across the board and demonstrating the continued strength and great execution by our business teams. Finally we grew the bottom line by 5% and that\u2019s in line with our guidance for the year. Now moving onto our outlook for the coming year. In 2017 we\u2019ll continue to execute our global business plan strategies. Our teams will invest in innovation, marketing and targeted growth initiatives to keep our brands strong. We also continue to manage our Company with financial discipline, focusing on cost savings, cash flow and shareholder friendly capital allocation. In terms of our specific guidance, on the top line we\u2019re targeting organic sales growth of approximately 2% that\u2019s broadly in line with our assumption for overall market growth in 2017. But we're expecting only modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets. But we aren\u2019t expecting growth to pick back up significantly in 2017, we're still very optimistic about the long-term possibilities for us in these markets. Innovation continues to be an important part of our growth plans. In developing and emerging markets we've got a number of launches planned in diapers and diaper pants, feminine care and adult care. We also have a strong line up in North America. Near term activity includes upgrades on Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers, Goodnites Youth Pants and Depend underwear. We expect that organic sales growth will be higher in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half of the year and that\u2019s largely because of tougher comparisons in the first half of the year. On the bottom line we\u2019re targeting earnings per of $6.20 to $6.35 and that\u2019s up 3% to 5% compared to our adjusted results in 2016. We plan to achieve solid improvements in both growth and operating margins in 2017 and that\u2019s despite an expectation for a mid-to-high single digit drag on earnings on the combined impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices. Our outlook also includes a meaningful decline in equity income that's driven by the weaker Mexican peso, which impacts our earnings for K-C de Mexico. Recent spot rates for the peso have been down 15% or more compared to the average rate for 2016. In terms of capital allocation, you should expect us to continue to be shareholder friendly. We expect to allocate between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion to dividends and share repurchases in 2017. That's a higher amount than in 2016 and that\u2019s equivalent to 5% to 6% of our current market capitalization. So all in all, we remain focused on continuing to compete effectively in the near term as we execute our global business plans strategies for long term success and shareholder value creation. That wraps up our prepared remarks and now we\u2019ll begin to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Windy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : Good morning. Could you just talk about the pricing environment, your guidance, specifically for 2017, looks like it's almost entirely volume driven? I'm surprised a little bit not only with currency headwinds, but also with your expectation for higher commodity prices and innovation, why you're not expecting more benefit from price mix. Thanks. Thomas J. Falk: I think I would say, we\u2019re going to have some carry-over price drag in places like China. We still probably will get some additional positive price in markets like Brazil and Argentina, but we're not counting on a lot of price. In some of these markets the consumer has been pushed pretty hard and we just don't see of a big opportunity to take price. And even in markets like the U.K. where you\u2019ve had though the Brexit phenomena, we will try to take some small positive price increases, but we're not counting on a lot of that to drive our year in 2017. So I think while the currency hit isn't as big as it\u2019s been in the past, the commodities we're assuming that oil is up double digits and secondary fiber is up double digits. But some others like eucalyptus pulp is going to be pretty flat, but we\u2019d just say the net of that is we're not counting on a lot of price in 2017. Wendy Nicholson : Okay. But your innovation broadly speaking can we assume that that\u2019s for the most part on premium priced innovation or is it more just important to get the pricing right for the local consumer? Thomas J. Falk: I think. Both of those. We\u2019ve tend to try to innovate on the premium end. We want all of our innovation to be margin accretive where ever we can. In markets like Brazil though, we are making sure we\u2019re innovating on the low tier when the category is moving down into tier 2, you want to make sure you've got a good performing product and can make competitive claims. And so we are trying to make sure we're innovating where the consumer is moving toward. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. Terrific. Thank you very much. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks, Wendy. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey, so wanted to kind of inter relate two things. One is a marketing research and general expense being down to 70 basis points. Trying to get a better understanding what the driver of that was and if any that was adjustments in Q4 on spend i.e. decline. Linking that to where you're effectively expecting for 2017, which is kind of an acceleration for the past couple of quarters of organic sales growth after this kind of 2% level same for the year. And I get the sequencing you gave in the first half was a back half. But A; was it advertising spend that went down and how should we take that as we think about your expectation for acceleration for 2017 on the top line? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah so, I guess, the way I\u2019d come out that, I\u2019d say the marketing research general did not include advertising in that number so that would really be the cost of the marketers and any marketing research or other things. I would say if you just looked at the quarter there was probably some more timing things particularly on our R&D where the third quarter was a little heavier than the fourth quarter, which is a little unusual for us. But that why I probably look at the full year number to be more predictive, our advertising spend overall was pretty similar to the prior year fourth quarter, but down a little bit sequentially. So that\u2019s not that unusual. We continue to see shifts out of advertising into digital couponing and a lot of that cost gets captured between gross and net sales. So you don't really get good visibility of that. But as you think about the top line in 2017, the way I would come out at it is that we're calling a roughly 2%, that's roughly what we did in 2016 on average. 2016 was very front half loaded and the back half was fairly wide as you described and 2017 from a cost standpoint, you know have tougher comps in the front half and easier comps in the back half, so I think we\u2019re calling fairly similar overall to what we saw for the full year in 2016. Ali Dibadj : And then just the sequential improvement that you're seeing, your saying it\u2019s just basically from a cost perspective, right. I mean, the zero and the one this past couple of quarters getting up to 2 you're saying that really just look \u2013 the comparisons are easier for the back half and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to make up the plaque. Is that the right way to think about it? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, that\u2019s right way to think about it. Ali Dibadj : Then just on the commodity piece to it. You know I guess $50 million to $200 million of inflation. Are you basically saying, you're not going to be able to recover any of that? Is that the right way to think about because historically you've been able to recover 60%, 70% of commodity inflation, so it\u2019s just a different environment right now competitively that you just sounds like won't be able to recover any of that given the pricing you\u2019re suppose in for 2017? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, I wouldn't say any of it, it will be much more market specific, so in places like Brazil and Argentina where there's a lot of local market inflation, not necessarily even big commodity categories. You know that they will be taking price up in those markets. Will they recover all it? You know I think that\u2019s an open question. You are seeing more competitive activity in some of those markets. We still have some of the carryover drag from some of the Chinese price reductions that we experienced in 2016 that will be a drag in 2017. In markets like the U.K. or in or even in North America, the level of inflation that we're seeing, we may get some pricing in case KCP around secondary fiber where we\u2019ve got double digit price increases in secondary fiber. But I wouldn't expect to get much price on our other broad consumer categories just because the inflation level isn't that big relative to the size of those businesses. Ali Dibadj : Okay thanks. Thomas J. Falk: The other the other thing Ali is that we feel pretty good about our cost savings going forward. And so our ability to absorb a little bit of inflation, these are fairly low inflation numbers, relative to what we've seen in the past and generating cost savings in the $400 million in a year, it gives us the ability to recover some of that and be competitive in the marketplace. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : So I want to just carry on this conversation about pricing versus inflation. Is there something specific to your categories and kind of where they fall in the line of kind of consumer needs and willingness to trade down or pull back on usage, just limiting the ability to price in line with local inflation? If to provide as you said the consumer has been pushed pretty hard, particularly in Brazil and increasingly in Argentina, is what triggering the share losses, their modest. Is it trade down that you're really seeing in the marketplace? Or is it another kind of similarly priced competitor that\u2019s winning currently? Thomas J. Falk: Is there an all of the above answer I can choose, Lauren on that one. Lauren Lieberman : No. Thomas J. Falk: Because I think it is a little bit of all of those I think. There is \u2013 growth rates in a lot of our categories have slowed. We said we were expecting category growth rates of roughly 2%. We would have said several years ago three to four was probably more what we were trending. So growth rates have come down, there's still lots of competition including local competitors who are aggressively pursuing business and we're trying to make sure we\u2019ve got the right innovation, we got the right price point, we\u2019re executing well in market and that probably makes it a little tougher in this environment to get price increases, in a market like Brazil, where the category is going backwards 3% to 4% in volume and you're taking list price up, you can generate some short-term category value increases, you don't want it to be a race to zero either. Lauren Lieberman : Yeah understood, okay. You had also mentioned in the release, lower category demand in diapers in the U.S. Could you talk a little bit about that, is that a birth rate conversation that\u2019s driving that? Thomas J. Falk: There's been a pretty big category shift in the last year where training pants category growth is up strong double digits and diaper category growth is down a little bit. Since I got Mike Hsu here on his first call Mike is running North American business, why don\u2019t you weigh in on that one Mike and give them a little color around that. Michael D. Hsu: Yeah, I think our baby and child care team across both child care and infant, doing a great job, but I do think we see a category shift to train pants and I think in some ways Lauren, we see that as probably some positive green shoots on the economy because training pants to sell at a premium to diapers in a like-for-like sizing, you know the consumers now, when they have confidence in the economy, tend to trade up. And the converse happens when the economy is bad. So I think there has been some shift. The other thing is though that we've made some significant improvements starting in 2015 on product quality. Pull-ups can give a performance of a diaper, but the benefits of training. And so we made a major improvement in 2015, we saw double digit consumption growth in 2015 and that\u2019s carried through to 2016. Double digit consumption and probably high single digit on shipments and so I think there's been a lot of activity there. In terms of the commercial programming, I think we've been talking to moms about the benefits of training and when to start training and I think that\u2019s having an effect in the category. The other factor is our primary competitor has also re-entered or refreshed their product in the category and made a lot of promotion activity which is probably drawing consumers in the category. So there's been a shift from diapers, but the overall mega category, if say all out at across non-measured and measured channels and diapers and child care is overall plan. Thomas J. Falk: So we were up a couple of percent or percent and a half or simple like last year. Lauren Lieberman : And the last thing was just the Nielsen data if there's been this disconnect we\u2019re seeing across companies and categories. But if you can comment at all about in your categories what you think the shift to kind of untrack channels that are driving in terms of growth versus what we're seeing in the open. Thomas J. Falk: Yeah Lauren, it\u2019s probably playing out the biggest in diapers and because of a couple of factors. The non-measured, the online channels are growing at a rapid rate and so you can't see some of the customers that are in there. Also some of the changes in terms of who is reporting with whom between Nielsen RRI [ph] also going to start affecting us as well. So it's a bit of a challenge right now when we're working through some of these issues too. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you so much. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Good morning folks. Thank you letting me ask the question. Like the others, I\u2019ve got two questions. First at a high level. Tom your guiding FORCE, so your second year of under-delivery versus your historical 3% to 5% aspiration. You mentioned category growth overall is obviously a key contributor with it just being at a slower end market environment out there. How are you thinking about the forward, is there a path back to that 3% to 5%. Is sort of 2%, maybe to 2% to 3% is sort of a new reality for at least the foreseeable future. If there is a path that's going to drive us higher, what are some of the key variables that you think we should be looking at, at the gate whether or not we can get traction on that. Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, that's a key question, Jason. Obviously, I\u2019d say, Latin America economic recovery would be a key driver. So if you look at Brazil, Argentina, they\u2019re taking a pretty big shock, but Brazil in particular from lower oil prices. As those come back that we\u2019ve got pretty big business with down there that could tier a lot of top line growth issues. On the other hand, as you look at places like Russia, China, still very strong category volume growth and we still see big penetration opportunities in lots of markets around the world. So I think that's why we would still say long-term there\u2019s huge opportunity here for us. In the short-term we're at a little slower spot than the GDP growth per capita of range that we're going to make the categories go at a little slower rate. Jason English : Makes sense. Thanks. Next question is on EBIT math. I really appreciate all the inputs you give us in terms of the guidance assumptions into next year and I also obviously appreciate the bridges you gave in the Qs in terms of what's driving EBIT growth. We can kind of use all these variables to build it up and see what the theoretical earnings potential is for next year. But one wild card that we don't have good visibility to is the other line that you roll in the 10-Q, I know there\u2019s a lot in there. But it's been a material source of leakage the last couple of years, north of $400 million every year of operating profits and leaking out to other line. Can you give us some color on what are some of the key inputs to that? How we should be thinking about that catch-all other as we go into this year? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, well, call it other Jason, because it is just a big unknown, but no seriously, I\u2019ll let Maria give you a little bit of color, but there\u2019s a lot of local inflation in there. We also have other product improvement costs would be in there, so for upgrading and adding functionality to a product we would put that into that line. Any start-up costs for new capital equipment around the world would go into that line, I don\u2019t know Maria, if there\u2019s anything else you would add to that or build on that. Maria Henry : Yeah, I think that's right. It definitely has a currency component to it as well as the inflation component to it is what drives it. Jason English : And thoughts on what that could look like as we go through 2017. Thomas J. Falk: I would say that line tends to be pretty similar year-to-year, but I don\u2019t know Paul, if you\u2019ve got any other, we have never tried to forecast other, so. Paul J. Alexander: Yeah, I mean typically as you'd expect with all companies we're going to have general inflation in our P&L and we break out the commodity component of that inflation. But wage increases, things of that nature, benefit cost, those are going to be, I would say modestly increasing year-to-year. Thomas J. Falk: Pretty similar year-to-year. Jason English : All right. Thanks a lot guys. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy : Hi, good morning. Just a follow-on, on that inflation question \u2013 wage and benefit inflation. Paul you\u2019re saying that that sort of the offers, that its excluding the other or I mean, is there allocation to each division? Thomas J. Falk: Each country team would have their own wage and benefit program and we just \u2013 as we break out the analysis of change and share that with you, we capture those cost increases on the other bucket and so I think that\u2019s the nature of the question that was asked. So we try to run a very efficient corporate overhead team and Maria oversees the corporate G&A budget and I know they're planning for a fairly flat, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on how you\u2019re approaching that going into 2017. Maria Henry : Yeah, on the corporate side we have pretty aggressive management of those expenses. I think you saw a decrease year-over-year 2016 to 2015 when you look at that segment reporting that we have on the corporate expenses. So we\u2019ll remain diligent on that and I think we benchmark well in that area. Thomas J. Falk: Trust me if we were sending our operating unit teams bigger bills from corporate, we would hear about it, so. Caroline Levy : Got it. Okay. My other question is understanding what's going on in the China diaper market please. Because my understanding is there's kind of 30% share now are held by locals. And it's a bit confusing that in something with technology I would imagine, very important that hundreds of local players have been able to take so much share. If you could just tell us a little bit more about what's going on with pricing. What's going, what isn't and how you see us coming out of this? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah that local share seems very high to me. I mean, you\u2019ve got essentially four big global diaper players with P&G is still the share leader. Their share is high teens. Our share would be high teens. Kao would be similar and Unit Term [ph], I think it's about 10 share. Then [Hang On] which is the local players about a 5 share. So I think Caroline it may depend on which dataset you're looking at their because there\u2019s a substantial portion of the Chinese market is in e-commerce. Another good chunk is in baby superstores and then there is relatively smaller segment than you might see in other markets that are in traditional retail. So if you looked at a just a Nielsen traditional retail number you could probably get a high share for a local player but that\u2019s covering a very small part of the market. Caroline Levy : Got it I mean I actually got those numbers from a competitor, but it does seem clear that competition is extremely high and pricing is weak. What do you think marks a turning point in this \u2013 in pricing? Thomas J. Falk: Well, I think the pricing is down double digits for the year, a lot of that happened in the \u2013 started really in late of 2015, but rolled through early 2016. Our expectation is going into 2017 that pricing is not going to get better in the short term. We do see good category volume growth, see a strong growth rate, high single digit, maybe even low double digit increase in births in China, good category participation rate. So there aren\u2019t many markets in the world that are growing that fast and it's not surprising that that there's a lot of competition there. Our team has done a fantastic job of is improving the products and reducing our costs, so that our margins overall in China are still quite attractive. Caroline Levy : That's great. Thank you very much. Thomas J. Falk: Thank you Caroline. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with UBS. Stephen Powers : Good morning. Tom on the composition of growth next year, maybe looking at by segment. Are you anticipating a similar mix in terms of the growth between Personal Care Tissue and Professional? Or do you see an acceleration in Tissue and Professional and then perhaps offset by some level of decel in Personal Care? Thomas J. Falk: For Personal Care, should still be the fastest growing segment I would say overall. KCP had about 1 point drag this year on their segment organic growth due to lower sales to Halyard and some of our internal nonwovens, so that was expected because that supply agreement kind of wound down. So we won't have that negative comp of holding them back in 2017, so KCP could be a bit higher. Consumer Tissue I'd say overall will be pretty similar. Stephen Powers : Okay. Thanks. And then Maria if we turn to FORCE, I know there are a ton of moving parts and how you run that program from the bottom up. But is there any way you can call out any kind of bucket of costs in particular in terms of where you saw upside in fiscal 2016, just looking back over the year. Then more importantly, where you expect the most incremental improvement to come in 2017 because the momentum. Both based on what you achieved in 2016 and what you\u2019re indicating that for 2017 is well ahead of where I think you would have put it a year ago at this time. So I\u2019m just trying to understand better where you're seeing that momentum sourced from? Thanks. Maria Henry : Sure. Yeah for the FORCE cost savings, come in three main areas and that was consistent in 2016 as it has been and those as a remind our savings that we drive from negotiating with our vendors, so on lower material prices, improving our productivity in ways across our facilities through manufacturing process and driving out ways everywhere. The third area is optimizing the cost of our product specifications and in particular looking for \u2013 what are things that don't matter to the consumer that we can optimize or how do we engineer our products with more effective material to lower the overall cost of the product. So those were the three areas for 2016 that drove our FORCE cost savings. What I will say though is because we did a little over our expectation our teams were incredibly focused on driving savings as we continue to fight it out in the very tough macroeconomic environment. So some of the areas where we over-delivered include in our international markets and also in some of our manufacturing and distribution operations. Those were ahead of our expectations in 2016, Thomas J. Falk: Just a thing I would add to that is Maria and our new supply chain leader, Sandra MacQuillan, have done a great job of driving inventory down. As we have \u2013 had held less inventory you get lots of other distribution and logistics savings and that probably another area that we\u2019ve done better and I think there's more to come there. A \u2013 Maria Henry : Yeah I would agree with that and I think that really helped us on the cash flow side. We put two days off of our CCC, that was in the high end of our expectations and a lot of that improvement was driven by inventory, which I'm particularly pleased with the teams are very focused on that area. Not only global supply chain, but the local teams are really doing a great job on working capital. Stephen Powers : Okay. Thank you very much. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz : Hey, Tom, good morning. Thomas J. Falk: Good morning Bill. Bill Schmitz : Hey a couple of things. The first is do you guys think you have enough spend capacity. It seems like all the growth in the category the next 10 years, as they come in the pack category. So have you thought about the capital requirements there? Whether you think it's more modular diaper lines to make taped in pant diapers in the same line. Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, I mean, I\u2019d say the simple answer to your question is yes, we do believe we have enough pant capacity and so we\u2019ve been at and that\u2019s pretty much we\u2019ve been adding pant capacity in major market in the world. We got new assets in China, Brazil, Russia, Czech Republic even Central America. And so - and our team in Mexico has also added capacity, so yeah we do feel pretty good about that. Not to get too technical, but the grade change between the diaper and a pant would be time consuming enough, that you probably wouldn't want to do it very often, so it's better to have dedicated assets. Bill Schmitz : Okay, all right, that\u2019s helpful. Then what do you think the end game is for all the competitors, with all the pricing activity we\u2019re seeing in some of these markets. Is it mostly like distribution specific, so like are you seeing super intense activity on e-commerce side in China and maybe less activity in the traditional stores? Any deeper color on like what you think the rationale is for \u2013 so it seems like it\u2019s just breaking the category growth globally. So I'm just trying to figure out like what you think the end game is for yourselves and others. Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, I mean, I think the end game for us is deliver winning products, build market share and sustain your business over time. You know it's kind of tried and true techniques and in China we invested a ton in 2016 in our newborn program to make sure that we were capturing new moms and carrying them through. We're doing a lot of hospital sampling in many markets around the world to make sure that mom goes home from the hospital with the right products. And so it's all the basics. I mean, as we deconstruct some of the P&Ls to attempt of our key our competition, I think these are still attractive businesses, even at reduced prices and we've been good at getting the cost out to help protect our margins structure. And so we want the diaper to work better and cost less and if we can continue to deliver on that, yeah, that makes it tougher for anybody to compete with us. I don\u2019t know if that addresses it specifically. There\u2019s another part to your question, Bill, I don\u2019t know if I answered better or not. Bill Schmitz : That\u2019s perfect. The other probably is just like do you see more aggressive activity in like different parts of the distribution network nearby channels or was it? Thomas J. Falk: I think the point I would make there is that e-commerce is making pricing more transparent everywhere. So there's more \u2013 you know if retailers just to comp each other\u2019s promoted prices and now e-commerce you can go comp three websites quick and easy and there\u2019s apps that'll do it for you and so I think that's probably driving more of an EDLP type environment recognizing, there\u2019s still room for some promotion. I don\u2019t know Mike if you've got a view of that of what you see in North America. Michael D. Hsu: Yeah, I mean, North America I think the e-commerce is having an effect and I think it\u2019s both the transparency, it\u2019s also maybe the game theoretical impact which is \u2013 some of our customers feel like they can, promote their products and they're service offering more aggressively, promoting certain product lines more aggressively. I think that has a \u2013 as you may call that it a deflationary effect across the categories some times. And so in some ways, you could argue that, it\u2019s not healthy for the category, in other ways, you know can bring new users into the category. So you know our job is, we\u2019re trying to serve our customers across the board and we need to make our products that serve their needs and the economics can work for us and so that's how we're approaching it. Bill Schmitz : Okay. Great. And then just one last quick follow-up. I mean, is there anything funky, I know you said there is a shift in spending on the R&D side on the SG&A line, with (M&A) or whatever in the fourth quarter. Was there anything like instead of comp reversals or things like that digital app [ph] next year? Thomas J. Falk: Nothing really unusual and that\u2019s said just we were probably tightly controlling spend, but as you would hope we are always doing. But I would say no there was no unusual item that rolled through there. Bill Schmitz : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Two quick questions. Tom, if you could just give us your assessment of the global consumer, I'm putting the category dynamic aside with competition. Just we're hearing from a lot of global companies right now and it seems like the message is that the emerging markets are starting to stabilize. I'm just curious on what you're seeing in some of the big markets. Then the second question is and I know this is kind of out of left field, but are you guys working on anything actually as it relates to robotics and automation, not just in the supply chain and manufacturing but more back office type stuff? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk: That is a left field question Nik, I think that would be the first time I have had that one. But let me answer the first question. So the global consumer I would say probably a bit of a mixed bag if you're in a economy that had oil as a large part your economy, but you\u2019re feeling still some pressure. So now you saw negative GDP in Russia. Nigeria, certainly under pressure, very slow or negative GDP per capita growth there. Some of the challenges in Brazil have been there as well. So if you're a oil consuming nation you\u2019ve got a big windfall in 2016 and so a pretty good GDP per capita growth generally or improving. So I would say if you look at a market like China, the underlying category demand growth, the birth rate those are all really positive signals. Despite a little bit of a little bit of a slowdown in their overall GDP growth, you still saw a really good growth in GDP per capita and more consumers coming in reach of our products and entering the category and starting families et cetera. And you\u2019d see some similar things. Vietnam is a very a good market for us as well. You saw \u2013 actually saw a very \u2013 we had a terrific year in Korea, despite a fairly flattish economy, our Korean business did pretty well. So I\u2019d say, the U.K. with Brexit. Our KCP business in particular saw, a little weaker year than we were expecting there. I think you saw some distributors not wanting to hold inventory, not certain necessarily what was happening next, that seemed like that calmed down a bit at the end of the year. It feels like maybe the U.K. is more stable at the moment and we'll see what the next step is in Brexit. But I don't know Marie if you want to add anything to that, so. A \u2013 Maria Henry : Yeah, I\u2019ll take the next one though. Thomas J. Falk: Okay, go ahead, do robotics \u2013 A \u2013 Maria Henry : And robotics, yeah, and machine learning in back office, yeah. We have a global business services initiative at Kimberly-Clark. We've got shared services center around the globe, where we look to consolidate and optimize transaction services and more routine type of back office work. And robotics automation can be applied in those areas, so we are working with our vendors and staying on top of the technology. And understanding why is that opportunity for us. But clearly its part of our global business services initiatives where we're looking at robotics, automation, machine learning and how we might be able to change the game on that in the future. Thomas J. Falk: Maybe just to build on that Nik, a way to think about it is if you could think about the perfect order or the perfect payables transaction or the quantity, the price, the delivery terms, everything lined up perfectly with the purchase order or it could sale right through your system and get paid without any human involvement, that would be the gold standard. I'd say too often some of those things don't work out and you need human beings to fix and adjust and correct all those minor errors that happen. And if you think about a customer transaction, if we could take the customer's order, get the price exactly right, the quantity shipped on the date they wanted it with the correct terms. So it applies right through our system and their system without any additional intervention that's a big opportunity and it takes friction out of everyone's transaction costs. But we still got a long way to go to get to that. Nik Modi : Great. Thanks so much for the perspective. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Erin Lash : Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping we could talk a little bit about usage particularly in for diapers in developing and emerging markets. Obviously, with the economic environment been challenging particularly in Brazil whether that, you've seen usage continue to come down or whether some of the price competition that you\u2019re seeing is actually negating a declining, or any on preventing I guess, a decline in usage? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, I would say, Erin, it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag if you looked at Russia, which has had a pretty good economic shock, we still saw a very strong a category growth. Our Huggies business was up double digits in volume and we had higher selling prices, lot of innovation so responsive consumer to that. Brazil on the other hand you\u2019ve tended to see, category volume declines in the low single digits 3% to 4% over the last couple of quarters. So that would say the consumer is either reducing their household inventory or reducing their usage in some cases or shifting from five or six diapers a day to three or four diapers a day that could account for that, if a subset of the consumer base is doing that. Argentina has probably been the biggest shock, they\u2019ve had a pretty big economic transformation under way, there are going to move some of their utility cost to more of a market rate and that's having a big impact on household budgets and you're seeing lots of categories declining in that market. I think it will take some time to really tell how that\u2019s going to shake out. But we saw in the third and fourth quarter in Argentina double digit declines in category diaper volume, which, that\u2019s pretty unusual, you don't see that every day. Erin Lash : That's very helpful. Thank you. Then just with regard to the growth that you're seeing in the training pant category in the U.S. that\u2019s been entirely driven by the, I guess, average age toddler or child as opposed to a shift or any consumer interest in moving down similar to the emerging markets for the diaper training pants has been picking up steam and is preferred for even newborn consumers, correct? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah I think that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t Mike, do you want to comment on diaper pants broadly. A \u2013 Michael D. Hsu: Yeah, I think we\u2019re still digging through the data on that, but I do think, a part of it is, I would say yes right now it's about average. I think our training pant business leaders would say, hey you know we think mom\u2019s should be starting earlier and so there's a strategy on their part to say, hey, we want our children to start training earlier and we want them to stay more consistent in the training pant, and so that\u2019s long-term strategy for the pull-ups brand manager. Then for the Huggies, they want them to stay in Huggies and I think our job again here is to want to serve the consumer and how they want us to be served and give them the choices and provide the best products, so they can make the choice. Thomas J. Falk: Then to your point in the U.S. market we're not offering training pants that go down to newborn sizes. Or as in some of the emerging markets you do find diaper pants in smaller sizes although, usually not newborn, but usually in size one, two, you find some of those are still pretty small part of those categories. A \u2013 Michael D. Hsu: Yeah, training tends to start around 18 months to 24 months. Thomas J. Falk: Yeah and even diaper pant usage in emerging markets tends to start when babies are a little bit more active crawling stage. Erin Lash : Thank you. That's very helpful. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : So obviously with the comps that you have in 2016, you\u2019re looking for organic sales growth to more second half weighted. But can you talk about the phasing of some of the innovation that you discussed in your prepared remarks? Are there some quarters that will benefit more than others. And then on price makes, obviously you said flat to up slightly, but you're now looking much from prices, we already discussed, so it sounds like obviously more is coming from mix. So much what's that based on? Do you expect the environment to improve as the year progresses and consumers mixing up? Or is there something else to that? Thank you. Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, I\u2019d say, there could be a couple of mix factors. As I said earlier in China we invested a lot in newborn in 2016, as those babies move up into the more mainstream diapers, you know we expect to see a little bit of more positive mix. And newborn hurts our mix just because there's more diapers in a bag and you sell the bag for the same price. Although you'd argue that builds your franchise, so you definitely want to have a leadership share there. But we\u2019re probably a little overweight newborn in China and that will have an effect on us going forward. I\u2019d say broadly we're not expecting a lot from price or mix in 2017. So I think they would both be slightly positive, but that's not going to be the story driving our growth, that\u2019s going to be core volume. Olivia Tong : Got it. And then the cadence on innovation. Thomas J. Falk: Cadence on innovation, obviously it\u2019s going to vary by market and so typically we've got quite a bit of stuff going on in North America. Mike I don't know if you want to comment on some of the things going on in independent polls without revealing any too much competitive launch data. A \u2013 Michael D. Hsu: Yeah I think the teams there, particularly in adult care were still focused on driving the category penetration, which is still a big opportunity for us, the business is performing well, up mid-to-high single digits. I think the innovation is coming. We\u2019re really focused on that you know adding value in the category and some of things, employees within Shape [ph] and Depend in the 2016 like Depend which has been a very successful item. And then coming in 2017 new and improved super premium on Depend both real fit and silhouette. So again super premium, softer, more broadened set of performance. Thomas J. Falk: In China we launched a new super premium diaper pant in November and so that will really just start to get traction as we roll into of 2017. Olivia Tong : All right. Thank you so much. Thomas J. Falk: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : I just had a question on your Personal Care business North America. Could you talk a little bit more in the competitive environment and promotional activity, which appears to remain pretty elevated across major category. Then can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about the environment going forward? What's really factored into our FY2017 guide? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, Bonnie, yeah, I think the environment is elevated and I think we saw an elevation occur in the third quarter, you could probably see that through in our results back then. I think we improved in the fourth quarter, I think the team has responded well to the kind of the change in environment and ramped up their intensity in terms of both securing the right merchandising activity and the right marketing activity. I think our call is that it\u2019s going to remain this way for a while, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re assuming for 2017. I think our teams are prepared for right innovation both in diapers, child care, adult care and fem care and we\u2019re excited about our plan for 2017. Bonnie Herzog : Then regarding your innovation pipeline, would you characterize in general your pipeline, as more full versus last year across your categories? Just trying to get a sense of where you go out with innovations going forward? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, I\u2019d probably say comparable, but we've got some pretty good items in there and I think we\u2019re not ready to kind of disclose what they are yet, Paul, But I think we feel good about it. Paul J. Alexander: Yeah, so I\u2019d say, Bonnie, we\u2019re pleased, but never satisfied on that front. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. And then just one final question for me, can you just give us a sense as to how your higher margin wiper business with K-C Professional is trending recently. I think it\u2019s been a few quarters, since you guys called this out. So just trying to get a sense that you still think, strong growth there or things may be moderated. Thanks. Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, I would say you know wipers was a little - was flattish in the quarter and for the year. We saw a little bit more growth in our core washroom business, so we've driven a lot of our innovation and commercial programming around the washroom and its probably refreshed that business a little bit. We\u2019re still seeing opportunity with wipers particularly in some of the heavy manufacturing areas, things like aeronautics and so forth, where we do a fair amount of work. So as those picked up we should see some opportunities to drive more wiper business. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Thanks for the follow-up. So look, I was just reflecting on the whole conversation this the time and last quarter and everything and we\u2019re all kind of taking as a granted, that there is much more competition out there. But we don't talk a lot about why and I\u2019m trying to get a sense of why from your perspective there is a lot more competition, so clearly local players, clearly P&G is he stepping it up. But how would you characterize it, so and long-term concerns might be things like they're just lower barriers to entry, so tougher to differentiate? Competitors are cutting more cost, they're willing to spend more back. Maybe it's just that the macro environment is tougher and so people are more intrigued about share gains than anything else. But putting your sense of that, kind of and you're going to say look there\u2019s a great category its always been competitive. But it\u2019s clearly more competitive now that than it has been. So trying to get a sense of your belief and the drivers of that to get a better sense of, is it going to get worse, is it going to get better, or is it going to be same. Does that question make sense? Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, no, I think that\u2019s fair. I guess, the way I would think about it would be; number one, as economic growth globally has slowed down and some of the markets we talked about. There's just less growth around and just as many people chasing it. So that inherently will make that just a bit more competitive if you\u2019re growing 3 to 4 and now you're growing too. And then you got the same number of competitors, it just makes \u2013 the same number of people fighting over in pieces of a smaller pie or smaller growth opportunity. So that\u2019s probably one. I also think you're seeing more competitors, expanding into more markets. So CNPC has moved out of Chile and is now operating in Brazil and moving into Peru and they're operating in Mexico, you know that's new geography for them and they\u2019re obviously trying to get traction in launch. We\u2019ve seen Unit term [ph] launch in Brazil. They haven\u2019 t build a big share position there yet, but that increases the competitive set. SCA [ph] has done acquisitions and increased their footprint globally in lots of places and so maybe it used to be us and our primary global competitor in a market, now you've got usually one or two other global players that are around and just makes it, so you got to be sharp on innovation, you got to sharp on cost and you got to be great on execution. We're up for that challenge, but there's other players in the neighborhood. Ali Dibadj : So it\u2019s really helpful, so does that concern you given that it feels like those things aren't going away for your 3% to 5% organic sales growth target longer term, right? I\u2019d assume people aren\u2019t going to now retrench and go away, unless you believe the underlying market gets better, so people are more relax. But does that concern you at all, the things you just described more competition in the same market. Theoretically you\u2019d expect it to put pressure on your 3% to 5% organic sales growth for long term, is that right, is that a fair concern or no? Thomas J. Falk: I mean, I would say, this, I mean, I think the, if you think about all the weighting of those factors. The slower economic growth is the one that\u2019s probably, that you can't do anything about but that's probably the bigger challenge. The economies are growing better. There's more growth to feed more mouths in category in particular places. And so the effect, we got more competition in more places. At the end of day, we\u2019ve got to deliver a winning product solution at an attractive cost and execute it well on the market and so does everybody else. So yeah I'm absolutely up for that challenge. Ali Dibadj : Thanks very much for that. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks Ali. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much guys. I just wanted to follow-up on Ali\u2019s question actually about, could you compare, within everything you just discussed. If you compare and contrast the dynamics in Brazil and Argentina specifically with maybe what kind of went on with the entry into China. What\u2019s different from macro standpoint? Maybe are there any learnings from the China experience, what you're kind of going through versus how you can handle and maybe what your next, couple of years will hold as maybe the structure of competition in Brazil and Argentina change. Does it evolve in the same way China is kind of involved right now? And maybe what have you learned from the development of that super premium segments in China? Thank you. Thomas J. Falk: Yeah, I mean, they're pretty different markets I would say and so China is an explosive growth opportunity where more and more people as our GDP per capita improves, are entering the category. So with billion plus, people in the country that is a near limitless supply of consumers that could eventually come into our category. I\u2019d say if you contrast it to Brazil, you probably had higher category penetration rates to start with. Unless GDP per capita growth and lately it\u2019s been negative in GDP per capita trends. And so yeah, I\u2019d just say it\u2019s a different starting point and different economic. Ones a got great tailwind and one 's got a headwind that you're running against. We have launch diaper pants in Brazil, have seen pretty good conversion and launched things like, in adult care in our Depend, Plenitude, which is our brand in that part of the world. We've been pretty successful at transitioning the category from a lower cost briefs, which is more like an adult diaper to a higher cost pant will much similar to what we would sell in the U.S., just because it\u2019s much better solution and then deliver terrific value. Even though that is a income challenged consumer and so, you do still see responsiveness, but you don't have the explosive growth of GDP per capita and more people under in the category of that you probably have in China. Jonathan Feeney : Thank you very much. Thomas J. Falk: Thanks Jon. Operator : And at this time we have no further questioners in the queue. Paul J. Alexander: All right we appreciate all the questions today and we\u2019ll wrap up with a comment from Tom. Thomas J. Falk: Well, once again, we had a good year 2016. We've laid out an aggressive plan for our global business class strategies in 2017. And we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thanks very much. Paul J. Alexander: Thank you very much.

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience and holding. We now have your presenters and conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. And at that time, instructions will be given as to the procedures to follow if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, CFO. Here's the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with a review of first quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish, as usual, with Q&A. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. Now, as a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the risk factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Lastly, we'll be comparing 2017 results with 2016 adjusted results, which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments. And now, I'll turn it over to Maria. Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Total sales were even year-on-year with organic sales down 1%. We achieved strong cost savings which helped us improve our margins and grow earnings per share. And we're on track with our overall capital plan. Now let's take a look at the details starting with sales. Our first quarter net sales were $4.5 billion. That's even year-on-year, with a 1-point benefit from currency rates. Organic sales fell 1% in the quarter and Tom will provide more color on our top line results in just a few minutes. On profitability, gross and operating margins were each up 30 basis points year-on-year. First quarter gross margin was 36.9% and operating margin was 18.6%. The margin improvements included good progress in developing and emerging markets. Our FORCE cost savings for the quarter were $110 million. So we're off to a good start relative to our full year savings target of at least $400 million. Commodities were a $35 million drag that was mostly offset by currency benefit. On the bottom line, first quarter earnings per share were $1.57, up 3% year-on-year, while our equity income reduced earnings by $0.02 per share, offset by a lower effective tax rate. Now let's take a look at cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $436 million and in line with our expectation. Cash flow was down compared to $553 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by higher tax payments this year. On capital allocation, first quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million. That includes $300 million of share repurchases. We continue to expect that for the full year dividends and share repurchases will total between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. Looking at the segments; in Personal Care, organic sales were even year-on-year. Organic sales increased 6% in developing and emerging markets, but were down elsewhere. Overall Personal Care operating margins were 21.4%, up 110 basis points. The improvement was driven by cost savings, higher volumes and favorable currencies. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 3% driven by North America. Consumer Tissue operating margins were strong at 18.9%, that's up 20 basis points. In K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were even with prior year. K-C Professional operating margins were 19%, down 70 basis points. The comparison was impacted by cost inflation and strong results last year. So let me recap. We achieved significant cost savings and improved our margin. We delivered bottom line growth in a challenging environment. And we continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Since Maria covered the financial details for the quarter, I'll focus my comments on our organic sales in the quarter and then on our full year outlook. As Maria just mentioned, our organic sales were down 1% in the quarter. So, in January, we said that growth would be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half largely due to comparisons. That said our first quarter organic sales were somewhat below my expectations, most of that coming from North America. In North America, our organic sales fell 3% in our consumer businesses, and that reflects the combination of category softness, greater competitive activity, and lower promotional shipments. Overall category growth across all channels, including e-commerce, was about 0.5% in the quarter, and that's about 1.5 points below what it was for the full year 2016. In terms of our key businesses in North America, our Personal Care volumes were off by 1%. In infant and child care, our volumes overall were down low-single digits, which is probably in line with the mega category. Category consumption continues to shift out of diapers and into training pants, and volume growth in e-commerce is continuing to accelerate. Our market share overall was even year-on-year and up 1 point sequentially in infant and child care. In Consumer Tissue, our volumes were down 7%, mostly in bathroom tissue. Results were impacted by competitive activity and lower promotional shipments than last year. We've got a stronger promotional calendar scheduled for the balance of the year. We expect better performance going forward in North America particularly the back half of the year when our comparisons get a little easier. Our planned product innovations will also help drive our growth in the near term. That includes the introduction of U by Kotex Fitness in our feminine care business, improvements to Huggies diapers and baby wipes, and some new Kleenex facial tissue offerings. In addition, we're placing even more focus on the execution of our sales and retail merchandising strategies with stronger programming going forward. In terms of the category overall, trends were a little better in the last part of the first quarter, so we're cautiously optimistic that market growth will get back to more normal levels over time. Moving onto developing and emerging markets, we delivered 4% organic sales growth in this part of our business, and performance and category conditions were broadly in line with our expectations from January. Looking at some of our key markets, in China, organic sales in diapers were up low-single digits as strong double-digit volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices. While the promotion environment remains competitive, we're optimistic that pricing won't be as negative in 2017 as it was in 2016. We also have several innovations on Huggies launching in the second quarter. In Brazil, our organic sales in Personal Care were up high-single digits compared to a decline of 5% in the year-ago period. Category demand remains down in Brazil and our team there continues to innovate and has product improvements in market on diapers and feminine care. In Argentina, our organic sales in Personal Care were up low-double digits, driven by higher selling prices. We re-launched Huggies diapers late in the quarter and that helped us deliver modest volume growth despite category volumes being down double digits. At Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers were similar year-on-year. Volumes were up double digits again this quarter with continued benefits from innovations in Russia. Selling prices were down, reflecting price rollbacks last year following the strengthening of the Russian ruble. Lastly, in developed markets outside of North America, organic sales were down 2%, mostly in South Korea. We expect results there to pick up as the year progresses including benefits from innovation launches. Now, moving onto our outlook and our specific targets for the year; we expect sales to increase 1% to 2% in 2017. The currency impact on sales should be neutral overall, which is about 2 points better than what we expected in January. Regarding organic sales, we also expect growth of 1% to 2%, and that compares to our original estimate of approximately 2% and reflects our first quarter results, the category conditions in North America, and slightly lower price realization due to improved currencies. Regarding earnings, while the currency outlook has improved, our cost inflation estimate has increased by $75 million on average compared to our assumption in January. In total though, we're still planning that the net impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices will be a mid-to-high single digit drag in our bottom line. That's consistent with our original plan for the year although with a different mix of these factors. Altogether, we continue to target earnings per share of $6.20 to $6.35 for 2017. And that's up 3% to 5% year-on-year. So, in summary, we're investing in our brands and growth initiatives to help us grow and compete effectively. We're managing our company with financial discipline. And we continue to be optimistic about our opportunities to create long-term shareholder value. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Good morning, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I just had a couple of questions, not surprisingly, on North America Personal Care. So first was just overall from a category perspective. Does it feel to you like there's been some sort of tipping point in terms of where consumers are shopping in these categories? Meaning the Nielsen tracked versus untracked, because the data obviously looked, from a category perspective, looked far worse than what you've said in terms of what you guys are seeing on category growth. And it looks like it's dramatically different since the start of this year versus end of 2016. So that was my first question. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I'll let Mike Hsu give you a little bit more color on that, but we've certainly seen a pretty strong uptick in e-commerce. And that's a trend that's happening in lots of places, but it did seem to accelerate in the U.S. in the last couple of quarters. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, Lauren, I do think maybe a shift upwards in e-commerce sales and other channels that are not scanned by Nielsen. I think if you look at the diaper category specifically, in Nielsen xAOC, you probably would've seen a high-single digit decline in volume, but across all outlets that was probably down about low-single digits across all outlets. And so, you are seeing maybe an increasing shift to e-commerce. I will say there's probably a lot written about this topic, but our relationships across all channels are strong. Our strategy is not just manage (11:58) or pick winners across retailers, and so we do fund customers on the same program across all channels, and then we tailor our execution support to support our customer-specific strategies. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then, also the data that Tom cited on category performance and actually market share performance for the infant and child care business, just sort of discussing what wasn't mentioned, it feels like then perhaps adult and fem care is where the sort of more material under-performance versus the categories were. So if you can just talk about that and the outlook on those businesses it would be great. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, go ahead, Mike. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, in adult care, I think I'd say our volumes overall year-on-year are about similar versus year ago, and our comparisons were actually probably impacted by the base period year ago where we had strong double digit growth. We are affected a little bit I would say by strong competitive activity in the category. Price promotion remains elevated in adult care. Our market share is strong at 54%, but that is down 2 points versus where we were a year ago. The category overall is up mid-single digits, and we expect mid-single to high-single digit growth for the balance of the year, so we still think adult care has a lot of growth in it both in the short term and the long term. We've got a strong innovation plan. We're launching a boy's overnight pad this year that's great. And then we'll continue and invest to make sure we're competitive in the marketplace. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: And, Lauren, fem care was down, I think, mid-singles, and part of that's timing of launch. We've got the fem care U by Kotex Fitness launch coming. That starts in the second quarter. So we expect to see a little stronger calendar in the back half of the year. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And do you have pretty good visibility on that in terms of shelves estimate? Feels like there's been some de-listings of other fem care brands. So is that freeing up space for you guys or is it coming out of your own existing space? Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I'd probably say it's a bit of a mix, but obviously, for us, our goal is to get incremental space. And we're launching U by Kotex Fitness, it's got some pretty good traction and excitement from our customers, and so we're getting the right shelving and space for that. It's a very innovative product. From our side, the product is very tailored for fitness or exercise with real product differentiation there, so we're excited about it. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hey, Wendy. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Hi. Good morning. Two things just following up on Lauren's line of questioning on the online stuff; can you tell us at this point, specifically your U.S. Personal Care business, how much of that is online versus through traditional trade? And second thing, I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding why there would be sort of some inflection point January 1, 2017, all of a sudden, online really starts to grow that much faster because, as Lauren said, the tracked channel data just kind of fell off a cliff. Was there more promotional activity online? Was there greater assortment online? Is there anything that you can speak to specifically either about your business or about the category, and I'm really thinking about Personal Care specifically that would represent such a shift just over the last few months? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, Wendy, I guess a couple of things I would say. Number one, giving you an accurate e-commerce or online versus off-line share is pretty tough for us to do because there's a lot of our traditional brick and mortar customers that do quite a bit of click-and-collect. And so we don't really have any visibility of that because it goes into their existing distribution system and into their existing stores and they take off their shelves. So Amazon will be a big one that isn't in the tracked data that probably is the gap. And maybe \u2013 and again, they've had a strong quarter across lots of businesses, including ours. And I don't know, Mike, if you want to comment any more about anything that you're seeing in that specific space? Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I think, Wendy, the only thing I would add is that, obviously, the resellers have decided that mom is very important to them, and there's a strong battle to win mom. We have seen some retail price competitiveness across channels both from bricks and mortar and online, and that's probably driving some price competition and price decline into the market, which has accelerated the shift to some degree this year. Just to give you an example, I think in the diaper category, infant/child care mega category across training pants, diapers, infant care and child care, the category volume overall across all outlets is down 1% in volume, but down 5% in net sales. So that gives you an indication of the price deflation. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. But there's been a lot written about, oh, with all of the shift in terms of where people shop, Walmart's going to be coming back and putting pressure on the manufacturers. Is there any \u2013 I know you said, hey, we treat all our customers equally, but in terms of incremental promotional spending that you are planning, I know you said for the back half you'll be spending more on promo, but that's been in the plans for a while. That's not a specific function of Walmart coming back and saying, hey, you need to be more friendly to us given the changing dynamics and where people shop. Is that right? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I guess I would just call it \u2013 if you look at the North American price was pretty neutral quarter-on-quarter. So that would be an indication that we're not funding additional competitive spend activity. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then I just had a quick short question on China. I know, Tom, you said specifically that you are hoping that in 2017 pricing in China won't be as negative as it was last year. Is that a statement about something you're already seeing in the market? Or is that your confidence in sort of what's going with the Chinese consumer? Or what's driving your optimism about the Chinese pricing environment? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, if you look at the pricing in Q1 versus fourth quarter last year was pretty similar. So we didn't really see further degradation. All the price decline was a carryover effect of things that happened in the first half of last year. So we would feel like it seems to have stabilized at this point in time. And the good news is you're still seeing really strong category volume growth. And so, our pricing comps will get a lot more favorable in the back half, which gives us some confidence on our organic top line outlook. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Terrific. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Wendy. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. A few questions from me too. One is, so just from a short-term perspective, at least for the next 12 months short-term, your organic guidance range just really ticks down a little bit, so that 1% to 2% relative to the about 2%, which really just suggest that the rest of the year will be kind of what you had anticipated when you gave the guidance the first time around at the start of the year. And I'm still having kind of trouble understanding that. It feels a little optimistic to me. And at least, very simplistically, we look at things like even in the D&E markets, sequentially looks a little better, but the two-year stack just keeps looking like it's getting worse. The North America business, clearly, as you said yourself, a little bit worse than expected. Pricing competition, maybe you're not driving the competition yet, although looks like in Nielsen just recently you start to match, but a lot more competition in the U.S. So, look, I'm not (19:46) accuse me of being generally optimistic, but it looks like you guys are being relatively optimistic that nothing is going to get worse, and it's just going to go back to what you anticipated before this less than expected quarter. So, I guess, can you help me quantify how that gap will be closed? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I guess I'd say, Ali, the year started out a little slow. Jan, Feb and March was much better. When we look at that and the plans that we have rolling forward with some of the innovation that we've got coming, that's what gives us some confidence. Our comps get quite a bit easier in the back half. So we knew the first half was going to be a tougher comparison to deliver organic growth. And we've got good momentum in a lot of markets around the world. I'd say the two factors were probably \u2013 and the call down of the top line was a little slower start in Consumer Tissue in North America, and then some price rollbacks in markets where there was pretty big price recovery last year and no other currencies have strengthened. So Brazil and Russia in particular have been places where the currency was pretty weak last year, and we took a lot of price and some of that snapped back. But we'll give you an update as the year progresses. We call it, as you know, down the middle of how we see the fairway, and we'll keep updating as we go through the year. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And just on the, I guess, shape of the fairway, (21:15) a little bit on North America, clearly, that looked pretty tough. And you talked about some things that seem like they might get better, including March, but it just seems like there's a lot more competition in the space, whether it be, again, some of that private label stepping in, whether it be Procter & Gamble directly, it does feel like some retailers like Walmart are reacting a little bit to preemptively stopping the ALDIs or the (21:43) are coming through. Although that's small, they don't want to get them to be too big, a bigger tilt towards Amazon, where I think at least in the U.S. your shares are lower, you said before publicly versus off-line. So I guess I'm trying to figure out more broadly why there won't be more secular challenges? And this maybe not just impacting you guys, but just overall in the sector, what do you guys see from those elements, again, competition getting tougher, retailers clearly struggling to gain share from each other, tilt towards Amazon going forward, and how do you think that actually impact you guys and the sector broadly, because it does feel like those are secular challenges? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I guess we would say that 1% to 2%, we still feel like relative to our long-term goal of 3% to 5% reflects some of those secular challenges. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. And Ali, I think while I certainly acknowledge that the North American environment's gotten more challenging than it was last year. I don't think our first quarter Consumer Tissue is how we planned to perform for the balance of the year. We are expecting our execution to improve. We recognize that it's gotten a little bit more price competitive and we will be competitive in the marketplace. But a lot of it comes down to how we execute in the stores. And I think we are expecting to improve our execution of the stores. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And so just my last question on that flows right in there, which is just your 3% to 5% long term, do you think \u2013 it used to be that you guys are delivering 3% to 5%, and then really toward the high-end of that. Emerging markets clearly slowed down, competition clearly picked up, and now we're in this kind of low-end, obviously, below that low-end of that guidance for this year. Any kind of views on the 3% to 5% sustainability over long-term? Do you still think that's sustainable? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yes. We do. In fact, Mike, maybe will comment on this because he's taking a refreshed look at the long-term strategic plan, which we won't unpack all the details for you this morning, but I'd say we still see strong category growth potential, particularly in a lot of the emerging markets. So maybe, Mike, do you want to comment just a little bit on that? Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, definitely, Ali, strong potential long-term, particularly D&E. If you think about it with continued household formation, wealth creation, emergence of the middle class in a lot of these countries, our categories are still, I think, fairly early in our growth cycle, particularly if you think about fem care, diapers, adult care especially, and so we do see long-term growth. Now, what we see near-term volatility or cyclical volatility as we're experiencing over the last year and a half or so, yes, that's probably the case. But I think right now, we are building plans to kind of keep us in that range. But, obviously, with some of these new conditions, we haven't fully analyzed what just started happening in North America this January. So I think our analysis will continue to evolve. But, right now, we are still shooting for 3% to 5% range. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, as usual, guys. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Ali. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Just to come back to the guidance and the acceleration there, Tom, how reliant is the improvement in the back half on category improvement? And is that something you can put a number on for us? And then I have a follow-up. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I think as you look at some of the price competition in China that's rolling off, what we're seeing is the underlying category has been robust from a volume standpoint. It's just been masked by some of the price challenges, and so we feel pretty solid that that's going to continue and flow through. There are other markets like Brazil, Argentina, where the economy hasn't yet really turned substantially. There's still a fair amount of price recovery to go in Argentina to get back to a more equilibrium state, and so there's probably some question marks there. On the other hand, Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe still seeing actually strong category growth there even though the economy hasn't fully recovered. And North America, I'd say it's a mixed bag. On the Personal Care front, we still see good category growth in adult care. We've got good innovation coming in fem care. Actually, the growth in the training pant category and out of diapers favors us given our share with Pull-Ups, so we feel pretty good about that. And Consumer Tissue is one where we just got to step up our execution a bit and make sure we're getting our fair share of that category. So I wouldn't say it's dependent on improvement in category growth, it's more sustaining what we see happening and then executing against it. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : And Tom, just to stick with that for a moment, if I may. So, in North America, your slide suggests overall category growth of about 0.5% in the quarter. That was down 150 basis points relative to 2016. So, more specifically, the improvement in North America embedded in your guidance, which implies like 1.5% to 3% for the balance of the year from down 1%. So, specifically, and maybe you don't want to put a number on it and that's fine, but is that something you can put a number on for us? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I don't think we could probably give you an accurate read on that specifically. And I think we'd probably say we're still trying to exactly figure it out what happened with the consumer in North America in the first quarter. There's been lots of theories. You've seen a little bit of category weakness across lots of places. So how much of it is broader economic slowdown, which you don't seem to be seeing in other areas? The job report was a little weak but not substantially so. So that's still probably what we're trying to dial in a little bit more precisely. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. So just one follow-up, if I may, and some of this has sort of been discussed, but maybe I'll ask it a little bit differently. So some of the commentary and what's been written around Walmart and the pricing posture and them looking to sort of solidify their lead as the price leader along with sort of underscoring an emphasis on private label, Tom, are those discussions, and, Mike, are those discussions different now? And maybe don't comment on Walmart specifically. I wouldn't expect that. But, just broadly, are you feeling more pressure on the manufacturers at this point? That would be number one. Number two, all this promotion that we're seeing, which is not just unique to your categories, there's a number of others of course. How much of this, in your sense, is being funded by the retailers versus that which is being funded by \u2013 I'm sorry. How much is being funded by the manufacturers versus how much is being funded by the retailers? And then, lastly, are you seeing greater emphasis on private label at this point? Or is that a bit over-emphasized or overdone in terms of what's being written? Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: It's a pretty long question, Kevin. We'll do the best we can with that. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Sorry. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I guess I would start. Price competition among retailers is not a new phenomena and it's maybe heating up a bit. Ultimately, finished product selling prices are retailers' responsibility and you didn't see a lot of price change in our North American numbers. So our trade programs are pretty much intact and maybe I'll let Mike comment a little bit more if you want on private label trends or the general nature of discussions there. I will say this though that when you've got good innovation and strong brands (29:14), it leads to a different discussion than if you don't have those things, it becomes more of an item price discussion. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I'd say the private label trends, I think they're category specific. And so I would say, in diapers, probably the brands are holding up pretty strongly. In Consumer Tissue, maybe there's a slight improvement in private label on the (29:38) side. So I think it varies by category. Certainly, I think given the kind of the conditions we're given, we talked about with increasing penetration of online, I think price has gotten \u2013 come more to the forefront. And we're having discussions with our customers, but they feel similar to discussions we have most years. And our job is to make sure we provide our customers with the right support. As I said, we do try to fund our customers on similar programs, and what we do tailor is how we support them execution only with promotions and through their own marketing tactics. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Olivia. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : In terms of first on \u2013 hi \u2013 your revised price mix outlook, sounds like it's primarily just currency related. Currencies are coming in a little bit, so some of the pricing you would've expected to take in emerging markets is no longer justified. But you also talked a lot about some of the things you need to do in North America Consumer Tissue and some other categories. So is that embedded into your outlook? Was that already in the outlook? Or is there something that's \u2013 or are you expecting more price mix, price promotion associated with that? And perhaps also where does pricing against incremental commodities inflation stand relative to your whole price mix structure? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I guess I'd say, and maybe Mike can comment a little bit more on North America, but I'd say our overall plan in North America hasn't changed much. We just didn't get it all executed in the marketplace in the first quarter, particularly in Consumer Tissue, and so our plan for the year hasn't changed in terms of what we plan to spend broadly. I don't know, Mike, is there anything else you want to add to that or? Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I think both in baby and child care and in Consumer Tissue, we are seeing increased promotion intensity. Our goal is to be competitive in the marketplace and we may need to increase our spending in some areas, but again, we have a pretty well established trade promotion effectiveness program, and we try to be very analytical in our approach and make sure we get the right returns on our investment trade. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: And then on the commodities inflation, it's not enough to drive finished product selling prices in most places, and particularly, when you see many of the international markets, the currency turning favorable, it's not a calculus that would lead to a lot of price in markets like that. We are getting some pricing in \u2013 where secondary fiber has gone up quite a bit in K-C Professional, we're getting some price recovery. I think there's been more broad price increases across the industry that have been announced recently and so that will give us some benefit. But that's about the only one that I can think of that there's maybe a direct commodity driven price change that we'd see coming this year. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks. And then in terms of margins, those have held up fairly well despite the top line slowdown and Personal Care was the particular stand out. And given the level of competitive activity there... Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: (32:54), Olivia. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, no, no, I mean they've actually been pretty decent, but just trying to understand some of the key drivers of the improvement there and how you think about the sustainability of that. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Well, we would say brilliant leadership would be right at the top of the list, but jokes aside, we had a great cost savings quarter. $110 million in FORCE cost savings, a great way to start the year. And then that certainly was a driver of that. Good mix of negotiated material savings, pretty good productivity, some of this material specification changes, then an increasing element of that bucket is in some of the distribution and logistics related savings. It's encouraging. I know Maria's a fan of this to see our inventories keep coming down and that not only delivers cash, but also delivers cost savings as we've got less stuff to store and handle. I don't know, Mike, if there's anything else you want to build on that? Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks. And then just last question. Your thoughts on sort of the deal environment; growth has obviously slowed first in emerging markets, now a bit more in developed markets. And are there any areas you think where you could expand that could help your growth? And then broadly, what's your view on the M&A environment as a whole right now, given some of the chatter and some of the attempts that have been made not too long ago in the broader HPC space? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I would say there aren't that many tuck-ins internationally, but there are a few in a few places, but we did a lot of that in the 1990s and really bought up a lot of the market positions that we wanted and we've been able to consolidate some joint ventures into being 100% owned over time. And so it's a relatively light calendar of M&A activity. And yeah, we read all the same chatter that you guys read and, quite honestly, we're more focused on running our own business every day and stay pretty focused on that and don't play too much with the speculation process on what might happen. So, I think so far that's served us well. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Olivia. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. I was wondering if you can please elaborate on the inventory levels in North America and China. And we benefit from your comments, but with the shift to online, and I know we discussed a lot of the call, but are you seeing inventory levels increase at the bricks and mortar? And how can \u2013 specifically in North America? And how about China? Have you cycled most of the levels of inventory there? I would appreciate. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, in terms of retailer inventories, we didn't see a big shift anywhere really, and we have pretty high cube, high velocity categories, particularly in a place like China, where so much of it is e-commerce. Often the e-com players really aren't even holding any inventory. They'll pick up at our distribution center and deliver the same day. And so there's not a lot of inventory in those systems, and I know we've seen some minor shifts in inventory across other channels, but nothing that was significant enough to call out in the quarter. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And if I can ask \u2013 thank you. This is very helpful. If I can ask on the FORCE program, I know you did not update much, the numbers are still there and you tracked well on the quarter. But how much of it is related to FX and also the commodities environment? Like you see some potential upside there or actually the opposite given that you did translate some of this cost savings might be \u2013 as it translates, might be higher, but if you look at the commodity outlook, how you can track that number? Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. Sure. As Tom mentioned, we did have a strong first quarter and $110 million of savings. And those savings came from across all the areas that our team looked to deliver against. Only one of those areas has to do with sourcing savings, which would be affected by the commodity environment. The tougher the commodity environment, the tougher the negotiations are, but we were very pleased with our team's ability to negotiate that \u2013 to continue to negotiate well in the first quarter and we would expect to see that continue through the remainder of the year. In terms of the other areas, though, we expect that we'll continue to drive productivity in our manufacturing operation. Our global supply chain team is partnering well with the regional supply chain teams and the in-country teams to really be focused on driving the manufacturing programs, driving waste out of the system. We've got some momentum there. We continue to build supply chain capabilities in that area, so we feel good about our number of $400 million for the year. One thing that I will note is if you look at our cost saving last year, we will have tougher comps on cost savings in the second half of this year because our cost savings really built throughout last year. But I think with the capabilities we're building and the execution and focus of the teams, we still feel good about that $400 million number for the year. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thank you, Maria and Tom. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Andrea. Operator : Our next question comes from Eve Powers (sic) [Steve Powers] with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Or Steve. So, first, just a couple of cleanups from your original guidance; I think originally you expected interest expense to come down slightly this year versus 2016, but given how you started the year, should we rethink that? And I guess, maybe as a potential offset, you've maybe guided the buybacks to $800 million to $1 billion, but started off ahead of that pace, so is there some offset there? Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, interest expense, we still expect to be down slightly. We've got a refinancing that's coming up. We have a bond that comes due for $950 million in August, and that's at 6.125%, so we'll replace that with cheaper financing, which will help us. In terms of share repurchases, we're still expecting to do between $800 million and $1 billion this year. We started out a little stronger. As you'll recall, we finished last year with a little bit more cash on hand. We had very strong cash flows last year, so we started out a stronger in the first part of this year. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Cool. And then one more cleanup, which is just on the commodity backdrop, just what you're now assuming full year for oil and pulp and where you expect each to exit 2017? That'd be helpful. But, broader question, maybe this is for Tom, but I was hoping you could comment a bit more on market share trends globally really, because I think you mentioned flat shares in North American Personal Care, but clearly, you under-shipped in Consumer Tissue versus consumption. And overseas, it seems like a mixed bag as well. So just maybe more specific comments on where you're seeing relative market share strength versus weakness? And given that you're not really expecting category improvement going forward, are you embedding improving market share trends instead? Or is it simply sell-in versus sell-out timing that will drive sequential improvement over the balance of the year? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Okay. I'll do the best I can with that, Steve, and we'll see, Steve, what I leave left for you to follow-up on. In terms of pulp and oil, we'd say for pulp we're probably up $40 to $50 a ton versus our original guidance in terms of we expect in terms of market pricing for eucalyptus. So we're calling euc at $870 to $900 a ton. And I know the current price is above that, but that's kind of our outlook for the year. Oil we're kind of in the $50 to $60 a ton still, and there may be some upside for us on that depending on where oil shakes. In the meantime, though polymer has actually gone up a bit, as there's been some supply challenges on polymer. And we don't have a lot of direct oil. We do a lot more polypropylene and oils short of the long-term proxy for that, but in the short term, they can go different directions. Swinging to the market share front, if you looked at shares sequentially in North America, they're pretty flat; up in a couple, flat in a few, down in a couple. Year-over-year, particularly in Consumer Tissue is where we had the most negative share comparison. So that was probably a high watermark for Consumer Tissue last year. As you travel around the world, I'd say you'd see relatively stable share positions. Brazil is up in fem care, down a little in diapers; similar story in Argentina. China shares were, I think, pretty flat to down 1-point; Korea, kind of a similar story. Positive shares in Russia, Ukraine, other parts of Eastern Europe on diapers in particular. I don't know, Mike, if there's any other ones that jump out for you? Fem care has probably been our star and that we've had very strong share performance in most markets on fem care. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yes. The only thing I'd add, I think, certainly, I think in China, holding on pretty very good and doing a good job out there. Central and Eastern Europe, I think we are seeing a pretty good share growth. I think Latin America, as Tom said, pluses and minuses, but we know we need to get our shares pointed in a stronger direction. And then certainly, North America, I think BCC (43:05) or infant child care, shares about flat in the quarter, but most of the other categories a little softer year-on-year versus what we expect. So we know we need to perform better there. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. I just want to \u2013 I think it was in response to Kevin's question earlier, you had said over the balance of the year you weren't really expecting much category improvement, but obviously, you're going to sequential improvement. So if shares are roughly neutral, which is what I gather from all of those comments in aggregate, but you're expecting improvement, it seems like you're expecting to be gaining share if you're not expecting the categories themselves to improve. Is that fair or am I missing something? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I think that's a fair statement. When we get done with this call, Mike and I are going to go in and talk to our team leaders around the company. And one of the things we're going to tell is we're not satisfied with our market shares in the first quarter. So we'd expect to do better as the year progresses. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: And Steve, this is Paul. Just remember, similarly to our organic growth trends from last year, the market share trends follow suit. So the comparisons get easier on both metrics as we get into the back half of the year. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. That's fair. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Good morning, everyone. So just a couple for me. Globally, maybe you can just provide some perspective, Tom, on the promotional environment. If you're looking for market share gains to accelerate or improve as the year unfolds, do you expect the promotional environment to moderate as well? Is it getting worse? Did you see that in the quarter? And then the second question is my understanding is that you've taken a price increase or a list price increase on Kleenex. And I'm just curious if you've seen Procter follow at this point? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: All right. Maybe I'll have Mike comment on both of those, so on promotional environment broadly and then facial pricing. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I think the promotional environment is, as you've heard us discuss, I think it's gotten more challenging, and our exception is at this point is that that environment will continue. And so we're going to be prepared to operate in that environment. And I think what we need to do is be competitive with our promotions and the right price points, but be disciplined about how we spent. And so that's the emphasis going forward. With regard to Kleenex, we did do a list price increase beginning of the year, and that has flowed through. I probably won't comment specifically on the profitability impact. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Oh, I was asking on P&G, if P&G has followed in the market? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I'm not aware that there's been any change on their end. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I don't believe so. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. I think the other point, Nik, would be, as we've got innovation coming, you want to use your promotion along with your other strategic marketing tools to drive that. So we've got a pretty strong calendar coming, and so that wouldn't be unusual for us to put more money behind those ideas either. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And just one more thing. I know you guys talked about March getting better versus Jan and Feb, and it just seems like no one really knows what happened in January and February. And I'm wondering if maybe you have any thoughts outside of just a macro comment? Was there anything specific to your business that you saw that really caused the weakness like a dislocation between consumption and inventory or just higher crate spend? Anything you can give us to just get us some perspective around that? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: No, I wish I could tell you the clear answer, because then I would have done something about it before now. But it was \u2013 and I think everybody was talking about retail store traffic was down broadly. They can't point to weather. There was theories about late income tax refunds. Again, I don't know why that would necessarily affect our category. But, on the other hand, if you're not in the store shopping, you definitely saw that in terms of retail traffic. Now there was some uptick in e-commerce that balanced off a part of that. We are seeing probably, I don't know, Mike, if you want to comment on this, just a little bit less in terms of the fill-in trips may be part of it as some retailers unpacked that. But I think it's still pretty early to figure out exactly what happened. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I think when you have this much going on, which is maybe consumer confidence, the e-commerce shift, and then these theories around the tax. I know that perhaps a lot of \u2013 we had debates internally about how farfetched the tax refund timing affect is, but certainly in conversations with retailers, I think many of them believed that with strong conviction. And so, I think there's multiple factors that we don't have enough analysis to be able to tease out exactly what happened, but I do think there was some softening that we saw particularly in January and February, and we came out in March a little bit better. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Nik. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Good morning, Bonnie. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I just have a couple of quick questions on two of your key markets, China and Brazil. So, first on China, I guess I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more on the pricing dynamics in the market. In the past, you guys have called out currency dynamics versus some of your peers as a key driver behind lower pricing. But I guess it now feels that some of this is also due to general competitiveness in the market. So could you help us better understand the dynamics there? And then on Brazil, could you comment on some of the volume strength you saw during the quarter, which seems to be an improvement versus last quarter? So, curious to hear if you're seeing any improvements in the underlying consumer in Brazil or is this more a reflection of you guys lapping easier compares? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I think on China, a lot of the pricing was really led by some of our other international competitors over the last couple of years almost, and some of that was probably funded by a weaker yen. But I think that seems to have normalized. In the meantime, this is one of the fastest growing markets in the world, and it's not surprising to see everybody chasing after that consumer growth. And so right now, you've got two big U.S.-based players and two big Japanese-based players all chasing growth in the Chinese market. And I think the good news is that pricing seemed to have stabilized in the quarter, although it was down year-on-year, reflecting some of the things that happened in the first quarter last year. On the Brazil front, part of it was we had a lousy start last year in the first quarter, so our comp was easier in that market, and that was why our volume uptick was there. I'd say the shares we've seen in that market are just Jan, Feb, and we had a stronger March, so you could've had a situation there, where maybe shipments were even a little bit ahead of category consumption. But we'll see when we get the next share data. I don't know, Mike, if there's anything else you want to add on either of those markets? Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Well, in Brazil, I think the Q1 Personal Care sales were up high-single digit. And as Tom was saying, we were cycling on a 5% decline in the base period. So volume up, and the net sales price is down slightly. FX obviously contributed a little bit. But the team has really done a nice job, I think, fine-tuning their price pack, competitiveness and getting the right price points on shelf. And I think that's making a difference. The macro factors, I think they are improving slightly, but the environment is still tough. And GDP is still contracting, but maybe at a slower rate. Inflation's a little bit lower than it was this time a year ago, but the consumer, I think, is still pretty well under stress. And then back to China, I think, we are encouraged by I think the performance Q1 on China. I think organic was up low-single digit, but volume was up strong double digits, somewhat offset by lower net selling prices. Pricing environment, as Tom says, has stabilized, but it's consistent with what we've been planning. So we think we still have \u2013 we're encouraged about what's happening this year, and think our performance will be good this year in China. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just one final question, if I may, on the promotional environment; a lot of discussion this morning about it, but just wanted to touch on something or hear from you how you think that's going to evolve throughout the remainder of the year or into next, if you think about what's going on with some of the channel shift going to e-commerce. And as these brick and mortar retail partners of yours are feeling increased pressure, how much more pressure ultimately will there be on retail pricing and greater promotions? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: So if you have slower growth and you've got lots of competitors facing it that sometimes results in higher promotional environment. And so you're also seeing retailers get creative across the space in terms of do more with click and collect and there's a lot of innovation happening, not just around price, but also around service and how shoppable the categories are in different environments. And so I will expect that that will continue as we roll forward. I don't know, Mike, if there's any other color you've got on that? Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: No, we've seen this shift occur in other markets, China and Korea particularly, and we've adapted pretty well, in some cases, led that change. And so we need to be as nimble and responsive to the market conditions that we plan to be. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, and e-commerce does cause great price transparency. On the other hand, retailers have been comp shopping each other's stores in bricks and mortar for 100 years. So it's not a new phenomenon. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. So just two questions and one detail. Tom mentioned lower promo shipment in North America Personal Care and Tissue. And I know you talked a whole bunch about execution. Just what specifically \u2013 a lot of it seems like it's category and competitive landscape. So if you can give us like an anecdote or two of what the kinds of decisions you made in Q1 in North America that you'd like to change over the course of the year, independent of and maybe where some of those types of decisions have worked. Second question is, nice volume improvement in China diapers, and do you think maybe some of these lower prices in your clearly premium diaper business are maybe enabling more trade up? And if you could comment on price gaps with mid-lower tier products there and just the details. Tax rate was better this quarter. I didn't see any real change to guidance for the full year. Comment around that. Can you tell us a little bit how that flows over the course of the year? Thanks so much. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: It's a pretty comprehensive list there so, on the promo front, maybe Mike can comment a little bit on that. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. I think, with regard to North America, I think the promo timing, we had a few major events with large customer shift out of our quarter that we knew going into the year, and so we had assumed that. So that explains a bit of the shift. Probably, what was new news to us was probably the more aggressiveness in promotion activity and promotional price points, and that's the one that we're adapting to right now. And again, we're going to manage our business with discipline, but we want to be price competitive in the marketplace. With regard to China, the \u2013 oh, sorry. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: On China, I think the question was, have you seen any kind of trade up in e-com and I think, broadly, that is the case. We've just launched a super-premium diaper pant in China that we're really excited about. And moms that tend to shop in e-com tend to skew a little bit higher income and so that should be a positive for us. And then the last question... Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks. And just tax rate? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: ...was tax rate, which Maria can comment on. Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. Our tax rate, as we mentioned coming into the year, will be variable by quarter because of the various tax planning initiatives that we do. Our tax rate this quarter was slightly below what we had last quarter before the \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 last year first quarter. The full year though we still expect the tax rate to be similar to the full year that we delivered in 2016. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you very much. Comprehensive answers. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for the follow-up. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hey, Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Just wanted to follow-up specifically on the free cash flow on the quarter being much lower and then you mentioned tax (55:55) to understand a little bit more, but also each element of working capital looks worse too. Can you just talk a little bit more about that and whether even on the inventory being so high, whether we should expect some idling or anything and whether we're that level? So taxes and then working capital. Thanks. Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Sure. We expected that our tax payments would be higher this year versus last year not only in the first quarter but for the total year. The driver of that was actually tax benefits that we had last year, which lowered our overall cash tax expense. This year, in terms of cash taxes it's a much more normalized level, so we'll be impacted by that year-on-year. On working capital, working capital was actually good for the quarter; our cash conversion days for 2018 (56:50), which is down four days from the average of last year. The primary benefit there is in payables. In terms of inventory, we clearly have room to continue to optimize our inventory. And both our supply chain teams and our finance teams are very focused on this. We made really good progress on that last year. There'll be some timing effects as we go through the year, but that's an area where we're very focused on it to drive down inventory as part of our overall working capital program. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: One difference though. You might be looking just that fourth quarter only working capital number. We tend to compare to the full year average, because there is a bit of cyclicality as the year rolls through. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, I was looking at Q4, so I didn't quite get that answer, but okay. Okay. Thanks. Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. We were very, very low in the fourth quarter last year. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me on. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: We obviously cover a lot ground so I just got a couple of quick questions I'll try pound through quickly. First, Mike, I think you mentioned that some promotion shifted out of this quarter. Was that a shift into the fourth quarter of last year or is that a shift into second quarter? Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Well, one, I think part of the shift was out of our plan entirely for the year, and then part of it was shifting into the second and third quarters of this year. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. So it's a little more programming, as you mentioned, kind of in the second quarter and back of the year, but a lot of comments also in terms of cadence and comparisons. As we look forward through the remainder of the year, as you've highlighted, second half comps get easy. The second quarter comps get really tough, particularly in North America Tissue and Personal Care. And it sounds like the environment's pretty darn challenged. Is it fair to expect the second quarter to look sort of comparable if not a little more challenged than what was seen in the first quarter? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Jason, we don't give quarterly guidance as you know, so I think you can do the math as easy as we can and you're correct in assessing that the comps get tougher in the second quarter. But, beyond that, I'm probably not going to give you any more color on quarterly guidance. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Fair enough. And in China, encouraging to hear that sequentially prices are sort of holding pretty consistent with what we're seeing in admittedly limited scope Nielsen got out of that market. As we go into the back half and we comp the price decrease assuming we hold, obviously, year-on-year pricing looks better from there. Should we expect year-on-year volume to decelerate at the same time? In other words, are you seeing the volume lift because of this year-on-year price degradation that's going to abate once the price degradation is no longer there? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: No, not at all. The volume actually has been pretty strong throughout and so is it's been more of a function of innovation and category growth and consumer spending power and that we expect those stronger results to come through more clearly in the back half of the year. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I'll give you, Jason, a couple of factors why we believe that. One, we do have news, as Tom mentioned, great new innovation in super premium tier 6. Second, the birthrate is increasing. Two years ago, I think the birthrate was about 16 million live births. Last year, we estimated around 17.5 million. And this year, it could be as high as 20 million. And so that's kind of in our favor. And then we're also are expanding our penetration of cities, and we'll continue to add cities in distribution this year. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good stuff. All right. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on. I know we're out of time. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Jason. Operator : At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. Thank you. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: All right, we appreciate everybody's time today. We we'll wrap up with a comment from Tom. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Well, once again, we are continuing to execute our Global Business Plan and allocating capital in shareholder friendly ways. And we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thanks very much. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines, and thank you for joining us today.",

We now have your presenters and conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we'll be opening the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedures to follow if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's second quarter earnings conference call. With us this morning are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here's the agenda for the call. Tom will start with some opening comments about the current environment. Maria will then review our second quarter results and after that Tom will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the year. And we'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Lastly, we'll be comparing our 2017 results to 2016 adjusted results, which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Before Maria gives you some of the details on the quarter, I thought I would comment on how I see the environment overall and then how we're approaching it. So, while I remain optimistic about our long-term future, the near-term environment has become more challenging than maybe we saw at the beginning of the year. So category growth has slowed broadly in lots of places over the last year or so, and we expect that growth will pick back up over time, but that pickup may not happen quickly. In the meantime, competitive activity has increased, including higher spending in North America over the last 12 months. So in this environment, we continue to focus on what we think are the fundamentals that create long-term shareholder value. That means we're continuing to invest behind our brands by launching innovation, pursuing targeted growth initiatives and then supporting our brands with strong marketing campaigns. At the same time, we fine-tune some of our promotion strategies and we have a heightened focus on delivering more cost savings and tightly controlling our discretionary spending in an environment like this. We're also continuing to manage our company with financial discipline and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. So in short, we continue to execute our strategies for long-term success, and we are adjusting our near-term plans as we operate in a more difficult environment. And with that, I'll turn it over to Maria for a review of our second quarter results. Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Sales and earnings were down slightly, reflecting a challenging environment, as Tom just described, and comparison to strong results last year. We delivered significant cost savings in the quarter, and we've increased our full year cost savings outlook. And finally, we're on track with our overall capital plan. Now let's take a look at the details, starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 1% year-on-year due to lower organic sales. Tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes. On profitability, second quarter gross margin was 36.1%, that's down 20 basis points year-on-year. Operating margin was 17.5%, down 50 basis points. While margins were down slightly overall, I'm encouraged with the improvements that we achieved in our Personal Care and K-C Professional business segments, and also in the developing and emerging markets overall. Commodities were a $75 million drag in the second quarter, and for the full year, we're now expecting inflation of $200 million to $300 million, that's $50 million higher than our previous estimate driven by higher pulp costs. Our teams continued to deliver significant FORCE cost savings. Second quarter savings were $120 million and we've increased our full year savings target to $425 million to $450 million. Our original target was for savings of at least $400 million. Given the current environment, we are also tightly managing our overhead spending. On the bottom line, second quarter earnings per share were $1.49, down 3% year-on-year. Lower equity income reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, offset by a lower share count and a slightly better effective tax rate. Now let's take a look at cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $825 million, in line with our expectations. Cash flow was down compared to $860 million in the year-ago quarter, including the impact of higher tax payments this year. Second quarter working capital cash conversion cycle was down six days compared to full year 2016, bringing the year-to-date decline to five days. We're making very good progress in this area, and we expect to nicely exceed our original one-day improvement target for the full year. We also continue to manage capital spending in this environment, and we now expect that full year spending will be in the lower half of our $850 million to $950 million target range. On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million. We continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases will total between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. Looking at our segments, in Personal Care, organic sales fell 1% due to lower net selling prices. Organic sales were up 2% in developing and emerging markets but were down elsewhere. Personal Care operating margins were 20.6%, up 60 basis points. The improvement was driven by cost savings, partially offset by lower selling prices and higher input costs. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2%, driven by North America. Overall, Consumer Tissue operating margins were 16.5%, down 190 basis points. The results were impacted by lower sales and higher pulp costs. In K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were up 1%, with gains in all major geographies. K-C Professional operating margins were 20.1%, up 150 basis points. The comparison included benefits from cost savings. So in summary, our second quarter results were impacted by difficult environment with weaker economies, category softness and increased competitive activity. Nonetheless, we are achieving strong cost savings, we're generating healthy cash flow, and we're allocating capital in shareholder-friendly ways. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Maria. I'll provide more detail on our top line sales and market conditions, and then I'll address our full-year outlook. As Maria just mentioned, our organic sales were down 1% in the quarter as we're operating in a challenging growth environment. In our consumer businesses in North America, organic sales fell by 2% that were impacted by category softness, lower promotional shipments and higher competitive activity. Just for perspective, in the categories that we compete in, in North America, the total market declined by about 1% in the quarter. Looking at our businesses in North America, Personal Care volumes were off 1%. In the infant and child care mega category, our volumes were down mid-single digits. Beyond tough comparisons, results were impacted by competitive activity and lower category demand, which is down about 1% year-to-date following last year's 1% decline in the U.S. growth rate. On the other hand, volumes were up mid-single-digits in baby wipes and low single-digits in adult care. In adult care, we're introducing an improved Depend product this quarter, and we're increasing marketing and promotion support to help drive more growth in this category. Our Consumer Tissue volumes were down 4%, and that compares to a 6% growth in the base period. We'd expect some better performance in Consumer Tissue in the back half of the year as we got a stronger promotional calendar planned and we're making some targeted promotion changes on Kleenex facial tissue. Turning to developed markets outside of North America, organic sales were down 3% in the second quarter. Sales were down in Personal Care in South Korea, where the diaper category is being impacted by a pretty significant decline in the birth rate. We expect results to pick up some in the second half of the year as we got some diaper and feminine care product upgrades in the market and we're also relaunching our baby wipes business there. Volumes were also down in the quarter in Consumer Tissue in Western and Central Europe, reflecting a continued challenging environment there. Moving to developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 2% in the second quarter. For the first half of the year, organic sales have increased by 3%, with volume growth of more than 5%. So, I'm encouraged by our volume performance and, overall, we're largely on track with our plans in these markets. Looking at second quarter performance in some of our key markets. In China, organic sales in diapers were similar year-on-year as higher volumes and improved mix were offset by lower selling prices. And while competitive activity picked up somewhat in the second quarter, we continue to be optimistic that pricing won't be as negative in China this year as it was last year. We launched several innovations in China in the second quarter. And going forward, we plan to continue to focus on driving winning product solutions behind our Huggies brand. Moving to Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care were down high single-digits compared to a 10% increase in the year-ago period. Through six months, organic sales in Brazil are similar year-on-year, which is probably a better indicator of our underlying trends. While category volumes are still down in Brazil, our volumes were up mid single-digits, aided by innovation and changes to our promotional strategies there. In Argentina, organic sales in Personal Care were up mid-teens driven by higher selling prices. Although category volumes are still down pretty significantly, our volumes are up somewhat following the relaunch of Huggies diapers earlier this year. And then lastly in Eastern Europe, our organic sales in diapers rose about 10%, as our teams there delivered another double-digit volume increase this quarter. We've also recently introduced several innovations on Huggies in Russia to help us drive even more growth. Now beyond our sales performance, I'll just briefly build on Maria's comments to say that I am encouraged with the FORCE cost savings, our improvements in working capital, and the cash we've been able to return to shareholders in the first half of the year. Now turning to our outlook. In terms of our full year targets, we expect organic sales will be similar or up slightly year-on-year. Our prior assumption was for growth of 1% to 2%. We still expect growth in the second half of the year to pick up somewhat from the first half, and that's largely due to easier comparisons along with benefits from innovations and other steps we're taking to improve our performance. On the bottom line, we expect that earnings per share will be at the low end of our target range of $6.20 to $6.35. That reflects our new outlook for organic sales and cost inflation, along with additional cost savings, some overhead spending reductions, and a slightly lower effective tax rate. Our priorities for the second half of the year are as follows : first, to execute on our brand fundamentals with excellence to make sure we improve our top line performance; second, to deliver cost savings to help keep our margins healthy; and third and finally, to generate strong cash flow. Our teams are very focused on these priorities and our plan is to deliver sales and earnings growth in the back half of the year. Beyond the near term, over the long term, we're committed to continuing our long track record of making changes to improve our company so that we achieve success for our brands, for our businesses, and for our shareholders. That wraps up our prepared remarks and now we'll begin to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hey, good morning Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to talk a little bit about the competitive environment in North America you called out across the consumer businesses. Is it, one, primarily from branded players, is it private label, and then also just how retailers are kind of playing into all of that or stimulating the change in the environment? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I'll give you a couple of comments, and maybe Mike can give a little bit more color. I mean I think the answer is probably all of the above. When you have weaker category growth overall and you have about the same number of people fighting over it, you can see that play out. And there is no question, there is channel shifting going on as e-commerce grows and that's putting pressure on lots of retailers. Maybe Mike has some other comments to add. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: No, I definitely agree with that, Lauren. I'd say it's probably certainly branded players and then also private labels have an effect, too. I would say North America is always competitive, but we are really focused on the fundamentals that we need to bring, which is innovation, creating longer-term shareholder value. We are really focused on building the categories and so we got a really strong line-up of winning products out there right now. But we got to really fine-tune what's in our current marketing plans and promotions to improve our competitiveness in the market. We're also focused on, as Tom mentioned earlier, improving our in-store execution in the second half. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And with in-store execution, and you mentioned kind of promotional adjustments, it feels like a lot of your category volume, maybe less so for tissue but more in personal care is sort of naturally shifting more online. So, how effective do you feel like for the focus on in-store, is there things that you're also doing to better position your businesses online right. We know Amazon has \u2013 we know they've made their push in diapers and wipes, and it looks like wipes is probably the piece that's had some success. So what are you also doing from an online standpoint, not just in-store? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I mean, in-store to us, I guess, broadly means whatever mom wants to shop. So that's a traditional bricks-and-mortar retail or an online retail, so it's making sure you got the right items in distribution, the right pricing, the right merchandising support. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, we've got a lot of resources focused on driving online growth and working with our customers on their online strategies. And obviously all of our customers or many of our customers are working towards the same end. I would say we're making pretty good progress in growing online. Still the majority of our business is still sold offline, but we're making good progress, but not satisfied with our online performance. But I'd say, bringing us back to the offline portion, I think if you characterize our first half, we were going up against a very strong comp in the first half last year and some of our promotion plans, kind of, were balanced more, tilted towards the second half this year. So, we are expecting much stronger performance in the back half, particularly of our family care business with promotions. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hey, Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So I have a few questions. One is just on organic sales, obviously, they continue to be challenging, clearly more challenging than we last talked. But you also say that you expect the top line to grow again. I'm trying to understand the underlying reasoning for that, and I guess, more specifically, is that the conclusion from Mike's strategic review that you said he was doing? Or is that yet to come really thinking about the long-term 3% to 5% organic sales growth target? And if that's not the conclusion from that review, when should we get that verdict? And then, also want to talk about margins, almost in a similar vein, I mean, FORCE has done just extraordinarily well for you guys, obviously continuing to do so and now raising it, recently the target for this year. Can you give us a sense of how much of that needs to be reinvested? And where exactly are the savings coming from, in particular because you're seeing Consumer Tissue margins fall so much this quarter? Should we be thinking about cost cutting not coming from there anymore, FORCE not coming from there anymore and kind of Consumer Tissue margins being past peak? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. Well, I think I got a lot of those. So, on the top line, I mean, a lot of it is, if you look at our North American business and, Paul, you can check me on the numbers, I think first half last year we were up 5%, in the back half we were flat. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Correct. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: So, just the comp will lead you more to growth naturally, just as we continue with the rate that we're on. So, I think the things that's probably different than on our top line look overall is the category declines, really some of the birthrate declines, both in North America and in places like Korea. You can still see category weakness in some of the Latin American markets, although some of the more recent data has been a little bit more encouraging on that front. In terms of the strategic review, I mean, I wouldn't say any of what we're talking about today is related to that. I mean, the strategic review is tending to look long-term and we still see the category potential in all of our categories as the developing and emerging markets grow. But how quickly we get to that future and the environment that we're in is still something that we're taking a look at. Coming back to FORCE, I don't know, Maria, if you want to comment on cost savings? Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, we do continue to deliver significant cost savings through the FORCE program, and we were able to take up the full year target. And what I'd say is that as the program name implies, our teams really are Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere. When you look at our supply chain savings that includes improving productivity and waste across our manufacturing operations, driving down the cost of our facilities, optimizing the cost of our product specifications and continually negotiating lower input costs or material costs of our products. And year-to-date, we are at 4% of cost of goods, which is really a strong performance, not only internally but benchmarks very well. I continue to see opportunities for us to continue to deliver the FORCE cost savings as we move forward. So good performance there, and I think more opportunity there. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, we come back to the reinvestment rate. If you look at the cost savings we generated relative to the commodity costs and other things that hit us, I mean, you can see that even though we had a great cost savings quarter, we still had gross margins that were down because of lower pricing and higher commodity costs, so and the biggest single factor in the Tissue margins was pulp price change year-over-year. And the FORCE cost savings probably fell a little bit more in the Personal Care segment this quarter, which is where the margin improvement occurred. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: If I can go back to sort of the strategic review. Tom, you mentioned in your remarks, we're committed to making the changes to improve our company going forward. Is that something that's also being thought through in the strategic review? And what I mean by that is when do we get confirmation about 3% to 5% organic sales growth top line, not to put too much pressure on you Mike, but when do we get confirmation on that or a different number? And also are you going to tell us about perhaps some other changes, like how you are in Europe PC, maybe a bigger breakup, for example, the company or something. I mean, is there a timeframe for us to be thinking about when you guys would tell us, Mike, the outcome of your strategic review? And whether it touches all those elements? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, Ali, I think your plan for the strategic review might be a little more glorious than what we're looking at. I mean, really what Mike and his team are trying to do and he can kind of add some comment to it as well as to say what are the things we need to do to really unlock the potential of our business in China, or how do we grow our adult care business everywhere when we see the huge opportunity there, and to kind of take us to the next level of performance and how our company operates and realizes the potential that we see in our categories everywhere. So that's under way. It's more about probably how we work together and use the matrix inside the company. It's not a portfolio analysis as you would have described it. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Go ahead, Mike. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I'd just add that, yeah, we're certainly excited about the long-term development growth of our categories. We do believe we're operating in some of the fastest-growing categories because of our D&E potential longer term. And so, we're really focused on category development and internally, we call it development of the white space for us. But we also recognize that the last couple of years have been a little slower and so we are working to see, hey, when do we get back onto that track. That said probably, and you may not find earth shattering news from us, but it's probably going to result in greater focus and more intentional development of some of our categories and geographies. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. So, we shouldn't expect anything like in Analyst Day or presentation or anything? That was, all right, I also thought that's what is going to come out of this, but it sounds like no. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: We give you our 2018 guidance; we'll give you an update on where we're at, at that stage so. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks Ali. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. I guess, I want to pick up on Ali's line of questioning, because I think his line of questioning was very much focused in terms of the long-term trajectory and the intrinsic value of the company. And I think that's important because as I've had lots of conversations from investors, there's really been two sticking points for people. One is the path to return to the type of growth that you used to be able to realize in Personal Care, and the second is the glide path to where margins can go in Tissue and Professional, particularly with the consternation of private label, price aggression. So, I was hoping you could delve in a little bit more deeply there. You mentioned category growth has slowed, can you give us some more context around what you think the drivers are and what levers may be there to get us back to reacceleration? And then a little bit deeper on the Consumer Tissue side. The results today are likely to do nothing other than sort of fuel those concerns with margins sort of rolling in that business, pricing under pressure despite input cost inflation, is there reason to believe that private label competitive dynamics in that market are indeed going to be ratcheted a lot higher on the forward and likely going to be causing some \u2013 a minimal cap on margins there, if not some downward pressure? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Okay. A lot of questions, Jason, we'll do the best we can on those, so coming back to the growth path and some of the drivers of weaker categories, I mean, in Personal Care and baby and child care in particular, it's been birthrate-related in a lot of the developed markets. So we had kind of projected 2016 was going to be a flat birthrate year. In the second quarter, we got the final fourth quarter numbers that showed it down 2% for the fourth quarter, which brought the full year down 1%. So that obviously has caused category growth to be weaker than we would've anticipated going into 2017. Korea's birthrate, I think, we got the final 2016 numbers, was down 7%, which is a pretty big, big drop. So I think there is potentially lots of reasons, we don't really understand it at a deep enough consumer insight level, I'd say. But a broad trend is that Millennials are having their children a little later, as long as they have the same number, we're in good shape because the category growth will return. You have to go through the adjustment while that age shift happens from a demographic standpoint. So I think in Latin America, we've seen some of the negative category growth, and that's really economically driven because of some of the economic recession, with GDP per capita going backwards in places like Brazil and Argentina. I'd say in the last couple of share periods in Brazil, we've seen a little bit more positive category growth and things seem to be returning more to an equilibrium there. Argentina is still a little bit volatile, we're seeing negative category trends and positive pricing trends, and so that's putting a lot of pressure on the consumer. In other markets where you're seeing some category negatives were places that had big currency swings last year and where we took pricing and some of that pricing has come back out of the market this year, that would be markets like Russia and other key markets in Eastern Europe. So probably a bunch of things happening, some demographic, some economic, that put pressure on our categories in the first half of the year. On tissue margins, I mean, good progress on KCP in the quarter and continue to see opportunity there as that business builds around the world. On consumer tissue, it's probably always going to be a little bit more volatile and affected by pulp prices. We've seen good progress lately over the last couple of years. We were kind of asked where can it go from there, and we thought that high-teens was kind of the right place for consumer tissue to land in the near to medium term. And if I look at our year-to-date margins in consumer tissue, I think, it's 17.7%, so we are in the ballpark, it was a little lower than that in the second quarter, that's usually a light facial tissue quarter and we had a little bit higher pulp prices. So I'd say we're not concerned about the current tissue trends. Private-label shares, as you mentioned, are up a tick in towels, but haven't seen a lot of share movement on private label really anywhere at this stage. So I don't know if that covers most of what you had, Jason; I think so. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, I think, so. And it was a loaded question. So, I will be respectful of other's people time and pass it on. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, good morning. First, in terms of baby and child care promotion, I mean how much of this is being funded by you versus the retailer? Maybe can you talk about North American price by sort of major product segments, it looks like price was flat overall, but I imagine there is a fair bit of difference in your segment? And I know you are not funding the majority of it, but how are you adjusting sort of your long-term plans to help combat against an environment in which the consumer is starting to get more and more used to lower prices, bigger and better deals particularly in that category? Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yes, I mean, you are right, Olivia, retailers determine the final finished products selling price in North America and that's the way it's always been. And so we go to market with a consistent trade deal. And then our customers decide how they want to apply those funds and whether they want to invest some of their own funds to attract the young family into their retail environment. And that's kind of been the way the game has been played for a long, long time and that's really not any different now. It was the way Wal-Mart played as they grew and certainly some of the e-commerce players are offering hot deals to try to make sure the family gets converted to their shopping. In terms of how do we flex in that environment, we're trying to make sure we've got a winning product proposition, number one, that you've got great product superiority, you got good marketing and innovation coming, and that you're communicating all of that to the consumer and that's changing with digital and social and all the other tools that we have. But I don't know, Mike, if you want to add any more color on that? Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: No. Yeah, certainly, Olivia, I think funding or you could see it in our numbers, I think, our price levels are comparable versus year ago. I would say probably the softness that we are seeing in the category primarily is driven by retail pricing. I think our overall plan though is and we're not happy about the softness, there is some shift into training pants and I think that's healthy for the category overall except in the way that it's occurring, we're not happy about the impact on our Polis business because some of that is being driven by the lower prices. We are focused on innovation and being the category leaders and trying to drive the category to growth. And that means bringing in innovation, we're the consumer-preferred brand, strong consumer preferred brand proposition and so we're really focused on category driving messaging on the training pant category. And then in diapers, again, we continue to bring news, but we are recognizing we probably need to fine-tune our plans to make sure, and we have done that to make sure that we're competitive on promotion. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. And then I guess in terms of North American consumer tissue, why do you think private labels is gaining the momentum that it is and why do you think there's so much of a push in promotion in tissue because, obviously, I understand the desire to winning new mom in diapers, but it's not as obvious in tissue? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I think that in some ways, I've got kind of the private-label shares here across our business. If you looked at it, it was up a tick versus the previous quarter and probably paper towels is the area where we've seen the most share growth generally. And if you think about it, there's relatively low cost of product failure in the paper towel category. So if the towel doesn't work, you take another one, as opposed to personal care where if the diaper leaks or the fem pad leaks, you've got a major problem. And so, I think, that's probably been part of it. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. And Olivia, I think, the thing that we'll say is, tissue, just like diapers, they tend to be strong traffic drivers for the retailers, and so that's why you're probably seeing some intensified activity there. I think, given what's going on in the economy and the retail environment, there are some external factors that are kind of tailwinds for private-label expansion. However, we do believe that retailers, when they're competing, compete more effectively and successfully with national brands because of that value proposition that's more transparent to brands. And so we really feel like our job is to bring the innovation and the category-driving messaging. And you don't have to look further than what we've done in adult care, I think, if you looked 10 years ago, I think the category had been inverted. We lost our leading share position to private label. The team went back to the brand foundations and really focused on bringing value-added news like Real Fit, and I think that's driven over double-digit share increases in that period and got us back to the right leadership and the right category expansion profile. So we recognize, given the economy, you're going to see some of this fluctuation, but we're focused on bringing innovation and the right messaging for the category. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And if I can just sneak in one more on feminine care. Can you talk a little bit about the trends post the launch of U by Kotex, because at least from the tracked channel data, it doesn't look like much has changed so far? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Are you asking about fitness? Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, yeah. So I think volumes were down, but we're lapping, Olivia, 10% growth in the year-ago base period. So last year, some of our results benefited by some promotional shipments and then some distribution gains. So our market shares were flat sequentially and down a little bit versus Q2 last year. We did launch UbK fitness. I think we're off to a good start, it's on track. Consumer feedback is strong and we're just rolling out the marketing support behind that launch right now. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Olivia. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Good morning, Bonnie. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I have a bit of a follow-on question on your consumer tissue business. I was hoping you could touch on some of the executional issues you called out last quarter. Do you guys think you did a better job in Q2, broadly speaking? And then maybe specifically, do you think you did a better job of matching some of the promotions in the quarter with your displays, for instance? And then, where are you at with your price points in your tissue business? I think you guys have mentioned you wanted to sharpen those? And then finally, what other changes have you made to drive better growth in this business? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. Bonnie, couple of changes. Just for a couple of facts, and I'm assuming most of those questions relate to North America. So our North America volume was down 4% in the second quarter, and that's up against a plus-6% comp in the year-ago base period. So that does reflect some lower promotional shipments and stronger competitive activity that happened in the quarter. Q2 was an improvement versus our 7% decline in the first quarter, but we still have a lot of work to do. We're not satisfied with our performance yet. We have better activity coming up in the second half. We strengthened the promotion calendar. I think our field selling organization is better prepared in the second half with their events. And we fine-tuned some of our pricing, most notably on Kleenex, where we did take a price increase early in the year, the beginning of the year, and we've adjusted some of that on-shelf pricing given the market conditions and we're expecting better results. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So bottom line, you think second half, obviously, should ramp in this specific business given things that you can control and just maybe broadly, do you think the competitive environment should ease, or do you expect that to still be pretty heightened? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Don't know. I don't know how to answer that, but we're going to focus on what we control, which is improving our execution. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just maybe a quick question on China. You've been lapping some easy price compares in the market now for quite some time. So, I guess, I'm curious what gives you the confidence that this can improve in the second half, especially I guess given that Procter, I think, is about to finally begin rolling out a new diaper product in August, I think? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of the pricing started in the back half of last year, and so I think, we're just going to start to lap easier price compares in the back half of this year. So I'd say we had some benefit from mix in this quarter as we had a little heavier newborn shipments last year. We still see strong underlying category growth. It's still a tough competitive market. I don't know, Mike, if you want to give any other color on that front? Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I think, the market and the competitive environment certainly remains very active. But we do think the pricing situation has eased compared to this time a year ago. We remain pretty excited and confident in our China business. We're expecting better volume gains in the second half and for the full year behind double-digit category growth. We do have best-in-class innovation. We rolled out a new tier 7 product earlier this year, and I think, that's performing very well. We've got premium tier diaper pants that are out in the marketplace. So, I think we've got the right innovation and the right products out there, and I think the team is doing a great job. And I think the long-term opportunity for growth in China is huge, as you know, and it's about five times as many births per year and the market size is, depending on what numbers you want to look at, comparable. And so over the long-term, this market is going to be much larger than the U.S. And so we've got a lot of opportunity to grow. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Bonnie. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. So, Tom, I think you said in your prepared remarks that you seemed happy with the developing and emerging market progress so far year-to-date relative to your plan. I guess was that a volume comment, or was that a comment reflective of both volume and pricing and overall organic growth? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I would say that it's more directed to volume, but if you look at their results overall, and their sales in dollars, their profit in dollars, they're tracking much closer to their plan. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So then trying to decompose the roundabout two-point reduction in organic growth outlook from where we started the year, is it really all related to the category volume pressures that you called out related to the U.S. and Korea in birthrates, or just versus the stronger competitive environment that we've also talked about? I'm trying to assess if it's not D&E, and it's not D&E volumes, is it just developed market volumes and birthrate, that really two points? Or there's competition? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I'd say, no, there's probably two factors. One is currency-related pricing rollback. So as the dollar has weakened relative to where it was a year ago, there's markets like Russia, where we took pretty aggressive pricing and had to roll some of that back this year. You're seeing some of the same factors in Brazil. And then obviously, there's some continued price competition in markets like China. So price is one factor. Some of it related to a weaker dollar that is part of it, and then category growth in developed markets, as we discussed, is probably the other factor. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, so pricing coming back in D&E markets, but no volume, no volume, no positive volume actually? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, and if you look at our decompose of this quarter, it was flat volume, minus 1 price. And a lot of that price rollback was some of the markets where there were some currency-driven pricing last year. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. To Bonnie's question on P&G's upcoming launch, have you factored any \u2013 I'm assuming that wasn't in your original outlook. Is there any incremental cushion you baked in for that? Or it sounds like you're kind of assuming kind of business as usual, I'm just trying to assess if that's the case, or if you've baked in some allowances there? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I'd say business as usual in China as it's a competitive environment with lots of terrific product launches, primarily from our Japanese and other competitors. And so we had assumed going in that China was going to be a competitive environment with lots of competitive launch activity and that has played out. And so I would say, again our team is focused on beating the best product in the market. And if that is P&G with this launch, then that will be who we're aiming at. But at this point, in recent times, it's been more the Japanese players that have had significant product news that we've been up against. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, that's fair enough. And just if I could sneak in one more, I asked about this last call too, just want to see if we're still on the same trajectory. I think $800 million to $1 billion in buybacks was the outlook coming into the year, you seem to be running ahead of that, just want to checkpoint there? And then also on interest expense you had assumed that would be down, I know that you've got some August notes you're going to reissue. But it also seems like you issued more debt in the quarter than I expected. So what's the outlook on those two numbers as well, if I could? Thanks. Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Sure. On the buyback, the $800 million to $1 billion is still the right number for the year. We're on track with that. And in terms of the interest expense, we did some pre-funding on the $950 million that comes due in August, which is why you see a higher debt number at the end of the quarter, but that should normalize. And the debt that we'll take out in August is a pretty high coupon, it's 6.125%, and so that will be replaced with lower interest rate debt and that should bring the interest expense down for the year. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Maria G. Henry - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yep. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Stephen. Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Hi, Nik. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Just two quick questions. There's been a lot of commentary recently at least this earnings season from a variety of companies on the U.S. weakening. And I mean we have our own theories, I'm just curious on kind of your assessment from the company's standpoint on what's driving the sequential deterioration? And then the second question is, just wanted to understand did the amount of promotions, particularly in North America, pickup as the quarter went on or has it been more steady? Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. In terms of the U.S. category growth rate, as we looked at that year-over-year, I mean, the big driver is infant and child care in terms of why we're down. If you kind of look across the categories, adult care is still growing mid-single digits. Baby wipes is still growing low single digits. FemCare is pretty flat. Consumer tissue is pretty flat. And value of infant and child care is down 5%, it's like 1% volume and 4% price. And so net-net, our total categories were down 1% with a good chunk of it being driven by birthrate and then competitive pricing activity in baby and child care. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then on the promotion question? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Promotion side, I mean, I wouldn't say it's more competitive. Mike, maybe you have a different view of that? Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, Nik, no, I would say comparable to the first quarter. And I think, well, birthrate is a driver in the diaper business, and there is multiple reasons for that, including the hypothesis around the way in household formation. There is a decline in some Hispanic household births. So, that's one side. But I think the competitive activity has been, I would say, at a higher level than we've experienced in recent years. And that probably started in the back half of last year and has persisted through Q1 and now Q2. And certainly we recognize the need to adjust and fine tune our promotional plans and strategy and we're doing that. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, thanks a lot. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks Nik. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : So first question, this is picking up on Steve's question, can you quantify for us and bridge the 2% organic sales growth that you were targeting at the start of the year and now sort of flattish, and specifically how much of it is a slowdown in the category, is that a point versus how much is maybe market share losses that were not anticipated? And then related to that, so your guidance now suggests something like up modestly, maybe up 1% in the back half of the year, what's implied in that from an industry growth perspective? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I mean, I think we've probably given you about as much detail on this as I can give you. I'm just kind of looking in January, I think if you recall, organic volume was up 2% and price was going to be similar to up slightly. And now we're going to tell you our volume is up slightly and price is probably going to be down slightly. And so, if that's helpful. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : It's helpful, but what's the expectation for the industry? So in other words, I mean, is there an expectation that you're going to see market share in the back half of the year? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I'd say our expectation is that our share should improve relative to where we are in the first half of the year. I'd expect the birthrate change isn't going to shift quickly. So, given that we had the 2% decline in births in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, that's going to roll over into this year. And I don't think the Korean birthrate that we talked about is going to turn around quickly either. So I think you are going to see some of the continued drag on category, and then we'll see where share falls out. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then one follow-up, just sticking with the share question. So we're kind of limited here for now, it's a bit of a blackbox in terms of what's going on online across categories, not specifically the ones that you are participating in. Would we draw any wrong conclusions by looking at the share trends in the Nielsen data? Are you seeing drastically different share trends for your business online? Because I guess, the way we look at it now, it's a challenging environment, but the market share performance for your portfolio has certainly been difficult. I mean as I look at it over the most recent 12 weeks, you've lost market share to varying degrees across your portfolio. Are you seeing something similar in the online channel? Or is there very different dynamics going on? So any commentary there would be helpful? And I guess if the answer is, it looks similar, are investment levels appropriate now, both with respect to trade investment, and with respect to advertising and marketing? Does that need to move higher? Is the cost of business moving higher, even while category growths are slowing? So any commentary there would be helpful. And that's it for me. Thank you. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I think, Kevin, certainly the offline and non-measured share performance is better than the measured at this point. Our online growth is accelerating and our shares continue to grow. That said, I think we're not happy with our share performance in North America, and we are fine-tuning our plans to make sure that our share performance improves in the back half. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning. So I just had a couple of follow-up questions. One on Consumer Tissue. So first, can you just clarify for us, it looks like pulp costs have increased versus April. But then, it also seems like you're not really able to transfer those cost increases to retailers. Can you just confirm that that's just because of the retail transformation that we're seeing especially in your categories? And is there any expectation that that is going to change as input costs potentially continue to increase? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. There's no question, pulp prices are up sequentially, and our outlook is for them to moderate a bit in the back half of the year because our full year outlook for pulp price is slightly below what the current market price is. And up until this point, it hasn't resulted in any major finished product selling price increases, and I think the question is going to be more on the expected outlook for pulp. And if people are expecting that to moderate, which at the moment they are, that makes it a little tougher to pass finished product selling prices along. And so, at this point, it hasn't resulted in finished product pricing. We have gotten some pricing in our Professional business. And they've had some similar trends on secondary fiber as you've seen on virgin fiber, but again, it is tough broadly getting selling price increases in developed markets at this point. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just on the competitive environment where you've talked about market share losses, I think this question was asked earlier, but could you just clarify for us how much of this is coming from, like, your primary competitor, like Procter? And how much of it is coming from smaller players? So asked another way, are you seeing, especially, as consumers are shopping more and more online, are you seeing a higher growth in potentially niche brands or private label, specifically online? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Are you talking about any particular market, Faiza? Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I would say North America specifically, and maybe more so on the diaper side, or just infant child care? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I mean, so I'd say, in North America broadly, our shares have been fairly similar sequentially, and I think we're down about 1 point year-on-year. In infant care, Procter has picked up most of that behind their Easy Ups launch last year. I think in another category, I think Mike commented on FemCare, I think it's down two-tenths sequentially and there is not much to talk about there. Adult care, I think we're up four-tenths sequentially. And if you look at some of the tissue brands, kind of a similar story. Facial tissue, we're down a couple of points year-over-year and up a tenth sequentially. Dry bath, we're down 1 point year-on-year and up 1 point sequentially. Paper towels, we're down a little under 1 point year-on-year and up a tenth sequentially. And so, yeah, a little bit better, kind of a mixed performance sequentially and a little bit down year-on-year and most of it with the exception of paper towels has been other branded competitors. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (UK): Thank you very much. Morning all. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, could you just talk us through where both pulp and reclaimed paper costs are at year-on-year and how you expect that to progress in the second half? And how we should think about its impact on pricing in both Consumer Tissue and Professional? And secondly, I guess, a much wider question. I think the U.S. is almost unique amongst developed markets in having a branded Consumer Tissue category where companies can actually earn a return meaningfully in excess of their cost of capital. What sort of gives you comfort that this is sustainable and that what we're seeing now isn't the start of a slide where the U.S. Consumer Tissue ends up looking like Europe or Australia where it's almost completely commoditized? Thanks very much. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Okay, on the pulp question. We typically quote eucalyptus pricing, because that's our biggest virgin fiber category. So our outlook is for $950 to $975 a ton on average for the year. I think the current market price is a little bit above that. And that compares to about $850 last year. So it's about $100 to $125 a ton would be our call up year-on-year. Secondary fiber, our call, again, there's a wide variety of grades that you can buy there. We're looking at a double-digit increase versus 2016 and it's in the low $200 a ton for the typical grade that we look at. And the broader margin question, I mean, we do have Consumer Tissue businesses all over the world and with some wide ranging market structures. So U.S. has consistently been a pretty high margin market, but we have other markets like Peru, for example, or Mexico that are similarly very, very profitable high margin markets for us. And even, yeah, markets like Korea and Australia are still reasonably good performing markets. And so we think the strength of brand and innovation in North America is justifying the value that we're delivering. And we've got scale and efficiency here and that seems to be playing out and supporting the margin levels for most of the players in the category. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (UK): Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. So Tom, just back on your comments on, and I think Mike as well alluded for emerging market. And I understand, of course, China, you are probably lapping what you mentioned in terms of price declines. But I was curious about Brazil, you mentioned that you're probably growing mid single-digits. You also commented about Russia, which similar to Brazil, you have some kind of like return of the FX kind of like now becoming a tailwind. How can we layer that with, for example, in Brazil, one of your competitors consolidating, the same competitor that consolidated in Mexico, is the competitive environment getting marginally worse there so you have to kind of pull back some of the pricing, some of the promotions into pricing which we're seeing by other multinationals there doing the same thing? Or how should we think, which goes against of course the economy has been improving from its bottom, but if you think about like competitive environment getting worse as we marginally think about Brazil pricing? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I mean, I would have said, at least the economic environment in Brazil is getting marginally better, and we've seen that in a little bit healthier category trends in the last couple of share periods. And it's been a competitive environment throughout. So I wouldn't say that we've seen a big step-up in Brazil competitive activity. Mike, I don't know, you were just down there not long ago, so you may have a different comment to add? Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, I think we're cautiously optimistic about both maybe Brazil and Argentina about the economy showing signs of improvement, although that hasn't fully translated into our categories yet. However, yeah, I think you're right, the competitive environment remains active and probably throughout our second quarter, maybe what we're getting is more volume than price. And I think the team has adjusted their plans to be able to plan that environment little more effectively. What they've done is improved their lower-tiers or their Tier 2 product to make that more competitive and then adjusted some price packs to make the on-shelf affordability better. So I, I think we're cautiously optimistic about Latin America. I think the team is largely on track with what they set out for the year. And then, with CEE, which you mentioned in Russia, we're pretty excited about that business. Even though they still have tough economic conditions, I think the consumer still demonstrates that they're willing to spend in our categories. We're up double-digits organically up there in Russia. We've got winning products. The team is executing great in store, we look great on-shelf and you can see it in their share, we're up about 1 point in the quarter in share, as you can see in that performance. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : This is very helpful. Is it fair to say that on those countries specifically and including I'd say layer in your Kimberly-Clark Mexico partners seeing the same thing, is that the fragmentation of the brands not happening that much yet, right, as far as, I mean, we're in different problems, I should say, in emerging markets vis-\u00e0-vis what you see here in the U.S. You don't see yet like the same folks, I think, Walmex definitely does their part on Mexico but from the retail standpoint, you don't see them pushing for pricing the same way or promotions the same way as we're seeing in developed markets. Is that a fair assumption? Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: I mean, I think it's a little different in each market. In Brazil, there's probably 30 or 40 diaper brands if you looked across every state in Brazil, and some are just tiny and you might have called them a private label, but they're just in one region or one state. And they wouldn't typically pop up on even the Nielsen data. So you have seen the trends, the consolidation around the bigger brands over time and that's not really changing. And Mexico, we continue to have very strong shares. Pablo and the team down there have done a great job. And I'd say it's about the same number of other players, they occasionally change owners, Mabesa was acquired by Ontex, et cetera, but it hasn't really fundamentally changed the competitive position from that standpoint. And Russia is mostly the international players, it's us and P&G and the Japanese players are present there for the most part. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Very helpful. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thanks, Andrea. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. I just have one quick follow-up. So one thing we know that Procter is changing in China, it's not just an upcoming launch but also their sales force coverage. They talked about adding 600 people to cover the mom and baby channel in China. So could you just share with us a little bit about your sales model in China, if you've dedicated coverage for channels, et cetera? Thanks. Michael D. Hsu - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah. We do have dedicated channel coverage. We do concentrate more in the larger cities. So we probably won't have those head count numbers that our competitor is talking about. The other thing that I would point out Lauren is that almost the majority of our business now is sold online, and so that's where a lot of our resourcing and our strategy is focused on. But the baby channel is very important to us, we've got great coverage there, we've got a great team there and we've been performing very well in that channel. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: All right. Well, we thank everyone for your questions and we'll wrap up with a comment from Tom. Thomas J. Falk - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Yeah, once again it's a challenging environment and we're looking forward to showing you we can deliver growth in the second half of the year. And thank you, again, for your support of Kimberly-Clark. Paul J. Alexander - Kimberly-Clark Corp.: Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you, and good morning, everyone, welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here's the agenda for our call. Maria will start with a review of third quarter results. Tom will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. And we'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website.  As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further information. And lastly, we'll be comparing our 2017 results to 2016 adjusted results, which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. And now I'll turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the third quarter. We continue to deliver earnings growth and returned to positive sales growth territory in a challenging environment. We achieved excellent cost savings and reduced our discretionary spending and we returned significant cash to shareholders. Now let's look at the details, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, up 1% year-on-year. Organic sales rose slightly, and Tom will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes. On profitability, third quarter gross margin was 35.8%, that's down 60 basis points as input cost inflation and lower pricing more than offset our strong cost savings. Commodities were $115 million drag in the quarter, and we now expect full year inflation will be slightly above our previous estimate of $200 million to $300 million. This outlook includes somewhat higher cost estimates for pulp and polymer resin. Helping to offset that inflation, our teams continue to deliver significant FORCE cost savings, with third quarter savings of $125 million. Moving down the P&L. Between-the-lines spending was down 60 basis points year-on-year. As we mentioned on our earnings call in July, we're tightly managing overhead and discretionary spending in this environment. Our third quarter operating margin was 18.4%, up 20 basis points year-on-year. I'm encouraged with the margin improvements we achieved in our Personal Care and K-C Professional business segments and in the developing and emerging markets overall. On the bottom line, third quarter earnings per share was $1.60, up 5% year-on-year. Lower equity income reduced earnings by about $0.03 per share, offset by a slightly better effective tax rate worth about the same amount.  Now let's turn to cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $805 million and in line with our expectations. Cash flow in the year-ago quarter was $948 million and included very strong working capital improvements. Our third quarter 2017 working capital cash conversion cycle was down 6 days compared to full year 2016. I'm pleased that our teams continue to make good progress in this important area. We're also managing capital spending even more tightly in this environment, and we expect that full year spending will be slightly below our $850 million to $950 million target range. On capital allocation, third quarter dividend payment and share repurchases totaled more than $500 million. We expect that the full year dividends and share repurchases will total $2.3 billion. That number includes $900 million of expected share repurchases.  Looking at the segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales fell approximately 2%. Organic sales were up 3% in developing and emerging markets but down elsewhere. Personal Care operating margins were 20.8% and up 100 basis points. The improvement was driven by cost savings and reduced between-the-lines spending. In consumer tissue, organic sales were up 2%, driven by North America. Consumer tissue operating margins were solid at 17.1%, although down 100 basis points. The results were impacted by higher input costs, mostly in pulp.  In K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were up 2%, with gains in all major geographies. K-C Professional operating margins were strong at 20.9%, up 130 basis points. That comparison included benefits from both sales growth and cost savings.  In summary, we continue to grow earnings in a difficult environment, we are tightly managing costs, working capital and capital spending and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.  I'll now pass the call over to Tom. Thomas Falk : Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll give you some more detail on our top line sales and market conditions, and then I'll address our outlook for the balance of the year. Looking at the third quarter, our organic sales were up slightly year-on-year after being down about 1% in the first half of the year. Volumes in the third quarter increased more than 1%, while net selling prices fell about 1%. But overall, it's challenging to find growth right now in several of our large markets.  So looking at some of those key markets. In North America, conditions remain relatively difficult, including elevated competitive activity. In the consumer categories that we compete in, the total market did grow by about 1% in the third quarter, and that's 1 point better than that same category grew in the first half of the year. In our consumer businesses in North America, organic sales were similar year-on-year after being down 3% in the first half of the year. Volumes rose 1%, led by our consumer tissue and adult care brands. On the other hand, net selling prices fell 1% as a result of competitive activity and some of the fine-tuning of our promotion strategies that we mentioned on our earnings call in July. Looking at our individual businesses in North America. Personal care volumes were off 1%. In the infant and child care mega category, our volumes were down mid-single digits in a continued challenging environment. Now we expect better performance in the fourth quarter as comparisons ease and we have more promotion and other brand activities planned. Volumes increased high single-digits in adult care in the third quarter. Our Poise and Depend brands benefited from category growth, from increased marketing and promotion support and from some of the innovations that we've launched in -- behind these 2 brands over the last 12 months. Consumer tissue volumes in North America increased by 5% and rebounded nicely following a difficult first half of the year. We benefited from a stronger promotional calendar, from good merchandising execution and our comparison to a soft performance in the year-ago period.  Turning now to our K-C Professional business in North America. Organic sales rose 2% in the quarter. That was driven by volume growth of 3%. Volumes were up in all major product categories as our team is executing its growth strategies well in a relatively sluggish market. Switching to developed markets outside of North America. Organic sales were down 3% in the third quarter. All of that decline was driven by South Korea, including in diapers, where category conditions are challenging as a result of a significant decline in the birthrate in that country. Moving to developing and emerging markets. Organic sales were up 3% in the third quarter, including volume growth of 4%. Looking at some of our key markets there. In Brazil, organic sales in personal care were similar year-on-year. Our volumes continue to grow with benefits from innovation across the portfolio. Selling prices came down, though, as we adjusted to the stronger Brazilian real and competitive activity.  In China, organic sales in personal care were up mid-single digits with strong double-digit growth in feminine care. Our Kotex brand in China is benefiting from product innovation and our focus on the premium end of the market. Organic sales in diapers in China were similar year-on-year. Product mix improved while volumes and selling prices were down as comparisons were impacted by very strong growth last year and competitive activity this year. Diaper pricing continues to be less negative this year than it was last year. And going forward, we will continue to focus on driving winning product solutions on Huggies in China. In Argentina, organic sales in personal care were up strong double digits, driven by higher selling prices. Huggies diapers' volumes continue to grow somewhat even though the category demand in Argentina is still down. And then lastly, in Eastern Europe, organic sales in personal care increased high single digits. Our volume momentum continues in this part of the world as we achieved another double-digit increase this quarter on both Huggies and Kotex. Selling prices declined in Russia and Eastern Europe, mostly reflecting price rollbacks following the strengthening of the Russian ruble.  I'd also like to mention at the end of the third quarter, we purchased the remaining 50% of our joint venture in India. Although the categories in India are small today, we're optimistic about the long-term growth potential in this country. And then finally, I'll briefly build on Maria's financial review to say that I'm encouraged with our team's accomplishments on our FORCE cost-savings program, the way we've managed our overhead spending in this year, especially in the third quarter, and then our working capital and capital allocation. Now I'll turn and cover our outlook for the balance of 2017. As we mentioned in this morning's news release, we're confirming our previous full year 2017 targets. We continue to expect that sales will be similar or up slightly year-on-year. Given results through 9 months, it's more likely that organic sales will be similar for the full year.  On the bottom line, we continue to expect that earnings per share will be at the low end of the $6.20 to $6.35 range. As Maria noted, our commodity inflation estimate has increased somewhat from 3 months ago. On the other hand, we've reduced our discretionary spending plans for the year. In addition, our outlook for currency rates and the effective tax rate has improved slightly.  So in summary, we're focused on competing effectively in the near term, we're executing our Global Business Plan strategies for long-term success and we're optimistic about our opportunities to deliver attractive returns to shareholders. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : I have a few questions. One is if you can talk about kind of the recent top line organic results you delivered in the context of the longer-term 3% to 5% organic range, and what you see is the gaps, whether it be particular geographies or particular business units that you need to close and, I guess, your comfort with that. That's the first question. Thomas Falk : Yes, sure. I think a couple of comments, first on overall category growth. When you've got the birthrate going negative in big markets like the U.S. and major negative in South Korea, we'd guess the birthrate's down 7% to 9% year-to-date in Korea, which we have a hard time explaining to be honest, and don't think that's sustainable. On the other hand, it is what it is and those babies aren't born this year and they won't be in the category next year or the year after that. So category weakness is certainly there in a couple of big markets. And then we had negative 1 price, which is pretty similar in the first half and the third quarter as you had pricing that went in as a result of currency in some places like Russia and Brazil last year that's coming out as those currencies have turned around and a generally more competitive price environment, even in markets like the U.S., as the same number of competitors are chasing lower growth or lower category. So we still think the 3% to 5% is the right long-term growth opportunity. We've got good growth as emerging markets develop. But I'd say, certainly this year, that has been tough to go find. Ali Dibadj : And just on that, I mean if you think about all those drivers, are they going to get better in 2018 at this point? Or do you just have no visibility into that? Because it certainly doesn't -- it feels like it's a pretty far reach to get anywhere near the 3%, the 3% to 5% range, even next year. Thomas Falk : Yes, we'll give you '18 guidance in January, but I'd say your instinct is right, that it -- we don't -- we're not planning for it to snap back. We would expect -- I mean again, the babies that aren't born this year aren't going to be in the diaper category next year either. So and I think, as we understand, much of it is a millennial thing, where they're having kids a little later. Is there -- what else is going on in Korea that might be affecting it? What's the path forward as to how those recover? Those are all things that we'll be looking at. But again, I would expect it's going to be another challenging year from a growth standpoint in 2018. At least that's what we're planning for at this stage. Ali Dibadj : And then just if I may, just the last question. Given what we're seeing on private-label trends, what's your stance on manufacturing private label for other retailers than Costco? For example, Amazon. Thomas Falk : Yes, we do, do private label for a number of retailers and across several categories and have for a long, long time. We don't usually talk about it very much, and it is a very small part of our business. It's less than 5% of our overall sales. Ali Dibadj : And nothing in particular about the e-commerce channel in regards to private label? Thomas Falk : No. I mean, we -- well, I mean, I think there isn't much private label in e-commerce today. And so we really are focusing on building our branded business and e-comm across our categories and in many key markets around the world, China and Korea, especially, where it's exploded. And it is where a lot of the category is taking place. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : Can you comment on your decision to focus on cutting your spending as aggressively as you have been? I mean, on the one hand, it's great that you've insulated your profit margins in a difficult environment. I assume there's some negative operating leverage and obviously costs are going up. But when you talk about sort of your cutting your discretionary spending, how much more fat is there to cut? And I guess, could you address the thought that, hey, if you cut less and maybe spent more, do you think that would have a positive impact on your organic top line growth? If you could talk about your -- sort of your philosophy, given just how challenging so many markets are right now. Thomas Falk : Let me give you a couple of headlines and let Maria give you a little bit more detail. I mean, first of all, I mean, there has been some shift out of advertising and digital couponing that you guys don't see because the digital coupon value is a reduction of gross sales to get the net sales and it kind of shows up in our price calculation as we give you the analysis of change in sales. So part of that negative 1 point of price is more digital coupons, and we spent a little bit less advertising. The other -- if you've got low birthrates in markets like the U.S. and Korea, more advertising isn't necessarily going to help you stimulate category demand. I mean, it could be a share play that you really felt like you could influence it. But in this kind of environment, we also said being sharp and competitive on price is even more important, so we've probably invested a little bit more there. And then the cost cutting between the lines is, I think, kind of a normal belt-tightening you do in a tough year, but I'll let Maria give you a little bit more detail on how we've thought about that. Maria Henry : Yes, I just follow on Tom's comments that on the growth-oriented investments that we make, we pay a lot of attention to what the ROI is on those investments. And we continually monitor that to see, are we getting what we're expecting? And then we shift our investment dollars to the highest and best use, where the strongest ROI is, given the competitive environment and the category dynamics. On the overhead spending, that is an area where you always have room on discretionary expenditures. And when the top line is where it is and as we face inflationary pressures, it just makes sense to tighten our belt on discretionary items. And while we hope that all of our spending contributes value, there's a rank order of higher-value activities and lower-value activities. And we just pull back and eliminate the areas that, again, have a lower return to the overall profitability and success of the company. And so it's regular belt-tightening below the line and a really hard look at ROIs on the growth-oriented investments. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. Okay. And then my second question, if I can, is just on China. Because we heard a lot from Procter on Friday about their initiatives in the diaper category, how much they're investing there. Can you just remind us where exactly you are positioned, your portfolio? Are you in the superpremium end? How big is your share maybe in the pants area? I'm trying to assess how much of a threat their renewed focus in that market is on your business specifically. Michael Hsu : Yes, Wendy, it's Mike. Yes, we're probably balanced, but we're probably -- the growing part of our business has been the premium business, but we're generally balanced overall. We have a good position in Tier 3, but also Tier 4 and 5. And the growth has been more out of the premium side of our business, and that's where we're driving more of our business. Our performance overall in China this quarter, I think as Tom mentioned, the organic was even versus -- or similar to versus year-ago. But we're very confident in our business there long term. It's obviously the world's largest diaper market. We've got a great team with great technology and we like our position there. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Clearly, this is shaping up to be a pretty tough year for you guys, as I think you've conceded, Tom. What I'm trying to do is wrap my head around, parse out, what may be sort of transitory pressure and what may have some more enduring headwinds. I mean, birthrates in the U.S. look like, at some point, they should come back. Input costs obviously ebbs and flows, and right now, it's flowing against you. But what stands out in results is really the combination of pricing and cost. I think I've got to take my model back to 2004 to find an environment or a year where you were poised to deliver negative price with cost inflation. And Ali asked the question on private label. We see in the data, it's got momentum and you're flagging competitive intensity just around so many markets, driving some negative price. So my core question is that. Is that here to stay? And if not, why not? Why should we believe that pricing pressure won't be more enduring? And if it is, what are the implications for the margin profile of your business overall? Thomas Falk : So good, deep philosophical questions there. I'd say one thing. As you look at the Nielsen data, the private label is probably somewhat overstated because it doesn't include growing parts of the category, particularly e-commerce where there's really, really very little private label at this point, particularly in the U.S. And we saw a little bit of spike in the quarter in private label in a couple of places, in particular, markets that were probably hurricane relief-related. So if you're going to donate diapers, you may go buy private-label diapers to do it. But we'll see how that resolves as the quarter rolls forward. But at a larger view of your question, we would say that, yes, you've got to have both winning products and you've got to be price-competitive going forward. And so I don't think that's going to change. And so we know that the prices are probably -- you're not going to get an annual price increase every year, although we haven't operated that way for a long, long time, but we are expecting lots of good local competition as well as global competition that's going to make a price competitive market. So I don't know, Mike, if there's anything you want to add to that. Michael Hsu : No, no, I think it is an interesting observation you make, Jason, though, that with the cost inflation, seeing the pricing pressure in some of the markets isn't what you normally see. And so again, I think we're preparing ourselves to operate effectively in that environment and be able to grow profitably in that kind of a marketplace. But obviously, that's not our preference. Thomas Falk : Some of the pulp price increase, really quite honestly, if you look at supply/demand model, you wouldn't have predicted it would be as high as it is. So our -- another RISI forecast stated that it's going to be higher in '18. And yet you again say it's hard to believe that under the supply and demand fundamentals, it's going to be there. It's harder to price off that if you're not sure that the commodity increase is real and enduring. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : First question for Tom and Mike. I wanted to come back to personal care, which came in a little bit shorter than expectations, I think, broadly in the quarter, and just understand what the surprises were to the downside. Because, Tom, I think you talked about birthrates in North America and South Korea, which were already sort of understood going into the quarter, year-over-year comparisons also understood. So was it just the competitive environment that was worse than expectations that drove some of the downside? And if so, why does that necessarily get better in Q4 or even into next year? I'd just like to try to better understand that. And then I have a follow-up. Michael Hsu : Yes. I think, Kevin -- I think it largely -- probably competitive environment. Obviously, that I think the birthrate, particularly in the U.S. and South Korea, has been known for a while, probably larger than what we where we were expecting previously. But I think the competitive environments continues to be active out there, particularly in North America. I think what you are going to see is that we are expecting to see our performance improve, particularly in the U.S. and North America, as we finish out the year from a promotional perspective. We've fine-tuned our promotion plans. I think we are seeing some of that reflection at the shelf now, and we're expecting better performance there. Kevin Grundy : Okay. Maria, question for you, if I may, on input cost inflation, which is becoming more topical broadly across the group and I would say certainly for Kimberly-Clark. Can you -- so the first is kind of a housekeeping. Can you just confirm that pulp purchases for the company are probably about 25% of cost of goods sold? And then related to that, just given the worries around top line, what's your expectation for pulp inflation, raw material inflation over the next 12 months, just given the potential worry here around margins and the company's ability to offset this with FORCE savings and pricing would certainly seem less applicable in the current environment given the competitive activity? So commentary there would be helpful. Maria Henry : Sure. In terms of our commodity purchases, what we say is that, generally, commodities- and energy-related spend is just under 50% of our cost of goods sold. And then within that, our largest single commodity buy is pulp, which is about 1/3 of that number. That will get you to about our pulp spend for the company. In terms of the inflationary pressures that we see, as I think Tom commented, it is stronger inflation than we were expecting. When you look at the fundamentals of demand and where we are in the cycle, we wouldn't expect it to be as high as it is. There is some supply constraints that seem to be in play here, so we'll have to work through that. The higher inflation is one of the drivers of getting even more aggressive on the overhead cost that we've been talking about in the third quarter. We're fortunate to have very strong performance on our FORCE cost savings delivering $125 million of savings against $115 million of inflation that we saw in the quarter. The teams have done a great job on the FORCE cost savings. We're now at about 4.1% of our cost of goods sold in savings delivery. And that has been up year-on-year for the last couple of years. And the teams continue to expand the lens that they look at to continue to drive productivity in our supply chain. In terms of the exact numbers and expectations on where we think the commodities are going, I'm going to ask Paul to kind of run you through. Paul Alexander : Yes, I mean, I think that for the next 12 months -- or for 2018 specifically, as Tom said, we'll give you our planning assumptions in detail when we get to January. As he also referenced, if you looked at market forecasts right now, they would suggest inflation again next year. Maria Henry : And at some point -- if you think about commodity inflation in a band, at some point, if it gets high enough, we expect that we will be able to get some pricing against it. It's just when you've got -- when you are where we are in terms of the inflation and the volatility around it, it's a little tougher to price. But if you look historically, after some inflection point on inflation, we're usually able to get some price in the market. Kevin Grundy : Thanks for that. Just to drill down without asking you guys to put numbers on it. For Maria and Paul, is it fair to say at this point, based on what you know and where spot prices are, that you feel comfortable that the FORCE savings can cover your input cost inflation over the next 12 months? Maria Henry : Well again, I don't want to give a specific number on the outlook. I think our FORCE cost savings, we're in good shape to deliver the guidance that we gave for this year when you look at where we are in a year-to-date basis. I think broadly, we continue to believe we've got room to go on that program as we looked forward. So when we come back in January, we will give you our perspective on what we think on the cost savings versus the inflation estimate. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : So a couple of questions. First thing was just on China. I think you guys said that -- or that volume in China diapers was down this quarter. Would you just -- it could may be my mistake, but it's not something I recall hearing before. I think the pattern has sort of been strong volume with negative pricing, and then that you said pricing was better. But can you just talk a little bit, the dynamics on China volumes turning negative in the diaper business and sort of the outlook forward? My first question, Michael Hsu : Yes, Lauren, volume was down in China, particularly in diapers. I think mix was favorable. And the pricing environment has probably stabilized versus Q2 and pretty much on kind of what our annual assumption of it at the beginning of the year. I think what's going on is probably, the volume, has been a little bit more competition chasing the world's largest market. And what's probably been different about maybe the recent quarters is a little more pickup from local Chinese players. We probably lost a little volume in our Tier 3 business, or our mid-tier business, versus our premium business. So I would say we recognize our -- competitive launch by P&G is out there, that probably hasn't affected our business as much at this point, but it's been more some local players picking up trial. Thomas Falk : Still, looking at the part of it -- so our toughest comp of the year in China volume was against third quarter last year. So it's up against a pretty strong growth number. And so overall, yes, we're making progress there. It's a challenging competitive set, but we're pretty happy with what we've got going on. And our femcare business in China has taken off, and that grew strong double digits and kind of picked up the slack a little bit this quarter. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. It sounds like that was also maybe the case in Brazil, a couple of markets. It seems like femcare has been an accelerating path in many markets. So I know diapers is just a much bigger category, but can you kind of talk about, as you look forward and think about growth opportunities in D and E markets, the role you expect femcare to play, and the degree to which that can balance, also perhaps, continually more competitive diaper environment? Michael Hsu : Yes, Lauren, I think we're excited about our femcare business. Globally, I think it presents a very significant opportunity for us to both expand consumption and/or distribution. In Brazil, specifically, femcare was up strong double digits. Overall organic sales in Brazil were even. Year-on-year, kind of a different story though. Volume's up pretty strongly, femcare up double digits, as I said. And diapers was up mid-single digits. But a little bit offset by a decline in net selling prices. I do think the economic conditions in Brazil are -- we're seeing some green shoots. Maybe a touch, a tick up in consumer confidence hasn't really translated to overall category demand yet. But I do think the team is executing much better in Brazil. We've got the right price pack architecture in place, improvements are in our product offering. And I think we're poised to grow when the market continues [indiscernible]. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. I just had one final question, and that was around the U.S. and promotional and competitive environment. So oftentimes, I hear manufacturers talk about that retailers are actually funding the stepped- up promotional environment, particularly in categories where they're traffic builders, there's a higher basket, so diapers being prime on that list. Can you talk about the degree to which you're seeing that? Or is it that retailers maybe have not been using Kimberly-Clark products in their promotional strategies, so it's required you to do something differently to kind of get back in that rotation?. Michael Hsu : Yes, I think perhaps maybe, Lauren, I would say those statements are partially true. Which is, hey, these are high-traffic-building categories and so retailers invest a lot behind them. But I think it's also true that we're seeing though, that we believe a lot of it is competitive spending. And I think you can see it maybe in some of the other numbers that are out there. And so I think it's a little bit of both. As I said maybe in July, we weren't happy with our first half performance in the U.S. We did have to fine-tune our promotional personal approach. I think the team has made steps, particularly in family care, which as Tom mentioned, was up over 3% organically and volume was up about 5%. So I think they've made very good progress on that, improving their in-store execution. And we're doing the same in our personal care businesses. And we're expecting to see better progress. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So going back to the Chinese diaper market, and I apologize for going back and forth here. When would you expect the destocking to be finished and pricing to improve in your view? You alluded to weak pricing being where you expect it to be, but could you be more specific on what is embedded in your guidance besides of the easier comparisons as you go into the balance of the year? And you -- are you planning any reaction to the increased competition in pants? I know it's relatively smaller to the tape category, but nevertheless, it's one of the premium categories that you want to be in. And also, can you elaborate more on the reduction on the CapEx? What will you be investing less than you originally planned? And is this reduction just a shift to next year? So if you can also elaborate on those. Thomas Falk : Yes, sure. Maybe I'll take a couple of those and then give Mike the bulk of the China question. So I guess first of all, we didn't really call out destocking as an issue in our volume change. So I mean, a good chunk of our business in China is e-commerce and there's not a lot of inventory shift through that channel. And then second, on CapEx, I don't know, Maria, if you want to comment on CapEx before Mike gives you a little deeper answer on... Maria Henry : Sure. Yes, on CapEx, it's -- we expect that it'll come in below our original guidance for the year. And the largest driver of that is with the lower sales for the year, we obviously aren't spending as much CapEx on growth capital. And as I talked about tightening up on discretionary spend and I talked about ROI focus on growth investments, we have that same discipline on our capital spending. And so not all projects are created equal. And we continue to invest in the high-return CapEx projects, particularly the ones that are helping deliver some of the FORCE cost savings that we've been recording. But overall, in the lower-growth environment, that reduces our CapEx spend along with a lot of discipline around the ROI and prioritizing where we are investing our CapEx. Thomas Falk : And then on China, Mike can give you a little more detail on what's going on in pants, we've been there for a long time in multiple tiers, we're doing diaper-pants in lots of places. But maybe just give her a little more color in that. Michael Hsu : Yes, Andrea. So to your question on pricing, I think the pricing environment is largely consistent with what we assumed at the beginning of the year. So pricing is less negative in 2017, but still down slightly versus 2016. The promotion environment remains pretty competitive and we're kind of assuming kind of it's going to stay at this level for a while. And pricing in Q3 was comparable to where it was in Q4. Our teams have made a lot of progress, notably on the cost front. And so while the pricing has come down over the last couple of years, our gross margins are performing very well. And so the team's doing a very good job there. I think the issue in the quarter for us on volume was more competitive issue around maybe some local competitors, primarily in Tier 3, picking up some volume and some trial at the mid tiers. Thomas Falk : Did we cover all your questions, Andrea, through that? Andrea Teixeira : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : I guess I wanted to circle back to the U.S. We really seem to be seeing a bit of a disconnect between broad macro indicators and then category growth rate in the U.S. So could you guys speak to the strength of the U.S. consumer? And then maybe give us a sense as to what you think might be driving soft U.S. consumption at a time when, really, the consumer environment should at least in theory be doing a little bit better than what a lot of the staples category performance suggests. Thomas Falk : Yes. I mean, I'll let Mike unpack this a little bit more. It is a mixed bag where you're seeing decent category trends in tissue and adult care and things like that, and diapers is more of a birthrate phenomena. But Mike, maybe you want to go a little deeper on that. Michael Hsu : Yes, maybe there are a couple of things. And as it pertains to our categories, across all of our categories, the average -- the category volume is down 1%. So I think down slightly. Bath tissue, the consumer tissue side, I'd say largely on track with where it's been. I think the decline has been in the diaper business, which, as Tom mentioned earlier, driven, we believe, by a reduction in births, right? The birthrate was down in the first quarter of 2017, down about 3%. So I do think the consumer -- if you read all the things we read, continues to be under stress. But there has been a different phenomenon in maybe the diaper business, which is a large business for us, which has probably driven down some of our consumption. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. And then I -- my last question, I guess, is on your innovation pipeline, just in thinking about it relative to your top line weakness year-to-date. Just trying to get a sense of, if some of this pressure could also be due to some of your innovation possibly not resonating as well as expected? And then could you guys give us a sense for how full your pipeline is and will there be more in the market next year? Michael Hsu : Yes. I think certainly, we're always looking to do better on innovation. We do have some strong innovation this year, notably in the U.S. I think in the recent quarters, been improvements in adult and femcare with Depend mainline absorbency improvement. And in China, an improvement in our Tier 5 diaper performance. So I think we've got some pretty good in the market this year. We're looking to probably improve it even further next year. And we're excited about some of those launches. But I think we're going to come back and talk more about those in January. Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Sunil Modi : I guess the question, we've been hearing a theme emerging over the past few quarters, at least on all the conference calls, about the local players you mentioned in some of your remarks about China and some things you're seeing in Tier 3 cities. But if you kind of, like, think about the entire world, in Latin America and what these local players are doing, what is different, number one? And why are they gaining share? And number two is how do you address it? I mean, are there organizational design changes you might need to make in order to better address the local consumer? Thomas Falk : Yes, maybe just I'll start and then let Mike build on it. I mean, I would say in China, it's the -- when we talk about Tier 3s, it's not Tier 3 cities, it's Tier 3 in the category, kind of the middle of the category, the mid-priced performance. Not the low end, but the kind of the middle. A lot of it is coming in through e-commerce, which essentially makes it a little bit easier to get on the unlimited shelf. And if you get trial, you can pick up a share point. And so you do see more entrepreneurial local players that sell a decent-enough-performing diaper and do it through e-comm, where they can get some attention and some trial. And it's probably too early to see what the repeat is. I'd say in other markets, we probably haven't seen as much of that phenomena. You've got some local players like CMPC in Latin America that are emerging in a lot of places. But I would say China has been the one where you've seen more of a resurgence of smaller local players. And that's mostly happened this year, I would say. Michael Hsu : Yes, Nik. And I don't think I have any blinding insight in terms of what you do about it. But I would say it comes back to the basics at how we run our business, which is better innovation. And I think we're customizing and tailoring our innovation to make sure that we're performing and competing effectively against all competitors on all tiers. And so I think we have some ideas that we're going to do -- working on to strengthen our performance of our products. And then also investing more behind our brands. And we think Huggies is positioned very well in all markets, particularly in China. And we like our positioning there and we'll invest more behind the Huggies brand to build that business, is what we're going to do. Thomas Falk : Yes, maybe the only thing organizationally is we are organized, where we're the local market leaders, own the response to any local competition. So the team running the China business, they're accountable for developing the strategies to deal with whatever kind of competition is in front of them. There's a global organization around to help them. But they're there on the front line every day and deciding what to do, what to launch, how to promote or what channels to go after it. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Welcome back, sorry. Thomas Falk : It's okay. We're here all day. Ali Dibadj : So am I. So two questions. One is, look, FORCE, for many of us, certainly me, continues to be a little bit of an abstract concept, right? So it's broad based, you're hearing lots of things. Can you maybe just give us... Thomas Falk : It's real cash, Ali. It's spending money. Ali Dibadj : No, no, but I'm just trying to figure out, can you just give us 2 or 3 specific examples that make up FORCE? I mean, is it a big project? Is it -- just if you could give us just something concrete that turns into the concrete dollars this year or something. Just maybe just to help guys think -- to think about it. Thomas Falk : Absolutely. Maria Henry : Sure. The FORCE cost savings are coming from a number of areas, and I'll kind of tick through them and then go deeper if you want to, Ali. On -- the first one is the savings that we're able to get from negotiating lower material prices with suppliers. The second one is we look to improve our productivity and waste across the system, particularly in our manufacturing operations. And there, it's things like driving OEE, eliminating waste through the whole process, going deep on lean manufacturing methodologies, things like that. The third area is overall driving down the spending across our manufacturing facilities. So that's in addition to the productivity of the equipment and the machines, it's just driving out any unnecessary spend in the facilities.  And finally, the fourth big area is around optimizing the cost of our product, specifications of our products. So our engineering teams are continually looking for ways to lower the cost of the product while maintaining or improving the performance and the quality of the products that we sell. So we've made significant progress in all of these areas this year and last year. And with the global supply chain team being in place, they're looking across all of those areas, plus logistics, to find ways to drive savings. And if you looked at the project list that make up what delivers the FORCE cost savings, you'd see hundreds of projects across the system globally that then add up to deliver those savings. There is specific examples we talked about in the personal care area, the strong cost savings. We've had a number of examples where we've been able to share best practices across the globe where one of our manufacturing facilities has optimized a way to drive cost out of the diaper, they share that across the system. And then other manufacturing locations implement those learnings and that helps us optimize the cost of our products. But it's really in those four areas, and there are many, many projects across the system with our teams working on that globally. Ali Dibadj : So that's very helpful. If we we're just to dig in one of them, just to give a little more color to it. So the second one, sort of productivity and operating efficiency. So what are your OEEs right now on average? And can you -- because I'm just trying to figure out how much of [indiscernible] is left, right? So where are we on OEE, as an example? Thomas Falk : So it varies widely across businesses. So if you looked at OEE for our tissue machine, it would be very high because it's a baseload asset that runs 24/7. If you looked at an OEE for a diaper machine, it would be much lower because you've got lots of stops and material changes and grade changes and things like that. And so I think for us, it's -- we would measure OEE for every diaper machine in the system and there's still a pretty good delta between the best-performing machine and the worst-performing machine. And the good news is, with a lot of the work that we're doing, our best-performing machines are getting better at about the same rate as our worst-performing machines. And so we do see lots of opportunity yet on productivity to continue to get best-in-class. Ali Dibadj : Okay, super helpful. Totally separate type of question. You mention your categories clearly are more challenged right now. We get that. But it also looks like your market shares are more challenged. And I just want to go back to this what you were just mentioning a second ago, for example in China, but more broadly, that look at reinvestment that has to be put back into the marketplace a little bit there. But not just China, in the U.S., showing less share even elsewhere. What are the things that you expect, not just from a category perspective, but from a market share perspective, you guys to be able to deliver on better results? Thomas Falk : Yes, that's fair. We're not satisfied with our market shares this year. We're up in about 40% of the country category intersections that we track, that are the biggest ones. And our goal for the year is to be up in at least half. So we're tracking below goal. North America's probably been the one that has had the toughest hit, given the first half results that we've had. We expect them to finish a little stronger. But I don't know, Mike, if you want to give any more color on other areas you're thinking but from a market share standpoint. Michael Hsu : No, I mean, it's a great area to pick at, Ali. It's an area that we're clearly not happy about. And that we're trying to make sure that we run the business and make sure we find the right investment behind the brands, be able to grow profitably. And we're doing that. I think we made some progress in family care. Not declaring victory because we're just taking the next step in the right direction. But we're trying to grow our shares, grow our business and then grow our profit at the same time. Thomas Falk : Yes, if you looked at our three-month shares versus our year-to-date shares, our trend is a little better sequentially, but we're still not satisfied. Operator : At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue. Paul Alexander : All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for your questions this morning. And we'll conclude with a short comment from Tom. Thomas Falk : Well, once again, we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. And we'll continue to do everything we can to deliver good shareholder value over the long term. Thanks very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines, and thank you for joining us this morning.",

At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedures to follow-up, if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s year-end earnings conference call. On the call this morning are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here\u2019s the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of full year 2017 results. After that Tom will discuss our announcements this morning of a new global restructuring program and also our multi-year ongoing cost savings target. Mike will then comment on our 2018 outlook and we\u2019ll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our website. That presentation includes an appendix with a summary of business segment results for 2017 and our key planning assumptions for 2018. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook; both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. Let me start with the headlines of our full year results. Sales and earnings were broadly consistent with our previous outlook. We achieved record FORCE cost savings and reduced discretionary spending to help offset commodity inflation and fund competitive investment, and we improved capital efficiency and returned significant cash to shareholders. Now let's cover the details of our results, starting with our sales. Full year net sales were $18.3 billion. Total sales and organic sales were both pretty similar year-on-year. On organic sales, volumes increased 1% and product mix improved slightly. Net selling prices were down more than 1%, reflecting the competitive environment and, in some cases, improving currency rate. Looking at the topline by geography, in developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 3% with volume growth of 5%. In terms of key growth market, personal care volumes increased mid-single digits in Latin America and in China and nearly 20% in Eastern Europe. In developed markets outside of North America, organic sales declined 3%. The diaper category decline in South Korea was the big driver of that decrease. In North America, organic sales for consumer products fell 2%. Our results benefited from innovations, but were impacted by competitive activity and the lower U.S. birthrate. In K-C Professional in North America, organic sales were similar year-on-year. Volumes increased 1% in what is a relatively sluggish market. Moving on to profitability. Full year gross margin was 35.9%, down 70 basis points year-on-year. That reflects lower selling prices and $355 million of commodity inflation. Helping to offset those headwinds, our FORCE cost-savings program continued to deliver strong results. Full year savings were an all-time record $450 million. Moving down the P&L, between-the-lines spending fell 40 basis points as a percent of net sales as we tightly managed our overhead. Adjusted operating margin was 18.2%, down 20 basis points. By business segment, margins rose 50 basis points in Personal Care and 60 basis points in K-C Professional. Margins in consumer tissue were down 130 basis points and were impacted by higher pulp costs. Our adjusted effective tax rate in 2017 was 28.6%, that was lower than our 2016 rate of 30.7% as our teams did a good job executing planning initiative. Full year adjusted earnings per share were $6.23, up 3% year-on-year. That was in line with our October guidance to expect earnings to be at the low end of the $6.20 to $6.35 range. Before I turn to cash flow, let me comment on how U.S. tax reform is going to impact us. Overall, we are pleased with the outcomes as the changes will give us a meaningfully lower ongoing tax rate. In 2018, we expect our adjusted rate will be between 23% and 26%. At the midpoint, that's equivalent to about six points of year-on-year earnings growth. We also anticipate ongoing annual cash flow benefits from tax reform. That provides us flexibility to continue to allocate significant capital to shareholders, while we also fund increased capital spending and our restructuring program over the next few years. Finally, I'll note that the one-time cash flow impact as a result of tax reform shouldn't be significant for us. Now let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash flow provided by operations was $2.9 billion in 2017 compared to $3.2 billion in 2016. The decline was in line with our expectations and driven by higher tax payments. We expect cash flow in 2018 will be similar to 2017's level. In terms of balance sheet efficiency for 2017, we reduced primary working capital cash conversion cycle by six days and we also improved adjusted return on invested capital by 20 basis points. On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.3 billion, that's the seventh consecutive year we've returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. In 2018, we plan to repurchase $700 million to $900 million of Kimberly-Clark stock. In addition, we\u2019re increasing our dividend by 3.1%. That's our 46th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. All together, we expect to allocate between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion to dividends and share repurchases in 2018. That's equal to more than 5% of our current market capitalization. So before I turn it over to Tom, let me summarize our results for the year. We increased earnings in a challenging environment, we delivered significant cost savings, reduced discretionary spending and managed our balance sheet well and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Tom? Thomas Falk : Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, I'll focus my comments on our new global restructuring initiative and on our ongoing FORCE cost savings program. Let me start with FORCE. So I'm encouraged with the progress that we've made on FORCE over the last several years. Our investment back in 2015 to create a global supply chain organization that was tightly linked to our businesses is paying off. We have more capability, we have more process discipline and we've got more visibility into our future opportunities. And most importantly, we are generating more savings, including the record performance that Maria just mentioned in 2017. So looking ahead, our FORCE pipeline is healthy and we expect significant savings to continue going forward. And as a sign of that confidence, we are establishing a multiyear commitment to this program, which is to save more than 1.5 billion over the next four years. And those savings are on top of the benefits that we expect from our new restructuring initiative, which I'll talk about now. So as many of you know and if you followed us for a while, you know that we have a long track record of announcing and executing strategic changes that have made us a much stronger company over time. These actions and the execution of our ongoing strategies have generated significant shareholder value. And we've adapted appropriately to the challenging environments that we've encountered over the years. And so today's announcement of our 2018 Global Restructuring Program is just the latest example of our proactive and strategic approach to managing Kimberly-Clark so that we can win in the marketplace and create long-term shareholder value. Toward taking these actions to accelerate our return to delivering on our long-term top and bottom line growth objectives over time. We remain very optimistic about our long-term future. We've got a terrific portfolio of brands, we have leading technologies and we've got strong capabilities in our major countries around the world. And many of the categories we participate in have significant growth potential, particularly in developing and emerging markets. So this restructuring program is the biggest program we have undertaken since we launched our Global Business Plan back in 2003. And this program will make our company leaner, stronger and faster. We expect the restructuring to generate cost savings of $500 million to $550 million by the end of 2021. And that means over this time period, we will have generated more than $2 billion in total savings from FORCE and the restructuring program to help us drive sales, to handle commodity cost increases and currency changes and to improve our margins. So these savings will allow us to do the following things : First, we'll be able to invest more to drive our top line growth, and those investments will be focused on strengthening and growing our core businesses, accelerating our personal care growth opportunities in developing and emerging markets and further building our digital and e-commerce capabilities. Mike can give you or will give you a little more color on those growth priorities when he talkies about our 2018 outlook. And second, we'll be able to compete more effectively in an environment that has become more challenging over the last two years. A key priority for us is to maintain or improve our market share positions, particularly in key markets and businesses, investing more behind our brands will help us improve our share trends over time. And third, we'll be in an even better position to improve our margins. Even in slow-growth conditions, we know we need to grow our profit and earnings to deliver attractive shareholder returns. So in terms of how we'll achieve the restructuring savings, we'll streamline and simplify our overhead organization and our manufacturing supply chain. We'll also better take advantage of scale opportunities and technology. We'll continue to use our locally driven operating model, including having profit and loss accountability reside with local teams. At the same time, we will shift more routine work and transactional activities to regional shared-service centers. And all our functions will drive more process discipline, which will help us with efficiency and sharing of best practices. So these changes will lower our overhead spending and make us even more competitive with industry benchmarks. From a supply chain standpoint, this program will require us to close or sell about 10 manufacturing facilities and capacity at several other locations will be expanded to improve scale and cost of those facilities. Workforce reductions in conjunction with the restructuring are expected to be in the range of 5,000 to 5,500 employees. These are difficult but necessary actions to make the Kimberly-Clark an even stronger company going forward. We also expect to exit or divest some lower-margin businesses that are equal to about 1% of company sales, and those divestitures will be concentrated in the consumer tissue segment. To implement the restructuring, we expect total cash spending of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion by the end of 2020. And that consists of $900 million to $1 billion in pre-tax charges and approximately $600 million to $700 million of incremental capital spending. Because of the restructuring and other long-term investments that we've got planned, we expect our total capital spending in 2018 and 2019 will be somewhat higher than our long term target of 4.5% to 5.5% of net sales. When we get to 2020, we expect spending to return more in range of our long-term target. We'll continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways as we execute the restructuring. And we expect to continue to increase our dividend and repurchase meaningful amounts of our stock, including in 2018, as Maria just noted. So to summarize, we're taking aggressive action to accelerate our return to delivering our Global Business Plan objectives over time. We'll generate substantial savings over the next several years to provide more flexibility to invest and improve our margins. And we will significantly improve our company for the long term. Now let me turn it over to Mike. Michael Hsu : Okay, thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by expressing my enthusiasm and optimism about our long-term future. We are bullish about our categories and the Global Restructuring Program will help us operate more effectively and efficiently. Now let me turn to our 2018 outlook. In terms of market conditions, we expect 2018 will be pretty similar to 2017. We're assuming the category growth rates were only slightly better than this past year, and we expect competitive activity will remain elevated. And we're planning for another year of commodity cost inflation. However, we expect to deliver better results in 2018, and we'll also invest more in our brands to ensure our long-term success. On the top line, we're targeting organic sales growth of about 1%. That's similar to our expectation for overall market growth. Taking into account currency rates and last year's acquisition of our JV in India, total net sales in 2018 should grow 1% or 2%. Now let me spend a few minutes talking about our three growth priorities that Tom just mentioned. The first priority is to strengthen and grow our core businesses. In North American consumer products, we expect better performance in 2018. We have a strong innovation lineup that launches in every major business. Near-term activity will include upgrades on Huggies diapers and baby wipes, Pull-Ups training pants, Depend and Poise in adult care and new Kleenex wet wipes. We would make targeted brand investments to support these innovations and to ensure we are more competitive in the marketplace. At the same time, our teams will be improving efficiencies by reducing spending on less productive items, such as non-work and media. The second priority is to accelerate our personal care growth in D&E markets. Overall, we'll build on the progress we've made in 2017 in our key growth markets. In Latin America, we'll launch a number of innovations in diapers, feminine care and adult care. Category demand in Brazil and Argentina has stabilized, and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that conditions will improve modestly this year. In Eastern Europe, we have good momentum on Huggies and Kotex and that includes our business in Russia, we will leverage innovations and strengthen our commercial programs. In China, our fem care team will continue to focus on winning young category entrants with their on-trend premium. In diapers, important innovations will phase in throughout the year, starting late in the first quarter. The third priority is to further build out our digital and e-commerce capabilities. We are already well-positioned and making good progress in e-commerce. Online sales in 2017 were a high single-digit percentage of company sales and increased more than 30% year-on-year. We expect to make more progress in 2018. We will also continue to improve our relationships with consumers through our direct digital marketing programs. We are investing in tools to help improve the speed, cost and effectiveness of our programming. Moving beyond sales, our plan is to grow adjusted operating profit by 2% to 5% in 2018. At the midpoint of our guidance, that implies margin improvement of about 40 basis points. Cost savings will continue to be an important driver of our performance. Our teams are targeting to deliver approximately 400 million in FORCE savings and 50 million to 70 million from the restructuring. Those savings will help us offset cost inflation, which we anticipate will be between 300 million and 400 million. More than half of that inflation is projected to come in international market. At this point, we are planning for wide spread selling price increases because of commodity inflation. That said, we have taken or expected to take selective increases in some of our businesses. That includes in KCP and in our consumer businesses in the DNA market. On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share of 6.90 to 7.20, that's growth of approximately 11% to 16% year-on-year and includes the tax rate benefit that Maria described. In terms of our earnings profile in 2018, we expect earnings will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half, and that primarily reflects phasing of cost savings and benefits from growth initiatives and, secondarily, some expected moderation of commodity costs in the second half. So to summarize our outlook, we're optimistic about our long-term future. We\u2019re planning for a better year in 2018, and we\u2019re taking important steps to make Kimberly-Clark stronger to enhance long-term shareholder value. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : I want to start with a similar question I actually asked on the P&G call just now, around the increasing difference between commodity costs going up and the inability to take prices up to offset that. I've kind of rarely seen things just coming from a price realization perspective. And I'm trying to understand kind of what's driving that. We certainly have our views and would love you know, how much of it is retailers' fighting, how much of it is competition slow growth environment, how much is consumer just saying, these categories are relatively commoditized. And really I want to understand it because to see if you see that lack of pricing power really changing going forward or is this kind of a new reality? That's the first question. Thomas Falk : That's a good big-picture question, I'll give you my take and I\u2019ll maybe have Mike can pile on. I mean a couple of things. Prices are also set on expectations. So as we look at what's going on in the pulp market, it's quite frankly surpassed our expectations on how quick it's gone up and why it is even at this level. And if you look at some of the forecast that says it should moderate later in the year a bit. And so you also want to be a little careful that you don't spend too much energy trying to take price in a particular category than the commodity falls off and you've got to give it back and then some. And so there is a bit of that where commodities are running ahead of expectations. And our expectation is for that to moderate a bit over time. So that's part of it. I think the other point you raised, particularly in developed markets, is that with relatively low or negative category growth, it's tough. You've got the same number of competitors chasing a tougher volume target. Having said that, there's also a lot of different ways you can get pricing in the categories. In our 2018 guidance, there's some more positive news on price. At least we are projecting it's not going to be negative as it was in 2017. And so whether that's getting more efficient on trade or getting more efficient on some of the other between the lines, between growth and net sales, that's another way to try to get some revenue in those businesses. But Mike, maybe you want to see what else you want to add to that? Michael Hsu : Yes, Ali, I've worked at other companies and in commoditized categories, and we are very far from being in any commoditized categories. I think we've got a long runway of growth, both in developed markets and developing and emerging markets. And one of the reasons for that is there's still lot of opportunity for us to innovate. And you know, to think about the experience of our products, these - the product experiences are pretty good today, but they are not perfect. And I put on the Depend Underwear every once in a while, and I think it's a great product, I think there is still room for us to achieve perfection. And so our focus is, hey, we are not going to be undersold, so we are going to be competitive on promotion, that's what you saw in the back half in North America. And we just want to be competitive there. But the way we are going to grow and the way we are going to drive value in these categories and what our retailer partners want us to do is to create innovation and bring marketing to and expand the category. Ali Dibadj : I like the piece - so maybe I should try that depends on in and do my further research\u2026 Thomas Falk : We had fun group got here at Kimberly-Clark, Ali, so I think Mike dose that with his office store closed, the equipment. Ali Dibadj : Look, helpful context. If you take that and you then say, okay, we are now doing an incremental cost saving plan, which is great, right? I mean you guys have shown that you can do that, FORCE looks like it has legged yet. But why do you think or how do you think reinvesting a lot of that back will actually drive the long-term growth trajectory, right? So you talk about innovation for sure, but it sounds like you haven't been doing innovation so far over the past several years. So you're spending a lot more back and I'm struggling to get this confidence in ROI that you seem to have as opposed to just saying, gosh, three to five long term isn't achievable, let's think about a different mix of cost cutting and reinvestment pack. So really that are aligned with you're going to do from a cost-saving perspective reinvestment? Thomas Falk : That's fair. I'll start and let Mike pile on again as well. I mean, I\u2019d say, certainly in 2017, we had some factors like the birthrate in the U.S. and Korea being more negative than expected that you can't encourage moms to use more diapers in a developed markets where the babies aren't being born in those markets. So on the other hand, there's still huge category penetration opportunities in most of our markets around the world and Mike can talk about that a bit more. And we also have some markets in Latin America where the economic conditions were tough in the beginning of 2017. We see that turning and being more positive in 2018. And as you look at the kind of years we had in Eastern Europe and other places, we still see strong category growth opportunities across our space. And we do believe that there's more opportunity there than maybe we put on the board in 2017. But Mike, maybe you can add something about it. Michael Hsu : Ali, I fully believe we'll get back to our long-term growth goals. And in the global restructuring plans to fuel we're going to need to help us get there and support both investments and the brands and also the margin improvement that we need to drive our business. I do believe the current slowdown is cyclical and some of it is microeconomic or political, social. And some of it is competitive. And again if you think through some of the competitive dynamics, there's not a real good reason of why that's occurring. And so I think we've been in these situations as I studied our history and been in and out of them before. And I think we'll cycle through that and get back to focusing on the things that drive the business, which I already mentioned. But I think the real important thing is the takeaways, our investments are going to focus in the three areas that Tom and I mentioned as our growth plans, which is one, to strengthen and grow our core. I think there's a lot of room to bring value-added innovation into these categories. We've got a lot of runway left in developing and emerging markets. And to use the baseball analogy, I think we're in the very early innings of that game or very early stages of what global development. And then lastly, I think e-commerce and digital and data really given us a transformative opportunity to change the relationship with our customers and consumers and become much more efficient and create long-lasting relationships. Ali Dibadj : And just the last question I had is, along the lines of increased penetration and macro kind of combining those two. Can you just give us an update on China, what you're seeing there, and also Brazil from a share, volume price perspective? Thanks a lot. Thomas Falk : Yes. China is still a dynamic market, and we're going to continue to focus on high-impact innovation and capture the strong growth potential that's there. It remains our single-largest growth platform, both in the near term and long term. And obviously, yes, Ali, as you can see and probably heard our competitors see the opportunity and plan aggressively and hard there too. So price has been a major factor, and I think the price situation in 2017 has stabilized, albeit at a lower level. I think our team has done a phenomenal job with our cost programs and our margins have never been higher even at this lower-price level. But I do think the long term driver of growth in China continues to be not price, but it is innovation and product quality and product innovations. And so we are expecting a better year of fem care and China has a winning formula, even growing strong double-digits last year, and we're expecting that to continue. They got a great brand positioning. And then in baby and child care, we were up low single digit in volume for the year and about even on sales, but we're very excited about the innovation we're going to be bringing. We're not ready to talk about it yet, but that's going to be coming throughout the year phasing in late in the first quarter. That's really about improved protection, comfort fit in the premium tiers. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with the Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : So looking forward I guess building a bit on Ali's question on price. Just given the intense competitive backdrop that you've called out, I mean, do you see any prospects of pricing relief without detriment to volumes in 2018 if your input cost outlook doesn't prove conservative enough, or is that a likely risk to the implied margin outlook in guidance? Thomas Falk : Mike can build on this, so embedded in our guidance is some improvement in the pricing environment. We've got some markets like Argentina, where there\u2019s pretty big price increases that we are taking in 2017 that will carry over. And then there are other\u2019s we expect to get some trade efficiency. I don't know that there will be that much list price change, but our teams have got plans to regenerate revenue in other ways in 2018, but maybe Mike you can give a little bit more color on that. Michael Hsu : As Tom mentioned, we have some selective price increases in some businesses. And then we are assuming perhaps a perhaps a bit of a normalization in pricing in some of our key markets. I will tell you the reason why 2018 is going to be better though is because of a stronger innovation pipeline that we're bringing. We've got a lot of innovation that we\u2019re bringing out, particularly in the U.S., China and Brazil, in Latin America, and we\u2019re investing more in our brands with harder hitting messaging and advertising. Stephen Powers : But, I mean, like appreciating that innovation pipeline and understanding the direction of external forecast, I just I guess I'm just really test the logic of guiding commodities below spot prices at the midpoint of your guidance and not allowing for at least a wider range that contemplates upside risk input costs. And I guess what I'm trying to get at is if that upside risk to input cost does manifest, do you think given the competitive backdrop, there's actually pricing relief, or is that a likely risk to margins? Thomas Falk : Well, we'd say, when you look at the range of commodity inflation that we've seen last year that we are forecasting for 2018, I've seen much big sharper cycles in commodity cost. And typically, if you have sharp swings in commodities, you will get some list prices change, and so we're not afraid of that. I think it's just that in this environment, given the swing that we've seen and what we expect, that's probably not going to move the needle on list price much in most places. Stephen Powers : And just one last question, different tact. On the new restructuring program, the cash costs to achieve seem high just relative to past programs and relative to the projected savings. And the 5,000-plus in workforce reductions seem potentially disruptive. So just trying to get underneath how you're assessing the aggregate kind of financial execution risks of this program relative to past initiatives that you've undertaken? Is there more uncertainty associated with this program, or do you view it as comparable to past programs? Maria Henry : Yes, I\u2019ll comment on the cash cost. This program includes a number of activities that are on the more expensive and restructuring. And I'll give you two examples. One is when you are shutting down facilities and factories, there are costs associated with moving equipment and doing the shutdown. So when restructuring tend to include plant shutdown, they tend to run on the more expensive and on the cost side. The other thing is we are moving to a global business services platform for our more transactional and standard work. And when you do that, when you think about it, we are removing a role that is in country, so we are paying the full severance on that position that we are taking out, and we are hiring that role in a different location in our shared services center. And we are probably only picking up labor arbitrage and some productivities that you're paying the full load on the cost, on the severance side and you're not getting 100% of that same amount back on the benefit. So those are two of the factors that are involved in our restructuring that tends to weight the cost on the higher end of our restructuring program. What I can tell you though is that as we look at the programs across our supply chain and also across our overhead structure, they have very strong, strong returns and will position us well for the future. Stephen Powers : One last clean up on the restructuring program. The 10 facilities that you expect to close or potentially sell, is there in the benefits of the program, is there any forecast to gain associated with the sales in those assets? I guess that's a question for you, Maria, just to clarify. Maria Henry : No, it is not. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : I'll try to keep mine to two quick questions. First, the commentary on pricing, your expectation for sort of normalization of pricing in some markets I think is the word you used, and of course the guidance for improved pricing in next year, albeit just kind of back to sort of a neutral posture, it does kind of contrast the kind of trajectory we've been seeing throughout the year. Is there any evidence of competitors kind of moving in this direction as you wrapped up last year as we come into this year? In other words, is there anything you can give us that you are seeing is tangible market that makes expectation feel a little more credible? Thomas Falk : Yes, Jason, I think maybe the better word I should have chosen is stabilization versus normalization, because I think normalization implies return to some level. But I would say right now, we are assuming that it's dropped to a level, will stay there. I think maybe the dynamic and maybe I'll talk a little more about North America is you know, I do think, we said in June of last year that, hey, we're competitive and achieve competitive levels of spending on promotion because we felt like we were getting beaten in the marketplace in the beginning of last year. And I think the team has executed and strengthened their promotion plans and fine tuned them. And so in the third quarter, we improved some performance. In the fourth quarter, particularly in family care, did not get the takeaway. But I do think in some degrees we are going to have to continue to fine-tune. And so we don't want to drive overall down in the categories. We do want to focus on our innovations and bring in our value added. And so we are looking for the market to, maybe a better word, stabilize. Jason English : And then a bigger picture question, sorry a bit more long when they exist or not exit quite concisely. I want to go to get to market growth. And Michael, I think you talk to your section by saying you're bullish in your categories long term. But if we think about the environment we are in, your GDP growth globally, pretty solid, a little choppy here and there, but all in all pretty solid, income growth pretty solid, and we've got inflation in the system the use of sort of flattering to revenue growth. And all that yields a whopping 1% sort of global category growth, I think, is the figure you gave out, which frankly isn't very growth. So how do we sort of where we are at today with 1% with your comments sort of bullish long-term? What do you think is holding us back? Where do you think the growth is? And if you can give me more color in terms of the diverging growth trajectories between your Personal Care and professional tissue, I think that would be helpful. Thank you. Thomas Falk : Yes. I think, what we need to do is, one, we\u2019ve got a major market in North America and we got to get that back to the growth path. And I think we feel better about our prospects for this year. I think the team has got very strong plans both, as I mentioned, on the innovation front in all major categories in bath tissue, Kleenex, diapers, Pull-Ups and adult care. And so we feel very strong about the innovation. I think we will improve versus our decline last year and so that's probably the first step. And I was personally involved in the North America business for a number of years and fundamentally believe that, that\u2019s a market that we could grow. And so that's probably the first step. And then in our developing and emerging markets, we've had a couple of either competitive situations or micro economics situations in key markets. I think in Latin America, we grew mid-single digits last year, and we were expecting an improved performance this year. And I think we're modestly perhaps saying that the economic conditions are going to modestly improve and so we're excited and looking forward to that. And then in China, I think, we've been in - it's a big market for us and then been a bit of a competitive situation. And again, I think in our earlier remarks we said, I think that situation has stabilized, we have some great product innovation coming that we think will get us back on a faster-growth trajectory in diapers. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I wanted to talk a little bit about Consumer Tissue, that's on the business that\u2019s getting a lot of air time these days, but it's still very big and considerably moves the needle. So first, if you can just talk a little bit about North America, right? We've had pretty sustained negative trend in organic sales growth this year. A lot of it driven by volume more so than pricing. And then also in the - with the restructuring, you talk about some low margin exit. So a little bit about where those exits are coming from, dynamics in North America tissue and thought process and plans around improving that, that performance in particular. Thanks. Thomas Falk : So maybe Lauren, I'll start with the exit part, because we\u2019re not going to be able to tell you very much about that right now until we get farther into it, won\u2019t be able to share those details appropriately with the effected business. But again it's less than 1% of our sales, so it's not going to be a big deal either way. Then maybe Mike can comment on North America and some of the dynamics that are going on there. Michael Hsu : Lauren, I think the competitive market conditions in North America tissue, I think we expect that to remain, but we are expecting improved performance behind our innovation, differentiated product news and stronger advertising. Q4 volume and price were both down about 2% which drove a net sales decline of 4%. And what I will say is what I was telling Jason earlier, have we improved the competitiveness of our promotion programs, and if you recall in our previous quarter, in the third quarter, I think, our volume in consumer tissue was up 5. And so in the fourth quarter, we were disappointed because I think what we had about the same kind of merchandising and achieved merchandising our consumer takeaway was lower than we expected. We do expect 2018 to be better. We're going to remain competitive on promotion, but, of course, stay balanced there. But the big difference is we've got a lot of product news and probably the most that I've had since I've been here at K-C. In bath tissue, we've got great news on Cottonelle, we're not ready to share exactly what that is yet, but I will tell you it's going to lead their category superiority for us in bath. It's got, extra soft, which is also a big business for us, we're bringing making it softer and thicker and that's important for helping us differentiate versus other brand and private label. And then our retailers are very excited about the innovation we\u2019re bringing to extend and expand occasions for Kleenex, which is an iconic brand and with our wet wipes launch. So we've got a lot of great products. And then I think the other thing that affected the fourth quarter is we were not as strong on our advertising as we need to be, and I think the team has realized that and learned that. They've got very good hard-hitting advertising coming this year to support these launches and we're excited about that. Lauren Lieberman : And then with regard to private-label activity I guess, both in tissue and in diapers, there's certainly a lot of talk out there in terms of private label having more impact, consumers being more open to it. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your business, what you're seeing in terms of pricing pressure just coming from retailers giving more attention to their own private labels, or that's not something that's really been terribly on your radar screen as an incremental challenge of late? Michael Hsu : Yes, I guess, Lauren, I'd say yes and no, I think it depends, on which category. But in general, I'd say in our personal care categories, if you look over the longer term, I think in our key categories, private label penetration has been down over the last five years. But we have had some increases and some spot increases from year-to-year. And in this year, we're probably seeing a little more private-label growth in tissue, and that's a big reason why we\u2019re very focused on differentiation and advertising, because that's the only way for us to drive the long-term health programs. Lauren Lieberman : And then just a final question, and you had mentioned digitally-only commerce and data and so on as being one of the key priorities going forward and where you're going to reinvest. My understanding is that you were a bit of a leader, a bit very much of a leader in terms of e-commerce penetration in China and it's been everyone else need to kind of catch up where you were, but the reverse was the case in the U.S. So could you talk a little bit about where you are today versus where you were at the start of 2017 on your e-commerce penetration in the U.S., your relative market share positions online versus offline? And anything concrete and planned for 2018? Thomas Falk : Yes, so we\u2019re strong leaders in China and Korea. They're both major e-commerce markets for us. And in the U.S., I would say we got off to a slow start years ago but we've been catching up fast. I think we've had three straight years of share growth online in the U.S. And I think, overall, across all categories, I think we have about a fair share for our position. What we've had very strong double-digit growth, while I don't know how to actually describe it, but its strong double-digit growth. And we\u2019re excited about it. And the reason why it's so important for us, Lauren, I think why it's uniquely important for our categories, we are in very high involvement categories that are frequently used and our consumers are in these categories for years or in some cases, many, many years. And so it pays to have an effective long-term relationship with our consumers. And I think with the advances in what's happening with data analytics, online access and advertising and then with e commerce, we've got an opportunity to really kind of change the model and make it much more efficient for us, our retail partners and our consumers. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Just had a quick follow-on question on private label. I'm wondering if you guys have plans to expand your private-label manufacturing footprint? I think you guys have mentioned in the past that it accounts for less than 5% of the overall sales. So just curious if you have any plans to increase that? Thomas Falk : No, private label is still less than 5% of our overall sales and really didn't move the needle significantly in the quarter. Bonnie Herzog : And no plans going forward to step that up, just given some of developments we've seen with private label in some of your categories and some of your comments? Thomas Falk : We are primarily a branded manufacturer and we do a limited amount of private label to specific customers where we think it advantages our overall relationship with them, but we are not out trying to sell private label to everybody up and down the street. Bonnie Herzog : And I just wanted to move over to China and your business there. Just hoping you guys could drill down a little further on again your diaper business in the market and highlight some of the key changes that you've seen following Procter's launch in the summer. And then going forward, other than innovation that you touched on, what other levers do you plan on pulling to really stabilize your business there? Thomas Falk : Yes, I think I'd say, overall, I don't think our business was impacted significantly by the Procter launch overall. Obviously, you can talk to them about how they felt that went in the product. But we feel very good about our product line up. I think we did lose some share in diapers this year. But we see it primarily impacted by local players who have guided an increase in online brands that have gained some trial. And I don't know how long that trial is going to stick and how well the repeat is going, because we don't have data on that, but they are getting some trial and that has impacted our business a little bit. Our focus is on making the best product out there and we are very confident that we've got great products out there and we are going to have better products coming out throughout this year. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : First, just some clarity on your outlook, particularly on the cadence, how many moving parts there are. Can you give a little bit more granularity on the margins as you model out, do you expect margins to actually be down in the first half and then up in the second half? And then just for clarity I think you said that EPS is better in second half versus the first half. Do you mean in absolute earnings or in growth because typically you do deliver more earnings in the second half versus the first half. Thanks. Thomas Falk : Yes, so we probably aren't going to give you quarterly margin profile. I'd just say 40 basis points for the year is the right way that we think about it and manage the business. And then on the second half versus first half, we'd say absolute profitability or the size of the earnings per share will be larger in the second half than the first half and we weren't referring to the earnings growth rate per se. Olivia Tong : And then secondly, just my question is about Amazon as entering more and more of your largest categories with their own brands before. Now you've got Presto!, Mama Bear. Before that there was Kirkland and before that many others. So we know this isn't the first time you've had a retailer relationship where you've had to wear different hats, but it certainly seems a little bit different this time around. So perhaps, you can talk a little bit about, how you approached it differently this time around versus previous instances? Thomas Falk : I mean, Olivia, we haven't confirmed that we are making Mama Bear, so we really don't talk about any private-label relationships and we do some with a few customers. And then those are kind of private conversations with those customers and we don't talk about their business and we let them talk about it. And so I would say that pretty much every retailer we sell to does private label, and so there is that inherent discussion as to what they are trying to do with their brand and their overall category strategy, and then how do we fit with our brands and what we can bring from an innovation standpoint. And that's the challenge that our customer teams have every day is just putting together a strategic plan with our key accounts that drive the business over the next two or three years. Olivia Tong : Just to clarify, I meant more that Amazon\u2019s obviously a retailer, but also they're selling your product but also you\u2019re competing with them in terms of product as well. So just wanted to clarify that. Thomas Falk : Like every other retailer we do business with, I mean, I think everybody has private label on the shelf in some form. And so we've got to bring news and ideas and innovation that drive the business with them and then that makes them excited about it. Olivia Tong : And then just lastly, the CapEx increase for this year, how much of that is related to the new restructuring program as opposed to potentially a bit of a build back of some of the things you may have had originally planned for 2017, but then got shelved as things got a bit more challenging as the year progressed? Thomas Falk : I mean, I would say that all of it is related to the restructuring program, and Maria maybe you want to comment further on that. Maria Henry : Yes, I think we gave an incremental CapEx number related to the restructuring program, and clearly a portion of that will get spent in 2018. The other comment that I would make is that on the restructuring program itself, we started that last year, earlier in the year. And a lot of work and effort went into to looking at the opportunities that we have across our supply chain as well as in our overheads. And so as our teams were working on the supply chain portion of that restructuring, we've had to imagine they were delaying some of the CapEx that they would have spent in 2017 until we had a total view of how the actions we were going to take to optimize our overall footprint. So I would imagine there's also some catch-up there on projects that got delayed from 2017 as our teams were working on the restructuring. Operator : The next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : So I wanted to drill a little bit further on private label, and I understand cagey is the wrong word, but the caution you have in terms of talking about it. I mean it's certainly... Thomas Falk : I'm not cagey, Ali, I have been pretty transparent that I\u2019m not going to talk about this. Ali Dibadj : That\u2019s just the wrong word, the wrong word, but you're trying to manage the relationship with these retailers as well. So I get that can\u2019t give too much detail about it. But generally preponderance of evidence is that you're experimenting with Amazon. You might be doing something probably with Walmart, although I don't know for sure on that one. As you work with the retailers on private label and 5% sounds small, but most of that\u2019s probably in the U.S. so almost double that, right, for percentage of your sales? Thomas Falk : It's less than 5%. And I think you would be way high on your estimate of how big it might be. Ali Dibadj : So it's not 5%. Okay. So look, either way as you are kind of doing it feels like more and more and although small and we start somewhere, can you talk a little bit about the impact on margins for you generally for the retailer? You mentioned when you were answering one of the questions that you do it only when you feel like you have a - it helps the relationship. Can you talk about what that looks like in terms of helping the relationship? Just some more context about private label and your interaction with the retailers would be great. Thomas Falk : Yes, I think I can give you just a little bit of general color and maybe Mike might want to build on that. I think I've been around the business relationships with private-label customers for a long time, and we haven't done a lot of it ever, but we have done it with a few strategic people. And it is for retailers that are serious about their private label; it is a pretty intimate relationship. It's their brand; it's their name on the package. They are involved in what goes in. They want to test the product. They care a lot about the materials and how you make it. And so we've got to put dedicated people working on the business that shows the retail partner that we care about their brand and their business as much as they do. And if the retailer's willing to partner like that, it can be a good profitable relationship for both parties. If it's a business that is going to get auctioned every quarter and the low bidder gets the business, that's not kind of a relationship that we\u2019re ever going to be looking for. So I don't know, Mike, if there's anything that you want to add to that. Michael Hsu : Well, Ali, I think the only two things I would add is, yes, it's a small piece of our business, it's not strategic because it's not going to be a growth driver for us mostly because we\u2019re capacity-constrained. And so we don't have the capacity to give to a lot of private-label out there. I will say, as Tom mentioned, we do a small amount. And may the reason why we do a good job at it is because we care about it for our customers and we want to have a good relationship and just like everything we do, we care about what we do, we want to bring good quality work to what we do. And so we got a few selected relationships out there and actually with the different sets of customers. But again, it's not a primary where you're - significant growth driver for us going forward. Ali Dibadj : And where does the shelf space typically come from when they push private-label further? And do they tell you about, look, we want private label to be this big of the category? Thomas Falk : Yes. So retailers typically are working with their category captains and category challengers to talk about where the shelf is going to go. And I would say most retailers in a brick-and-mortar world typically over - and this is true across most formats. So over allocate space to private label relative to share and they typically often give preferred shelf space to private label. And so the brands know that they are fighting for their spot in the shelf as well. You got to justify with innovation. And when you do category line reviews, you've got to justify why you need that real estate and what it's going to do for the retailer when you get it. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : I'm just wondering. First of all, I just heard your comment say you're capacity-constrained in that sort of feature decision process on private-label manufacturing, but with regard to the 10 facilities that you're not sure you're not going to shut as part of the restructuring, first of all, how much of that is in the U. S. versus outside? Thomas Falk : Yes, I guess, a couple of things. I didn't say we are capacity constrained, I think someone was asking me about going to be building facilities to make private-label, which I said that's probably not where we're headed. And then secondly, just because of where we are in the announcement phase and also the consultation phase with various works consults and unions and other things, we really can't give you any more color at this point where the 10 facilities are. But I would say that the combination of the 10 affects every region. Wendy Nicholson : Because I guess one concern I have just first blush is some of the private-label manufacturers in your categories that we've talked to, their growth is actually being held back it sounds like because they don't have the capacity particularly in North America. So there's part of me that's worried that if you sell those plants to those players, it sort of might give oxygen to some of the private-label manufacturers who are going to be competing against you? Is that crazy logic on my part? Thomas Falk : I would say you're barking at the wrong tree there. I think most of the plants will be closed versus being sold. Wendy Nicholson : And then my second question, just going back to kind of high-level, sounds like you don't want to back away from the 3% to 5% long-term revenue target. So I assume the restructuring program is sized to enable you to meet that target. But my question is, you also commented at one point how much margin expansion you've seen, and it's true over the last four, five years your EBIT margins have gone up much more than your peers, the ones we cover anyway. And so wondering, is the restructuring program designed to fuel that growth, I get it, but do you really think margins can expand? I heard your guidance for 2018, but longer term, is this restructuring program enough to fuel faster top line growth and long-term margin expansion? Or is there a risk actually that your current margins reflect some over earning and that you kind of have to reinvest more and so maybe margins stay flat. Does that make sense? Thomas Falk : That's a complicated calculus when that we are speculating. We think so I think is the answer. And so we feel like the restructuring program will give us a more efficient, more effective way to run the business. We are at kind of cyclical peak in the commodity cycle and that may well swing the other way at some point over the intervening years. And so while we are not counting on that, that we also realize we've had higher commodity costs both last year and projected for 2018 than we had in the previous several years. And so we will see. Basically, our view is that it is and that we do believe we have the possibility to get our business growing at that level and this is the right plan to get us moving in that direction. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : Just one question. I wanted to ask about the genesis of and the planning around for long-term standpoint major restructuring like this. I mean in restructuring inside your company broadly. You're talking about, you identified 10 plants, you talked about 13% headcount. How much of this specifically would you say were costs you could have addressed if you had the management bandwidth and whatever, and maybe should have two or three years ago, but you can only do so much in a certain period of time? And how much of this, roughly speaking, are redundancies that are the results of real technological changes or marketplace changes in the past couple of years? I'm just trying to understand the timing of all this and whether you\u2019re going to digging deeper into things you\u2019d prefer not to have to do, and how much of it is like, no, really things are changing really, really quickly and maybe we could expect more of this sort of thing in the years ahead? Thanks very much. Thomas Falk : That's a great question, Jonathan. I'll let Maria kind of expand a little bit on our process. I will tell you I think I had investor once tell me that he thought every CPG company restructure every five years. And I think your point would be, gosh, it would be great if we could avoid adding the cost in the first place so we didn't have to restructure it. But we've probably historically proven that we're not capable of that. On the other hand, I think this restructuring program was an excellent piece of work by our team and Maria and Mike, and I help lead it. But Maria, why don't you comment a little bit on the process and how we got here. Maria Henry : Yes, what I'd say, I'd start by pointing back to a few years ago. Actually, if you think about it, we hired a global supply chain leader coming up on three years. And she put a team in place and that team has been doing a lot of work over the last couple of years to assess and identify opportunities and you've seen a lot of their work along with our global teams in the mills delivered through the FORCE cost savings. But as they've done that foundational work leading into 2017, I think it gave us a good footprint on the overhead side of the house. We did a lot of work with both our IT teams and finance teams to get our information lined up in a consistent way so that we could understand better and have better visibility into our SG&A spend. And that work started, I'd say, a couple of years ago. So in 2017, we were in a really good position from the actions we had taken to go ahead and launch a very comprehensive process to look at our cost structure. We used a consulting firm to help us upfront to get the program structured and just set up governance, to provide expensive benchmarks for us. But it was our teams though that did the work. And there were several hundred people involved in this process. The program isn't an across-the-board reduction plan; it's not a textbook BBB approach. We actually went function-by-function to look at the work that we're doing, where we're doing that work in order to identify opportunities to do things differently. Really we had a lens to say how can we run our business fundamentally on a lower-cost structure. And so on the SG&A side, we took a whiteboard approach and classified our activities into what's baseline, what do you need to do to keep the business running versus what are differentiated activities. We then went hard at looking for ways to reduce the spend on the table stakes types of activities and free up that money to invest in more differentiated capabilities and activities. And then on the supply chain side, I would say what we do with the restructuring is really accelerate the work that our global supply chain teams were doing on the network optimization because we wanted to get a comprehensive view of our opportunities globally. That enabled us to then identify the programs that have the best returns, take advantage of our global scale and prioritize our investments. And at the same time all of these cost work was going on, Mike and his operating team were taking a fresh assessment on our markets, our category growth rate, our competitive position, our innovation pipeline, and I'll let Mike talk about that more in a minute. But the combination of all of that work together, the extensive work on the G&A side, the comprehensive view of our global supply chain, and also an affirmation of our belief in the long-term growth algorithm from the growth work the teams have done are really coming together in the restructuring program that we have announced as well as our commitment on the FORCE target as well as our 2018 guidance on our longer-term outlook. Michael Hsu : Yes, we went through maybe a concurrent process to, hey, what is strategically where we\u2019re going to get our growth from and how do we best position ourselves to achieve that growth, and that includes restarting, we\u2019re accelerating our growth in North America, a lot of the work that we talk about with the NE and also by leveraging technology, both this digital and e-commerce technology, but also our own product-making technologies and how do we drive that more effectively. And so kind of we went through a process and worked on where we want to place our bets. And at the same time, I think, we also said what kind of company do we want to be and how do we want to evolve our organization. And I think the words that kind of came out over and over again we are smarter and faster. And as Maria mentioned, we means we want to be low cost, smarter means we want to leverage our scale more effectively and faster means we are an agile organization, we are locally empowered, we could do better by simplifying some of the work that\u2019s done locally. So I think we\u2019re very excited about development in this program and looking forward to the returns. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Just on the pulp estimate, and I appreciate your pricing commentary, but we before we go into pulp, I understand where you're saying in the U.S. will be more mix rather than pricing for innovation. So just to on a comparable basis, you are not taking prices in the U.S. correct? Thomas Falk : In terms of list price at this point in time, again, we don't talk a lot about forecasting, but I don't think there will be major list price changes. That doesn't mean that there won't be opportunities with trade or promoted price points or things like that, that could be a factor. Andrea Teixeira : Yes, and then following up - sorry, go ahead. Thomas Falk : No, just saying Andrea that we like to be more efficient with our trades, and we still think we have a lot of opportunity to get better at that. And that goes into the proverbial work that we use is just fine tuning. Andrea Teixeira : I understand that, that makes sense. On the pulp side though, from what I understand, the pulp spot prices are closer to 1,200. And I get it that obviously throughout the year, it may change, right? But now you are saying on average, you are looking at 1,050 I think to 1,100 as you put it in the guidance. So you're saying, even though the beginning of the year will be - so you're expecting to go down to an average of that number, I\u2019m expecting that you believe you will be below thousand at the end. So if you can help me kind of like break down that estimate? So as the cadence of the year for pulp. Is there any indication that you are seeing that the back end of the year will be below thousand? Paul Alexander : Andrea, this is Paul. So just to level set everyone. Our outlook on pulp is solely based on what the industry forecasters tell us. So I don't think we are calling it any different than what you'd see if you ask when see about their outlook for 2018. And in terms of the cadence, I think the forecast would show some slight moderation starting late Q1 and then into the back half of the year. But I don't believe that there is any one time period that's supposed to be below $1000 a ton. Andrea Teixeira : And the same for oil, I'm assuming, right? For oil, you're kind of using external, external\u2026 Thomas Falk : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Societe Generale. Iain Simpson : A couple of questions for me, please. Firstly, it's very encouraging to see mid-single-digit growth in China and thanks for the extra color. Just on diaper, what's the birthrates in China doing now? And could you comment a little bit on what percentage of diaper in China is online for both you and the market? And second, I know you've had a few questions on it already, but pretty much everywhere in the world consumer tissue is sorry consumer tissue is a commodity category. The U.S. is pretty unique in that respect. So looking about pricing in U.S. consumer tissue, even with input costs doing what they are doing, is this structural? And what gives you confidence that what we're seeing in just U.S. consumer tissue becoming a commodity like it is everywhere else in the world? Many thanks. Thomas Falk : Yes, just on China, I'd say, first, we saw about 18 million verse this year was the estimate, and I think that\u2019s driven pretty good double-digit growth in the category overall. Again, I think we underperformed the category on that cell just based on some of the competitive dynamics. But we do expect to improve that trajectory over time. The second part of your question was online and where we are. I think we believe we are the leaders in e-commerce in China. We've got great relationships with all the major e-commerce players and great capability. Over 50% of our business is currently sold online. Michael Hsu : We are probably over-indexed relative to the category a bit. Thomas Falk : Yes. Michael Hsu : And then your last question, maybe I'll debate a bit. I mean, I would say, I don't think consumer tissue is a commodity category and we have terrific brands in specific markets. There are tougher category trading conditions in some places, I will not dispute that. But I look at our Hendricks brand in the U. K. where we've got a strong little 30 share, very high brand loyalty, decent profit margins and good, good opportunities to innovate around that space. We've got in specific markets in Latin America where we got very strong branded positions as well and other specific markets like in Korea and others in Australia. And so sometimes tougher from a margin standpoint, but I may be biased, I probably am, but I think it's a long way from a commodity category. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks for squeezing me in and I appreciate it. My question relates to your appetite for M&A. So you've obviously been less active on this front and tend to discuss it less than a number of companies in the CPG space, particularly those that are struggling to find growth. So we talked a lot about the difficult environment, we can appreciate that, but does this lend itself at all perhaps to greater openness for M&A in order to diversify away from some of these categories and given the strong cash flows of the business, albeit with slowing top line growth? So a number of questions around that, how actively are you looking at assets? Is that any more less than recent history? Would you need to build out your business development capabilities? What categories, geographies may be interest, et cetera. So any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you. Thomas Falk : Yes, sure. I would say our view hasn't changed. We've typically felt like we had enough organic growth opportunity in the portfolio and that was the right thing for us to chase, that was the best opportunity to create long-term shareholder value. So I've been around long enough that we've done a bunch of M&A, we built most of our Latin American business through M& A in the '90s and early 2000s. There aren't that many of those kinds of opportunities left in the world that are things that we know a lot about that would be highly likely to be able to be integrated and create shareholder value. Having said that, we picked up small opportunities. We bought the other half of our business in India late last year from our partner. We bought the other half of our business in Israel a couple of years ago from our partner. So there are some of those types of those opportunities that are small and make sense. But in our core space of things that we think we know how to do, we just haven't seen a lot that's out there that we think is shareholder value creating. Kevin Grundy : And fair to say doesn't seem like it's a big priority. I can appreciate the view that you don't want to overpay and go into categories where you don't have a lot of background or expertise or scale, et cetera, but it doesn't seem like it's a big priority to build out capabilities, personnel and otherwise to explore higher-growth categories and the ones you're participating in. Is that fair? Thomas Falk : That's correct. Operator : Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Just a quick one on housekeeping. Could you just tell us the split of the charges associated with restructuring plan that are going to be cash versus non-cash this year? And then secondly, how should we think about on your plans to fund some of the added cash fund needs that you have over the next couple of years, particularly given the portion that\u2019s expected to be incurred this year? Thank you. Maria Henry : Sure. For 2018 of the charges, a little more than half of them will be cash charges for this year. Thomas Falk : And then in terms of funding it, maybe you\u2019d also comment on cash flow expectations and so forth. Maria Henry : Sure. In terms of cash flow for next year, I commented that we expect cash from operations to be similar to 2017. Included in there, we've got the cash that we will spend on to fund the restructuring. On the tax line, we get the cash flow benefit of tax reform. And as you know, with the restructuring charge that we take, there are also cash tax benefits that we'll have in 2018 that net us out to similar operating cash flow for 2018. Beyond that, we did give the higher expectation for capital spending. And so we would expect that we would take on some additional debt as we get into 2018 to fund the higher CapEx. Priya Ohri-Gupta: And in terms of the higher debt, should we anticipate that being through CP related, or something more longer term? Thank you. Maria Henry : Yes. We do have plan to make more use of CP. That will give us the benefit of the very low rate that we\u2019re getting on that. And we've got a lot of capacity on the CP front. Operator : Our next question comes from Iain Simpson with Societe Generale. Iain Simpson : Just on your M&A comments, you highlighted that pretty much all of the acquisitions that you've done recently were buying out minorities. Could you just remind us what businesses with minorities you kind of have? And is there any comment you could make as to anything we should bear in mind on that? I mean the obvious one is Mexico but I just wondered if there were any we should be aware of. Thank you. Thomas Falk : In Mexico, we're the minority, we own 48% of that one and the other 52% is a publicly traded company, so that won\u2019t be a little bit more complicated. Other than that, there is a very, very small minority shareholder interest in Central America. I think it's less than 5% of the operations and it's a family that seems pretty happy with that investment. And we've got a minority partner in Korea that owns 30% of the Korean business, and I think that\u2019s about it in terms of what's left out there. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : I just want to - back into Maria's explanation about the financial expenses and layer into your guidance. As you take on more debt, I\u2019m assuming you're assuming a much lower rate for, as you were saying. I just want because you are taking more debt, but you are guiding for 20% lower financial expenses. Is that something related to hedging, or anything that we may not be aware that would bridge the gap? Maria Henry : Sure. We've done a lot of work to lower the tax - the interest expense for the company. In 2017, we took out, as they came due, some or I should say replaced some high coupon bonds with much lower interest expense vehicle. For example, this summer, we took on $500 million of euro debt that's priced below 1%, as an example. And also as we closed out this year and with tax reform expected to come, we took out a very high coupon bond that was going to originally be due in November of 2018. So we took that out in December to pay the arbitrage on the tax rate and get benefits there. So the actions we took in 2017 and have been taking to replace high coupon debt with low interest vehicles and then the early retirement of the November bond is what's driving the lower interest expense for 2018. Thomas Falk : And then maybe just to add, we expect to maintain the A rating and so the debt increases are fairly modest relative to historical standards for us. Andrea Teixeira : So the average interest expense or the average interest rate is how much, if you can share against the 2017 average? Maria Henry : Yes. It is down. I don't think we share the specific. Thomas Falk : We probably should say in a couple of weeks and you can do the math in the footnote. Operator : At this time we have no other questioners in the queue. Paul Alexander : All right, Bob. We thank everyone for your questions and we will conclude with a comment from Tom. Thomas Falk : Once again a lot of news for Kimberly-Clark. We are expecting another better year in 2018. We've got an aggressive plan to go execute and we appreciate your support. So thank you very much for your time with us today. Paul Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines. And thank you for joining us this morning.",

At the conclusion of this morning's presentation, we will open the floor for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedures to follow-up, if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today, are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here's the agenda for the call; Maria will start with a review of first quarter results and provide a brief update on our global restructuring program. After that, Mike will share his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the year. We will finish with Q&A, with Tom, Mike and Maria. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our web site. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Finally, we will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook; both which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks Paul. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. We returned to delivering organic sales growth, with a solid increase of 2%. Margins were impacted by significant commodity inflation. Helping to offset that, we delivered strong cost savings and reduced overhead spending, and our adjusted earnings per share increased 9%. And finally, we are on track with our restructuring program and our overall capital plan. Now let's look at the details of our results. Let me start with sales; our first quarter net sales were $4.7 billion. That's up 5% year-on-year with a three point benefit from currency rates. Organic sales grew 2% in the quarter, led by improved performance in North America. Mike is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes. Moving on to profitability; our first quarter adjusted growth margin was 33.8%, down 310 basis points year-on-year. Commodities were a drag of $175 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher pulp costs and secondarily, inflation and other raw materials. We are now expecting the full year cost inflation will be between $400 million and $550 million. That's a $100 million to $150 million more than we assumed in January. Meanwhile, our FORCE cost savings program continued to deliver strong results. First quarter savings were $90 million. Moving down the P&L, adjusted operating margins was 17.4%, down 140 basis points. Between-the-lines spending fell 140 basis points as a percent of net sales, as we continue to tightly manage overhead and discretionary spending throughout our company. In a few minutes, Mike will talk about what we are doing to improve margins from the first quarter levels. All in all, adjusted operating profit was down 3%. In addition to the factors that I just mentioned, results benefitted from volume growth and $20 million of favorable currency translation effect, but were also impacted by lower net selling prices. On the bottom line, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.71, up 9% year-on-year. That included about seven points of earnings growth from a lower tax rate, along with benefits from lower interest expense and share count. Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency; cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $542 million compared to $436 million in the year ago quarter. The increase was in line with our expectations and driven by lower tax payments. We continue to allocate capital in a shareholder friendly way. Dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $550 million in the first quarter, and we expect the full year amount will total $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Looking at our results by segment; in Personal Care, organic sales were even year-on-year. Volumes and product mix, each improved 1%, offset by lower net selling prices. Overall Personal Care operating margins remain healthy at 20.4%, although down 120 basis points, including impacts from commodity inflation and lower selling prices. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales rose 5%, volumes increased 7%, while product mix was down two points. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 15.8% were down 340 basis points. Significantly higher pulp costs were partially offset by top line growth, cost savings, and lower between-the-lines spending. In our K-C Professional business, organic sales grew 2%; volumes increased approximately 2% and price and mix were both also slightly positive. K-C Professional operating margins were 19%, that's up 10 basis points, as our team continued to manage well in this environment. Now let me share a brief update on our 2018 Global Restructuring Program. Initial implementation steps are underway, and we are on track with our plan. In terms of our administrative and overhead organizations, in North America, we offered a voluntary severance plan to most of our salaried employees in the first quarter, and that plan is now closed. Soon, we will begin to share more specifics with our workforce, primarily in North America, about our redesigned organization and the resulting implications. We have also announced our intention to move our European shared service center from the U.K. to Poland, in order to reduce our labor costs. In terms of manufacturing facilities, we have announced our intention to close our Consumer Tissue facility in California, and are planning to close our nonwovens facility in Wisconsin. We continue to expect $50 million to $70 million of restructuring savings in 2018, with the vast majority of these savings occurring in the second half of the year, as our workforce reductions ramp up. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Hsu : Thanks Maria. Good morning. I am going to focus my comments this morning on organic sales and our full year earnings outlook. As Maria just mentioned, organic sales grew 2% in the quarter, which is a good start to the year. Performance included benefits from targeted growth initiatives, innovations launched over the past 12 months, and increased investments in our brands. On our conference call in January, I had talked about our three main growth priorities for the year. Let me now spend a few minutes on each. Our first priority is to strengthen and grow our core businesses. In North American consumer products, organic sales increased 3% in the first quarter, behind volume growth of 6%. Market shares were up or even year-on-year in five of eight product categories, and up or even sequentially compared to the prior quarter in every category. In Personal Care in North America; volumes increased 3%, net selling prices were down 2%, reflecting increased investment levels that helped our volume performance. In terms of innovation, in the first half, we are launching product improvements on Pull-Ups training pants, premium Huggies diapers, Huggies baby wipes, Poise pads, and Depend underwear. In Consumer Tissue in North America, volumes rose 9% compared to a decline of 7% in the year ago period. Results benefitted from increased promotion support, a severe cold and flu season and promotion timing differences compared to last year. Product mix was down three points because of the promotion activity. Now in terms of product news, we are introducing new Kleenex wet wipes, and bringing major bath tissue improvements to Cottonelle, and part of our Scott line-up. The bath tissue upgrades are shipping now, and come with sheet count reductions. This will improve net realized revenue high single digits on nearly $1 billion in annual sales. In our K-C Professional business, volumes were up 2% in North America, with growth in all product categories led by wipers. K-C Professional volumes increased 4% in developing and emerging markets, led by Asia-Pacific. In our developed markets outside North America, organic sales rose 2%. In South Korea, our diaper business continues to be impacted by lower birth rate. However, this was offset by strong results in our other consumer businesses there. Now let me turn to our second priority, which is to accelerate Personal Care growth in developing and emerging markets. First quarter organic sales for these businesses were even year-on-year. Looking at some of our key markets; in Brazil, organic sales were up mid-single digits, driven by broad based volume growth. Market shares were up nearly three points in diapers and two points in feminine care. Elsewhere in Latin America, organic sales were down low single digits. That included lower volumes in Argentina, Chile and Colombia. That said, our market positions are holding up well, including in Argentina, where Huggies share is up 1 point. We expect our sales to pick up in Latin America. We have a number of product innovations launching throughout the region, and we are implementing selling price increases to help offset inflation. In China, organic sales were down mid-single digits. A strong growth in feminine care was more than offset by lower sales in diapers. We just started to introduce a significantly upgraded Huggies premium diaper, and we have more innovation coming later in the year. We expect these innovations will improve our volume trends in the coming quarters. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased mid-teens. Our momentum continues to be strong in this part of the world, with another quarter of double digit volume growth, and share gains on Huggies and Kotex. Regarding our third growth priority, which is to further build digital and e-commerce capability; we continue to make good progress. Our targeted digital marketing programs, investment in tools to improve capabilities, and customer joint business plans are producing strong results. That was especially true this quarter in North America. So to summarize our top line, I am encouraged with our start to the year. We know we have more work to do, because we continue to operate in a competitive environment. That said, our first quarter results and our plans going forward give me further confidence in our 1% organic growth target for the year. Now, let me turn to our earnings outlook. We continue to target full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $6.90 to $7.20. That's a year-on-year growth of 11% to 16%. Our teams are taking actions to improve net realized revenue and reduce costs to offset the commodity headwinds we are facing. We expect these actions will help improve our margins from first quarter levels, especially in the second half of the year. On the revenue front, we are taking steps in several layers of our business. Key actions include the sheet count reductions in North America, and the price increases in Latin America that I just mentioned. In addition, our consumer businesses in other international markets will be raising prices and our K-C Professional team has begun to do the same in most regions. While many of these initiatives were included in our original plan for the year, our overall expectation for selling price increases has improved slightly from three months ago. In terms of our focus on costs, more savings should be built from first quarter levels. In addition, as Maria noted, restructuring savings will occur mostly in the back half of the year, and our teams are moving with urgency to accelerate actions. We are also redoubling our efforts to reduce discretionary spending. In total, we expect these actions, combined with our volume growth initiatives, a slightly better currency outlook, and some flexibility that we built into our original 2018 plan, will enable us to deliver our earnings guidance for the year. So to summarize, we are off to a good start to the year on the top line and with our market positions. We are taking steps to improve our profitability, and we are broadly on track with our 2018 plan. Overall, we remain very optimistic about our opportunities to create long term shareholder value through successful execution of our strategies. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and we will begin to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Thomas Falk : Hey, good morning Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Hey good morning. Thanks for the question. So I wanted to just ask a little bit about pricing. So I think the sheet count reductions on Consumer Tissues, something where you should probably have very good visibility, have done it many-many times before, and the math is pretty easy to do, thank you for that detail Mike. I was curious though on the Personal Care business, particularly in North America and in Brazil. So one is that in North America, I think we have heard and we heard last week from a major competitor about things just getting a lot tougher on the private label end of the world, in terms of retailers all kind of reacting to each other, will say and the pressure that's putting on the lower end pricing in their portfolio. So I was wondering about your visibility on pricing on North America diapers, how much pressure there is there, and if you really think you can move things up a bit more? And then in Brazil, some chatter about some deflation in Brazil, on it being a difficult place to get pricing, and I was wondering, to what degree that was critical to your forecast? Thank you. Thomas Falk : I am going to let Mike elaborate on it, and I guess, I'd say just kind of broadly, as you look at private label shares in North America, they really haven't moved around a lot. Our estimated first quarter private label market share for diapers in North America is about the same as the full year average last year, and actually down slightly from fourth quarter. So maybe we have a little bit different view of it than others might, but I don't know Mike, do you want to add anything else to that, other than comment on Brazil and what's going on with pricing there? Michael Hsu : Yeah. I think, diapers specifically I think was maybe up half a share point in the quarter in North America. I think, maybe the opportunity for us is, we are evaluating some count reductions on diapers and then the other lever for us in pricing in North America would be fine tuning our trade promotion plans, right? And so, there is always an opportunity for us to adjust our frequency and our depth, and that's what we are evaluating right now. With regard to Brazil, we had a good start to the year in Brazil. Sales and volume and share were all up pretty good. I will say, we are taking pricing and have taken pricing in Brazil and that feels like that has gone through and the market has responded accordingly. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. And in North America, the frequency and depth, I mean, is that something that you are seeing competitors move to what's the retailer receptivity to that; because it feels like if anything, retailers are looking at diapers as, whether you [indiscernible] calling it a loss later [ph], but something to drive traffic, bringing in families and etcetera. So I think, that's a category in particular, where they'd be wanting more and more support from their suppliers, rather than less promotional activity? Michael Hsu : Obviously Lauren, the baby category and mom is very important to retailers, and so they are very focused there. But I do maybe have a different take, which is I think a lot of the pricing activity you are seeing, may have been promotion driven versus retailer strategies. And while I think they all want to be competitive on the diaper business, I think it's, in some ways up to us, to make sure we are managing the business appropriately in the long term. And in this category, I think, innovation, and creating value add and then premiumizing the category over time is really the best way to grow our fixed consumption category, and that's where we are focused on, and I think a lot of the retailers will understand that strategy and approach. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Thank you. Thomas Falk : Thanks Lauren. Michael Hsu : Thanks Lauren. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Thomas Falk : Hey good morning Jason. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for allowing me to ask a question. Michael, I guess in your prepared remarks, early on, you talked about increased investment in brands to drive growth. You referenced in the press release kind of pulling back, and if we look at the last few years, if you continue to sort of pull back, it looks like this will be the fifth year in a row, that as a percentage of sales, advertising, if not marketing overall, has shrunk. It begs the question of whether or not, you may be underinvesting behind your brands, particularly in the competitive environment. Can you shed your perspective or share your perspective on that, and why we shouldn't be concerned that you may need to reinvest going forward, particularly given the weakening top line, especially in emerging markets? Thank you. Thomas Falk : Yeah, thanks Jason. Obviously, I think as a long term driver, we do want to grow our investments behind the brands. I think that investment comes multiple ways however, and so I think overall, I think, we are very balanced on our advertising spend. We have increased our promotional spend, and as we saw the markets kind of get competitive towards the back half of last year, we did show some funds in the both consumer and trade promotion. And as we go forward this year, I think we have got very strong investments, both in terms of product and innovation in China and North America and in Latin America, and we strengthened our execution or merchandising investments in the brand. Thomas Falk : Jason, just to build on that. I mean, everything we move to digital coupons winds up being a reduction in net sales and showing up as negative price, even though we might argue, that that's a strategic targeting of an individual consumer. Jason English : Okay. That's helpful. And then, real quick, if you could delve in a bit more into China, the decline there this quarter is a bit surprising. Can you talk a little bit more about what's going on? You are talking about innovation -- you have been talking about innovation. It seems like you have a pretty full product cycle for quite a few years there, like your position in the market has kind of been eroding. Are there more structural reasons that you could be losing ground, perhaps with the Made in China stamp that's on your product? Maybe it's the marketing posture? I am not sure, I am hoping you could shed light on that? Thomas Falk : Yeah. I have viewed a couple of headlines, Jason, that Mike can build on. I mean, pretty much all the big international branded players lost share in the last quarter, and so, it has been the local Chinese brands that have actually probably picked it up through e-commerce. And so, that's really just in BCC and in fem care, we had a great quarter with strong growth. And so China is a tough competitive market, it's a huge market with huge potential. Where we have got lots of innovation coming and we still believe in the opportunity there, but it's a tough competitive place in the short term. I don't know, Mike, if there is anything else that you want to add to that? Michael Hsu : Just as Tom said, Jason, I think the China diaper category is under a little bit of pressure from the local players, and we are addressing that with the major launch of a significant product improvement on Huggies. China overall remains our single largest growth opportunity, both in the near term and over the long term. Pricing has been competitive, but I think that's stabilizing, and I really believe, fundamentally in China, well it's not structural, its product, performance and features are still the key driver of brand choice, and that's still what's driving that marketplace. And so, we are launching our best ever diaper, that delivers a really significant improvement in both thinness, softness, breathability, and absorption. I mean, it's a pretty impressive product. We are excited about it. It's certainly better than what we had out before, and outperforms all major competitors. So we expect that's going to improve our performance, as we get into the back half of the year. Just starting to ship now. Thomas Falk : It's going to be a competitive market for a long-long time, just given the opportunity there. Jason English : Sure. Thanks a lot guys. Thomas Falk : Thanks Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Thomas Falk : Good morning Ali. Ali Dibadj : Hey, how are you? I have a few things; one is, just to talk a little bit more about the negative price mix dynamics in this quarter, and then kind of going forward, in particular, in North America. Because you guys just said a second ago, the retailers aren't the ones pushing you on price, they kind of have all the more buy-ins from a de-sheeting perspective and tissue at least, and maybe even on a reduced count in diapers that sounded like. But private label, seeing the Nielsen data, and you guys mentioned it, has gone up actually quite a bit, the 50 basis points is not small in the past quarter. And so, let's just even assume the retailers get it? I mean, they are getting private labels in their choice. Let's assume, even the retailers get it, how come you have more confidence that the competitors are getting? PG for example, gets it, that pricing should be more benign going forward, more positive, as opposed to you guys losing lot of share? I am trying to dig into that incremental confidence you have? Thomas Falk : Maybe I will give you some macro view, and then Mike can give you some details. I mean, number one, if you look sequentially, price for us was negative 2 in the fourth quarter, it was negative 1 in the first quarter. So it did ease a little bit, not a lot, and we have some initiatives in the marketplace, that roughly track commodities, and you see commodities move at this level historically. You typically see some finished product, price recovery, either a pull back in trade, a little bit less depth, and you are starting to see some of that play out in different markets around the world. And so I think, that's not surprising, and we will see how the rest of the year plays out. I don't know, Mike, if there is anything else you want to add to that? Michael Hsu : No, I mean, Ali, we are trying to be balanced. And obviously, we want to drive the organic growth, but we also want to deliver our margin commitments, and so we are walking that balance. And so the opportunity for us is, we have evaluated opportunities for count reductions and have a few -- quite a few in the plan, but the other opportunity for us is to get more efficient with our trade spending. And you know, we are looking at the competitive marketplace and our field teams have a good sense of what is required to drive the promotional list that we need, and we think we have an opportunity to fine tune it. Ali Dibadj : So just continuing on that, are you leading the planned price increases? Thomas Falk : I'd say in general, we are probably matching up globally with competition. And just as an example, we didn't lead it, to be clear. Ali Dibadj : You did not? Thomas Falk : We didn't. And some large market examples that have happened recently, we did not lead it. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And then, from a -- production on pulp pricing, I know you guys are very loyal to the RISI numbers. Can you give us an update on what that's looking like going forward? Last quarter, we all talked about the RISI numbers being perhaps a little bit too positive in terms of pulling the pulp prices down, at least on NBSK, it seems like, towards the end of this year. Can you tell us where that is and how you guys are modeling the prices at this point, on pulp? Thomas Falk : We use RISI, because they have been the best forecaster out there. I don't know that we are in love with any of them, and I think every pulp forecast that I have ever gotten in my career, just about always had a positive upwards slope and they are only right half of the time. So at this point, every forecast we get lately, pulp prices look like they are going higher than the last one we got. And so, you are certainly -- having seen pulp markets in the past, they can get a bit frothy, as the producers are disciplined on taking downtime and you get some Chinese demand. You can definitely see some upward moves in pulp price, and that's certainly showing up in some of the RISI data we have seen lately, and that's kind of the high end of our forecast range. It's kind of the worse case of what we have seen from RISI lately. Ali Dibadj : So not tailing off until lower by the end of the year, effectively, what you are saying? Thomas Falk : I think that's what the current outlook would look like. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And then my last question is, just this mix between -- I think between the lines, as you call it, or A&P, I guess, spend, as part of between the lines, versus trade spend. I get that you can shift from A&P to an online coupon, and you get a response, it's a transactional response. But is that building brand or are you training the consumer to be more looking for and seeking of deals, so you are actually hurting the brand over the long term? And this is the bait [ph] we have had with many other companies to -- Thomas Falk : This is a very philosophical question this morning, Ali. I'd say, first of all, every coupon is a company with some other kind of a brand message, and you want to click through -- get the consumer to click through and see your other brand equity building messages. And it is one of the things that we do think about, is that are you building equity in the right places, and to Mike's earlier comment, we believe, product innovation and having winning products, talking about in the right way, and in some cases, providing an incentive to try, is the way you build brands long term. But we are -- I think we are all trying to figure out, how do we build a one-to-one relationship versus a mass media blast, way of building brands. Michael Hsu : Yeah Ali, we are pushing a big shift in the digital. It gets more complicated, because some of it goes into consumer promotion. A lot of it actually goes into trade, because we do some of -- quite a bit of it for our customers, with online media. And it may not necessarily even be a coupon, it could be a pure add, and we are getting a lot of efficiency in terms of ROI on it, because it's allowing us to target our consumer with a lot more precision. I would just put our Asia Pacific team out last month, and they were showing that, the hits on target more than doubled over the past year, in terms of reaching our target audience, versus the spillover that you might get on TV. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Thanks very much guys. Thomas Falk : Thanks Ali. Michael Hsu : Thanks Ali. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Thomas Falk : Good morning Stephen. Stephen Powers : Thanks. Good morning. So I guess, a little bit more on pricing, if I could. So I guess, if the environment is as constructive as it -- I guess, it sounds like you are implying with branded and private label pressures, maybe less severe than many of us perceived. Haven't we seen more pricing to-date, and why should things change, going forward? Just because gross margin is down 300 basis points year-over-year, it's a pretty -- just implies a pretty difficult backdrop. So just a little bit more kind of clarity between what we are seeing in the actual data, and then what you are -- just like the qualitative communication today seems to be implying. There seems to be a disconnect there. So just any color you have there would be great? Thomas Falk : The only misread that we are saying it's an easy pricing environment, and it's not. It's a challenging competitive environment. As we would look at our gross margins, it's down significantly year-over-year, it's down about 100 basis points sequentially. So it's not that far off from where it was in the fourth quarter. Some of the pricing actions we talked about are just going into the market now, or they have been announced and we will roll in, in the second quarter. So we didn't get a lot of it in the first quarter results. And I think, like everybody else, pricing has certain expectations, and as commodity cost expectations have increased during the quarter, that's caused some of our teams to go back and relook at their plans for the year, and see, where else we can generate more revenue. Mike, I don't know if you want to -- Michael Hsu : Yeah, I wouldn't Steve -- I don't think we are trying to imply whether the pricing environment is difficult or very easy or -- all we are trying to suggest is, these are the actions we are taking; which is, we have taken some account reductions. We are managing our trade budget to be much more efficient, and we are looking at the frequency and depth of our promotions. Stephen Powers : Okay. Maybe just it would help. On the sheet count reductions, specific that you mentioned in North America, is that an issue that you have led or are you following someone else's action in the market? Michael Hsu : I believe that our key competitor has already taken that in 2017, and so -- and we are coupling with a significant product improvement, because it's also -- it's much easier to get price or revenue recognition, when you have got innovation to package it with. It's a whole different conversation with the retailer, if you have got a better performing product. And yes, they cost a little bit more, so even a different conversation with the consumer. It's a straight list price change, that's a little harder for them to swallow sometimes. So some of the pricing actions are tying into innovation activities that we have planned, as the year rolls out. Thomas Falk : For example, Steve, on Cottonelle, we have got a terrific product improvement superiority versus other brands, and it's a breakthrough type product for us, and that did come with a sheet count reduction, high single digit, in fact. Stephen Powers : Okay, great. I guess -- and one last one if you could, given the way you've guided commodities, which effectively is below current spot and below year-to-date run rates. I guess, in the context of pricing, I am just trying to understand, how you frame that? What's the pitch to retail partners; because it seems on the surface, a bit muddled, but we have faced a lot of pressure. We think commodities will trend lower, but we need some pricing. I'd just love some commentary there? Thomas Falk : Well, they are still going to be higher significantly year-over-year I think, and they are all watching it and they are seeing it across other categories as well. So it's not enough dialog. Stephen Powers : Thank you very much. Thomas Falk : Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Thomas Falk : Good morning Olivia. Olivia Tong : Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about how you are feeling about your market shares and relative strength? Where you are seeing some improvement; because your commentary is clearly more optimistic than some of your competitors, and obviously you are looking to price. So just would love to hear a little bit about market share specifically, in Tissue and Personal Care? Thomas Falk : Yeah. Mike can give you a little bit more detail. I mean, I would say, we weren't satisfied with our market shares in 2017, and we had a better start to the year and the first quarter. And so, I think -- and we track the major markets and major categories, and I think we were up in almost 60% of those in the first quarter. But we'd still say, you know, that's kind of bouncing back from a tougher year in 2017. So we are pleased, but we are not satisfied, I guess is a way to describe it. Michael Hsu : I'd characterize it as maybe a good start to the year, but we want to continue to focus on it. Overall, North America, up about a share point, up in five of eight of our overall categories. Up in Brazil significantly; Argentina, Eastern Europe up a couple of points as well. I think the one area that we need to improve, and that's where we are bringing innovation, is in China, where we are down a couple of points in diapers. Thomas Falk : [indiscernible]. Olivia Tong : Got it. And that sort of leads into my question about emerging markets, because it's surprising to see that your sales were worse in emerging markets versus developed markets. But typically you don't see that. So you mentioned earlier a lot of the local competitors kind of getting better in online, but I thought your shares were better or your shares were higher online than off. So can you talk about the disconnect there? Thomas Falk : That's still true. I think online is a place where you probably have fewer barriers to entry, and so there is more players coming into that space. If you could trial in a category, you can drain off some of the growth in that category. Olivia Tong : Is most of that new product -- most of the innovation that's launching in China, is that primarily going to be in Q2, or is it more equitable through the year? Thomas Falk : We will have a big push in Q2. But then, there is more coming later in the year. Olivia Tong : Got it. Michael Hsu : A lot of it is shipping right now. Olivia Tong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. Thomas Falk : Good morning Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Good morning. I have a question on private label. I know you guys are somewhat confident about your position against private label; but some of the channel data we look at, suggests that private label continues to make inroads into some of your larger categories. So curious to hear if you guys are noticing instances, where you might be losing shelf space to private label at retail, or possibly these share gains coming at the expense of some of your competitors products? Thomas Falk : Okay, Bonnie. Yeah, we are following the private label trends very carefully, particularly in North America. And our focus is really on differentiating our brands with value added innovation and partnering with the customers, to focus on category growth. But the overall penetration levels over -- if you looked over the past five years, had been at similar levels. Down overall in Personal Care and up a bit in Consumer Tissue. We are focused on differentiation, and we have done that well, we have been able to grow our share and that's occurred in categories like adult care, diapers, and wipes. What we need to a better job is in the bath tissue category, where private label penetration has grown a bit over the last couple of years, and that's what, we are bringing in some significant innovation this year, with Cottonelle and Scott Comfort Plus. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. That's helpful. And then I just had another question on your supply chain. Some of your peers have talked about steps they have taken across the supply chain to really, I guess, adapt to the changing retail inventory, [indiscernible] patterns, and I guess in a sense to more rapidly products to reduce system inventories. So I guess I am curious to hear what steps you might be taking to reduce system inventories thus far, and whether there are still improvements you can potentially make? Thanks. Thomas Falk : That's a great question. I will have Maria build on that. And really, we are trying to keep our retailers in stock, while minimizing system inventory. There is a lot of stuff that we are working on. Maria, I know you can give them some color on that? Maria Henry : Yeah. I think there is a couple of points there. As you know, we have got significant activities in our company to improve our overall supply chain. One, just generally through our FORCE cost savings program, and two, with our restructuring there, we have taken that global view of our manufacturing network and are taking some steps to improve our advantages there. In terms of the retailer inventory, I do think it's worth noting that that was not an issue that we saw this quarter, and so, we are working the supply chain overall, clearly it's evolving as new channels are evolving and we are working with our key customers on how to make all of that work and continuing to improve what we have got. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. Thank you. Thomas Falk : Thanks Bonnie. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good morning. Thomas Falk : Hey Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Hey, good morning. I wanted to drill down on gross margins a bit if we could. So if I am not mistaken here in looking at our model, it's the lowest gross margin you have delivered since the first quarter of 2012, and of course, we understand that the environment is difficult and input costs have moved higher. But how should we think about this now, particularly two pieces to it? Number one, the near term, the progression for the balance of the year, input costs clearly higher, you talked about some pricing you could potentially get. But then also the longer term component of it, so your ability to restore gross margins to current levels, I guess, I asked it in the context of a couple of things. Number one, street expectations seem to suggest something in the 36%, or even close to 37% range looking out to 2020. Is that a feasible number? You delivered something close to that, looking back to 2016. But is the environment different now, and the market sort of discussion here is not lost on you guys [indiscernible], just in terms around CPG brands strength [ph] ability to take pricing maybe perhaps impaired. So a commentary there would be helpful. Another one, the near term, the cadence here on the gross margin for the balance of the year, and then the second piece, sort of longer term, what's your confidence now that we can come off of this sub-34% level and restored something closer to where expectations, street estimates currently are in the 36%, 37% range? Thomas Falk : Yeah. I think those are all important questions. And I'd say if you -- we have got a pretty significant commodity exposure. And so, you are going to see some swings in our gross margin when commodities are relatively low, gross margins will spike up a little bit and vice versa, which is what we are going through right now. If you kind of look at the quarter, virtually, all of the decrease in our gross profit, if you net it all out, was the negative price item. All the other stuff, commodity costs, net of cost savings, net of currency benefit kind of washed out, and the price kind of fell through to the bottom line. So as we roll forward, we hope we have more positive pricing comparisons, as we get some price in the market. This is probably the toughest commodity costs year-on-year comparison in the quarter. So commodity costs, we will start to lap those increases, that started to happen in the second half of last year. We expect our cost savings to build, both from our FORCE cost savings program, and our FORCE cost savings program, and our restructuring cost savings, some of which will hit gross profits, some of which will hit in between the lines. So we have got a lot of levers pulling, that should improve our gross profit perspective, as we work through the year, and that's kind of what our guidance is built around. If that's helpful? Kevin Grundy : I mean, directionally it helps. I mean, like more specifically, because I guess like, the market concern would be that, 2015 and 2016 were sort of peak margins for this business, the environment has now changed, particularly in the U.S., there is a balance of power shift to retail, that pricing is going to become more difficult, that those levels are just not something that can be attained to get. It will be increasingly difficult. Would you agree with that characterization on, just specifically on quantifying that number? Is that a realistic number? Thomas Falk : I would say, if you look at our margins over a long period of time, they are going to oscillate around the commodities cycle. I mean, there is usually a lag between when commodities go up and when you get price. And then, when commodities hit bottom, there is a lag before your price adjusts downward, if it's going to. So my goal, is that there is still a positive upward slope to the line, and that hopefully over time, we are getting more efficient, we are driving more innovation, we are improving our product mix and if we can do that, we should see long term positive trend on gross margin. You can have pretty big swings, as we have seen this quarter, from commodities in any one period of time. Kevin Grundy : That's helpful. I appreciate. If I could just squeeze in one more on [indiscernible] topic, just around balance sheet flexibility and capital deployment decisions. So the Group has obviously been weak and Kimberly included in that, with the market increasingly concerned around competitive dynamics, the mode of these businesses, etcetera, and you guys haven't traditionally looked at M&A, and your balance sheet is in good shape. So have you considered potentially buying the stock back more aggressively, would you add half a turn of leverage or so, and implement and accelerate share repurchase program? Is that something that you think about, given the pullback in the stock price? Maria Henry : Well, I'd say a few things. We have a very balanced view on capital allocation, where we are looking to invest in our business, grow our dividends and beyond that, then we look at whether M&A opportunities and what's the excess cash flow that you have in the business to look at how much is allocated to share repurchases. From a leverage standpoint, I like our position, just around two times leverage, and maintaining our A credit rating is important to us, because it does provide flexibility, it provides assets to lower cost commercial paper, and in a competitive environment, it's important to have a strong balance sheet, so that we can deliver against our model, really in any economic cycle and also, not be competitively disadvantaged, where we have got large global competitors that also have strong balance sheets. I would say that, while we haven't done a lot on the M&A front, we do look at it. We actively look at M&A opportunities. We have got a team of folks, and as you can imagine, given our size in the space, if something is moving, we are probably looking at it. But we are very disciplined in how we allocate our capital, and so you haven't seen us pull the trigger on M&A, because we haven't found something that makes economic sense, that we believe will create long term shareholder value. But we do like the flexibility that the balance sheet gives us, and there are advantages to having that flexibility. Thomas Falk : Kevin, the only other build I'd add for you, is that we have just kicked off this big restructuring program. And over the next couple of years, we are going to be spending more than normal on capital spending, and maintaining a healthy share repurchase program. So that is going to put a little bit of pressure on our debt in the near term. But we think investing in our core business, with the work that we are doing, with all the restructuring program, is a very high return approach for us, relative to other things that we could do with the money. Kevin Grundy : That's great. Good luck guys. Thank you for the questions. Thomas Falk : Thank you, Kevin. Maria Henry : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Thomas Falk : Good morning Nik. Nik Modi : Yeah, thanks. Good morning everyone. Good morning. Just two questions for me; the first one, just broadly on category growth, just would love to get your perspective on some of the major markets, particularly, North America. And then, the other question is, how does Kimberly-Clark measure consumer value equations, and how has the methodology changed? I guess, I am asking, because there is so much change going on in the marketplace. Like how do you make sure that you have the right value propositions relative to the peer group, just given what's going on with private label online, emerging brands, etcetera, etcetera. Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yeah okay, hey Nik. One, on the overall category; North America I think, maybe the headline was -- the big change was in diapers, for the infant child care category, which was flat across all outlooks last quarter, which was the first time it was flat since 2016. So that was a big change. You may know that was down mid-single digits, most of last year, so that was a big change for us. And then most of the other categories in North America were generally consistent or slightly improved from prior quarters. So I think, green shoots I think on the category front in North America, and then in most other markets, I think in Brazil, we are encouraged with -- and also GDP is expected to grow about 3% this year. Unemployment was down a little bit less than we had expected in Q1. So we are off to a very good start in Brazil this year. China, I think the diaper category overall continues to grow. It's just the -- I think, the competitive situation has gotten a little tougher, due to some product innovation from the local competitors. Any other? Thomas Falk : And the consumer value equation question, Nik, is another philosophical question. It's one that's probably more opaque, because you don't have visibility of what everybody is doing in the digital space. But it's one that, we are continuing to trying to refine our measures and test different things to see how to assess that. I don't know Mike, if you have got anything else, so you can share that's not proprietary on that. Michael Hsu : Nik, I think we are pretty disciplined. I mean, it's the -- the equation side is like, what are the brand benefits, product quality, the brand impression, all those -- the bundle of features and benefits that we are offering, and we are pretty disciplined about assessing our -- what we call product acceptability, or how good a product is, in absolute terms, relative to both brands and private label. And then the denominator of that equation, obviously, is the price, and our strategy is, we want to be superior on the benefits and competitive on the price, which is why you are seeing, when we talk about fine tuning promotions, I think last year I was talk about fine tuning and getting a little bit more competitive on price, and then this year, I think the fine tuning, given the commodity environment is headed the other way. Nik Modi : Great. Thanks Mike. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Thomas Falk : Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks. Hey good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to follow-up on a discussion that Bonnie started, with a couple of specifics. When I look at -- was volume and North America particularly better than your expectations this quarter? And I wanted to maybe parse out, how in general, when you are making big supply chain moves, you approach that volume price balances? On one hand, you want the absorption to be right, that would tend to emphasize volume, but you also want the price to be right? Or does that supply chain move and form your strategy, in North America, specifically, at all? Thanks. Thomas Falk : Yeah. I mean, I think, maybe to simplify it, is we really want our supply chain to track closely consumer demand and consumer takeaway. So we want -- the consumer is the boss, and want her and her purchase patterns to drive our supply chain, and we need to be able to react to that. And then our teams are planning the business in six month buckets, as to when they have promotional activity planned and we are trying to get better and better at our ability to forecast that, and make sure we deliver outstanding customer service, and can fulfill everything that we committed to our customers to go do. So we plan to have a better start to the year in North America, and I'd say, Mike had even started a little better than we would have expected, but our supply chain was able to adapt to that. Jonathan Feeney : Okay. Thank you very much. Thomas Falk : Thanks Jonathan. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you for squeezing me in. So my question is on the cost and expense savings program. First, if you can elaborate on the discretionary marketing spend reduction, you called in since the guidance in the last quarter. And examples of the cuts you have implemented, is that [indiscernible]. And the second part of the same question, on the manufacturing footprint, the closure of the California plant that Maria referred on the prepared remarks, that seems to coincide with increasing the imports from Kimberly Mexico, which you have a minority interest. Is that a plan for you to increase to do this cost based [ph] agreement with Kimberly Mexico? And the reason why I ask, is that, you had $90 million in cost savings this quarter, as far as I understand, which is tracking below your $460 million for the year, the midpoint of the guidance. So I want to just see if you can elaborate on those two points? Thank you. Maria Henry : Sure. I will start with your last point, just pickup on some of the comments that Tom made on the $90 million of FORCE cost savings. That's a good first quarter for us. We expect that their savings will ramp through, as the year goes on throughout the year, and we are still holding to the $400 million target that we got for the year. In terms of the manufacturing footprint, and specifically, the plant related actions, that we are taking as part of the restructuring, as we laid out our restructuring program, we did a lot of detailed planning on, how we would fulfill demand, as we move through the restructuring, and then longer term, and we look to optimize that. What I would say is K-C de Mexico is a great partner for us, and a very strong company. They had nice results this quarter, and it's certainly an option, but as we looked at our overall footprint optimization, the majority of the sourcing comes from Kimberly-Clark plants. And then your -- the first part of your question was around our lower SG&A expenses, and I think it was particularly around advertising. And what I'd say there, is that, we have done a deep dive on our advertising expenditures in all of our major markets, and what we have found is that, we had an opportunity to reduce the amount that we are spending on non-working advertising activities, and redeploy some of those funds to working advertising. And so that's an area that we are focused on, and that is, we talked about earlier, there is a shift between doing mass advertising and doing more specific targeted activities, some of which, such as digital couponing, end up as part of the advertising lines. So when I look at our overall investments, I think we are in a good place, even though you see the advertising line on the P&L, a little later than it was last year. Thomas Falk : Yeah, maybe just to put that in perspective; I mean, it's going to be roughly 10 basis points down from the average of last year. First quarter was the high watermark last year. Some of this also has to do with timing of innovation and when new products will launch. So I mean, we are still committed to supporting our brands at the right level, both with advertising and as well as promotion. Andrea Teixeira : Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. Maria Henry : I will just note, when we look at focusing on the cost reductions and the discretionary spend that I talked about, there is an intense focus, more around the general expenses, on the general and administrative expenses, on the P&L. And I think when you look at the numbers, you saw some really good progress there again in the first quarter. Andrea Teixeira : This is very helpful. Just one quick fact check on what Maria said, $90 million obviously tracks well with the FORCE. But then this quarter, I don't think you had much of the other restructuring program savings, are you still tracking to that amount, for the full year? Maria Henry : Yes. But we have got, in addition to the FORCE cost savings, we are targeting $50 million to $70 million for benefits from the restructuring program, and those are expected to come in the second half. Thomas Falk : Basically in the first quarter, we announced the plan to our employees and got organized to implement it. And so, as Maria mentioned, we did a voluntary severance program in North America, that is now closed and those job reductions will start to take place in the second quarter. So we will start to get savings more in the back half of the year from that effort. Andrea Teixeira : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Thomas Falk : Thank you. Maria Henry : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Good morning. Thank you -- Thomas Falk : Hey Caroline. Caroline Levy : Hi. Having just got back from many different cases in Asia, the commentary on the local competition in China was really brought home when I was there. And I am just trying to understand, how a product that can be substantially below your quality, which I believe it really is in these local cases; how the innovation is going to drive the local players out of the market; because it seems to me they are not really competing on product quality there, kind of beating on something else. That was my first question. The second is, please, if you could address, whether you are doing any private label production, if so, if it was meaningful to the first quarter, and what percentage of your sales goes online in the U.S. right now versus China? That's three, sorry. Thomas Falk : Okay. Yes, we can -- between Mike and I, can probably cover those. I mean, I think in China, competitors, you raise an interesting point, and there is lots of interesting products available over there, some are good and some are not. Some are very high priced, even well above the price that you pay for a premium or super premium international product. And if they get trial, they might not get repeat, but they can still pick up some market share, and our hope is that, over time, we are building loyal consumers that want to stay on our franchise. But moms, especially moms in China who want the best for baby, are exploring new ideas and trying new things and so, there is just a lot more competitive offerings in that market. And so our belief is, product performance matters, if we do a great job of delivering on that, and talking to the consumer about it in the right way and having it in the place where you can find it, that we are going to win in any market, including China. I think private label production, I mean, is a tiny part of our business overall, it's less than 5%. So I mean, I think, I wouldn't really comment too much on that. And then e-commerce in China, Mike what it is probably -- Michael Hsu : Overall, it's about a 50% penetration in China. About north of 70% in Korea, depending on the category we are talking. And then North America, mid to high single digit, but that varies quite a bit amongst categories, with diaper being significantly higher than that. Caroline Levy : The diapers double digit in terms of market share online in U.S.? Thomas Falk : Yes. Michael Hsu : Yes. Well market share and also penetration rate. Thomas Falk : Also just to be clear, the data is not as robust as other data we would give you, because there is a ton of retailers that are doing click and collect. Virtually, every retailer is doing some form of click and collect, and none of that is counted anywhere in an e-commerce measurement, because no one collects the data that way. So they are probably as bigger than any number we would quote you in North America, but we don't have any way to measure it really. Michael Hsu : And I'd add Caroline, we are doing well in e-commerce. I think we grew strong double digits overall globally last year, and we are expecting similar results this year. Caroline Levy : And last one, did you grow double digits in China e-commerce or was that down quite substantially? I guess, it must be actually? Michael Hsu : I don't have that number right now. Caroline Levy : All right. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thank you. Thomas Falk : Hi Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Just one quick question on freight costs. It's just a topic kind of across the industry, there is nothing that we have talked about much. So what are you guys seeing in terms of freight inflation? Is it generally kind of in line going into your expectations, or is that something we should just be thinking about as well? Thomas Falk : Yeah. It's an issue, and we ship high tube [ph] low value items, so freight is a big cost for us. But we probably -- we are less of a spot freight buyer and more of a contract freight buyer because of that, and so, we probably have been buffered from some of the spot gyrations that may be some that are structured a little differently or freight is a smaller part of their costs, they might manage it in a different way. So in our high volume freight lanes, we have contractual relationships, that we pay higher diesel, but we aren't paying some of the other costs. I mean, we may eventually have some pass-through, when those contracts are renegotiated. But for the moment, we are not suffering quite as much as others. Lauren Lieberman : That's very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Thomas Falk : Hey Ali. Ali Dibadj : Hey guys I have a follow-up as well. So two things, one is, North America e-commerce clearly is one of the focus areas for you. Can you give us a sense of your online share versus your offline share, and sense of the pace of that closing, if at all? Thomas Falk : Yeah. I mean, I'd say, broadly, in total our online share is pretty similar to our offline share. In fact, it might even be a little bit higher, because there is no private label typically in your online share. But it can vary a little bit by category. But I would say, we are competitive, because there is less private label online, we would probably want it to be even higher than our offline share. Michael Hsu : And that would vary by category. So a little bit ahead maybe in -- in maybe Tissue and adult and fem care, and maybe we got off to a little bit of a slow start years ago on the diaper category. But we are gaining ground in diapers as well. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And no private label, except the private label that you guys might be making or might not be making for Amazon. Thomas Falk : You couldn't resist that one, Ali, I guess? You trying to chum the water and see if I take the bait, is that the strategy this morning? Ali Dibadj : No, no, look, you guys are very good with that stuff. On private label in general, look I get it's for you guys, I guess it's less than 5% of sales. Can you give us a sense of the growth of that less than 5%? Thomas Falk : I mean, I wouldn't say it has been something that we would feel like we needed to talk about or we would have talked about it. So it's one that -- we have got a very small number of customers that we do that for, and we are happy with the business, I think they are happy with the business, and -- but we really are focused on driving innovation behind our brands, and winning with that total bundle. Ali Dibadj : But it's growing much faster than your underlying business. Is that a fair assumption? Thomas Falk : I don't think I would agree with that statement. It hasn't changed much as a percent of sales, let me put it that way over time. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Thank you. Thomas Falk : Yes. Thanks. Operator : At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue. Paul Alexander : All right. Well then we will wrap up with a comment from Tom. Thomas Falk : Well once again, we are off to a good start in the first quarter relative to our plan for the year. And so it's a challenging environment, but you can count on your Kimberly-Clark team to try to manage through that as best as we can. Once again, we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines and thank you for joining us this morning.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here's the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with the review of second quarter results. After that, Mike will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish with Q&A with Tom, Mike and Maria. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. Now as a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statement today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we'll also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. I'll start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were even year-on-year as growth in international markets was offset by lower sales in North America. Margins and operating profit were impacted by significant commodity inflation. Helping to offset those headwinds, we delivered strong cost savings and reduced overhead spending and our adjusted earnings per share were up 7%. And finally, we're on track with our restructuring program. Moving on to the details of our results, starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's up 1% year-on-year with a 1 point benefit from currency rates. Organic sales were even with the year ago. Mix improved by 1%, while volumes fell less than 1% and net selling prices were down slightly. On profitability, second quarter adjusted gross margin was 33.4%, down 270 basis points year-on-year. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 16.8%, down 100 basis points. Commodities were a drag of $200 million in the quarter primarily due to higher pulp costs, and secondarily, inflation in other raw materials. We're now expecting that full year commodity cost inflation will be between $675 million and $775 million. On average, that's $250 million more than we assumed in April, and $375 million more than what we planned in our original plan in January. While commodities are higher than expected, our teams continue to do a great job delivering cost savings and tightly managing overhead and discretionary spending. We achieved $110 million of FORCE cost savings in the quarter, and we're now targeting $425 million to $450 million of savings for the year, that's $25 million to $50 million higher than our original target, including more value from negotiated raw material contracts. In addition, we delivered $40 million of cost savings from our restructuring program. We're accelerating actions where feasible, and we now expect full year savings between $100 million and $120 million. That's $50 million higher than our original target. In addition to the restructuring, we continued to reduce overhead costs. In total, between-the-lines spending declined by 180 basis points as a percent of net sales. All in all, adjusted operating profit was down 5%. On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.59, up 7% year-on-year. That included about 7 points of earnings growth from a lower tax rate, along with benefits from lower interest expense and share count. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate will be at the low end of our 23% to 26% target range. Let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $787 million compared to $825 million in the year ago quarter. This decrease was in line with our expectation, and it includes cash restructuring payments and the benefits of lower taxes. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $575 million in the second quarter, and we continue to expect the full year amount will total $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Looking at our segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales were down 1%. Net selling prices declined 2%, while product mix improved 1 point. Overall Personal Care operating margins remained healthy at 20.4%, although down 50 basis points year-on-year. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales fell 1%. Volumes decreased 3%, while net selling prices increased about 2% and product mix improved slightly. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 14.1% were down 260 basis points. Significantly higher pulp costs and lower volumes were partially offset by cost savings, lower overhead spending as well as favorable selling prices and product mix. In our K-C Professional business, organic sales grew 2%, with gains in all major geographies. Volumes and product mix each increased 1%. K-C Professional operating margins of 19.2% were down 80 basis points compared to a strong year ago quarter. Results were impacted by commodity inflation, partially offset by cost savings and benefits from top line growth. In summary, our second quarter results were impacted by difficult environment particularly with significant commodity inflation. Nonetheless, we are achieving strong cost savings, we're making good early progress with our restructuring program and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Today I'm going to focus my comments on organic sales, pricing and our full year outlook. As Maria just mentioned, organic sales were even in the quarter. That said, organic sales were up 1% year-to-date, which is right in line with our full year target. Let me spend a few minutes on our 3 main growth priorities for 2018. Our first priority is to strengthen and grow our core businesses. In North American consumer products, following the strong first quarter, organic sales were down 2% in the second quarter. Halfway through the year, which is a better indicator of our performance because of some changes in our promotional shipments, volume is up 2% and organic sales were even year-on-year. Our year-to-date market shares are up or even year-on-year in 5 of 8 product categories. We've launched a number of innovations and are supporting our brands with strong marketing and promotion programs. Overall, these initiatives are on track with our expectations. In our K-C Professional business, second quarter organic sales were up 2% in North America, with volume growth in all major product categories. K-C Professional organic sales increased 3% in developing and emerging markets, led by Asia Pacific. In developed markets outside North America, organic sales rose 1%. In South Korea, while our diaper business continues to be impacted by a lower birth rate, our other brands are growing nicely. Now let me turn to our second key priority, which is to accelerate Personal Care growth in developing and emerging markets. Second quarter organic sales for these businesses were even year-on-year. In China, organic sales were down about 10%. Competitive promotion activity in the diaper market has increased and we are responding appropriately. During the second quarter, we launched our upgraded Huggies premium diaper. And this quarter, we're rolling out an improved premium diaper pant. We continue to be optimistic about these innovations, although in the near term, we do expect market conditions will remain challenging. In Brazil, organic sales were up mid-single digits compared to a high single digit decline in the base period. Volumes were up slightly despite a modest impact from the country-wide transportation strike. Pricing has now turned positive following the increases we've implemented this year. In Argentina, organic sales were up mid-single digits. Price realization continues to be positive, while volumes for us in the category are down, which reflects the difficult economic conditions. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased double digits for the third consecutive quarter. Volumes rose double digits on both Huggies and Kotex behind innovations, strong marketing programs and continued expansion outside of Russia. In terms of our market positions, trends are positive in most of these key markets. Shares are up in Brazil, Argentina and Eastern Europe, but down in China diapers. Regarding our third growth priority, which is to further build digital and e-commerce capabilities, we continue to make good progress. Our digital marketing programs, joint customer business plans and investments in tools are producing good results. Online sales continue to grow at healthy double-digit rates so far this year. Now let me switch to the topic of selling prices. In April, I outlined several of our actions to improve net realized revenue. That included sheet-count reductions in North American bath tissue, price increases in Latin America and other international markets and initiatives globally in K-C Professional. These actions are broadly on track and our pricing trends are improving. Net selling prices have gone from being down 2% in the fourth quarter last year to down 1% in the first quarter this year and down about 0.5 point in the second quarter. We expect overall pricing in the second half to turn modestly positive, mostly because of the actions we've taken in the first 6 months of the year. We will also be lapping elevated promotion activity in North America, especially in the fourth quarter. Still, given the headwinds we face, it's clear that we need more pricing. As a result, our businesses around the world, including North America, are closely evaluating further opportunities to increase net selling prices. We anticipate that nearly all the impact from any potential actions would start to show up in our results next year. Now let me turn to our outlook. Clearly, the near-term environment has become more challenging, and we are responding by aggressively reducing costs and increasing selling prices. At the same time, we continue to execute our long-term strategies to deliver balanced and profitable growth. We continue to innovate, support our brands with category-building marketing campaigns, pursue targeted growth initiatives and improve key capabilities. We also continue to focus on sustainable cost reductions, while we implement our global restructuring to make our company even stronger for the long haul. In terms of our specific targets for the year on the top line, we continue to target organic sales growth of approximately 1%. On the other hand, the outlook on foreign currency has gotten considerably worse since April, we now expect currencies will have a neutral to 1% negative impact on our net sales. 3 months ago, we expected a 1% to 2% positive impact. On the bottom line, we are now targeting full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $6.60 to $6.80. Our previous outlook was $6.90 to $7.20. To put that reduction in perspective, we're now expecting that commodities and currencies will be a combined year-on-year operating profit headwind of about 20% to 25%. Our original plan for the year included a net drag in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. We expect to offset approximately half the additional headwinds with more benefits from pricing, cost savings and spending reductions. In summary, we are aggressively managing our business to benefit near-term results in a challenging environment. At the same time, we're executing our long-term strategies to create sustainable shareholder value. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : So I have a few questions here. One is, you mentioned a couple of times in the release and in your prepared remarks about marketing spend being a help, whether it be on the growth to net or just pure advertising spend. Can you talk about where you are in marketing spend at this point? Obviously, the cynic in me says you need to cut marketing spend to make your bottom line numbers. Can you just give us some comfort there, please? Thomas Falk : Yes, I'll start and maybe Mike can build on. I mean, I would say broadly if you look at our advertising and promotion spend in the quarter, it's pretty similar to the full year average for 2017. So it's down a bit from the prior year second quarter. And the thing that you're maybe not able to see is we are cutting nonworking pretty substantially and reinvesting those savings. And so if we look at our plan for the year embedded in our guidance is relatively flat marketing spend. So we're not cutting marketing spend broadly to make the number. Mike, maybe you want to build on that. Michael Hsu : Yes, actually Maria and I were just huddling on it earlier and if you go line-by-line, all of our working lines are actually up versus the plan. If you see, it's the nonworking numbers that are down significantly. And maybe to give you a little of background, Ali, is when we went to our global restructuring planning, obviously taking a hard look at all lines of nonlabor was an important initiative for us. And we just found that there was a lot better ways to manage our nonworking spend or getting more efficient in terms of how we produce our copy or our promotional programs around the world. You can imagine the inefficiencies that might exist when you have these marketing initiatives distributed around the world. So we pulled some back, and we're really just getting out of some of the nonproductive spend. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And that's helpful. And then the corollary to that is, obviously, brand power and pricing, and you put a very helpful slide, thank you, Mike, I think you went through it on Page 20 in the presentation just around selling prices. I'm worried about pricing, you guys would probably know this from some of our last discussions or some of the pieces that we've written. What gives you confidence that you'll be able to take the pricing that you laid out, that you're not going to be promoting it back, that the competitive environment is going to allow you to take pricing in different parts of the world? I think it's a big controversy for the whole sector, but certainly for you? Thomas Falk : Yes. No, I'd say, we know we've got to show you. So it's been a while since we've had commodities cost at this kind of level, and we were kind of going back through history. If you look at 2008, 2009, 2010, 2008 and 2010 both had commodity cost hits that were about in the range that we're in. I think in 2008, we took two price increases. 2009 was the recession, so we gave some of it back. 2010, we took another round of price increases. We came out of it with higher margins than we started. So we -- it takes us a while to get price and so we do suffer during the period of time while we're getting that embedded in the market, but we feel confident that with the commodity cost hit at this level that the cost structure for most of our competitors is similar and that there will be more broad scale price. But I don't know Mike if there's anything else you want to add to that one. Michael Hsu : No, I guess the addition only is that we have made some pricing, taken some pricing actions around the world this year and we have progressed there. And so that's one piece. Second, as Tom mentioned, when you have a commodity impact as large and significant as it is right now, I think our customers understand that. And we do have to recover and improve our net revenue realization. And so we are going to take the appropriate actions. And we've seen maybe some evidence in the markets and various markets that would show maybe : one, the promotion intensity in markets is easing a bit; and second, we have seen some early indications of some pricing moves by competitors. Thomas Falk : And so we're not leading it everywhere. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And then just related to that my last question is around the implications of that on EBIT, right? Because although you try to recover some of the commodity cost, doesn't seem like you're able to recover as much as you'd like, and so the pressure on EBIT, obviously, is very obvious and very clear here. And if you could comment on your EBIT trajectory, certainly in the context as well as what a lot of folks look at Q4, which is returning cash to shareholders. How should we think about the EBIT pressure you're facing and the challenging environment that you're facing in the context also of the sustainability of your dividend payout ratio and your share repurchases? Maria Henry : Sure, Ali, I'll take that. We gave a range on share repurchases of $700 million to $900 million for the year, and we're still tracking to do that and you know what the dividend is. We do expect that our leverage will be up slightly as we come out of this year versus where it was when we started into the year. And so if you put all those things together, I think we're still tracking to what we set on shareholder returns, which in total would be $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : So I mean, can we just I guess pick up on that pricing theme because the -- you sounded very confident in your response to Ali's question about your ability to push through price. But at the same time, obviously, we haven't seen it in the first half. I think modest -- the call for modestly higher pricing in the back half doesn't sound that ambitious. And if I just go back to those benchmark you just talked about, 2008, '09, '10, it just seemed like the pricing came through, although it wasn't immediate, it did come through a lot more quickly and more robustly than I think we're seeing this cycle. So what's different? How much of the pricing pressure that, at least, I perceive you to be having right now do you -- if you agree, is temporary versus more -- something that might be more structural in your categories? Thomas Falk : Yes, I'll let Mike elaborate on that. I would say it's probably fair to say that it may take a bit longer to get price, particularly if we're going to take price through either package counter sheet count, there is some supply chain implications to that, doing it in the middle of a big restructuring, we probably had some other people focused on other things. But it's probably takes us a bit longer to get price in the market. And typically, with your retailers you're 3 to 6 months out on promotion plans as well. And so I'd say, that's probably a fair push, but Mike maybe there's some other color you might want to add to that. Michael Hsu : Yes. Steve, we've taken some actions year-to-date in most markets, including North America. I would say that they were not at the level because I think the commodity impact was, as we said earlier, far higher than what we were expecting it at the beginning of the year. So at this point, we're looking at another round of pricing. And I would say, a couple of big changes. We've made pretty good progress this year in the business like North American Consumer Tissue. Our pricing is up 2 points in Q2 after being flat in Q1. And that's all an artifact of the desheets that we've bundled with our product improvement there. And you might have seen, you could probably see in the numbers, in Personal Care we've lagged a bit. Our pricing was still down a bit from Q2. Part of that is also an artifact that we wanted to support our innovation on Huggies this year and in adult care. And we're doing that pretty well. That said, we also had some pretty strong promotion plans that were locked at the end of last year that we plan on adjusting and easing promoted depth and frequency as we go through the balance of the year. Stephen Powers : Yes. I mean, so on the one hand I get it, and I get the cost pressure is building, but it -- and I guess just asking for your feedback on this. It feels like competitively, this -- the category, especially Personal Care and baby care that you're in are super important to the retailer right now. They're very focused on winning that consumer. And so there's a lot of pressure from them to keep prices low. They're pushing on private label. Your biggest competitor, I think, definitely wants to win and what for them is one of their biggest if not their biggest profit pool categories. So it feels like there are things that are, especially in Personal Care, that structurally are going to make pricing more difficult, not only in the back half of this year, but for the foreseeable future. Do you agree? Or am I overdoing it? Thomas Falk : Well, I think it depends on the market. I'd say the thesis isn't wrong, although that hasn't changed all that much. I mean, baby care has always been an important category for our retailers for a long, long time. And so -- and they want to be competitive. And I think our customers, they understand industry price changes when the commodity cost shifts. They just want to be advantaged somehow. And so that's what we have to work with as we implement it. The good news is as you look at private-label shares and Personal Care broadly, they haven't moved very much. And so the -- in fact, if anything, they're down a tick in diapers, which has positively driven innovation and that's helped us on the mix front a bit. Stephen Powers : Great. Okay, just one question on another topic, if I could, which is on the savings side. And I just I look at the SG&A reductions and especially appreciating your comments to Ali about not cutting into working media, just feels like the cuts that you're -- you've been making not only this year, but over the past really 3 years or so are pretty aggressive when it comes to that overhead or nonworking part of SG&A. So I guess the question is, where you're sourcing them from? How much of this is sort of belt-tightening that you want to get a little bit of relief you might have to put back into the business? Can you sustain this level of cutting? Because when I look out to the next year, it just feels like that source of profit growth or inflation offset may not be there for you. Just looking for some help to bridge that gap. Maria Henry : Yes, sure. We have a number of things going on, on that between-the-lines spending front. You saw in our results in the second quarter that we delivered $40 million of savings from our restructuring program, 80% of that fell between the line. So below gross margin, and that certainly has helped our ratios in the second quarter. Beyond that, we have been very tightly managing discretionary overhead spend and you saw that come through our results really starting in the second half of last year, and those are things like T&E, meeting expense, all of those types of those activities. We really have our whole workforce focused on taking out either unnecessary or less valuable types of spend so that we can protect the investments that we're making behind growth. Your question on, is it sustainable. I'm not going to say that the second quarter rate is going to be the rate every quarter, but you know from our guidance on the restructuring program that over the next couple of years, we will continue to work the cost structure hard. We've got $500 million to $550 million of savings associated with that program, and probably 1/3 of that is going to accrue to the SG&A part of our P&L. The area where you're seeing the biggest reductions when you look at where is it between the lines is really in the general and administrative side of the house. And that is, as I said, working the discretionary hard, working the restructuring hard, where we're looking to take work out of the system and leveraging various productivity programs. So we're hard at it, and our goal is really to fundamentally lower the cost structure of the business and continue to invest behind our brands to grow the top line. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : I actually want to ask more about the go-forward beyond this year. Because clearly there's been a lot of focus around the growing and growing challenges across many companies, such as you guys ability to price, consumer's willingness to pay for premium priced product overall. And I was just hoping you could give us some color on how you view your ability to hit sort of your long-term algorithms going forward, and what you need to change to get there? Is -- we talk about cuts in the nonworking spending, but is there more investment necessary in another parts, more marketing in the working areas? Because right now, it seems like given what's happened already in the first half of the year that it would be pretty tough to get your longer-term expectations? Thomas Falk : Yes. And so, Olivia, the quality of the line wasn't very good, so I think I heard most of the question was really kind of questioning how do we get back to our longer-term growth algorithm and when are you going to see signs of progress and what changes do we have to make to get there. Is that a good summary of the question? Olivia Tong : Yes, you got it. Thomas Falk : Okay. So I'll start, but I'll let Mike pile on. And we've talked about some of the factors, the lower birth rate in some markets, some of the things that are going on in Latin America where we've seen kind of double-digit unit volume declines and places like Argentina have made the headwinds a little stiffer, places like Korea where the birth rate is down 9% and our second largest diaper market, obviously aren't helping. On the other hand, we do see the best for baby as a powerful instinct all over the world, which is driving more premium products in places like the U.S. and in places like China. And we've got a robust innovation pipeline that we're investing behind, and we'll use that across our portfolio to drive that. But Mike, maybe you can comment a little bit more on that. Michael Hsu : Yes. Olivia, we're very bullish on our categories. Obviously, we'll need some help from the categories in some of the markets to get back to that algorithm. But I think the big planks that we have that we believe that can help us grow is, one, in our core markets, our big markets we believe there's still a big opportunity to elevate our categories. We know there's a big value consumer and there's also big swathes of premium consumers. And part of the opportunity for us is we believe we make the best products in the world, but we still think there is plenty of opportunity to improve the fundamental performance across some pretty innovative dimensions that we're working on. And so we still think there's an opportunity to elevate the category and also bring more consumers into the category in big developed markets. And then there's, obviously, large and significant potential in developing emerging markets. As I've said multiple times, China is our largest market today, but it's going to be a multiple of what it is today in the coming years. And then we've got India and other markets to build as well. Obviously, we can say all that. We've got plans that we're working on to accelerate our growth, but we've got to show you, so -- and we know that. Olivia Tong : I guess just -- that's all very helpful, and I guess just a follow-up one thing about developed markets in the U.S, right? You've had those or it sounds like those discussions have started maybe can you give a little bit of color as to what transpired or have -- has anything changed in terms of your plans because you talked about pricing by reducing package count, but price obviously worsened in Q2 and the track channel data that we've seen so far would imply that promotional levels are still pretty high. And then in China, you talked about innovation and new product rollouts and stabilization in pricing, but it doesn't seem like that's -- given the competitive challenges, it doesn't seem like that that's transpired the way that you had anticipated? Thomas Falk : Yes, it has not, but I'll come back to China. Yes, North America, one is, there have been some pricing moves, some down counts competitively we've desheeted in our bath tissue products. And in some categories, we have started down back the promotional depth and frequency and have additional plans to do more. We have had some discussions with our customers about this. I think they also see in fixed consumption categories, the way to grow the category long term is to elevate it or to create more value add in the category. So we're not just talking, for us our strategy is not just to raise price indiscriminately. It's to creating value-added in our products that people would be willing to pay more for. So that's a little bit on North America. I think China, I think, has been a market that's in my mind been one of the most premium markets in the world. It is under a little bit of pricing pressure. We've launched a terrific new product this 5d core that delivers thinness, flexibility, breathability in ways that are superior to any other -- in our belief, any other major manufacturer in China today. That said, I think we've got off to a good start, but those results have been muted because pricing has come down in the most recent quarter, about double-digits overall in the market. And in some cases, we have matched on as we rolled this out, and that's muted our impact a little bit. So China right now, we expect it to be a bit challenging because it remains the single-largest opportunity that we have on the board to grow. All our competitors see that same opportunity, and they're going for it, too. But we're in China to win for the long haul, we've got a great team that knows how to make winning products and knows how to operate within a lean cost structure that delivers the margins that we need. Operator : Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : I wanted to go back on Consumer Tissue business and drill down a little bit further, you guys took some pricing in the quarter, it was up 2%, yet your volumes were down 3% on a somewhat easy comp. So I'd like to first hear your thoughts on price elasticity? And then maybe how your elasticity is changing in this environment? And then second, in thinking about the strong volume, you guys reported in that segment in Q1. How much loading occurred that might have also contributed to the weaker volume in Q2? Thomas Falk : So bonnie, I'll start and I'll hand it over to Mike. I'd say, we typically don't load and customers really don't want to load tissue anyway, it's a very high tube. And so the strong promotional calendar in the first quarter that sold through. And then the second thing and Mike will give you a little more color, on the second quarter, whenever you do a desheet, you see negative volume and positive price. And so if your customers were holding 100 cases before it's got fewer sheets in it so you're going to show less volume and yes, there's some inventory decline in both the customer and consumer. We typically don't try to measure that or call that out, but it's not unusual to see some software volume in a desheet or a down count environment. And so that's something just to watch for and know that it exists. It's not an elasticity issue. It's just a facts of life that there's fewer standard units in each case that we ship. And so as we look at Consumer Tissue for the first half, we're more or less on track with the plan. Our shares are stable, and we've had positive organic growth. But Mike, I don't know if there's anything else you'd add to that. Michael Hsu : No, I'll just speak on few numbers, Bonnie, our Q2 organic was down 4, and most of that was due to that shift in promotional timing that Tom talked about. Just to refresh your memory, back in Q1, I think our volume was up in North American Consumer Tissue 9%, and we said at the time that, that is not the run rate of the business. So it was a big shift. It wasn't a load, it was more volume that sold through in Q1 that was in Q2 of last year. So that's one big change. And as Tom said, year-to-date, our sales were up 1%, which is in line with our plan. The additional thing I'll tell you is our innovation in family care this year are off to a very good start, Kleenex wet wipes doing very well at launch. I think it's already at the velocity rate it is just the largest wipe in the marketplace right now. Cottonelle wavy ripple is selling very well, performing very well and getting great customer feedback. It's consumer-preferred product. And if you exclude kind of some of the promotional shifts, the base velocity is up mid-single digits. So we're pretty excited about the new items we have. We are getting some price realization in the family care business and looking forward to more. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to go back to China with a follow-up question. I was actually in the market a few months ago, and it seems there is a perception from the Chinese consumer that the quality of your key competitors' brands, it's actually perceived to be better, but a lot of times they're priced more attractively. So just kind of love to hear your perspective on this? And then what changes you may be implementing to improve your positioning in that market? You touched on some innovation that you're bringing into the marketplace, but just wondering if more needs to be done there? Thomas Falk : Yes, yes, definitely there's more that needs to be done, but I think we're off to a good start this year. The team has done a great job rolling out the new diapers -- Tier 5 diaper that came out at the end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter. And then also we're rolling out a similar diaper-pant that's also significantly preferred. I think there is a perception out there, our testing would show a strong preference versus all the multinational competitors with our new product. And so I think the team has responded to the consumer perception over the data, and they've developed a winning product. Part of the challenge on the China market right now though is people are being very aggressive on price, and we are in this for the long haul. And so right now, we are matching on price, although we don't want to win on price. And we want to return to winning on product, quality and brand positioning. And that's -- those are things that we're driving in the definitive market as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So Maria, I just want to follow up on Steve's question earlier. You talked about what's driving some of the cost savings this year and in the back half of last year. But I'm wondering as we look out, is there any type of hangover when we look out to 2019 in terms of -- are some of these cutbacks more temporary in areas like discretionary travel, et cetera or incentive compensation that ramp back up in 2019. I know you'll be hesitant to speak to '19, but the question is more the 2018 cost savings, how much of that is sort of more discretionary and belt-tightening that may have to come back as you look out for 2019? Maria Henry : So I think there is a number of factors that will affect what our SG&A rates are within any given quarter. What we're fundamentally trying to do is run our company on a lower-cost structure. So finding new ways of working that didn't require us to spend as much money on lower-value added activities. And that's something that we're hitting hard in the restructuring. In terms of kind of the nonrestructuring reduction in discretionary spend, clearly, we are not on our target for the year, as you see, in what's happening in the macro environment and our guidance range adjustment. So we do have a comp benefit this year that will hopefully not repeat next year. But for the most part, the changes that we're making in the business are structural. Now the timing of these changes is going to vary quarter-to-quarter. So let me give you an example, we talked about the fact that in our restructuring program, we've accelerated certain actions, which is why we increased our restructuring savings number by $50 million within 2018. We are through our voluntary severance program and so we've had a lot of employees leave the business. The restructuring program and the savings that we've given is actually a net number. So I would say that we're probably a little ahead on the excess and a little bit lagging on the add-back in the business. So we may have some timing shifts there around headcount, that'll play itself out through the year. And I think, overall, the fact that our savings number has accelerated for 2018 is a good thing, and it's showing the hard work that the teams are doing to really help us offset some of the headwinds that we're seeing in this year. But, overall, the goal here is to fundamentally lower the cost structure of the business, and that's what that restructuring program is all about. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to return to the pricing front in Personal Care. I guess it sounds like it's more sort of business as usual in the back half of the year in terms of some typical pricing actions, stepped in frequency, et cetera. It doesn't sound like there has been a big change in mindset around pricing, and I'm just trying to understand that, given if you look over the last year, it looks like the combined impact of pricing and input cost in Personal Care is $200 million, it's a big number. So I guess just help me understand why it's not a bigger focus? Is it just the competitive environment that's limiting your ability? Does that competitive environment change going forward? And as we think about your own internal pricing actions, are these significant actions? Or is it more can you recover a lot of what you've lost? Or is it more moderate given the competitive environment? Thomas Falk : Yes, I'll start and then let Mike build. I mean, I guess if we gave you the impression it was business as usual, that was probably the wrong impression. And so when we typically run the business assuming we're not going to get much price in a relatively stable commodity environment, that we can compete on innovation and execution. In this kind of commodity cost environment, we're looking to get price in lots of places, and some places that takes longer than others. But looking at it through lots of different vehicles, whether that the price count, promotion, trying to pull all those levers. And so I'd say the team is heavily focused on that, while not trying to take their eye of the ball and executing the innovation plan and getting the right winning products in the marketplace. Michael Hsu : Yes. Just to add, I think last year, Personal Care at least, let's talk about diapers in the U.S. I think the promotional environment was -- had gotten more intense, and I think at this point in time, on this call last year, we're saying we were going to find some of our plans become a little bit more competitive in the marketplace, and that meant more depth and more frequency. I think there has been a significant change this year, and I think the market has, in my mind, maybe normalized back to kind of where it historically has been in terms of promotional intensity. So part of what I was saying is on the promotion side or the trade planning side, we're adjusting our price points to maybe back to where they had -- where been historically for us. That's one part. And then second, we're evaluating additional opportunities for pricing because we are taking some pretty significant increases to our input costs in the Personal Care business as well, and we feel like we need to make some moves there as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : So I just wanted to go to kind of the performance in D&E markets, Personal Care kind of... Thomas Falk : Oops, we lost you, Lauren. [Technical Difficulty] Lauren Lieberman : Tom? Thomas Falk : Yes, we got you now. Lauren Lieberman : You got me now. Okay, hold on let me put down my headset and speak before, okay, all right. So I was just looking at organic performance in D&E markets in Personal Care. So organic growth overall was flat this quarter, but when in the script you went through some of the markets sort of China down 10%, but everything else, the big chunky things, Brazil, up mid-single digits, Argentina mid-single, Easter Europe have doubled. I'm having trouble figuring how that all squares to the business being flat in the quarter. So what other markets maybe if there were other markets that were particularly weak. What am I missing to tie out to D&E having decelerated again kind of both sequentially and on a 2-year stack, because I look forward I think that's the thing that probably through now probably 4 quarters in to D&E markets not improving in a way that I might have expect even just based on the comparisons. So that's a piece of the puzzle. I'd love a little help understanding both dynamics in the quarter and how does things get better from here? Thomas Falk : Yes. I think maybe Mike or Paul can give you a little more detail. I think probably the only other big piece that you're missing is the rest of Latin America was relatively soft, and that was a trend from the first quarter. And there's some positive signs, and we could go through the litany of what's going on in the Caribbean with recovery from hurricane or in Central America with issues going on in Nicaragua, there's some political upheaval in some of those spots that are part of it. And other parts of it, there is a little bit more competitive activity, but that's probably the biggest one. And then the relative size of China is the other factor, that's a pretty, pretty big number. And the other ones aren't as big to offset it. Paul Alexander : Yes, and Lauren, if you've looked at Q2 versus Q1, you would see that Latin American total was pretty similar to similar performance. Argentina was a bit softer. Brazil was pretty similar and China was softer. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. So on the go-forward look, what are the pieces as you are thinking through what kind of gets better? You've had this big product launch in China this is challenged by the pricing environment. Is Latin America just a hope for macro stability? Just a little bit of help on what -- how things go from here in some of these markets, where it's one of your big focus for 2018 is accelerating Personal Care and D&E? Michael Hsu : Yes. Lauren, one, I think the -- some of the underlying performance I think we feel very good about. As I mentioned in Brazil, I think our market shares were up about three points in diapers and two in femcare. Similarly, in Eastern Europe, up a couple of share points in diapers and femcare. So I think some of the fundamentals of the things that the teams are working on in terms of improving our value proposition or improving our offering particularly both in the value tiers and the premium tiers, I think, it's working pretty well. I think part of the challenges we've got to work through is China is a challenging market right now with some of the pricing environment, and we're going to need to work through that. And as Tom mentioned, it's a pretty significant piece of our business. Year-to-date overall in D&E, we're up about 1%. And I think our developed markets are a little bit ahead and maybe D&E is a little bit behind. And so on our call for the year, our best call right now is probably the second half looks a little bit like the first half in D&E for the balance of this year. But we do think we've got share moving in the right direction in most major markets and D&E, and we're working on the right things. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. And then if we could talk a little bit about profitability in Consumer Tissue. So understand the cost pressures we're seeing are primarily hitting this business more than any other, but 14% margins, I think is the lowest you've seen in probably probably 5 to 6 years now. So as you think about the kind of long-term structural profitability for Consumer Tissue, so once you've got the pricing and that you feel is appropriate, you've mentioned low-margin exits in your restructuring plans plus some things that have been kind of remembered in the press in terms of Europe. What do you think is the long-term run rate for margins in Consumer Tissue? Is it kind of high-teens? Is it low to mid-teens? I'm just -- does this 14% kind of jumps off the page a bit versus where we've seen the business get to over the last five years. Thomas Falk : Yes, it's a good question, Lauren, you and I've been around long enough, but you and I remember high single-digits. Lauren Lieberman : Tom, don't remind, everyone. Don't remind them how long I've been doing this. Thomas Falk : And so when you go through a pulp price spike like this where it's $1,200 plus box a ton, that business is going to take it and it takes a little while to get price, especially if we're going to do it through sheet count. And so the good news is that the low point is a lot higher than the prior cycle lows. And so what we're hopefully doing is shifting that range up over time by improving the mix, by improving the innovation, by improving the cost structure. And if we can continue to do that, I think we'll be in that hopefully mid-teens to upper teens across the cycle. And we were up in the 18 plus range not long ago. I think the good news was in this kind of commodity costs cycle, you look at the KCP margins at 19 plus, and that shows you what's possible in a tissue heavy business. And you still see Personal Care hanging in at north of 20% in a fairly stiff commodity headwinds. So we're -- we know we've got some work to do in tissue, we've got to get some revenue realization. There's obviously some cost savings that will come from the restructuring, and that's a focus for us as we go through the balance of the year and into next year. Lauren Lieberman : And what if anything do you think has changed from a consumer or competitive standpoint in Consumer Tissue, say, today versus the last cycle? So let's point to the 2008 cycle where margins got to what like sub 8% at the lows, I think. So in terms of consumer demand, openness and prevalence of private label, the things that everyone is worried about, how much do you think has actually changed? Has the threat gotten worse? Have shares really changed in this 10-year period? I could think that this would be helpful too. Thomas Falk : Yes. That's a -- private-label shares have generally increased. And if you go back, I think, when you look at some data from 2012 over something like that, and I think there it's up 5 or 6 points in towels in the U.S., our share is flat, as we don't have a huge towel share, so it's not like little we've been the big donor, and past years I think are up 3-year or up 5 in that period and I think we're down a point or 2. So if you looked at Europe, you generally see private-label shares up. So I think the thing that's probably changed for us is we may be have a healthier portfolio, we went to the tissue restructuring since the last time that we talked that helped exit some less-profitable business. And so we've continued to kind of work that part of the portfolio. We've mix shifted more of our capacity in emerging markets, especially into the more premium tiers. And then choice will be about where we expand that business. And so I think we're trying to manage it to get growth where we can get profitable growth and to get margin where we should get margin. And overall, I'm not satisfied with where we are, but I'm pleased with the progress that we've made. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : I guess I want to dig deeper on the dynamics in a couple of your core markets, and why don't we start with China. This persistent price competition in the market, is there any way for you to unpack it and give us a beat or give us your sense of how much is due to maybe tariff changes in the market? How much is due to just an aggressive stance from your major Japanese and U.S. competitors? And how much is due to just the broader proliferation in the market? And on the proliferation point, it's something you've highlighted in the past, and there's been some question about how much of the proliferation or proliferated products could actually stick and endure and whether or not there could be a shake out on the horizon that could make things a bit easier? I'd love an update on the thought process around that and what you're seeing in the market? Thomas Falk : Yes. I'll start again and I'll let Mike build it. First of all, I don't think any of it's related to the tariff discussion. So all the products that we make -- that we sell in China are, for the most part, made in China. There is a bit that we import from Korea, but there is -- we don't import or export anything out of the U.S. We also make all the products for the U.S. market in the U.S. market. So it's not a big issue really for either of those. On the competitive front, I think -- everybody thinks the other guys started the fight usually. But I would also say is when you have 1 competitor like us launching some big innovation, if you don't have any innovation, sometimes you compete on price. And so -- and China is a big growth opportunity for everybody and no one wants to get left behind. And so it's also a big e-commerce market, probably half of our business is in e-commerce. There is a little bit more price transparency there. And you also have the e-tailers competing with each other to try to win in this category. So that also can make the pricing a bit more competitive. And so, as Mike said, I mean it's the biggest diaper category in the world. It's not our biggest diaper market yet, but it will be one day. And everybody else sees that as well. And we're up for the challenge, but it's going to be a volatile, exciting place to operate for a while. Michael Hsu : Yes, Jason, I probably would do a better job answering this question after this week, I'm flying out to Shanghai this afternoon. So I'll be able to let you know more. But I would tell you my sense is, hey there's been some traction from some local players who've picked up a pretty nice chunk of share over the last couple of years or maybe over the last 18 months or so. And I think some of the price is in response to that growth. And some of the major manufacturers don't want to let their share growth. Our response has been to help beat them, out match them on product quality and innovation, which is why we had the big push we had this year with our 5d core. That said, the market has moved, and so we want to be competitive in the marketplace, and we are going to be competitive on price as well. So I think that's a little bit of what's going on. I think long-term, the right strategy for China is to create more value added. It's a market where the consumers demonstrated their want to get what's best for baby. And that market is, in my mind right now, the most premium market that we have in our business system. And I think there's still more potential to create more value-added going forward. Thomas Falk : And while we've had some price cutting, the prices in China are quite attractive relative to other markets as well. Jason English : That's helpful. And then a couple of quick questions on North America. North America has been challenging I know for -- we've got -- it has to do with birth rate. We've also had retailers, brick and mortar retailers investing pretty aggressively and presumably pushing pressure back upstream to defend against e-commerce. If we look at the Nielsen data, it looks like brick and mortar seems to be winning that battle. The growth in diapers and training pants combined is sort of surprising to see there. So a couple related questions. One, are you seeing that channel shift to online sort of stall out? Or if not, what's driving that brick-and-mortar growth? And b, I know that a lot of the investment came last year with at least one major retailer sort of restaging private-label and pushing hard on price beginning in August of last year. Do you think we've found a floor that we can soon anniversary on some of that retail-led price investment? Or should we expect just another lag on top of it? Thomas Falk : Yes, that's a complex set of questions. I guess I would say we tend to look at our all outlet share data, which includes e-commerce and club and the other thigs that aren't in Nielsen, and don't spend a lot of time slicing and dicing on Nielsen data so I don't know that necessarily be the correct person to answer that. I would say, broadly, I haven't seen any indication of slowdown in e-commerce trends. And so that continues to be a popular place for mom to want to shop. And as it relates to private-label, broadly, we haven't seen much movement in private-label shares in our all outlet data on diapers. And so while there has been some activity by some retailers in that space, it hasn't moved the needle overall at the consumer end, and you are seeing still some uptick in the super premium end of the segment, which has been a positive mix for us and others in the category. But Mike, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add to that? Michael Hsu : No. The good news Jason is the headline and maybe the diaper category is that the overall mega category for the last quarter was up 1. And that's a big change from where it was this time last year, which was down 5. And I think part of that is, I think, when we saw the deflation in the category last year, I think the -- certainly we didn't like that, and I think may be it raises some concerns with our customers as well. So I think that's one piece a very good news. With regard to the channel, we don't try to pick winners. Our strategy is to support all of our customers and tailor kind of our tactics in market within the support of their strategies. And so our e-commerce business, both in pure-play and in -- through bricks and mortar is up pretty significantly. And I know both sides of that are very focused on it. And we're supporting them in different ways, but with the same objective, we're trying to serve our customers and consumers in the way that they want to be served. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So I was hoping if you can elaborate more on the FORCE and the restructuring program. So you added some incremental cost cuts to guidance. So can you elaborate in your -- on your R&D level. So I was hoping you can describe a little bit more if those cuts include R&D from what you discussed that your working marketing spend is flat, but in terms of R&D, how you can look at this going forward? And what are the areas specifically, you spoke a little bit about D&E and also Travel. But what are the areas that you became more optimistic against previous plans? So two questions part of one, R&D and then areas that you see incremental cost cuts opportunities? Maria Henry : Sure. Well you've got it right that we have got 2 significant cost program in the FORCE and in our restructuring program. Let me talk about FORCE to start with. We had a good quarter in the second quarter. We were up compared to the first quarter. And with what we see through the remainder of the year, we were able to take our outlook up for the savings that we expect to generate from that program for the year. We're seeing savings across all 4 legs of that FORCE program, which include productivity and it includes product cost optimization and driving down spending across our facilities as well as savings that we achieve from negotiating lower material prices. So when you have an inflation spike, the discount that we've negotiated are worth more. And so we expect to have a good year on the FORCE cost savings front. On the restructuring program, I talked about the fact that we've accelerated some of the activities that we planned to take, and that's good news because the teams are being aggressive in getting the work behind us, and that's yielding more savings for 2018. On the R&D side, I think two things. One, R&D is covered in our restructuring program, and that has to do with really driving efficiencies and effectiveness of our R&D spend and our R&D programs that we have. So our R&D is an area that's very important to us. Innovation is a key plank in our growth strategy. What we are looking to do is become more efficient in the R&D spend that we have behind those innovation programs. So R&D is part of the restructuring program. The other thing I'd say is kind of the third piece on the cost savings that I talked about is a reduction in discretionary spend, and that's across the board. That's hitting all areas of our business, and that would include the money that we spend in the R&D organization on discretionary items. But I would emphasize, similar to what Mike said earlier, we are not reducing the fundamental investment in our business, and we've got a big innovation agenda, both in 2018 and in the future. And so R&D is a critical area, and any reductions there would either come from the benefit on the restructuring program or the benefit with the discretionary cost cuts that are affecting all lines of the P&L. Thomas Falk : Yes, and maybe I'll just pile onto that. Each member of our leadership team have responsibility for one of the functional areas as part of their restructuring program. So Mike did the customer and sales organization, Maria had finance and IP, I had R&D. So my goal was to come out of the restructuring with better R&D capability than we had going into it and the right people in the right place with the right capabilities to drive our business even faster with better innovation. And so we will spend a little bit less, but we will have better innovation capability when we have this fully vetted down. Andrea Teixeira : Yes, that's helpful. But in terms of the percentage of the products that are new, that are coming -- percentage of sales or products which are like say, less than 2 years old. Is that coming down because of this adjustment that you're making at this point? I think it's probably natural that it's coming down from where your organic growth is going to? Or is that something that you are not concerned? Thomas Falk : Yes. We track innovation as part of our compensation goals. We look at 3-year rolling, and we look at year 1. And if you look at how we're tracking for our innovation goals this year, yes, we're on track with our year 1. So a lot of the innovation that we are going the market were supporting that the right level, we expect to deliver that. Some of the 3-year rolling looks a little behind, in places like Argentina where the categories have declined dramatically or innovation that you launched. Obviously the consumer doesn't have the money to buy it, you're going to underperform. But it's not far off track. And so, I'd say broadly on the innovation front, we're hitting. We got to make sure we're getting the base volume at the right level. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : I was wondering what you guys think in terms of anymore potential for structural change within your company to really getting out of most of diapers in Europe and then Halyard and obviously there's been some discussion about Europe overall being tough. Can you talk a little bit about how often you revisit those sorts of ideas? And whether it be surprised to us to see more structural change, whether that be Europe, whether that'd be breaking up Personal Care versus not. Some of these topics we've revisited, but the environment seems a little different now than it used to be? Thomas Falk : Well, I mean number one, we're in the middle of a big restructuring. So we've got structural change going on at the company. And as you guys know, we've been good stewards of the portfolio over time, and I would expect that to continue. It's not something that we look at every year, but we look at it from time to time. And in the meantime, we are focusing on executing the restructuring plan flawlessly and getting price in the market. And we've got plenty on our plate to handle for the near term anyway. Ali Dibadj : So in the time to time, is this one of those times that you're looking at it, portfolio-wise? Thomas Falk : I wouldn't say unusually so, not particularly. I mean, we're kind of beating around the bush as to whether I'll comment on the Reuters story, and our answer will be no comment just because we don't comment on rumors, so. Ali Dibadj : No, I'm just trying to getting a sense of where your cadence is and where your process is to make some those decisions. Thomas Falk : It isn't as rigid as that. It's a periodic look at the portfolio. And I'd say broadly, we're pretty happy with the major segments that we're in, and I think we've got the right portfolio. That doesn't mean that we don't look to fine tune things from time to time. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And then a separate question, following up a little bit on e-commerce, which you touched on a few times lightly. Can you talk a little bit about how you guys think about your market share on in the U.S. specifically e-commerce? Where do you think you are? Are you still behind? We certainly see you showing up more than you used to. What did you do to get there? Just an update would be helpful. Thomas Falk : Yes. I'd say e-commerce broadly is an important strategy, and I'll let Mike add some detail. In some markets, where we're ahead. And in some markets, where we were behind and caught up. And there's other markets that we were a little behind and we're catching up. And you've got that across the business. There's other markets that haven't emerged yet, where we're monitoring and working with early adopter partners just to see how it's going to shake out. And so in the U.S. in particular, we were behind. We're catching up. I'd say we'd say still that's the case. Overall, I think our total share on e-commerce in the U.S. is about fair share. But it should be higher than fair share because there's less private label in e-commerce. But Mike, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add anything, about what else you guys are doing specifically to drive it. Michael Hsu : No. E-commerce it's -- e-commerce and then more broadly digital, our digital strategy is a big opportunity for us still, and I know we've been experiencing pretty good growth more recently. If you think about the big e-commerce markets, Korea, where I think, 3 or 4x the size of the next largest brand in our categories. And so we're ahead there. We're ahead in China. I think the area in North America, we'd say overall were fair share across all of our categories, but a little bit behind in the baby and child care category, and we're gaining ground fast, and we're improving our performance there. So -- but the broader thing is, I think, if you look at our category and you think about how our consumers behave in the category, Ali, it's a very high range annual purchases, it's -- they're using the products every day, and it's high frequency. And so believe we have a different opportunity that fits unique, and I think for a lot of CPG brands, which is to create a different relation with our consumer of which e-commerce can be a part. But the digital opportunity is even bigger for us in terms of how do we build a different one on one relationship. And so we're excited about the growth we're seeing, but that's not our entire strategy there. Thomas Falk : I think, broadly, we're trying to just be present where mom wants to shop, and it's not any more complicated than that. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : I'll be brief. Quick clarification on China in the quarter, down 10% organically. What was the price mix and volume composition of that? And then a broader strategic question on private-label, which has been touched on in the past, I think it's less than 5% in the company sales. Strategically, do you think the company, the board would get to a point where that becomes a bigger emphasis philosophically? Are you opposed to that becoming much bigger than 5% of sales? Would you be comfortable if it reaches 10% or even greater than that over time? And sort of if so to help us think about that, can you talk about the margin and return differential for that part of the business? Thomas Falk : Yes. So maybe I'll start with the private-label question first and then we'll come back to the first question. And Mike, I guess, I'd say this, we typically are doing private label with very few people and doing it in areas where we think it advantages our overall relationship. And so to that extent, I think there we continue to be the lens that we've looked at it through to decide what the what we wanted to do from that standpoint. And I'd say that's probably the -- where you'd say you're going to go with it. Mike, I don't know if you want to come back to.... Michael Hsu : Okay, in China. Yes, in China the pricing, we're low double-digits down on price mix or pricing China. I think our mix was a little favorable. And so does that reflect the competitive environment that we talk about. I think the overall category pricing came down, I don't know what the right term is Paul, mid-single -- mid-double digits and it's a little bit more than what we came down. Thomas Falk : And the other mix in China total is our femcare business was up strong double digits in the quarter. So that blunted some of the price and volume hit in diapers. Operator : At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue. Paul Alexander : All right, thanks for the questions this morning, and we'll wrap up with a comment from Tom. Thomas Falk : Well, once again, challenging environment, and you can count on us to do the best job we can of delivering results in a challenging environment. And we appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thanks for dialing in today. Paul Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines, and thank you for joining us this morning.",

We now have your presenters in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you'd like to as an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our conference call. Here with us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Today's call will focus on three things, our third quarter 2018 results, our full-year outlook, and this morning's announcement that Mike Hsu has been elected Kimberly-Clark's next Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2019. This morning, you'll hear from Tom, Mike, and Maria, and then we'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investor section of our Web site. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements this morning. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Finally, we'll be referring to adjusted results and outlook; both exclude certain items described in this morning's earnings news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Falk : Thanks, Paul, and good morning everyone. I'd like to be the first to congratulate Mike Hsu on his upcoming move to become Chief Executive Officer of Kimberly-Clark. So congratulations, Mike. The Board of Directors and I have been working on this succession plan for several years, and it was my recommendation that Mike is the right choice and now is the right time. So this is a carefully planned and natural transition. And I'm confident Mike is the right leader to build on Kimberly-Clark's nearly 150-year legacy of caring for the needs of people around the world while delivering top-tier performance. He is passionate about our people, our brands and our businesses, and he has a deep understanding of what it takes to win in the marketplace. Now, let me hand the call over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank you, Tom, for your tremendous leadership of Kimberly-Clark over the past 35 years, especially the last 16 years as CEO. And during your tenure, you really transformed KC into one of the world's leading consumer products companies. You've also been a great mentor to me, and I'm honored to lead this great company, and I'm excited about our future. So now, back to the business at hand, I'm going to turn the call over to Maria to talk about the third quarter results. Maria Henry : Okay. Well, congratulations, both Tom and Mike. Tom, your great leadership and mentorship since I joined in 2015, and Mike, looking forward to the future. So, as awkward as it is, I'm going to pivot to the headlines for the quarter, so let's get into it. Organic sales were up 1% driven by 3% growth in developing and emerging markets. Margins and operating profit were impacted by significant commodity inflation and negative foreign currency effects. Helping to partially offset those headwinds, we delivered strong cost savings and reduced overheard spending. And with the benefit of lower taxes, our adjusted earnings per share increased 7%. And finally, we continue to return cash to shareholders. Now, let's look at the details of the results, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 2% year-on-year with a three-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales increased 1% versus a year ago. Net selling prices and product mix each improved 1%, while volumes fell one point. Moving on to profitability, third quarter adjusted gross margin was 33.2%, down 250 basis points year-on-year. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.4%, down 120 basis points. Commodities were a drag of $210 million in the quarter, primarily due to pulp and other raw materials. We're now expecting that full-year commodity inflation will be in the upper-half of our previous estimate of $675 million to $775 million. Foreign currencies were also a sizable headwind in the quarter, reducing operating profit by a high single-digit rate. On the other hand, we achieved $105 million of FORCE cost savings, including significant benefits from negotiated short-term raw material contracts. We also delivered $40 million of cost savings from our restructuring program. In terms of that program, we're making good progress overall, including closing a small consumer tissue converting facility in Latin America this quarter. In addition to the restructuring, we also continue to reduce our overhead costs. In total, between-the-line spending declined 150 basis points as a percentage of net sales. All in all, adjusted operating profit was down 8%. On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.71, up 7% year-on-year. That included significant benefit from a lower tax rate, along with lower interest and share count. We now expect the full-year tax rate will be between 21% to 22%, which is better than our estimate of 23% from three months ago, largely because of some planning initiatives. I'm pleased that our effective tax rate is expected to be below target this year. Looking ahead at this point, I expect our rate in 2019 will move back up somewhere into the 23% to 26% range that we initially targeted for 2018. Therefore, we're expecting that the tax rate will be a pretty significant year-on-year earnings headwind for us in 2019. Now, let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $662 million, compared to $805 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease included a $100 million U.S. pension plan contribution, restructuring payments, and the benefit of lower taxes. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $520 million in the third quarter. We expect the full-year amount will total $2.2 billion, in line with our $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion target. Looking at our segments; in Personal Care, organic sales were up 2%. Performance was led by developing and emerging markets, with organic sales up 5%. In terms of the highlights for D&E Personal Care this quarter, in Brazil, organic sales were up high-teens, including inflationary-driven prices increases and solid volume growth on diapers. In Argentina, organic sales were also up high-teens as price realization continues to accelerate, while our volumes, both for us and for the category, were down. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased double-digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, with strong volume growth on Huggies and Kotex. In China, organic sales were down high-teens due to lower diaper sales and continued challenging market conditions. Elsewhere in Asia, [ASEAN] [ph], which represents about 3% of Kimberly-Clark sales across all of our business segments, ASEAN had strong double-digit organic sales growth in Personal Care driven by Huggies in Vietnam. Personal Care organic sales grew up 2% in North America. Infant and childcare volumes increased high single-digits compared to a mid single-digit decline last year. Pull-Ups training pants momentum remained strong, and Huggies diapers benefited from growth in e-commerce and the timing of promotional shipments. Adult care volumes were down mid single-digits, reflecting strong growth last year, changes in promotional timing, and competitive activity. Overall Personal Care segment operating margins continue to be healthy at 20.7% although down 40 basis points year-on-year. Switching to the Consumer Tissue segment, organic sales fell 2%. North America organic sales declined 5%, primarily due to lower promotional activity. Overall, our initiatives to improve net realized revenue led to a 2% increase in net selling prices, and a 1% improvement in mix. Developed markets outside of North America grew consumer tissue organic sales by 4% led by Western and Central Europe. Consumer Tissue segment operating margins were 14.4%. That's down 310 basis points, driven by commodity inflation and lower volumes, partially offset by higher pricing and cost saving. Lastly in our Kimberly-Clark Professional segment, organic sales grew 1%. In D&E market, KC professional organic sales grew 4%, driven by continued volume growth in Asia-Pacific. Organic sales were up slightly in North America, including volume growth in washroom products and wipers. KC Professional segment operating margins were 18.9%. That's down 160 basis points versus record performance last year. Results this year were impacted by commodity and currency headwind. In summary, our third quarter results were impacted by a difficult environment with depreciating currencies adding to continued significant commodity inflation. Nonetheless, we achieved higher net selling prices, delivered significant cost savings and reduced overhead spending, and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike to comment on our full-year outlook. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Maria. As most of you know, while the overall environment remains challenging, especially the commodity inflation and currency volatility, in the near-term, we are responding by aggressively managing our business up and down the P&L. At the same time, we continue to execute our long-term strategies to deliver sustainable growth. As we mentioned in this morning's news release, we are confirming our previous outlook for our key top and bottom line financial targets. On the top line, we continue to target organic sales growth of approximately 1%. That's equal to our actual performance through nine months. I am encouraged that we are making progress improving net selling prices. Pricing went from being down 1% in the first half to up 1% in the third quarter, and that's consistent with what we said in July when we indicated that pricing should be modestly positive in the back-half of the year. And in mid-August, we announced price increases on the majority of our consumer business in North America. Many of those increases will start to go into effect in the first quarter of 2019. Realizing higher selling prices will be important next year given that recent commodity forecast and foreign currency rates imply pretty significant headwinds again in 2019. Now, looking at commodities and currencies for 2018, we expect these factors will negatively impact our adjusted operating profit by slightly more than the 20% to 25% range we assumed in July. That's mostly because of the recent weakness in many foreign currencies, especially in Latin America. In addition, our commodity inflation outlook is a bit higher on average, and so, as a result our teams are further reducing cost and raising selling prices. In addition, as Maria mentioned, our outlook for this year's tax rate has improved. All in all, we continue to target bottom line adjusted earnings per share of 660 to 680 for the year. That's up 6% to 9% year-on-year. So let me wrap up with the following. First, I am extremely proud of the 40,000 KC employees around the world who are committed to our vision to lead the world in who are committed to our vision to lead the world in essentials for a better life. We have a strong senior leadership team in place to help lead this company forward. Second, while the current environment is challenging, I'm optimistic about the long-term opportunities we have to grow our brands around the world. And third, our teams are focused on improving our business, winning in the marketplace, and creating long-term shareholder value. So, that concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the floor is open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Thanks. Good morning. First, congrats Mike, and congrats Tom. Tom Falk : Thank you. Mike Hsu : Thank you. Olivia Tong : Wanted to ask you about the progress on price in Q2, particularly in Personal Care, obviously North America was still negative but less so. So as we go into Q4, should we expect it to swing positive as some of your price plans take hold, or are there still promotions still planned that could express that realization? And then in the developing and emerging markets, it's nice to see also that that swung positive, but how much more can you price even if it is cost-justified given the macro challenges across several of the key markets? Mike Hsu : Yes, Maria, maybe I'll comment on the first part. I think overall -- well, I think globally I would say our pricing overall is on track and that we're cautiously optimistic about the progress we're making, and that we will make progress, and you're probably well aware, we've taken pretty significant actions, especially in North America, Europe, and Latin America. North America and Europe, I think generally mid to high single-digit price increases on the brands we have increased prices on, and in Latin America, generally double-digit. At retail in North America, we've had the wide range of discussions that you'd probably expect us to have, but I think we're all in agreement that we're going to try to move forward and minimize the potential disruptive impact on consumers. But we recognize that the market does need to move upward. And right now, we're cautiously optimistic that the market is moving in the right direction. With regard to the D&E, I think it is a challenge. I mean, one of the headlines is the Argentinean consumer is highly stressed, and we are raising prices double-digits to offset both the commodity impacts and also the currency impacts. I mean, year-on-year in the diaper category the diaper price will increase almost 100% for this year, while their wages have increased generally about a quarter of that. So it's a challenge, but we are doing what we need to do to manage this business. Olivia Tong : Got it\u2026 Mike Hsu : Thanks, Olivia. Tom Falk : Go ahead, Olivia. Olivia Tong : Oh, thank you. So, on China, you didn't touch on that, but with all the talk about the opportunity there, particularly in recent conferences. Are you concerned about the decline in China now that the volume is also down in addition to price? Was there any change in launch timing because I think you mentioned last quarter that you had some innovation coming. And I assume you still think this is just part of a cycle rather than a long-term market change so what are you doing to sort of shift the trajectory and what are the mile markers you're using to indicate where things stand? Mike Hsu : Yes, I'm trying to -- obviously we're not satisfied with our performance right now in China. It remains our biggest long-term opportunity, but it's also a complex market and it's got its challenges. I think the team is pulling on all the right levers that you would want them to pull. And that starts with improving the product. And we are excited about the product enhancements we've made in the line, but that said, pricing did come down in the middle of Q2, and we're going to be competitive on price in that marketplace, but we believe -- I don't really believe that market out in China is commoditizing. We are seeing consumers still interested in new products and product quality. That said, a number of manufacturers have pulled pricing down, and so we're going to need to be competitive. But I do view it as a challenge. It's going to be ongoing for a while in the near-term, but long-term it's a big growth market. Volume for the year-to-date has been up high single digits, the challenge has been the pricing. Olivia Tong : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. Michael, you guys have clearly faced a lot of headwinds in the last couple of years, and both on competition and cost. And you've pulled a lot of levers to minimize sort of the pain at the bottom line, including reductions in a lot of discretionary spend as Hsu has highlighted once again in your release. Do you believe your reductions in discretionary spend have left you competitively vulnerable? Mike Hsu : One, I think the simple answer, Jason, is no. I think we're doing a -- the teams are doing a great job getting more efficient at cost. We had a very big global restructuring that we announced in the beginning of this year that is proceeding very, very well. I think we are identifying a lot of good opportunities for us to improve our efficiency. But however, we're still going to spend and we are spending this year in the right areas, product innovation, marketing programs, and sales execution are critical growth drivers for us, and that we feel like we're invested in the right areas. But we also had identified opportunities for us where we weren't spending efficiently, and we're managing that better, but Maria, any additional\u2026 Maria Henry : Yes, I think that's certainly the headline, Mike. But if you look at where we're taking the biggest amount of cost out it's in the general administrative types of activities. And on the discretionary activities like travel, consulting, those types of things, really pulling back and working differently in order to get done what we need to get done. We've also had a big focus on reducing non-working advertising costs, and that has really paid off for us this year. So we're leveraging the restructuring program to structurally drive down the cost base of the company, and that portion of that will be sustainable. Mike Hsu : Yes. I think I'll note further, Jason, is I think overall, I think our in-market performance in most geographies is improving, especially in big markets and our big businesses in North America Consumer I think are getting better in diapers and in parts of Consumer Tissue. I think in many of our D&E markets, with one notable exception, China being that one, are having a good performance in their markets. So I think we are investing in the right places. Jason English : Very helpful, thank you. Tom Falk : Thanks, Jason. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys. Congrats Mike and Tom. A few questions for me, first, I guess we were a little surprised by the margin disappointment even with the startups and pricing looking -- this looks like, and it looks like we're going to now see continued pressure on EBIT given your guidance has worsened a little bit here. And a lot of that pressure looks like it's coming from Consumer Tissues, so that's pulp. But it looks like FORCE is a little bit behind what we'd expected. Pricing clearly is still on the comp and you got to believe it's going to happen. So, can you talk a little bit about the trajectory you expect your margins to look like over the next few quarters given all those moving parts. Mike Hsu : Yes, I mean the trajectory will go up in the next few quarters. I think the challenge has been we announced our pricing in mid-August. And obviously most of that has not taken root yet. We did have net selling prices in Consumer Tissue up a couple of points this quarter in North America, which was good progress. That was related to some of the innovation and the desheet that we made more at the beginning of the year. So we've got more price increases coming through, generally mid to high single digits in North America, and we'll start to see that generally take place in the first quarter of 2019. And that includes Personal Care as well. And then in developing and emerging markets we have made significant progress, particularly in Latin America, but we've got huge currency headwinds there, and in Europe. Maria Henry : Yes, and if I comment on the cost side, Ali, what I'd say for the quarter, that pulp was relatively stable if you look at the breakdown of what we gave on the 210, on inflation. In the other raw materials, polymer was worse than we expected in the third quarter, it was up 40% year-on-year, and we weren't expecting that coming in. On FORCE cost savings, that $105 million, I describe it as a solid number, but it was somewhat behind our expectation. We had some plant outages in our KCP business, and so we lost some momentum there on the FORCE cost savings within that segment in the quarter. And then the other big one is currency. And we had a significant drag from transactional currency in the quarter, particularly in Latin America, where we not only have the translational effect, but in those countries they're buying U.S. dollar-denominated pulp. And with the lower values currencies that's a double hit for that region of our business. So the transactional currency was a meaningful negative for us in the quarter. Mike Hsu : Yes, interesting side note, I think if you add up and look at the quarter results, which that the breakdown is pricing and cost savings generally offset commodities. It was the unexpected hit in currency that probably left that a little soft there. Ali Dibadj : So, just to follow-up on that a little bit, another question. One is, look, the pressure was in Consumer Tissue specifically on margins. That's just personally domestic business, number one, and looks like pulp is -- to your point, kind of stabilized. So better understanding there. And then on Latin America pricing, I mean if we're doing our math right, Argentina, call it 2% to 3% of your sales, 40% to 50% price inflation, so the bulk of your pricing actually came from that, right, just Argentina. So those are the follow-ups there. And then just a broader question, Mike, for you, as you look forward given all these moving parts and challenges. Are there pieces of the business that you think you want to spend more time on as you look forward for your vision for KMB? Mike Hsu : Yes, let me come back to -- I'll address the Argentina. I think in Latin America we've taken fairly broad price increases in many markets, and most notably also Brazil. So it's more than just Argentina. And then Ali, I wasn't clear about your question about North America consumer tissue. Ali Dibadj : Well, so I'm just saying your consumer tissue operating margins were where you really kind of had some pressure this quarter. And that's disproportionately in North America business. So you're taking the pricing in North America, it's not going to be resolved going forward by international pricing. So I'm trying to understand the trajectory of I guess the Consumer Tissue operating margin in particular as you go forward here was well. Mike Hsu : Yes, I think in the quarter, obviously and the North America Consumer Tissue team has done a nice job trying to offset a lot of it. And it's a pretty big hit from a commodity impact. They've offset, I would say, about half of it. But obviously that's not good enough, and therefore -- which is why we did the initial price move in August, and we'll start to see that impact starting in January. Tom Falk : And Ali, I would just add that margins were up sequentially in that business by 30 basis points, and so that's in line with what we were expecting given that the pricing, as Mike has said a couple of times, hasn't come in to the market yet. Mike Hsu : Yes. And then maybe with regard to your third quarter, strategic direction, I'll give you a couple of thoughts. Right now I'm still focused on the job I'm in, which is we got to finish '18 strong, and so that's kind of where the focus is. We will have plenty of opportunity to talk strategic direction as this transition occurs, so I'll share more then. But I'll give you just a couple of thoughts, a few things. Here's what's not going to really change going forward, which is, one, we're going to continue to manage the business in a shareholder-friendly way or the focus on our shareholders. We're going to continue to operate with the balance on long-term perspective on what drives shareholder value. And the core tenants, as you would expect, Ali, I mean, it's a CPG business, so we're going to focus on innovation, brand building, in-market execution, and cost savings. And those are kind of the four areas that every company kind of manages. I think it's kind of how you assemble them. And so when you talk about maybe where the strategic emphasis is, I will tell you a couple of thought-starters that we've been working on. One is we've got big businesses in big developed markets. And I think we have -- they're inherently slower growing, but I think we have a big opportunity to elevate those categories and premiumize those categories, and make those categories worth paying more for. And the great thing that we have in our categories is we've got actual performance differences, and where performance really matters. So elevate our core business is the key opportunity for us. The other big opportunity obviously is the developing and emerging market potential. We need to continue to lead the world in driving our Personal Care business across D&E markets. It's a multi-billion-dollar opportunity over a long time. And I think we can do a better job driving the weight of that in our portfolio, and also how we lead market development across the important markets for us. The third big area is on the digital and ecommerce front. I think it can have a transformative impact on our business. I think our business really matters to our consumers and our retailers because of the ring they're spending in our categories, the frequency they're using it, and the long duration they earn our categories. And so we're going to really look to focus on how we transform our business through digital and ecommerce. So those are a couple of thought-starters. I don't know if that answers your question. Ali Dibadj : It helps. And look forward to chatting more about it. Congrats again. Tom Falk : Thanks, Ali. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning, and congrats to both Tom and Mike. I have a question on your 1% organic sales growth in the quarter. I'm wondering if this performance was better or maybe worse than your expectations internally. I guess I'm thinking about this in the context of your fourth quarter expectations, which imply that your organic sales growth won't accelerate sequentially for you to meet your 1% full-year guidance. So I guess I'm wondering why this is and how you guys are thinking about the impact of some of the pricing actions you've mentioned. Mike Hsu : I think, Bonnie, overall, about on track for us. I mean, year-to-date we're up about 1%. We're expecting for the full-year to kind of be on that path. And the important thing is what I mentioned a little earlier. We are seeing improved performance in many of our key markets, including in North America and most of our D&E markets. In a lot of D&E markets we're up a few points on share in our key categories, and we are seeing good organic growth. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. And then I had a couple of questions on private label. First, I was curious to hear from you why we're not seeing more trade-up into branded products from private labels especially given the current strength across the U.S. macro environment and the consumer. And then second, we're hearing a lot of the private label has followed on pricing. So could you guys confirm this? And then wondering how you see the relative price gaps narrowing, and if you think this should encourage more trade-up to your brands. Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes, I would love to see more trade-up faster. I think the recent private label trends are a little mixed. If you look at our categories, I think in the third quarter private label was up in three -- down in three, and flat in two, so overall kind of mixed. It was up a bit more across the Consumer Tissue categories for us. I think we are seeing though improved performance in parts of our tissue business, particularly bath tissue, both Scott 1000 and Cottonelle, Kleenex Premium side, and our towels business is also performing better. I think the focus there for us is we really are focused on the product experience and bringing innovation, and those are areas, particularly on bath tissue this year, we brought really good innovation on it. I think that's why we are seeing improved performance there. Now, as Maria mentioned, our overall organic in Consumer Tissue, North America, for the quarter was down five. A lot of that was associated with some promotion shifts that we had or decreases in promotional spending that we're making to try to improve profitability of the business. The underlying base performance of the business and the brands, particularly in bath, I think is improving. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thank you. Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the adult incontinence category in U.S. So I think that when Procter reentered the category the conversation was sort of more activity more advertising raises awareness, raises the profile of the category and grows the category. So share wasn't really the right metric to be watching. But recently, and you mentioned in the release, but also is it in the Nielsen data that actually sales trends have turned negative. So can you talk a little bit about what's going on in that business, if there was something in the quarter in particular in terms of promotional timing that may have impacted it, or if in fact it's now not just a share game or not just share isn't the indicator we should be watching, it's actually the sales growth? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes, Lauren. In North American adult care I think it's also a soft area for us that we want to improve our performance. And I think the team is addressing it. But one is, that's probably the one category in North America where competitive and promotional activity remains fairly elevated. We are still seeing some aggressive couponing out there. And so that's kind of the environment we're operating in. Also in that, I think the opportunities for us is we have had some negative distribution changes that the team is working to correct. And we're also working on some product improvements as well. So I think it's a competitive category, there is still growth inherent in that business, the focus for us going forward is to make sure that we are focused on driving category growth. I'll note that, you know, I think before our P&G reentered, we are growing low double-digits or even mid double-digits for a number of years, and that growth has slowed down with maybe a little more competitive activity. And my hypothesis would be a little bit more too much emphasis competing versus marketing message, driving category expansion, which is what we're getting back to, and we're going to focus on bringing consumers back into the category, we call new category entrance, back into the category. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, that's really helpful. And then also with that as backdrop, and it feels like, Procter, primary competitor is behaving a bit differently in terms of in-store execution, may be working with retailers a bit differently to work on their display space and activity in store. So can you tell us -- talk about if in your businesses, you've already mentioned maybe some distribution losses on in continents, but if you feel like you are still getting your fair share of activity in the store, if there needs to be sort of a change in perspective on how you're working with retailers to get support for your innovation in store? Mike Hsu : Yes, I would say that, well, we feel like we are getting our fair share of performances, as the opportunity for us is, we can still enhance and improve our in-store execution globally. That's a big opportunity for us, and given -- I spent some years in sales, I mean, I tend to be a little obsessed with our performance there, and still think we have an opportunity to improve. And so, well, we can respect what our competitors are doing, we see our own opportunities, and well, there's parts of our -- a lot of our performance, we're pretty pleased with. We know we can be a lot better, and we're going to focus there. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. Congrats, Tom and Mike. So I have two main questions. First, I guess this is just more of a forward-looking version of Jason's question, but I'd love to hear about any plans going forward in terms of reinvestment by the business in marketing or other areas under your leadership, Mike, it's typical that a new CEO often chooses to take the opportunity to reinvest in the business, there's been some market share pressure recently, theoretically, you need to support the business post pricing. So just given those factors, should we expect more reinvestment by the business as you look going forward? Could it be significant, or are you pretty comfortable with the level of investment that you're planning for leaving 2018? And then also, Mike on 2019, I know you won't provide guidance today, but you did sort of go out of your way to cite the recent commodity forecasts and forward currency rates implies some significant headwinds. Maria mentioned the tax rates going back up significantly. It seems like some of those headwinds are worse than you would have expected a few months ago. So I'm just curious, are there additional areas you're sort of coming up with and help offset those pressures? Obviously, given also a lot of price increases, is it possible to get more going forward, you know, another round of pricing? Is there more room on the cost side where you've been effective for the last few years, beyond the specific programs you've outlined? It just feels like some of those headwinds could be pretty significant for next year. So I'm wondering about sort of some of the offsets the other way. Thanks. Mike Hsu : Okay. Okay, maybe I'll start, and then maybe Maria, we could talk a little bit too, but\u2026 Maria Henry : Yes. Mike Hsu : I think the first part is on the investment, and there's probably not a General Manager in any company that would say they're happy with the overall investment levels. And so, while we spend it, what's average for a CPG, what I like to put more behind good ideas, yes, and that's a big reason why we've done the restructuring, and that's to provide fuel for reinvestment, which we are doing in some cases. I think also if you think about what I just talked about with Ali, which is that the three kind of planks elevate the core of our business, lead a Personal Care development across D&E markets, and drive our digital e-commerce growth. I think those are areas that would be good candidates for investment. As we think about how do we build out our market positions in international markets and leading market development, I think that could -- there could be investment dollars well spent after that, or in terms of how we fund innovation, and so, we are going to do some of those things. I don't think we're ready to share the details of that yet, and that's still to come. So I think I think that's part -- maybe one. I think with regard to the -- what you're asking about maybe the outlook, one is, we are not -- our practice is not to give guidance on 2019, right now. We'll do that in January, and that's kind of how we do that and so we're going to stick to that. I will tell you a couple things, so just to kind of get -- since we are talking -- just to give you a little more context, we are going to continue focus on building a holistic plan, and that means focusing on the proven long-term drivers like innovation, brand building, and cost efficiency. So, we're going to do that. However, it's fair to say that near-term challenge has become more difficult with commodity inflation, and you should see that you can probably see that the commodity and currency impact has amplified over the last two or three months. Just for reference, I think in this year the commodity and currency combined is equal to about $1 of EPS negative impact on the P&L. So, we expect that commodity and currency to be further headwind next year. And part of that is some of our contracted terms, for some of our key commodities like pulp are probably unlikely to be as favorable as they are this year, given the current environment. And so, with that, and we got that to work through. Our tax rate is going to be a drag, but the pricing and the cost savings are obviously going to be a help for us next year. So we are going to give you more specific guidance as we get back to January, but those were a few thoughts. Maria Henry : Yes, I don't think I have any anything to add. Obviously, we will update you in January when we are together, and the comments that we are making on a couple of those items that are just in the spirit of transparency to make sure you know what we are thinking in a couple of areas as we all start to think more about 2019. Dara Mohsenian : Okay, thanks. Mike Hsu : Thanks Dara. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with the Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Great, thank you. Mike, Tom, congrats. If we take a step back versus where we were a few quarters ago, it feels to me as though the broader discussion, not just for you for the industry as a whole has turned down a bit in terms of any potential tension between CPG suppliers and retailers, and I'm curious if you agree with that and if so also your perspective as to why? Because from the outside, it feels like the dialog is somewhat more constructive today, but I wonder, if that's just potentially rooted in the fact that the retailers themselves don't feel -- don't seem to be acting quite so aggressively towards one another. Amazon is arguably operating with more of a bottom line focus than a year ago when it was prioritizing pure customer acquisition. Our discounters haven't taken over the world, consumers are generally healthy spending, Walmart is doing well et cetera. And it feels like that has all helped to create a relative true sub retail, which in turn I'd argue has opened up a window for yourselves and other CPG players to pursue some pricing, and I guess I'm just trying to figure out, am I making things up, do you agree with that summary in broad terms? And then to the extent you do agree, I guess what is the more normal state of affairs, what we are living through now, which is arguably less intense or the more aggressive environment that we saw two, three, four quarters ago? Thanks. Tom Falk : Steve, maybe I'll start since I haven't answered the question for a while, and you have to listen to the sound of my voice a little while longer, but I guess I would say -- I'll let Mike build on this is that I don't think it was ever pointed as bad as investors thought it was, and I think every retailer that I've called -- I know Mike would probably echo this, they want to hear from you, how you are going to help them grow their category, and how you are going to help execute their strategies. And so, as long as you are bringing value to that conversation and bringing innovation and putting it behind brands that are important to consumers that shop in their stores, you are going to have a pretty constructive conversation, where you have challenges with retailers as if your innovation isn't working, your service is lousy or those kinds of things. Those are the most difficult discussions, and thankfully, we usually stack up pretty well on that front. I think most of the retailers, they read the business newspapers and know what's happening to commodity costs and know what's happening to exchange rates. And so, they aren't shocked when you when you come in with a pricing conversation. I think the -- where you really start to get their attention though is when you pivot to talking about innovation and what you are going to do to make the category bigger and how you are going to close the execution with a customer in their store, but Mike, maybe you can build on that. Mike Hsu : I definitely agree with Tom, which is I think the tone of discussion with retailers has been consistent over the last several years, and I don't think last year was any different. I think it probably got bigger play in a few areas, and maybe part of what's maybe what you are perceiving as changes, the improved growth in the infant childcare category, as it relates to us. I think last year in the middle of the year, ICC was down about 5% in value. I think that was kind of a rude awakening and caused quite a concern amongst us and the retailers. And so what's changed this year is we were down five in July last year, the category now in this latest quarter is up three, huge swing, and I think that probably has changed what you might perceive as a tone, but I think the -- in the meeting discussions and the tone of discussions with customers has been consistent last year, this year, the year before. Stephen Powers : Okay, that's great. And Tom thanks for weighing in, we did miss you so far this call. Maybe just one quick, one quick clean-up if I could, Maria, on the tax rate, the lower tax rate in 2018, is that -- to interpret that is benefiting free cash flow and cash -- is that a cash tax benefit or is it more just an income statement benefit? Maria Henry : No, it's also on cash side of the house. So we did have a nice benefit on cash taxes in the third quarter, and that helped to offset things like cash bet we spent on the restructuring and also held cover the lower operating costs that we had in the quarter. Stephen Powers : Okay, perfect. And so, for '19, that step-up back to the more normal tax rate would also be a more normal cash tax step-up as well? Maria Henry : Yes, that's right. Stephen Powers : Perfect, okay, thank you so much. Maria Henry : Fair. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, just as a follow-up on the question on the taxes, I mean, it feels to an outsider that the lower taxes are helping you make your earnings target for this year, which is great, but I'm wondering given how many categories or markets or situation specifically that you referenced, where competitive activity has intensified whether you debated internally, hey, let's take some of that benefit from those lower taxes, and plough them back into more competitive spending immediately. So forget the earnings guidance range, but just increase our competitive investment or promotion or advertising or whatever it is or hurry up on the new product activity to insulate some of your market shares, whether it's in China, whether it's in -- continents et cetera, et cetera. And then sort of bigger picture, you know, Mike, if you look at the business, advertising spending is down if you think 3.5% of sales maybe this year, down from almost 4% just a few years ago, and your business has shifted I would argue to categories and markets, where advertising spending is arguably more important than it was five years ago. So as you look forward over the next five years, do you think 3.5% of sales and advertising is right, do you think you need to migrate back up to the 4% maybe even higher given how intensive competitive these markets are et cetera, et cetera? Thanks so much. Tom Falk : Okay, Wendy, I will start on the et cetera, et cetera part, and then let Mike hold it. I guess I would come -- maybe coming back to the tax rate discussion, some of that is a discrete activity putting the extra $100 million in the pension plan, which we get to deduct that last year's tax rates created a tax benefit that was one-time deal, really as part of the whole new tax bill and figuring out what options you have under that to create shareholder value was clearly a separate discussion. As you look at the investment behind the business, I mean, we're more or less investing on plan behind the right innovation in the right market. So I would say let's show up and share, I mean I think we're up in high 50s of category country intersections that we track, and feel like we're generally investing at about the right levels. We're also generating a significant amount of non-working media savings as part of the restructuring, a lot of that's been reinvested in advertising and promotion activities. And so, I think the team is pivoted to driving price increases in the back-half which we need. There are times where you may be focused on that, and miss some other opportunities, but I still think that's the right thing to be focused on, but I'll let Mike build on that. Mike Hsu : Yes, Wendy, overall yes, I would like to get the advertising spending. That said, at our number, you can't read too much into that number these days because it goes into a lot of lines. And so, for example, there is two things going on, which -- for example, digital online spend sometimes can be slotted into the promotion even though it may feel more like an advertising expense. So, there's a lot of differences going on there. The other thing is given all the innovation that's occurring in a digital media, our ROIs are improving significantly. And so we're really excited about that. And I think that has a big impact for businesses like ours that are more continuity based or that are consumers in the category for a long time every day. And so I'm pretty excited about that. But overall, if you think about the areas that I had mentioned earlier around elevating the core, D&E markets and digital, yes, I would like to get us to spend more. Tom Falk : I don't know if this will make you feel any better, Wendy, we are not going to -- I think we are not disclosing this, but in the quarter, our advertising spend was above the full-year average by a small amount. So we're spending at the right levels even in this quarter. Wendy Nicholson : It does make me feel better. And thank you, Tom, it's been a pleasure knowing you, and congratulations on your retirement. Tom Falk : Thanks, Wendy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks, good morning, everyone, and congratulations, Mike and Tom as well. Mike, one question for you, broadly here, I was hoping to get your updated thoughts -- and we've touched on a lot of these issues throughout the call, which is balancing some of these pricing objectives given some of the margin degradation that you're seeing here with market share trends, which I'm sure you guys are a little bit disappointed, particularly in the U.S. in just one data point as we look at the Nielsen data, I mean, for the most recent four-week period, we have Kimberly-Clark losing market share in every single one of its major categories, which I'm sure can't be satisfying to you. So maybe you can talk a little bit about that. It also touches on an issue which was brought up earlier. Are you willing to sacrifice near-term profitability to restore lost market share, how important is some of this lost market share, particularly some of these losses to private label, in tissue and towels and then just broadly a discussion around market share, how worrisome this is and your level of confidence and we'll see this improve here in the near-term. So thanks for all that. Mike Hsu : Yes. Kevin, let me start with like the foundational principle, which is like, we exist to deliver a strong proposition to our consumers and that's what we're focused on, and that's the only way you can win over the long-term and I fundamentally believe in that. And that does go along with market share over the long-term. I think in the quarter in North America I think our data given a lot of that is probably slightly different. And so I have us up or even in five out of eight categories. There's a lot of activity going on in the club channel and also in online. So I think that's one. And then what I was saying earlier, I think our performance is broadly improving across many markets in D&E. In Russia, I think, we were up three points in diapers and up a point or so in feminine care. In Latin America, including both Brazil and Argentina, we're up two or three share points in diapers and up a point or two in feminine care. So we are seeing improved performance and we are very focused on market share. And we have to recognize that we need to drive and you need to focus on driving the right value proposition which guides a lot of the pricing activity. Kevin Grundy : Thank you. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Steve Garmaise : Good morning, this is actually Steve Garmaise on for Nik, and we'd also like to echo congratulations to Tom and Mike, and then we were hoping just kind of building off that last question if you could talk about e-commerce and your market share positioning online versus offline and then what plans you had in place to further increase your share online? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes, again, e-commerce, I think proceeding very well for us. Our online shares generally are ahead of our offline shares. We're even. The three big markets for us are China, Korea and the U.S. Although we are seeing some growth in some other markets as well. Overall, our business this year year-to-date is up double-digits as it was strong double-digits last year. And so we feel good about that. I think maybe the looking forward part, Steve, is -- we think we can leverage it even more effectively going forward. I mean, the teams are innovating in terms of how they deal with their e-commerce channel partners. Most recently, I think we were ranked number one in advantage in dealing with e-commerce in China which was off the press. I don't even think a lot of us is -- you know, some of our team internally have seen that data yet. But pretty exciting news and I know that teams are doing a great job around the world and also it's driving great efficiencies in terms of how they're spending and how they're driving their results. Tom Falk : And Steve, I will just add that we just want to be present with the right offer and the right product mix wherever mom wants to shop. And so, we are doing a lot of e-comm. We are also doing a ton of a lot of our brick and mortar retailers who are doing click and collect. And we're -- that's not really captured in any of our data, but every retailer we serve is working on that. And so, yes, we really want to make sure we've got the right part, the right offer wherever mom is looking to do her shopping and that's really overall strategy. Steve Garmaise : That's great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thanks. Hi, good morning, and Tom, Mike congrats on the news. So Maria on the upper end of commodity headwinds what are your embedded assumption for pulp and oil prices? And on a separate question to all of you in the competitive environment particularly North America and China - and I appreciate all the comments, but had volume now 8% in North America in consumer tissue and also declines in China too. So what are you going to do in terms of continued volume share losses? Or you are just timing as your key competitive is putting more money behind innovation while you are cutting? And given the commodity tax headwinds into 2019, should we assume that you'll continue to be cautious on the investment in marketing or just broadly as you said before not commenting on 2019 but you expect that the investment in innovation to pick up as you progress into 2019? Thank you. Maria Henry : Sure. I'll ahead and start with some of that commodity questions that you have. Running through our assumptions on the key commodities, we are expecting that eucalyptus will be up about 20% for the full year. The same with polymer that we are expecting it will be up more than 20% for the full year. And then on SAM, super-absorbent, we are expecting that for the full year, it will be up low double digit. And so those are our commodity expectations. And I think something that worth noting is if you look at commodities and currencies combined for the full year, we are expecting that to be about just over a 25% drag on our operating profit. So, it is significant for the year. Tom Falk : Yes, on the - on the competitive front, Andrea, I think the I would say is in North America, I think it's mixed performance. But overall I think improving. And if you take North America infant and childcare, obviously I have mentioned that the category trends are improving, but the category trends were improving I think because of our performance. More recently our share is up about a poiny the quarter. Huggies volume was up mid-single digit, Pull-ups volume or childcare volumes were up low double digits. And so we feel good about where that is. And I think the category is responding well to innovation that we put out there. I think in consumer tissue one of the big things is that we have been dialing back in our promotional activity. And that does come with some volume and share impacts. The big challenge given all the commodity inflation this year, it's a significant headwind. And I think the team has a done a good job chopping that back. But one of the levers they have pulled is pricing both in terms of sheet count reductions but also including promotion reductions. And so that's what we are seeing some of the effects there. And then the other that I mentioned, yes, adult care has been challenge. I think it was down about 3 points in share. And that's kind of the big focus area for us where we need to improve. Andrea Teixeira : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi, good morning. So, I had a question on China diapers. Wanted to know if you didn't say already, how did this business trend on the year-over-year basis? And competitively speaking where are we in the shakeout of the industry? Are you seeing new local competitors and regional entrants? Has that kind of reached an asymptote, or are we now seeing a point where there is a little bit of fallout in the industry? And then I have a follow-up. Mike Hsu : Yes, I think, Steve, I would say the competitive intensity in China in the last few quarters or maybe the last couple of years has escalated. And just to give you some reference, our personal care organic sales in the quarter were down in the high teens. We had strong growth in fem care but that was not enough to offset some of declines in diapers for us. And so, diaper pricing dropped in the market by about 15 to 20% back in Q2. And so we are working our way through that. And that's kind of blown through our business and impacted our business right now. Overall, volumes as I mentioned earlier, I think volumes in the category were up high single digits so far this year. But with pricing, the category is about flat or even slightly down in terms of value terms. So despite all these price moves personally I don't believe the category is commoditizing. And some of the effects you are seeing are consumers that are trying new products local products that they perceive to be interesting or of high quality or have attributes that they are interested in. We have responded by upgrading our products. And we are really excited about the offering that we have out there. However, some of that impact is muted because of all the price activity. China is critical for us. It's the largest market in the world right now in diapers. It's going to continue to be, and we will continue to grow. And so, we are going to compete in China for the long term. And we are going to focus on the right value drivers, which includes a great product offering, the right marketing and obviously a competitive price. Steve Strycula : Okay, great. And then I have a quick follow-up across your three -- top three diaper markets online, China, Korea, and United States, could you just comment for context what the penetration is roughly across this market? And on the last call you mentioned that private labels currently under indexing online. What's structurally is driving that in your view relative to brick and mortar? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Maybe the first part, I think so overall in Korea very highly developed in terms of our overall diaper sales online -- it's almost 90% online development. And China tends to be that - the overall category is about 50 or slight over 50%. And the U.S. is little bit more behind. I would say right now it's in the mid teens overall. And part of the - when you talk to our retail partners across the country, they all say the same thing that the U.S. is still a car culture. And as long as they have cars, people are still going to want to shop in the store. But we are seeing very good growth in North America as well. And then sorry, Steve, I missed the second part of your question. Steve Strycula : Yes, on the last call you mentioned a private label under indexing online relative to the share at brick and mortar order. So just curious what do you see as structurally driving that, and I imagine that fosters very good repeat rates purchase rates because this is almost a subscription-like business. Mike Hsu : Yes. I don't have a good hypothesis right now as to why that private label is under indexing. I would say that the reason some of our business is not performing well online is there is a lot of online marketing activity and digital marketing activity that we put in place to drive that. And the tools are becoming increasingly sophisticated and our teams are getting better are managing and marketing through those tools. And so that might be a reason why you see lower development levels of private label\u2026 Tom Falk : And then, Steve, I'll chime in on that one. I would say two things, one is physical store environment, you get to interact with the product. And so you can see packaging. You may not be able to necessarily touch and feel the product, but you know what you are getting whereas online you know you are getting if you are buying a brand but may not know what you are going to get on private label. So it is little bit of a hurdle on that front. And then secondly, I mean a large super seller may have a 50 to 100,000 items in distribution, and e-tailer may have a couple million items on their distribution. So this is a complexity of managing private label across a number of different categories is not trivial and that could be another factor. Maria Henry : Yes, and also the failure rate issue, we are concerned that consumer have our product that you have think about what they are and what they do for the consumer that having a trusted brand is important. And when you are shopping online and you don't have that ability to interact with the brand that -- as Tom described, consumers tend to migrate in our categories to brands. Steve Strycula : Great. Thank you. Congrats to both. Mike Hsu : Thanks. Tom Falk : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning, and Tom, thanks, congrats on a great run. Mike, congrats and best of luck. A question on mix, I have three questions on that really. What is the biggest -- I noticed positive mix, not only broadly but in each of the segment is what are the biggest one or two sources of that positive mix would you say? Is there something that's intentional and maybe tactical this year as a way of another way of coping with higher commodity prices? And about how much of a positive factor in adjusted gross margin, if any, is mix because I know you think of the business in terms of total dollars. Thank you very much. Tom Falk : Yes, I'll start. Is it intentional? Absolutely. So, typically we would like all of our innovation to be mixed accretive. And to your further point about pricing challenges, and if you can't get price easily you try to give mixed. And so, the teams will try to up-sell the better value performing item. And so, our sales teams are absolutely motivated by that. Now sometimes you can see mixed drag as the business grows in some of the larger format packs, which can be a countervailing force on that, but by and large, we would hope day-in and day-out, we're doing some things that will give us some improvement on mix and offset some of the headwinds that we face from growth in other channels. Maria Henry : Yes. And on the profit question, the positive mix was definitely a contributor both in the third quarter and year-to-date. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much. Tom Falk : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. Tom Falk : All right. We appreciate everyone's questions this morning. We'll conclude the call, and we look forward to speaking with you in January. Everybody have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines, and thank you for joining us this morning.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you'd like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's year-end earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chief Executive Officer and Maria Henry, our CFO. This morning Maria will discuss our 2018 results and 2019 outlook. Mike will then talk about our medium term strategic priorities and financial objectives. Our remarks will be a little longer than normal this morning, but we'll finish as usual with Q&A. And we would ask each analyst to limit their questions to just a few, so we can get to everyone efficiently. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we'll be referring to adjusted results and outlook; both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn the call over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines on our full year results. We delivered 3% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and a 1% increase for the full year consistent with our target. It was a challenging macro environment and our profitability was impacted by significant commodity inflation and currency volatility. Nonetheless, we delivered significant cost savings and achieved higher selling prices in the second half of the year and we improved capital efficiency and returned significant cash to shareholders. Now, let's take a look at the details of our results. Starting with sales, full year net sales were $18.5 billion, up 1%. Organic sales rose 1% and that included about 2 points of positive pricing in the second half of the year. Looking at the top-line by geography, in North America, organic sales in consumer products increased 1% that was driven by an increase of more than 1% in personal care including solid volume growth in baby care and adult care. In K-C Professional in North America, organic sales increased 3% driven by higher volumes in all major product categories. In developing an emerging market, organic sales rose 2%. In terms of key Personal Care markets, organic sales increased double digits in Eastern Europe and ASEAN and mid-single digits in Latin America, but fell low-teens in China. In developed markets outside of North America, organic sales rose 1%. Moving on to profitability, full year gross margin was 33.2%, down 270 basis points year-on-year. Commodities were drag of $795 million. That was an all-time high and well above our initial planning assumption coming into 2018 of $300 million to $400 million. Foreign currencies were also head winds. Those two factors combined reduced operating profit by high 20's percent. We delivered full year cost savings of $510 million including our FORCE and Restructuring program. Restructuring savings were $135 million well above our initial target of $50 million to $70 million. We made excellent progress in the first year of this program and we remain on track with our overall plan. While FORCE cost savings of $375 million were substantial, we did have a soft fourth quarter. Performance in the quarter included elevated transportation and distribution cost in North America particularly in Consumer Tissue, along with some higher manufacturing related operating costs. These factors are controllable for us and we will manage through them as we go through 2019. Moving down the P&L, between-the-lines spending fell 130 basis points as a percent of net sales, reflecting restructuring benefits tight management and discretionary spending and secondarily lower incentive compensation. Adjusted operating margin was 17%, down 140 basis points and adjusted operating profit fell 7%. Our adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 was 21% that was down significantly year-on-year and below our original plans. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $6.61, up 6% year-on-year and driven by the lower tax rate. Our October guidance was for earnings per share of $6.60 - $6.80. Now, let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations was $3 billion, up slightly year-on-year. We reduced working capital cash conversion cycle by five days and we improved adjusted return on invested capital by 240 basis points, ending the year at 26.5%. On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.2 billion. That's the eighth consecutive year we've returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. Now, let me turn to our 2019 outlook. We expect the environment will remain challenging, although somewhat better than in 2018. We're targeting to deliver a solid improvement in our operating performance that includes higher organic sales growth compared to our 2018 performance and improved operating profit and margins. On the top-line, total sales are expected to decline 1% to 2% that includes an expected 3% to 4% headwind from currencies. We plan to grow organic sales by 2% that's similar to our expectation for overall market growth. We expect higher net selling prices of at least 3%. Our progress in the back half of 2018with price realization bodes well our 2019 plans. Given the overall level of pricing, we expect to achieve or planning for some negative volume impacts particularly in Consumer Tissue. We've a number of innovation launches in our plan and we'll support our brands with strong marketing programs. Moving beyond sales, we plan to grow adjusted operating profit by 1% to 4%. At the midpoint of our guidance targets that implies margin improvement of 70 basis points. On average, we expect commodities and currencies in total will be a headwind on operating profit of about 20%, including a high single digit drag from currency rates. We expect to offset much of that with higher pricing. We expect commodity inflation of $300 million to $400 million. That's much less than we experienced in 2018, which we believe represented a cyclical peak in terms of year-on-year headwinds. We're targeting to deliver $400 million to $450 million of total cost savings. That includes FORCE savings of $300 million to $325 million and Restructuring savings of $100 million to $125 million. Our FORCE target reflects lower value generated from our commodity contracts versus what we've achieved over the last couple of years. Outside of this, we expect strong performance on the other components of our FORCE program. In addition, supply chain related restructuring activities and savings will be ramping up in 2019. Overall, we continue to have high confidence in our ability to deliver healthy levels of supply chain savings going forward. We expect the adjusted effective tax rate will return to a more normal level and be between 23% and 25%. At the mid-point that represents a year-on-year earnings drag of about 3.5%. All-in-all, we're targeting full year adjusted earnings per share of $6.50 to $6.70, which at the mid-point is essentially even year-on-year. In terms of our earnings profile, we expect earnings will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. That's primarily because of the expected timing of the net benefit from selling price increases. Finally, on cash flow and capital allocation, we expect cash provided by operations will be slightly below our strong performance in 2018. We expect to allocate between $2 billion and $2.3 billion to dividends and share repurchases. We plan to repurchase $600 million to $900 million of Kimberly-Clark stock, in addition for increasing our dividend by 3% that's our 47th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. Now let me hand the call over to Mike. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Maria. Good morning everyone. Maria walked you through our results and 2019 outlook and while we aren't satisfied with our margin in 2018, I was encouraged with the following. We returned to delivering organic sales growth and improved net selling prices in the second half including strong fourth quarter performance. Our market share positions improved in about half of the 80 category country combinations that we track. We leveraged our financial discipline and we made excellent progress on our global restructure. Since this is my first earnings call as CEO, I'd like to tell you I'm excited about K-C's future. It's a great time to have the opportunity to lead this great company and it's a real honor. Our strategic priorities are to grow our portfolio by iconic brands, leverage our strong cost and financial discipline and allocate capital in value creating ways. We're calling this K-C Strategy 2022 and it's how we intend to deliver balanced sustainable growth and create shareholder value in what we assume will be a continued challenging environment. So let me outline a few thoughts. First, we'll continue to be lean on cost and be stewards of shareholders' capital. Those will always be hallmarks of Kimberly-Clark. Second, to drive top-line growth will sharpen and increase our focus on the consumer and better meet their needs that we've shown over the past few years. To do that we plan to develop and launch more meaningful innovation, increase investments in digital marketing and improve in store sales execution. While our commercial capabilities that drive the top-line are good, I believe we can make them great. We're launching internal initiatives in these areas to strengthen our capability just like we've made ongoing cost savings a superior capability. Now, let me spend the next few minutes describing our growth priorities. We intend to grow our portfolio of iconic brands in line with or slightly ahead of our categories. We're starting from a position of strength. We built some of the world's most well-known and trusted brands and we hold the number one or two market share position in 80 countries. Our objective is to maintain or improve our overall market share position especially in key categories. We have three main growth pillars and all of them are consumer centered. The first is to elevate core businesses. Improving the product experience, making our products more valuable and work more consumers is what I mean by elevating core businesses. We'll launch differentiated product innovation to drive growth in core markets. These innovations will be based on deep understanding of consumer insights. We'll deliver better performance and will drive trade off. You'll see some examples of that end market in 2019 including in baby care. Our upgraded and more standardized manufacturing footprint enabled by our global restructuring will help us bring our innovation pipeline to market more rapidly and more consistently around the world. Beyond innovation, we'll grow in core businesses by deploying category expanding marketing including in underpenetrated categories like adult incontinence and training pants that's how we built large and leading brands like Depend, Poise and Pull-Ups. Net revenue management will also help us grow core businesses. With more process discipline and more consistent utilization of tools, we can generate more revenue through pricing strategies, promotion effectiveness and product mix. Our second growth pillar is to accelerate Developing and Emerging markets with an emphasis on Personal Care and K-C Professional. D&E is about 30% of company revenue and while we had a lot of success here, D&E remains our largest growth opportunity because of the relatively low levels of category penetration and frequency. We have the resources and plans to achieve success going forward. For example, we'll invest to drive category development in diapers, it's a $35 billion incremental market opportunity if the average spending per baby goes from today's 15% of the US level to one third of the US level. We'll also invest in feminine care, adult care and baby wipes which all have significant penetration opportunities. Priority markets for us are in Personal Care of Latin America, China, Eastern Europe and ASEAN. We'll also book some early stage markets such as India and Africa, which are relatively smaller today, but have significant long-term potential. As in developed markets, we'll deploy our consumer insight based innovation model in D&E too. As part of our restructuring, we're moving more R&D resources in the local markets to enable better and faster innovation. We're using an adopt and deploy model for smaller markets. Beyond innovation we'll drive growth through stronger in store sales execution by optimizing distribution, pricing, shelving and merchandizing. We'll also deploy category building marketing campaigns and in-market activities to help develop these markets. In K-C Professional only 20% of the business is in D&E. We've significant whitespace opportunity as industrialization and economic development continue. Our near-term focus markets will include Latin America and China. Our third growth pillar is to drive digital marketing and e-commerce. Through digital we can build one-to-one consumer relationships, which will enable us to maximize lifetime value for our consumers. We'll invest even more in digital marketing and help us build those relationships. Today a digital is approximately half of our working medium mix and that percentage is growing. We'll deploy data-driven and compelling marketing with precision targeting to engage with consumers at the right time at the right content. We've gained deep experience with this approach including in China, South Korea and the US and plan to utilize it more globally to engage, acquire and retain consumers. Data-driven digital marketing and dynamic content development is helping us to improve consumer engagement, loyalty and ROI. In addition, e-commerce is an important and growing part of our business. This channel is growing double digits and it's about 10% of overall revenue. Our online shares in key countries are slightly ahead of or similar to our offline positions. Our products are well positioned versus environment because they have high recognition and consumer trust and they're also critical to help our customers grow since they're important traffic drivers. We plan to leverage our capabilities and attracting this of our brands to capture the opportunities that exist in e-commerce. Digital marketing and e-commerce also further enable our strategies to elevate core businesses and accelerate growth in D&E markets. We have a strong portfolio of brands, the right strategies and organization structure and a solid foundation to build on going forward. We also have significant opportunities to accelerate our capabilities to drive growth. We have pockets of excellence around the world and I expect us to drive more consistency globally and achieve a step change in capabilities overall. Our second strategic priority is to leverage our strong cost and financial discipline, to fund growth and improve margins. We have a strong legacy in this area and that's something that we expect to continue going forward. We'll drive ongoing supply chain productivity through our FORCE program. FORCE has generated savings of 3.4 billion over the last decade and we expect significant savings for years to come. We'll also continue to execute the 2018 restructuring program. This is the biggest restructuring in our history and it's making us leaner, stronger and faster. We'll rigorously control discretionary spending to help us sustain our top-tier SG&A cost structure and we'll drive down working capital with benefits from global supply chain initiatives and our improved manufacturing footprint. Our last strategic priority is to allocate capital in value creating ways and is very consistent with how we've operated historically. After we complete our restructuring, we'll target annual capital spending of 4% to 5% of net sales, down from our current target of 4.5% to 5%. We're planning to continue providing shareholders a top-tier dividend. We will evaluate M&A opportunities in a disciplined manner with a bias for tuck-in transactions in existing categories. M&A is not expected to be a significant part of our growth strategy. Finally, we plan to allocate healthy amounts of cash flow to share repurchases. Now, let me turn to our medium term financial objectives that come with K-C Strategy 2022. Our top-line objective is to grow sales and organic sales 1% to 3% annually. That assumes category growth in a range of 1% to 2% similar to recent conditions. Macro headwinds in Latin America, birth rate declines in South Korea and the US and price competition in China diapers, have all impacted category growth in the last few years. We believe these factors are largely cyclical and we'll focus on doing our part to drive these categories, but we also believe it's appropriate not to plan for much improvement right now. Depending on how our categories evolve and the success of our initiatives, we'll work to achieve the upper half of that 1 to 2 target range. On the bottom line our objective is to increase adjusted earnings per share mid single digits annually. We expect to grow operating profit 3% to 5%, on average that implies annual operating margin improvement of 30 basis points to 40 basis points. Our strategy is to increase gross margin somewhat faster and reinvest in advertising and marketing to fuel the top line. Ongoing share repurchases should also benefit EPS growth. In terms of capital efficiency, our objective is to at least maintain our top tier ROIC at its current level. Over the last 15 years, we've nearly doubled ROIC and it's currently more than 26%. We'll continue to be disciplined with our investment strategies, but we won't turn away value creating opportunities with attractive returns that may be below our overall average. Lastly, we're targeting to increase our dividend generally in line with our growth in adjusted earnings per share. Our payout ratio is in the low 60s and our yields about 3.5%. We continue to believe that a strong dividend is an important part of our investment proposition. I believe these medium term financial objectives are appropriate and realistic in the current environment. Longer term, we continue to have significant optimism about the potential of our categories and our business. Our categories are essential for consumers and have significant development opportunities. We have very strong brands that we're investing behind and we're focused on raising our game on key growth capabilities. This morning I've outlined the key components of our medium term strategy. We look forward to sharing more information with you and updating you on our progress as the year progresses. Overall, we're confident in our ability to create shareholder value through successful execution of our strategies. That concludes our prepared remarks and now we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning, guys. Maria Henry : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So on the 2022 strategy changes, it was helpful to hear about the areas you're focused on and how you get there. I'm wondering what sort of the net level of incremental investment to attack the three strategic priorities you mentioned the core D&E and digital marketing and e-commerce. Is this sort of the strategy changes more the way you're structured or execute or should we assume there's an incremental level of investment behind them. And then on the other hand in terms of the cost savings that you mentioned, is there actual incremental cost savings you're announcing today or is this more executing on the prior programs you've announced? Michael Hsu : Hey, Dara. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the first part, I would say, the overall game plan is, we do want to increase our overall investment behind brands, like to drive our advertising up, drive our in-market execution, investments up and also our digital marketing. But I do think that's why we've executed our restructuring. So, but the underlying premise of that restructuring is to create the room and the investment funds that we need to drive our business. Maybe from my perspective the bigger kind of notion of what needs to be different in terms of our going forward, one, I think you get the message, which is a big focus on the consumer and I think we have that opportunity to kind of raise our game in terms of how we approach the consumer and how we serve them. I think what we're trying to accomplish here is maybe emulating what we've done on cost transformation, which is we've been very systematic and put in a really robust management system to drive cost transformation and we're trying to bring the same approach to driving what we're calling commercial discipline, which is how we manage our innovation resources, our sales and marketing resources to drive growth And then on the cost savings question, Maria, do you want to take that one. Maria Henry : Yeah, the cost savings, there was no new news there. It's the continuation of the restructuring program that we have announced and are executing and also that continued execution on our FORCE cost savings program. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. That's helpful. And then on the 2019 outlook, the 350 million in input cost pressures. Can you detail some of the key underlying assumptions there that are embedded for oil and pulp prices? And it looks like A&P spending was up as a percent of sales in Q4 year-over-year. Would you anticipate that in 2019 also is that embedded in the guidance? Thanks. Maria Henry : Sure. I'll take advertising first and then I'll kind of walk you through our commodities outlook. The advertising spend in the fourth quarter of '18 was higher than it was last year fourth quarter, but last year fourth quarter was low. So it was in line with our expectations and the year-over-year really has more to do with the trend that we saw last year. For the full year is relatively flat. Looking at next year, we do intend to fully support our brands and also the innovations that we put out into the market. So we'll see how the numbers shake out, but we will continue to be supportive there. Probably, I don't know if we're giving a specific number for advertising, but it continues to be a core focus of the strategy that Mike outlined. In terms of the commodities outlook that we have, I'll just comment for the fourth quarter you saw that that was one of the drivers that we mentioned on some pressure on the gross margin where commodities were up, fiber in general was flat to up sequentially in the fourth quarter for us, which put some pressure on gross margins. But if I look forward to 2019, I'll pick through a couple of the key commodities : on eucalyptus, we're expecting that to be down mid to high single digit; secondary fiber we're expecting to be up mid-teens; on the other key input costs, we're expecting polypropylene will be down mid-single digits and we're expecting super absorbent will be similar to what we saw in 2018. On crude oil, we're expecting it to be in the 50s, but it'll be down from $66 a barrel this year. But the correlation between crude oil and polypropylene and super absorbent has not proven to be strong in the last couple of years, which is why we see some differences there. In terms of some of our other fiber types, we're expecting those to be up in 2019 also. So 2019 commodities we expect to still be inflationary but not nearly as much as what we saw in 2018. Michael Hsu : Dara, let me just tag on here. I would tell you, although, 2019 we plan to make solid progress, and I think you can see that and kind of the results that we're planning for, we're improving the organic growth and the overall shape of our P&L and so one of the things that we're encouraged about in our Q4 was that we saw the net selling price improvement that gives us confidence about our plans for 2019. We're also making a pretty significant improvement on our key growth prospects in 1% to 4% growth and that's 70 basis points margin expansion, so we're feeling better about that. Obviously, we're not delighted about EPS growth, but we do have those - the currency and tax drags. Dara Mohsenian : Right. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Thanks Dara. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Just first question, the organic sales increase that you're forecasting for '19 of 2%. Can you give us directionally personal care versus consumer tissue, what you expect for each of those segments? Maria Henry : Yeah. We're not going to provide specific guidance by segment for 2019. Wendy Nicholson : Okay. But more pricing I assume in consumer tissue. Is that a fair assumption? Maria Henry : Yes, that is. Wendy Nicholson : Okay. The second question, though, shifting gears just to the comment accelerating growth in D&E markets generally. And, Mike, I appreciate everything you went through in terms of reorganizing the business a little bit thinking about how to reinvest in the business. But if you look out over the next three years maybe, would you say those D&E markets, and I'm thinking a lot about China, but also about a market like Brazil and Mexico. Do you think the profit pool in your diaper and sun care business in those D&E markets is going up? It just seems the level of competition has intensified so much in those markets. I'm just wondering if you think as you accelerate growth whether that's going to mean margins actually contract. Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yeah, Wendy thanks for that question. You know, one, you can tell, you know, we're very bullish on D&E, and I think that is the future - Why that is? I think what specifically your question there. You know, certainly, we're seeing pressure, competitive pressure in China and everybody is aware of that. And so - but our team's doing a great job, they're building a business to a win for the long haul. And that's on a market that the consumers still want to see premiumize, where they're still buying better performing products. And so we do need to work on a profit pool. We do need to continue to focus on our margins in China. Brazil, I think we are seeing improvement. For the quarter, we are up mid-teens, healthy growth in price, healthy growth in volume as well. And I think our team is doing a great job there. And what's really driving that is, they're being very disciplined on price management, cost management. But also a key component of the strategy going forward, this commercial discipline that I'm talking about is the sales execution is driving a big piece of our growth, because our pricing is actually up low double-digits in Brazil this year. And the volume is actually up and that's because of the execution. If I can - if I could just - Wendy Nicholson : Just one question about pricing in Brazil, I'm sorry, is that for the overall business or is that just diapers? Or does that include sun care too? Michael Hsu : Personal Care. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. Okay, fine. Michael Hsu : Yeah. And maybe just back to your original point, which is the options and I think - if I could just say my perspective is informed by kind of almost 30 years in and around this industry and having seen a lot of companies and worked in other companies that do it different ways. I'm really excited about opportunities going forward for a couple of different reasons, you know, first and foremost, the whitespace opportunity you just highlighted in D&E. I mean it's real for us, right? If I say, hey, it's going be 10 billion over this period or 50 billion, both numbers were probably right. There's a lot of growth inherent in our categories because of the low levels of development. So that's one big thing that I see, that's different that I've seen in other companies. The second thing is still even in developed markets in our categories, I really believe there's a lot of opportunities to expand our categories through what I call elevation which is what I mean by that as value added premiumization, right? And the fact that I think we can solve bigger problems or meet certain bigger unmet needs for our consumers in different ways and expand kind of the value that's available in the category and premiumize the category. So that's the second piece. And then I think we are in the third area this digital opportunity. We're approaching the Holy Grail territory of everything a marketer dreamed of. And it creates much more value in our categories because consumers use our products every day, they spend a lot of money on them and they're in these categories for a long, long-time. And so we're really moving fast on getting closer to our consumers and jumping on the digital train. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Michael Hsu : Thanks Wendy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi, guys, so I have three questions. One is, besides that there's almost tradition of a rebase when a new CEO starts. Congrats by the way, Mike. Why is this the right time to give the 2022 outlook, because we've already seen several years of a little bit challenging results. Is there anything you see in the consumer just recently or competition or retailers that really prompted you to say okay, gosh, we need to reset between now and 2022. And then also why is it just a 2022, why not be a long-term guidance as well? Michael Hsu : Okay. Yeah. Ali, I guess saw the rebase term I don't know if my team would feel that way and that - it's a rebase. I do think we're working hard even on our 2019 numbers I think to make the progress we're making both on the organic and the operating profit side. But I will say, these are mid-term targets and we're saying, hey, over the next four years or so and they really reflect what we're seeing in the marketplace and our expectation of market conditions. I definitely believe that our - we've got long - way to long-term growth potential in our categories and definitely believe also that as leaders we play a significant role in driving the category to realize that and that's what the strategies we're talking about in K-C 2022 are all about. However, given some of the uncertainty we're seeing this environment, I don't think it's prudent to go out longer than that four years at this point. So that's kind of why we're steering this direction here. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And that's helpful. Then within that, you know, under the umbrella of prudence or not prudence, you talked about a 30 basis points to 40 basis points on your prepared remarks, average operating margin enhancement over the next three years, four years and higher than that on gross margin. Can you talk a little bit about what the drivers for that are? Are you just keeping commodities flat? Do you have new gross margin improvement buckets? And then if your operating margin is actually improving 30 basis points to 40 basis points over the next few years, the ROIC stays flat. That would suggests that your invested capital turns are getting worse or certainly not improving and sounds like they're getting worse. Is that more CapEx need for innovation? Is that more - less efficient rollout of assets in emerging the markets? I mean what is it that's driving ROIC also? Michael Hsu : Yeah. So maybe, Ali, I'll start and then maybe Maria you could - Maria Henry : Yeah, sure. Michael Hsu : But the - maybe the first part is operating margin improvement, one, obviously, our FORCE program. And maybe a soft year '19, I think people understand because of the commodity, in fact, notwithstanding, we do have plans to continue to raise our game on FORCE and our overall cost savings approach. And then importantly, I think the strategy that we're talking about here K-C 2022, we do intend to premiumize our business and that will drive margin and mix. And then the other thing that you and I have talked about in the past is net revenue management is being much more important part of our strategy going forward. So we're expecting to see a step forward this year with getting list prices but we're also have opportunities to be a little more strategic on price to drive the trial we want or the trade up we want or the mix that we want. And then we have a big opportunity, I would liken it to a FORCE cost savings opportunity in terms of how we think about our trade spending and how we get much more efficient in it. And then maybe the analogy I'll give you is, we've made a lot of improvement in OEE over the years and I think we have that similar opportunity in trade. Maria Henry : Yeah. And then I - we'd like to see the gross margin go a little bit ahead so that we also have some more room for investment in the key areas that keep the flywheel going on the top line growth. And so that kind of algorithm makes sense to us. On ROIC, the big driver there for the next couple of years, Ali, is the investment in the restructuring program. We talked about the fact that we're expecting between $600 million and $700 million of incremental CapEx as we execute that program. And in 2018, we did a great job on the restructuring, a lot of what you saw was on the SG&A side of the house. So 80% of the savings this year were really coming from there and we're kind of getting going in earnest on the supply chain part of that program as we're moving into 2019. So the incremental CapEx will be there on the asset base. From the restructuring, we'll also affect our ability to drive working capital improvements. So while we've got programs to improve working capital in both the areas of inventory and payable. As you can imagine as we're standing up new assets or taking out assets that are currently existing, we expect that we'll have inventory builds around that to make sure that we can deliver on customer expectations without service interruption, while we're moving assets around. So there'll be pressure on both of those things, which is why there's a more muted outlook on ROIC. And at 26.5, if you benchmark us, we're at clearly in a top-tier level and as Mike said in his comments, we aren't going to hesitate to invest in value creating opportunities that come our way even if they're dilutive. Ali Dibadj : Okay. That's helpful. And just my third question will be more of a 2019 tax. I guess, we've been hearing from a lot of retailers trying to skinny down their suppliers, the number of suppliers, including in baby care and really trying to go to one in private label in some instances even. Could you talk a little bit about your shelf space expectations for 2019 at some of the major retailers actually in the U.S. but perhaps even in Europe? Michael Hsu : Yeah, Ali, I think that's a great question. I think maybe what we are seeing that in some pockets and maybe in some of the smaller retailers, but in our plan right now we are planning to grow distribution overall. And so that's a focus for us. And you probably know as well as anybody else is that distribution tends to be one of the largest drivers of share, so that's a big focus area for us, not just in the U.S. but globally Ali Dibadj : Okay. Thanks very much guys. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Ali. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you, good morning. Michael Hsu : Good morning, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : My first question - Good morning, I just had a quick question regarding your medium term organic top line growth target of 1% to 3%. Curious if you guys are expecting that to be a better bounce between pricing and volume than maybe what you're seeing now? Michael Hsu : Yeah, for sure Bonnie and I think and embedded in that is not just list pricing but as I mentioned earlier when I was talking with Ali was net revenue management for us which includes list price, I would call strategic price pack architecture, right. And also the third bucket is trade spend efficiency. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. And then my second question is on promotional spending. And in looking at the track channel data, it looks like you guys have pulled back on promos and few categories I guess in the last few months. So curious if that is, in fact, true. And then if so does this suggest in general terms that you think the promotional environment is becoming more rational or if this is just something more strategic from your and you're making a conscious decision to possibly sacrifice some market share right now in order to support your margins. Michael Hsu : Yes. Great observation and one I would say is yes, you can see in our behavior which is faced with the big inflation we're seeing particularly in North America, we're making the right choices I think to the drive the business in the direction we need to make. And if you recall maybe two years ago, 18 months ago, we were dialing up promotion because of some of the competition. I don't know that I would - write the businesses or the categories being more rationale, but I do think the market is focused on right now or at least has a similar focus as us, which is recovering some of the cost inflation and making sure that our margins are protected. That said, and so specifically if you look hard at North American family care, I mean, pricing overall organic was up 2, price was up 6 and then we had a little bit of volume about of about 4 points and that was planned. And we said I think in the prior call that we're going be down back our promotion activity in the fourth quarter. I will tell you that just as a heads up, we don't give quarterly guidance on organic, but I will tell you there probably is going be some lumpiness in terms of our organic or our price realization, because we got higher price realization in the fourth quarter in North America because of that promotion pullback. And if you'll think about take a look at Q1 in family care, I think we had a 9% volume growth last year in family care because of additional promotion activity, which we'll be scaling back this year. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Michael Hsu : One additional and I'll say Bonnie is that underlying it especially in bath and towels in North America, the underlying base trends are very healthy and head in the right direction behind some of the inflation we're going. Bonnie Herzog : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Maria Henry : Hi, Jason. Jason English : Hey, Maria. Hey, Michael. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. And Happy New Year and congrats on officially taking the reins. A few different questions here and I'll try to bang through them. First, Maria, the FORCE savings I appreciate, why you're expecting so a smaller number this year. Can you give us a sense of the FORCE savings you've achieved in the last year or maybe last two years? How much of it was really sort of structural in nature into the structure reducing the cost base and how much of it was just buying better than the markets? Maria Henry : Yeah, we do provide the specific details of each, but I can tell you that we generated significant value from what we call negotiated material savings, which is the value that we get from basically buying better than the market to use your words. And as I look forward to 2019, that is the portion of the FORCE cost savings that will be lower than it has been in the couple - in the last couple of years. As our contracts reset, we still have value from those contracts, which is positive but the value of the contracts compared to what we had in 2018 is lower. And so that's what's affecting the FORCE number. The other components of our FORCE program all have healthy levels of activities and savings associated with those for 2019. Jason English : And if spot prices were to rollover or weaken from the current levels or your planning assumptions. Is it fair to assume that your FORCE savings will be dragged down with it? Maria Henry : It's - spot prices move lower. What I would tell you is that a portion of our buy we have short term contracts, which help provide stability in our forecast, but we don't have coverage on 100% of our buy. So it will show up in the numbers. It won't necessarily have a big impact on the FORCE cost savings number. Jason English : That's helpful. Thank you. And last question, tissue margins have come in substantially for understandable reasons. I think you've lost over 400 basis points over the last couple of years, but we finished despite 5% price growth this quarter, we finished at the weakest margin level we've seen in a number of years. As we think about medium term, what is the sustainable margin level for that business in your view? Is there a path back to peaks we've seen before or given we've kind of finished on a weak note. Are we still trying to settle in to a lower and more durable margin structure for that business? Maria Henry : Yeah, I'll comment and then Mike feel free to chime in. I'll comment on the tissue margins in the fourth quarter just to emphasize the point from the remarks that not only did we see inflation and I kind of talked about which of the commodities we saw inflation in the fourth quarter, but the execution challenges that we had in the fourth quarter, which led to lower FORCE cost savings. One of the biggest areas that was affected by that was North America tissue and there what happened is the mix of the orders that came in at a brand pack level was different than what we expected. And so we didn't necessarily have the right products in the right places to get an efficient distribution to meet the customer demands that we had higher logistics costs as we had a lot of inter milling shipments in the Consumer Tissue business and we also lost the opportunity on the productivity side on manufacturing as we are running product on some assets that aren't optimized for necessarily for those products. So the Consumer Tissue business particularly in North America had some additional expenses in the fourth quarter and that really weighted down on the margins. Mike, you want to talk about longer-term how we see tissue. Michael Hsu : Yeah, just a comment on the fourth quarter Jason, I work closely with that team in North America family care for a long time and they're a great team. And the trick of that business is, and I said it's like driving an 18 wheeler that needs a turn like a Ferrari, right? So it's a big business and I think what happened is that we got a little out of sync in terms of where our inventory was and where it needed to be for customers and that added some additional cost, and then we had some equipment issues. So I think I'm confident that team is going to get it back and may take a quarter or two to kind of get back on that right path. But we'll address the operational issues. We've always said overall on tissue, we want these margins we expect to be in the mid to high teens. We're still kind of on the Harris edge [ph] of that - that number right now, but I think we will make progress because, one, we will get back some of these operational issues. The team is very focused on price realization. And, again, the strategy is to elevate these categories and that kind of means premiumize through value added innovation and that's where our focus is Jason English : Got it, very helpful, thank you guys. Maria Henry : Thanks Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Hey, good morning. So I just want to try to unpack next year's guidance a little bit more if I could and maybe tie back Mike to the 2022 objectives, because the forecast calls for net sales to be down 1 to 2, profits to be up 1 to 4, despite inflation and the FX headwinds, which I think Maria you cited as a 20% headwind in the profits. And to just understand the cost savings you have lined up, which basically looked poised to offset the base commodity inflation and some translation effects, just seems as I'm doing the math that the forecast is dependent a good deal if not entirely on net price realization and it really doesn't seem to allow for a lot of reinvestment behind those early strategy 2022 initiatives like e-commerce and marketing and end market investments. And I guess I'm just trying to just test is that fair. I know you cited a plan to invest in digital marketing next year and I get that and I view that positively, but do you have room to net invest in overall marketing next year and also make this right you need to an e-commerce and changing structure in markets like China just the math just feels tight and I just want some perspective on that. Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yeah, Steve it's - definitely pricing is a key component of our plan for 2019 and a critical plan maker for us, but however we also do have. Investment up in terms of our advertising A&CP mix and also importantly we're shifting more to digital which is more productive for us, so we got all those elements on it and Maria is there anything you want to add to that? Maria Henry : Yeah I think the - and if you just think the puts and takes on the out - the outlook for next year we've got currency up as a headwind, we have input cost inflation, we're expecting to get strong pricing against the two of those, so if you look at the full year 2018 for the combination of currency commodity price that was a mid 20's drag on operating profit. With the pricing that we're putting in place for next year, we'd expect that to be - have very strong coverage. So maybe the combination of that looks more like more singles on operating profit and then we have the benefit of the restructuring saving coming into the P&L. We've got the FORCE cost savings coming into the P&L and when you kind of put all that together that's how we get to our change in operating profit. Stephen Powers : Okay, okay. So I guess within that then what - it sounds like you don't see much risk, but I guess you know how do you handicap the risk of the pricing pull through that you're expecting - you're just not coming through just given the competitive backdrop. And then if I can tack on one more question then I'll pass it on, but focusing in on China. Mike, I know you stated that you like what the team is doing in terms of positioning the business for the future, but if you took a snapshot today you're clearly losing some ground just given what you reports versus what P&G reports today. So I guess what's the plan there or the building blocks of the plan and what should we be thinking about in terms of the cost and time to achieve future success? Thanks. Michael Hsu : Okay. Yeah, thanks. Thanks Steve. Yeah, let me just go back to your first one on the pricing. We are feeling good about our price plans and I think the Q4 was an indicator that kind of we're on the right track right now and we have pretty significant plans throughout 19', most of them have been announced and worked through with customers and so that's one part. Second is, generally I would say the market is responding in a similar fashion not everybody yet, but we're seeing the market move broadly. So I think we do have confidence in terms of the pricing. The second part China, one is, I guess I'll highlight, performance overall for the quarter and it was - I think we mentioned it, similar Q3. You're right, it continues to be a very, very competitive market and we're not satisfied with our performance, but the team is building for the long-term. And really I will tell you that the area where we're losing run a little bit is in the lower tiers our tier 3. You know where we are actually growing is on our tier 5 and tier 6, where we have launched really, really good and important innovation that really focuses on premiumization of the category and I think we're having good consumer response to it. It's growing, the tier 5 year, tier 4 - 6 share. Although, I would tell you that the response is probably a bit muted because of all the price activity that's in the marketplace, but we feel great about that. And the plan for this year is, we are rolling that technology out more broadly across our line and across various channels throughout China and so that's our focus. And really the strategy is, it's a market that really want to premiumize, consumers are trading up and the reason we're seeing price competition is I believe it's more driven by the manufacturers pulling the price down and so we're still seeing the consumer movement in that direction and that's our focus. Stephen Powers : Okay, thank you. Michael Hsu : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Thanks, I just want to go back to FORCE given, the savings came in and sort of your expectation and that was the case last quarter too, so last quarter you talked about some of the pulp pricing arrangements that you had in fiscal 18' that won't repeat. So could you talk about what's the delta there fiscal 19' versus fiscal 18'? And then relative to your expectations, where the specific buckets for FORCE fell short beyond the pulp dynamic. And then I have [indiscernible]. And then. Back. Maria Henry : Okay the - so a couple of things in there on - first on the delta, as you can picture kind of how this works. If you think about where we were coming into 2018 and where everyone thought commodities would go that was the negotiating environment as we entered into 2018 and then you fast forward to as they have contracts come up at the end of the year and we're negotiating as we go into 2019, we're in a very different environment. So the 2018 contracts that we had negotiated had significant value to us given how much commodities rose and the steepness of the curve. When you look at where we are going into 19', when we clearly pretend to be able to call the market, the intuition would say that we've got to be at a pretty high point in terms of commodity prices and so it's a different environment as they've contracts reset. So the value of the contract is lower for us in 19' than it was in 18'. We're not going to provide specific amounts, but that affects that negotiated material price portion of our FORCE cost savings which is why 2019 will be lower than what it's been in the last couple of couple of years. For what we saw in 2018 in the fourth quarter with FORCE being lower it was not on negotiated material prices, it was more on the operating components of FORCE and in particular it was on the area of productivity and the area of logistics. So with all of the intermingling shipments I talked about in the North America tissue business that's what drove the lower real life savings in the fourth quarter. Olivia Tong : Got it and are you back to normal levels there at this point? Maria Henry : We are not, we are on it. I'll take a controllable issue over an uncontrollable issue any day and the issues that we had in the fourth quarter are controllable issues. So we are very confident in our supply chain capabilities and in our opportunities. The teams are on the challenges that we saw, they're working through them. We will we will get those resolved, they won't necessarily get resolved immediately or within the first quarter, but they absolutely will get resolved. Olivia Tong : Got it, okay and then for fiscal 19' just by segment you talked to some of the issues in consumer tissue which makes sense, but are you expecting margin expansion in each of the divisions in fiscal 19'? Michael Hsu : Olivia, could you repeat, it was cutting in and out so I could hear the second part of your question? Olivia Tong : Sorry, just what I was asking is - on margin expectations you obviously talked about the total company, but by segment Consumer Tissue, Personal Care and Professional, are you expecting margin expansion in all of those in each division for fiscal 19'? Michael Hsu : Yeah, Olivia, I'll remind you, we don't give guidance at the segment level, but you can imagine given the overall company targets that we've talked about all three segments have margin improvement from center for further objectives for next year. Olivia Tong : Got it, thank you. Maria Henry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to go back to earlier someone had mentioned that in the same math that sort of the outlook medium term let alone 19' doesn't imply tremendous incremental reinvestment in the business which Mike you pretty specifically also talked about. What I was curious about though is where you stand on the capability building. So analytics, what exists in house today in terms of getting going on this greater trust on revenue realization or the highly targeted one-to-one marketing e-commerce. There's a - these things sound great, but it does sound like it costs money and requires different skill sets than may be available to you in house today. So if you could just comment on where you are on being able to execute versus having the aspiration of these big things that kind of enhance the model going forward. Michael Hsu : Yeah Lauren, great question. One, I will tell you just to be clear, we're just standing up initiatives in all these areas now, however, the basis of why we have defined these as critical ones for us, I mean I think you get the consumer opportunity and why we need to do it. I think the reason why we stand them up this way is because we've made progress in different areas and you know historically we have been a bit more decentralized as an operating model and that served us well is enable us to be very nimble, but what happens is when you do that as you end up developing pockets of excellence. And so what I will tell you, in North America we're a little ahead I think on the revenue management side. We've six sigma like tools that we've been developing over the past year or so on trade efficiency, on price pack and we've got some other tools that we're developing in other markets, but I think the big opportunity for us is to standardize and roll them out more consistently across markets, so that's one big area. I think the other - in a similar way is this digital and we've got really, really good pockets of excellence and that's in the markets that you really want them in which is the big e-commerce markets like China, South Korea and the US. And just to give you an example, I think our China team - I think we've multiplied our marketing ROIs, we've gone to a fully digital spend in feminine care and mostly digital spend in baby care in China. The ROIs are a multiple of what our traditional ROIs are. One of the key drivers of that is that we've got what I think Paul would say dynamic content creation, which means we are putting out new content every day. And the China team I was with earlier last year and they were saying, well back in the old days in e-commerce the saying was you had to be 996 which meant you work 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. And they said well, now it's the 007 right, midnight to midnight, 7 days a week and they said that's never been more exciting and I think \u2013and that's because they're really seeing value in what they're doing and that's driving the business. We're doing similar things in the US and I was talking to one of our e-commerce managers the other day and they're running through AI generated content creation a 100 and some odd campaigns a day, right. It's very, very specifically targeted against very specific segments. So I think we're really moving, moving really fast and we're excited about that, but I think the opportunity and through this process-process to level up around the world and bring all those capabilities to the same level. Maria Henry : Yeah and I comment more into - I just put some context that when we were contemplating our restructuring program back in 2017 and looking at ways to create value in our business, we had two things that we saw. We saw the opportunity to structurally lower the cost of our business, but importantly the need to do that so that we would have the investment room to invest in capabilities to unlock the opportunities that we saw for growth. So as we put that restructuring program together, we had both of those things in mind. You didn't necessarily see everything play out that way in 2018 given that we had the unexpected run on commodities and also currencies going against us, which put some pressure on the numbers, but moving forward especially as Mike's coming in and outlining the detailed strategies. The point of that restructuring program was to shift costs from less useful places and put it to more useful places and a big part of that was around finding the capabilities that we need to unlock the opportunities that we have. Lauren Lieberman : Okay and if I could just ask one more question on revenue realization because I think revenue realization has been something that - that's been talked about for a decade probably at K-C, but in this sort of next iteration, one thing I'm wondering about is, how this relates to the competition right? It's sort of one thing to say we want to look within our portfolio and see whether the opportunity to be more strategic, but obviously the categories in which you compete particularly in the developed markets where there's perhaps less of a market growth opportunity and even arguably like in a China today with the declining birth rates and so on. Revenue realization also - the interplay is what's the competition doing, right. So how is that factoring into your thought process that pursuing greater revenue realization is maybe all that realistic that being more productive with your trade is something that's entirely within your control. Michael Hsu : Yeah, definitely a true statement Lauren, which is - especially if you're talking about list price changes, right, a lot of that depends on the retail environment and what competition is doing and we recognize that. I do think in terms of pack - price pack architecture or thinking about how we set pricing, we rather call waterfall pricing more effectively I think is a little bit more within our control and certainly well, trade spending there's competitive constraints there as well, but the thing about it is, it's like lean six sigma. There's a huge range of variation in how we spend our funds event-to-event and there's a big opportunity for us to get better. And it's just like running any asset in a mill perhaps even more complex because the reason why there continues to be opportunity and companies - I have been working on trade efficiency for 20 years now and I've done it in a lot of places and the reason why the opportunity continues to exist is it always will exist because our business is really spread out meaning anytime you're spending billions of dollars through tens of thousands of people who sell to hundreds of thousands of people it's complex and because of that complexity things are not optimal - tough to optimize in that complexity. And so we're talking about here is taking the next step and bringing systems and process and metrics and measures to drive more efficiency here. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, alright, great. Thank you so much. Michael Hsu : Thanks Lauren. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, so - just for squeezing me in. So the first question is on the progression of the pricing initiatives. From the last calls you were planning to increase prices for Scott in Kleenex in the first quarter and second quarter of respectively. Are you still keeping this plan and if so what has been the reception and is that being accompanied by increase of promotions and compounding, which explain how conservative you've been with the 2019 guidance? And my second question is, you've got into FORCE back in turn 18' established a total target of 1.5 billion in four years starting in 2018. So it sounds like you aren't taking that target down based on your comment to Ali and just in the short-term and to your answer to Jason and Olivia, so what do you think should drive acceleration for 2020 and 2021. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Yeah Andrew, so I'll start with the pricing one and maybe Maria will come back on the FORCE. Yeah, I think the pricing in North America I think your questions relates to family cares is on track and I think the plans that we have are largely in place right now. Again, some of the impact that you saw in fourth quarter was related to desheeting we've done in bath tissue maybe in the, I think in the middle of 2018 and also from - a little inflated because of merchandising pullback. I'll remind you, most of our list price changes are going in the first quarter or right now by through the end of the first quarter of this year. So that still will come through and right now we have positive vacations [ph] and most customers are aware and where our plans are working there. Maria Henry : Yeah and on the FORCE target, we did not change the $1.5 billion target that we have. We're still working against that target. In terms of where the savings come from, we would expect that - the savings come from all of the four categories that make up our FORCE program. Negotiate a material price beyond next year should continue to be a factor for us, the productivity in our manufacturing operations as we continue to drive out waste the way that we engineer our product to cost optimize them and then overall costs across the supply chain system including logistics are all areas where we see opportunities. And it's a reminder we've got a global supply chain organization that has been running a very comprehensive program now for a couple of years that we built up our capabilities and we continue to see opportunities there that we believe we've got the capabilities to deliver upon in the next few years. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Michael Hsu : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yeah, thanks a lot for squeezing me in. Just two quick questions Mike, you indicated M&A is not going to be a big part of, at least your vision right now, just curious what that means for Kimberly would they ever be interested in you know getting into new pillar of growth, a new category just want some more perspective around that if you can provide any context? Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yeah, thanks Nick. One, I'll say hey, overall I like our portfolio on three business segments that we operate in. They're large, essential and profitable categories and as we said in the past, we believe there's very strong synergies in how we buy, make, sell and ship and so better together. That said, we will pursue opportunities to improve our portfolio and right now rather than maybe new categories, maybe the focus for me would be in opportunities that might enhance or leverage our geographic scale in a market, a new technology capability or a new commercial capability that's going to accelerate us either in revenue management perhaps or this digital world that we're talking about and then up - and then last it might be to reduce exposure to unattractive markets that were markets that we might be attractive right or perhaps volatility to them, so that's kind of how we're thinking about it right now. Nik Modi : Great, thanks a lot. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Nik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Hey thanks, good morning everyone. Michael Hsu : Good morning. Kevin Grundy : First, a quick one Maria, just on the tax rate, what's driving the acceleration in fiscal 19' and then a little bit of a broader question just to come back to the quarter and sort of understand some of the moving parts here and potential implications on the outlook for fiscal 19'. So we talked - I'm not asking to revisit the Consumer Tissue issue, we spoke a lot about that and some of the shortfall on FORCE savings, but I think I'm kind of sitting here looking at the 3% pricing in the quarter relatively strong or sales relatively consensus yet significant gross margin miss relative to where the street was and while we spoke a lot about Consumer Tissue, Personal Care margins also down about 200 basis points year-over-year. So anything else that you can sort of fill in here to help us better understand some of the moving parts in the quarter and some of the margin shortfall, anything else you'd highlight besides that tissue business in North America and the FORCE saving, just want to make sure I have my head around this and how much of this is going to linger into the first half of the year? Thank you. Maria Henry : Sure. On the tax rate the tax guidance that we gave for next year is not only for next year, but it's kind of what we see is our tax rate in the environment as it is. What I would call out is that in 2018 we had some favorability on the tax rate from some settlements and from some tax planning opportunities that we had just as the US tax reform all settled out but we accrued some benefits better than what we were expecting in 2018. To get to our tax rate if you think about at a normal level of 23% to 26, about two thirds of our statutory incomes in the US and there we've got the 21% rate. Outside of the US combined, our tax rate is in the upper 20's and then we've got a couple of points coming from state taxes and if you run all that math you'd get a normalized tax rate in the guidance range that we provided. In terms of the fourth quarter from our expectations, I'll make a on a couple of comments and Mike chime in. First is our expectation, the challenge that we had was on the gross margin level and we've certainly talked about the issues related to the execution in the FORCE number, but also I'd comment that commodity inflation was strong in the fourth quarter and up sequentially. So there was additional pressure on commodities versus what we were expecting in the fourth quarter. Michael Hsu : Yeah, maybe and maybe the important thing I think about the fourth quarter Kevin is, one is I think broadly speaking across most markets with one or two notable exceptions, I think the businesses is improving and getting healthier and importantly the consumer has proven to be very, very resilient. So in North America organic was up 3 in the quarter, you can see that, but personal care up mid single digits and our infant child care business low double digit - mid single digits as well and for child care being up the double digits. We got double digit growth broadly across D&E markets, Brazil, CEE, ASEAN, India were all up double digits and up in share in most of those markets. So I think we are seeing broad improvement and I think that gives us some confidence in our 2019 outlook. Kevin Grundy : Okay, thank you very much, good luck. Michael Hsu : Thank you. Maria Henry : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi Mike, congrats on the - on your on your new post. Question for you [ph], wanted to see if you could speak a little bit more about your 2019 gross margin outlook, particularly how should we think about the timing of the year maybe midyear for a commodity being favorable to you guys that would be helpful and then what are your preliminary impressions on trade expense for the year. Maria Henry : Sure. A couple comments, when I was talking earlier about what we're expecting on 2019 inflation I didn't mention distribution and distribution will be inflationary next year to the tune of double digits. I think North America carrier rates are expected to be up around 10% and in the spot market will be even much higher than that as we as we go into 2019. And then in terms of how things flow, I think we indicated that we're expecting stronger performance in the second half versus the first half as a number of factors play out. One, would be and expectation on commodity inflation, but even more so on - at the phasing of our pricing coming into the market and therefore into our P&L. There's a couple of areas on commodities where in the in the last month or so we've seen indications that some of the pressure will come off as the demand in China softens and there's some indication potentially of some inventory over there as well that as things work through in the first quarter we would expect some relief in a couple of areas versus where we were in the back half of the of the fourth quarter particularly in the area of fiber. Paul, if you have to say anything else just in terms of the phasing on commodities for next year. Paul Alexander : No, I think that that's about right Maria. I think we're hopeful overall, but the headwinds are less significant in the second half, but we'll give you an update as we do every quarter. Steve Strycula : Okay, great, so would you say then holistically for the year that would be safe to say the gross margin should be net positive for the year given by the back half of strength relative to the front half? Maria Henry : What I'd say is we're expecting margin improvement in the 2019 plan and if you think about the pieces that I described particularly on pricing and secondarily on commodities that you would expect strength as that pricing comes into the market because given the 20% impact on margins that we're expecting on OPs from currency and commodity, the offset to that is price. So the margin improvement will be clearly affected by the timing of that pricing coming into the market. Steve Strycula : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much. Two questions, within North America what have you been so successful recently in Pull-Ups, GoodNites and Depends versus diapers? Is there some matter just to focus there, brand quality or maybe structurally different dynamics? And secondly, the US drug channel has been an issue for some CPG companies we've seen both in the lower store traffic that's already happened and maybe looking forward to whatever the ultimate adoption of delivering online will bring. Is that an issue for you and how do you win in that channel specifically? Thank you. Michael Hsu : Yeah, let me start maybe with the first part. I think on Pull-Ups, it's the fundamentals which is age with one [ph]. We're back on our big kid messaging which has worked for us over a long time and we tend to get I think more with - tired of it before the consumer gets tired of it and I think the focus there needs to be about bringing consumers into the category and showing them the benefits of what a training pant can do. So big focus on the big kid messaging and then also innovation and obviously innovation matters this category, we feel like we have our best ever Pull-Ups, obviously every year we should have our best ever Pull-Ups and we feel great about the product right now and that's what's driving the double digit growth in pants - in Pull-Ups and also GoodNites, which is even growing faster than Pull-Ups. So we feel great about that. I think - and then if you light it back or compare it to diapers, again elevate the category is the strategy and that's why it's an important strategy, which is what our opportunity to do is bring that same level of innovation and value added innovation to premiumize the diaper category and we're doing that in 2019. Too early for me to share with you the specifics, but we feel good about some of the news we have coming into the market place. Maria Henry : And then drug channel? Michael Hsu : Drug, yeah, I would say there is a little softness there and we're kind of working through that. We have great relationships with our drug customers and very, very good and I just saw some good news this past week on some of the things we're doing there. But again I think - overall I think you continue to have the challenges across channels in the US that you guys would expect, large format, small format, e-commerce and we're working through that. Jonathan Feeney : Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Thank you. Operator : At this time, we have no other questions in the queue. Paul Alexander : Alright, great. We appreciate all the questions today and we'll wrap up with a couple of closing thoughts from Mike. Michael Hsu : Yeah, thank you for turning in and your support of Kimberly-Clark. We're going to make solid progress in 2019 and we're going to accelerate our growth while maintaining our strong financial discipline as we develop our K-C Strategy 2022. So thank you very much. Paul Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines, and thank you for joining us today.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here\u2019s the agenda for our call. Maria will start with a review of first quarter results. After that, Mike will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full year. We'll finish as usual with Q&A. We have a presentation of today\u2019s materials in the Investors section of our Web site. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Finally, we'll be referring to adjusted results and outlook; both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn the call over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 3% driven by higher net selling prices. Adjusted operating profit and earnings per share were down low-single digits year-on-year. That said, we made solid progress with our margins compared to full year 2018 performance. Additionally, we\u2019re on track with our overall capital plan and we continue to return cash to shareholders. Now let\u2019s cover the details of our results starting with sales. Our first quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That\u2019s down 2% year-on-year with a 5 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales were up 3% which is a good start relative to our full-year target for 2% growth. Net selling prices increased 4% and product mix improved 1% while volumes fell 2%. Mike will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes. Moving on to profitability. First quarter adjusted gross margin was 33.5%, down 30 basis points year-on-year. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.4%, even with the year ago. I\u2019m encouraged that gross and operating margins were up 30 and 40 basis points, respectively, compared to full year 2018 levels. Commodities were a year-on-year drag of $135 million in the quarter. While that is still a meaningful amount, I was pleased to see market prices in North America for pulp, recycled fiber, and polymer fall a bit sequentially. Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit by a low double-digit rate. Our focus on achieving higher net selling prices offset much of the commodity and currency headwinds we faced in the quarter. We also generated solid cost savings of $115 million. That includes $55 million of FORCE savings which was consistent with our plan, and $60 million of restructuring savings. On that, we continue to make good progress with our restructuring program. So far this year, we\u2019ve announced the planned closure of two personal care facilities outside North America. We\u2019ve now announced 6 of the approximate 10 facilities that we intend to close or sell. Advertising spending was up in the quarter as we continue to support our brand. Even with that investment, total between-the-line spending was down 50 basis points to 16% of sales. The reduction was driven by our restructuring savings. Compared to the first quarter, I expect between-the-lines spending as a percent of sales to move up a bit for the full year. So all-in-all, adjusted operating profit was down 2%. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.66, down 3% year-on-year. That included an approximate 2% drag from a higher tax rate essentially offset by a lower share count. Let\u2019s turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the quarter was $317 million compared to $542 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was generally in line with our expectations and driven by higher working capital and restructuring payments. Capital spending was $316 million in the quarter. As expected, that\u2019s up from $189 million in the year-ago period and is driven by supply chain restructuring projects. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. First quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled $510 million, and we continue to expect the full year amount will be between $2 billion and $2.3 billion. Turning to our segments. In Personal Care, organic sales were up 5%. Net selling prices increased 2%, and volumes and product mix were each up more than a point. Personal Care operating margins were 21.3%, up 90 basis points year-on-year. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth and cost savings. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were even with the year-ago period. Net selling prices increased 6% which was offset by lower volume. Consumer Tissue operating margins of 15.8% were even year-on-year. In K-C Professional, organic sales grew 3%. Selling prices rose 3% while a 1-point improvement in mix was offset by lower volumes. K-C Professional operating margins of 18.4% were down 60 basis points. Results were impacted by commodity inflation and currency headwinds, partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings. So all-in-all, we\u2019re off to a solid start relative to our full year plan, and I\u2019m encouraged by our progress. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike for his perspective on our results and outlook. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus my comments on organic sales and our full year outlook and let me start by saying I\u2019m encouraged by our first quarter results. We\u2019re making strong progress realizing higher selling prices. We\u2019re launching innovations, investing in our brands and pursuing our growth priorities and we\u2019re leveraging our strong financial discipline. As Maria just mentioned, we grew organic sales 3% in the first quarter which is a good start to the year. Overall, our pricing initiatives are on track and to date the impact on our volumes has been reasonable. Let me share some of the top line highlights for the quarter, starting with developed markets. Organic sales increased 1% in North American consumer products. In North American Personal Care, organic sales grew 3%. Volumes increased high-single digits in adult care with benefits from innovations, increased brand investment, and category growth. Volumes were up low-single digits across our baby and child care portfolio. In the first quarter, we increased selling prices on Pull-Ups training pants and premium Huggies diapers. Looking ahead, we have innovation on Poise pads coming this quarter and premium innovation on Huggies diapers that are going to hit the market this summer. In North American Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2% compared to a 5% increase last year that was driven by strong promotion activity. Net selling prices rose 7%. Our pricing plans are overall on track. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the impact on our volumes and competitive activity, but we remain focused and confident on realizing the benefits of the price increases. In North American K-C Professional, organic sales increased 1% driven by solid price realization. Turning to developed markets outside North America, organic sales were up 1%. In South Korea, while our diaper business continues to be impacted by a lower birth rate, our other businesses are growing and offsetting that diaper category\u2019s softness. We also had solid performance in Western and Central Europe in K-C Professional. In developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 7% overall and that included nearly 3 points of growth from Argentina, which is consistent with our 2019 plan. In terms of our key Personal Care businesses, in Brazil, organic sales rose about 15% compared to a mid-single-digit increase in the base period. Growth was driven by higher selling prices while category volume remained sluggish. In China, organic sales were down high-single digits. Huggies diapers continues to be impacted by competitor price reductions that started last year. Nonetheless, volumes on our premium-tier Huggies were up driven by strong product innovation. In feminine care, we continue to grow at double-digit rates driven by our innovation, trade-up strategies and supported by strong digital marketing. In ASEAN, organic sales rose about 10% with the strength on Huggies diapers in Vietnam. We\u2019re rolling out improved Huggies in most ASEAN markets this year. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased about 20% with volumes and selling prices both up nicely. Our momentum in this region reflects the combination of excellent sales execution, winning product innovation backed by great marketing. We\u2019re launching further innovations on Huggies and Kotex this year. While diapers remain our biggest business in D&E, I\u2019m pleased that in the first quarter we grew organic sales double digits in fem care, adult care and baby wipes. These businesses have strong growth opportunity and we\u2019re making progress. Now in terms of digital marketing, we\u2019re using digital on many of our brands to help us build one-to-one consumer relationships. Digital is improving our marketing ROI and helping us grow in markets like fem care in China and South Korea, diapers in Vietnam and adult care in North America. To summarize our top line, I\u2019m optimistic about our start to the year. We have more work to do and we continue to operate in a competitive environment. However, that said, I\u2019m encouraged with our progress thus far. Now moving beyond sales, I\u2019ll just build briefly on Maria\u2019s comments about margins. While we need to make more progress, I\u2019m encouraged that first quarter performance was above our full year 2018 levels. Turning to the outlook. As we mentioned in this morning\u2019s new release, we\u2019re confirming our previous outlook for 2019 which calls for 2% organic sales growth and adjusted earnings per share of $6.50 to $6.70. We\u2019re also maintaining the key planning assumptions we outlined in January. Our first quarter results has improved our earnings profile somewhat compared to our initial view of the year. That said, we still believe it\u2019s more likely the earnings are going to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Our teams have a lot to execute over the next nine months and we\u2019re going to continue to closely watch the overall environment. While we work to achieve our 2019 targets, we\u2019ll continue to pursue the longer-term balanced and sustainable growth opportunities that are all part of our K-C Strategy 2022. So in summary, we\u2019re off to a solid start for the year, we\u2019re confirming our full year outlook and we\u2019re confident in our ability to create shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks. And now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Michael Hsu : Hi, Jason. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is actually Cody [ph] on for Jason today. How are you guys? Michael Hsu : Hi, Cody. Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Can you provide us an update on your commodity outlook? Previously you stated 300 million to 400 million of inflation. Does that still hold? And can you also provide details by each commodity like you did last quarter? Maria Henry : Sure. Cody, it\u2019s Maria. On commodities, we had $135 million of headwinds in the quarter driven by pulp and other materials. That was slightly better than our expectations for the quarter with some relief on resin-based materials and recycled fibers. Distribution also remains inflationary in the quarter. We are holding our outlook at this point to $300 million to $400 million of inflation for the year. It\u2019s early in the year. We\u2019re just through the first quarter and while we\u2019re encouraged by the North America market prices that have started to come down sequentially in areas like polymer, resin, eucalyptus, and recycled, it remains volatile and we\u2019ll have to see how this plays out. And as we think about the P&L impact of the commodity changes, we have to think about commodity inflation in relationship to price when we look at the P&L holistically. If I cover them kind of piece by piece, if we look at fiber with eucalyptus, it was down 1% year-on-year and down 4% sequentially. And we\u2019re maintaining our outlook on eucalyptus for the year of 11.25 to 11.75 per metric ton for the full year average. On NBSK, we were up low teens year-on-year and we were down low-single digits sequentially. And when I\u2019m quoting these, I\u2019m quoting the market prices in North America for these commodities. And then on fluff, we were up or the market was up high-single digits year-on-year and down low-single digits sequentially. And on recycled fiber, those prices remained elevated. North America market was up more than 20%. However, it has fallen sequentially. It was down about 10% on recycled. In terms of the oil-based commodities that we have on polymer, the first quarter average price was down mid-teens versus a year ago. We\u2019re expecting a modest increase in price in the back half of the year for polymer, so we\u2019ll have to see what happens there. On super absorbent, we were or the market was up high-single digits versus year ago and relatively flat on a sequential basis. And finally, I\u2019ll point out that outside of North America, inflation continues to run at moderate levels particularly coming out of Latin America. So, we\u2019re seeing some easing for the North America market prices. We still got inflation when you look at it outside of U.S. It\u2019s a very long answer. Hopefully that covers all the details you were looking for on what we think about what the markets are doing. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. If I can sneak in one more question related to your commodity costs. Your initial FY '19 outlook assumed 400 million to 450 million cost savings with about 300 million to 325 million in FORCE. Does that still hold today? I assume it does based on your reiterated outlook. But if inflation proves to be less onerous than you initially thought, how should we think about your potential savings for FY '19 as the year progresses? Do you still expect to deliver at least 400 million in savings? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on. Maria Henry : Yes, we do expect to continue to hold \u2013 to continue to deliver savings and we are holding our estimate in terms of the savings outlook for the year. I think that as you watch commodities and commodity inflation, the three to watch together are what\u2019s happening with currencies, commodities, and price when you think about the P&L, but the cost savings estimate remains unchanged. Unidentified Analyst : And I just want to make sure that\u2019s unchanged even if commodities do roll over in greater force than we thought. Maria Henry : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you very much. Maria Henry : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk to something, actually a little bit bigger picture was around innovation and news flow in the Personal Care categories, particularly in the U.S. I know Mike you mentioned that you\u2019ve got innovation coming on Poise this quarter and something on Huggies over this summer. But I was just \u2013 I feel like the pace of activity in these categories has dramatically stepped up both from largest competitor, from Procter, but even from retailers and also all the upstart brands that seem to be gaining some traction. So could you just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about the right level of news flow and activity, your interest in kind of smaller brands in sort of natural organic, and any detail that you can offer on the Huggies innovation this summer would really be helpful? Thanks. Michael Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Lauren. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the last one. I probably \u2013 I\u2019m not ready to share details on the launch this year. I will tell you it\u2019s a premium Huggies diaper and that\u2019s kind of the general space, and it\u2019s consistent with our overall strategy in Personal Care overall but especially in diapers which is we think there are opportunities for us to deliver improved benefits, especially on the dimensions of comfort, fit, protection, and all the things that you would expect. I think in terms of \u2013 the overall strategy really does highlight the need for more impactful innovation and we are ramping up our efforts. And I know we just kicked off our K-C Strategy 2022 approach with our team earlier this last quarter, rolled that out with our top executives, and then we\u2019re now deploying regional teams and cross-functional teams around the world to kind of get after it. I would tell you though that while we\u2019re just launching it now, we\u2019ve been kind of working it for probably the past year or so, and so some of the things that you\u2019re seeing in market like some of the product launches or the launch we\u2019re talking about in North America this summer are a product of some of the teams working over the past year to accelerate some of this opportunity. So overall, a big opportunity on innovation. I think with your question on natural and organic, it is \u2013 I\u2019d say North America right now it\u2019s still probably a niche opportunity or a smaller one to two, three share type opportunity and something that we\u2019re going to continue to look at. I think the question around small brands and big markets like North America is a really relevant question because we still keep tabs \u2013 Maria and I still keep tabs on the food side and we know what some of the smaller brands have done there. And so I think for us there is a question about whether there\u2019s an opportunity for us there and there may be. But we\u2019re not ready to share details on that yet. We are doing a pretty good job on pursuing natural organic in our Korean business which that\u2019s a market where I think is one of the most sensitive about chemicals and contaminants of any market in the world and we\u2019ve gotten a number of brands and they\u2019re doing very, very well and more than just a couple share points. Lauren Lieberman : Mike, is there a reason why you wouldn\u2019t have already done a sort of lift and shift them with some of the things you\u2019re pointing out with Korea, South Korea having long been a lead market for you guys in terms of innovation, in terms of market share to move quicker with taking kind of what\u2019s working there with a very, very discerning group of consumers and moving quicker to bring it to other markets to bring it to the U.S., for example? Michael Hsu : Yes, great question. Definitely and I think that\u2019s the focus going forward was \u2013 I like your term faster lift and shift or we\u2019ll say adopt and apply, but that\u2019s part of it. And I think you will see some of that natural product flow into the U.S. perhaps in fem care later this \u2013 at some point. And then also I think this diaper that we \u2013 that I talked about that\u2019s coming out this summer in North America really is a joint Asia-Pac North America development and a feature kind of the new way we\u2019re trying to work which is more collaboratively around the world. Lauren Lieberman : Have you started to sell that into retail yet, because also it\u2019s funny to see, right, there\u2019s news flow from Target, there\u2019s Walmart with Hello Bello, right. There\u2019s just \u2013 the retailer \u2013 even Target today with not so much in diapers but I think it went into paper products, this new product launch that they\u2019ve announced today. They seem to be charting their own course in what may well be a niche opportunity, maybe it\u2019s big but just curious of those conversations, how much they want to sort of go their own way versus opening up shelf space for you guys to be bringing some of this news flow in maybe a little bit again behind where they\u2019ve been themselves? Michael Hsu : Yes, so on your first point we haven\u2019t started selling this product in yet with customers which is why I\u2019m not sharing that many details on it right now. I will tell you though we do have the collaborative discussions with most of our major retailers or all of our major retailers and they\u2019re still very receptive to big brands and big innovation. They are pursuing some other opportunities. But I think we\u2019ll work with them as partners kind of leading these categories. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. I\u2019ll pass it on and come back if I\u2019ve got the time. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Michael Hsu : Hi, Nik. Operator : One second, it looks like his line dropped. Give me just a moment. Nik Modi : Hello. Operator : All right. Nik, you\u2019re line\u2019s open. Michael Hsu : Hi, Nik. Nik Modi : Okay. Thank you. Hi. How are you? Sorry about that. I guess there was a nice over delivery at least relative to consensus this quarter and Mike I guess it\u2019s a philosophical question as you think about your first year as CEO and when you think about the priorities, clearly given the level of disruption in the marketplace just generally across the CPG landscape, there\u2019s all this stuff to spend money on, right, capabilities, innovation, et cetera, et cetera. So I\u2019m just curious like on your thoughts on how you think about the goals for the year in terms of, hey, we can hit the high end of guidance, make commodity costs coming down or hey, look, there\u2019s a lot to spend. This is the first year. Let\u2019s go get it. I just was hoping you can give some guidance around how you think about that. Michael Hsu : Well, I guess maybe my near-term focus is on delivering the midterm objectives we outlined in January, right. And I do think maybe \u2013 and this is maybe the company culture which is we want to deliver consistent, predictable and positive earnings growth and sales growth. So I think this quarter was a solid quarter for us and we\u2019re encouraged by it, especially encouraged by the price realization and the margin improvement, but it\u2019s a step along the way. I will point out, Nik, though I think a couple of bright spots for us on the quarter were we saw broad improvement across a broad range of markets all improving; the U.S., Brazil, Central/Eastern Europe, ASEAN, UK, Western Europe, India. So I think we got a lot of markets heading in the right direction, so that\u2019s a good thing. And then obviously with the pricing being on track, that\u2019s obviously helping the shape of our P&L. Nik Modi : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi, guys. So I have two questions on top line and then one on free cash flow. First from a Personal Care top line perspective, if you think about PCNA and then the Personal Care outside North America, so the developed markets together, it looks like the price mix flattish for NA and then down 3 for outside North America developed markets, so it\u2019s negative on average. Volumes were good so I\u2019m not denying that and that\u2019s excellent. But I just was scratching my head a little bit in terms of price mix element there given what\u2019s happened to commodities obviously going up, given that you\u2019re spending on advertising, given that we hear everything about the competitive situation being more benign yet unable to take price in the Personal Care area in developed markets, but just wanted your perspective on that. Is that diagnostic fair, maybe comment about market share along the way? It just struck me as why not take more pricing in that area in particular? Michael Hsu : Yes, probably Ali the biggest thing is maybe a bit of a lag on Personal Care in North America, that\u2019s probably the biggest mover and driver that we have which is we\u2019re doing most of our pricing on diapers through a pack count change and that started rolling through at the end of the first quarter and it\u2019s still rolling through now. And so we had a big rollover. It took a little time for us to get that lined up and so that\u2019s probably why you\u2019re not seeing as much price now. But that we expect will continue to improve as the year goes on. Paul Alexander : And Ali, this is Paul and in developed markets outside North America, broadly speaking I\u2019d say there hasn\u2019t been a lot of pricing in the marketplace in Personal Care so this is Western and Central Europe, Australia and South Korea. The price declined in Q1, came primarily in South Korea where given the decline in the birth rate, there has been a bit of a pickup in everyone competing to pursue growth in a pie that\u2019s getting a little bit smaller over time. In terms of shares, you asked about in North America across diapers and pants combined or the mega category, if you will, our shares on an outlook basis are even year-on-year and that might be a little bit better than you\u2019re seeing in the tracked data because we continue to do strong in non-measured channels, including club and e-commerce. Ali Dibadj : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then on Consumer Tissue both North America and developed markets, almost the opposite question, right, where you\u2019re seeing very significant pricing, I get it because of the commodity costs but the elasticity looks a little bit tougher particularly North America, so the downtown and CT as we call it ONA or outside North America down about 3. Can you talk a little bit about how that\u2019s going to continue throughout the year? Is that kind of the right balance or do you think they\u2019ll be a better balance going forward? Michael Hsu : Yes, I think maybe the first point is that with regard to Q1 we are cycling a pretty big set of events that we had in the plans last year. For reference I think our volume was up almost 10% in Tissue in North America first quarter last year and overall organic was up I think over 5%. And so we are cycling that. We took those promotions out of the plan this year. So it\u2019s not that it\u2019s a timing difference, it\u2019s just out of the plan. And so I think the Q1 this year therefore in that effect, I would say right now the elasticity effect is probably as we predicted. We had a separate promo change that is as predicted and so overall we\u2019re on. I think the one thing for us to watch out is overall I think the pricing is on track and the volume is in line with our expectations to date. The one thing we are keeping our eye on is I think some of the other private labels or some of the smaller brands have not \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen the price move up yet and so it\u2019s a little sticky on the upswing, so we\u2019re keeping our eye on that. We\u2019ll be ready to adjust our plans as necessary to make sure that we protect our share long term. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And just my last question on the free cash flow point, you said in expectations that working capital was up. But I want to get a better sense of your free cash flow conversion here. It looked a little bit tougher what we should expect going forward for the year and kind of what\u2019s going to make that change? Thank you. Maria Henry : Sure. On cash flow, it was down year-on-year for the first quarter. It was in line with what we expected. We had higher working capital and we had an increase in restructuring cash payments. In working capital that\u2019s really the big driver when you look at the numbers in the first quarter and there were a number of factors that went into that. On the payable side we had a stronger than expected finish to 2018 and those entire payables got paid out in the first quarter. On the receivable side we had a number of factors including the timing of the sales and also the higher level of sales and we ended the quarter on a Sunday, so we lose two days on collections which causes a run up in that balance. And then finally on inventories, as we expected, as we get into the supply chain portion of the restructuring program there are inventory build in advance of moving equipment or basically taking equipment offline. So we expected that to happen and we saw all of those factors play out in the first quarter. And for the year as we said in January we would expect cash from operations to be down slightly year-on-year. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Maria Henry : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your full year organic sales growth guidance of 2% which actually implies a bit of a deceleration on the top line through the balance of the year but your comps do get easier in the next couple of quarters. So I guess I want to understand if we should interpret your guidance as maybe conservative or if there\u2019s something else that we should be aware of that could cause growth to moderate? And then I\u2019m just thinking about this in the context of you guys maybe lapping some of the higher promos you had last year. Michael Hsu : Bonnie, maybe I\u2019ll start and maybe Maria can chime in. But we\u2019re making solid progress but we still have plenty of work to do to make sure that we have a strong 2019. So while we\u2019re encouraged with the start there\u2019s a lot we have ahead of us. I just said to Nik we have broad improvement across a lot of markets, we\u2019re still in the early days of price and as I mentioned to Ali just now we are watching elasticity and alignment effects are kind of in line with our expectations, maybe even actually slightly better in D&E especially. The thing that we are watching now is competitive pricing, it does seem to be a little sticky on the way up and so we\u2019re keeping our eye on that. So I wouldn\u2019t know \u2013 I think we\u2019re calling it down the middle which is what we believe and 2% for us is a reasonable number. We\u2019ve got nine months to go. There\u2019s a lot of work ahead for all of our teams. Bonnie Herzog : Okay. And then if I could I just wanted to circle back on innovation with a couple of quick questions. First, your full innovation pipeline this year, would you characterize it as more back half weighted or do you think pretty evenly spread throughout the year as you roll out new products? And then second, curious how margin accretive some of the new innovation is and was that possibly a key driver behind the sequential improvement you saw in your margins during the quarter? And then what could we expect in the future? Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yes, I think maybe a touch tilted to the back half but I would say overall fairly balanced, although I think the impact that we\u2019re getting now is still from some of the benefits in innovation we launched last year. So we have an uptick, for example, in North American adult care where I think we\u2019re up high single digits in the quarter organically. That was on the backs of innovation that we launched last year with this discrete sizing which has taken a little while to get traction in the marketplace but it\u2019s getting that traction now. So I think we have a pretty robust innovation plan. It\u2019s balanced across quarters. In terms of the accretiveness, I don\u2019t have the exact number but I think the strategy is to elevate our categories where that means premiumizing our categories by making it worth it, so with premium innovation in general we\u2019re aiming to move to a higher price point hopefully accretive. Paul Alexander : And I think Bonnie that bares out if you look at the sales changes in the quarter, mix was up as a company one point and it was up essentially between half a point and a point in all three segments. So to Mike\u2019s strategy comment I think we\u2019re making good early progress. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about marketing spend. You talked a lot about that last quarter and when we met in February and obviously you mentioned that it was up this quarter. So can you discuss some of the things that you did this quarter whether it\u2019s tradition or digital, where is the lion share of the dollar spend going and then just a little bit of order of magnitude of the increase and from this point forward are you expecting it? Was Q1 sort of a high watermark and then it sort of normalizes from here or is it just a start and we should actually expect it to continue to increase as the year progresses? Thank you. Maria Henry : Sure, Olivia, I\u2019ll start and then Mike can jump in. In terms of our advertising spend, on the P&L it was up in the first quarter and we have an expectation that for the full year it will also be up year-on-year. And that is encouraging because not only is it up but as we shift more of it to digital and as we continue our work to drive down the non-working portion of the advertising expense, the actual consumer impressions that we\u2019re getting from that spend is up as well. And so good support behind the brands and the innovations. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to talk more about what we\u2019re doing in advertising. Michael Hsu : Yes. Olivia, I think maybe a couple of things which is one, overall I\u2019d say with a couple of key brands most notably in North American adult care and in diapers I think increased levels of brand investment overall and brand support. And then most specifically it is weighted to digital. And so some of the stuff that we\u2019re seeing and the reasons why we\u2019re growing faster perhaps in non-measured channels is the strong digital investments that we\u2019re making in search and that\u2019s paying strong returns for us and doing very well. We also have pretty good content now that we feel good about in terms of the messaging we\u2019re putting out there and we\u2019re rolling out some new advertising on Cottonelle which I think is being right now very, very effective. So overall I think we feel good about kind of where we are. We know we can do better still, but looking forward to the progress. Olivia Tong : And should we expect this to increase this year as you talked about the upcoming innovation both in adult care and Huggies? Maria Henry : The benefit of innovations this year, is that the question? You\u2019re kind of breaking up. Olivia Tong : I\u2019m sorry. In terms of the increase in advertising, should we expect that to \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, within advertising, are we expecting to increase advertising as the year progresses especially as you fund or as you support innovation that\u2019s coming? Maria Henry : Okay. As you know we only disclose the advertising number I think once a year and I don\u2019t want to get into how the quarters are going to flow. So suffice it to say that it was up on the P&L in the first quarter and we would expect for the whole year that it will be up also. Olivia Tong : Got it. And then just lastly on pricing, can you talk about how much of the pricing benefit you would attribute to just straight list price increases related to commodities versus some of the things that you\u2019re working on with respect to trade efficiency and innovation? Michael Hsu : Yes, I think that\u2019s an overall mix. I think in Q1 maybe \u2013 and I don\u2019t have an exact number but I would say the vast majority of it is some form of straight pricing whether it\u2019s list or pack count changes. But I think those are probably the big buckets for us right now. We\u2019re making progress especially in North America on trade efficiency and we have some programs there. I don\u2019t know how much would show up in the P&L right now, but I know it\u2019s a big priority for the organization and they\u2019re doing a good job with it. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Olivia. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Michael Hsu : Hi, Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : Hi. Good morning. So can you comment a little bit on the 15% organic growth in Brazil? I appreciate the detail. And it was driven by pricing and I believe you were lapping this price increase in the third quarter, just want to check that. So one of these competitors are now finally following or they are retrenching given the commodity pressures are finally easing now? And also a follow-up question for Maria on the cash flow. I appreciate the detail on the cash conversion side and the working capital. I was wondering if she can explain a little bit more of the CapEx and the timing aspects of it. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Okay, Andrea, maybe I\u2019ll start with Brazil. First of all, the team\u2019s doing a great job down there and we\u2019re experiencing strong growth in what I would characterize is a very challenging consumer environment. Our Personal Care organic volume was up as we said about 15%. Net selling prices were up double digits and volume was up low single digits, Andrea. So I think we\u2019re not defying the laws of gravity there or elasticity there. I think the market pricing overall is generally moving in the right direction. But I would say there\u2019s a handful of local competitors that are lagging a little bit. The better than expected volume performance, however, is really a result of maybe great commercial execution which is strong sales execution, a great brand value proposition and good advertising I would say overall working together and that\u2019s what the team is doing. It\u2019s why building out commercial capability in our K-C Strategy 2022 is so important. There\u2019s a number of markets that look like they\u2019re defying the laws of elasticity but really it comes down to strong commercial execution and this was one of them. Andrea Teixeira : I appreciate it. Maria Henry : Go ahead, Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, Maria. So I appreciate Mike when you said \u2013 in the initial comments I think you said sluggish, so I wasn\u2019t sure if it was negative. So you\u2019re saying volumes are still up in the low single digits in Brazil which is encouraging. Okay, perfect. Michael Hsu : Andrea, the volume was down low single digit. Andrea Teixeira : Down, okay. Michael Hsu : Pricing was up double digits, pretty strong double digits and volume was down low single digits, but I would say way better than what the elasticity model would have said. Andrea Teixeira : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Maria Henry : And then on CapEx at 316 million in the quarter, that\u2019s in line with our expectations and it reflects the supply chain portion of the restructuring program really kicking into gear this year. So we continue to expect 1.1 billion to 1.3 billion on CapEx for the year and you started seeing some of that come through in the first quarter. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, Maria. Maria Henry : Thank you. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Andrea. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Thanks. I guess I wanted to start on U.S. Personal Care where the strength was really notable relative to at least what we\u2019ve seen in scan data. So just maybe some comments on that and whether that\u2019s strengthen on track channels or whether that\u2019s an element of shipments running ahead of consumption, just how you saw the growth this quarter and how we should kind of think about that momentum going forward? Michael Hsu : Steve, thanks for that question. Definitely I think strengthen in non-measured channels, overall the mega category was up about 2 points in the quarter. Our share overall as Paul mentioned was about flat. Huggies was up low single digits and I think that\u2019s really been driven by strong product performance and as we were just talking about increased brand investment and brand support. Growth was especially strong in non-measured channels and that for us is club and primarily e-comm and club. And it\u2019s worth mentioning we got a very strong digital program in e-commerce across all our customers and I think that\u2019s really working a good effect right now. So we\u2019re encouraged by the progress in Personal Care. Pull-Ups is up high single digits as well. Our adult care business is up high single digits and so it\u2019s moving in the right direction. Steve Powers : Okay, great. And then I guess my broader question was just to get you maybe Mike to expand a little bit more on how you\u2019re thinking about the medium term, the duration of K-C Strategy 2022, because building out this quarter as you say it sounds like \u2013 it looks like you\u2019re ahead of schedule. The tone today is deservedly very confident as a result. But on the other hand you called out you still have a lot of improvement initiatives underway, macro competitive conditions remain hard to call and stepping back year-over-year operating profits in dollar terms have yet to inflect positive. They should I agree as you move forward, but it just seems like the pricing which was great this quarter is tied to FX and cost inflation and if those come in lighter. How do you assess your ability to hold on to today\u2019s pricing and bank some of the productivity that you have underway in order to flow through better dollar-based bottom line results versus having to reinvest to sustain volume share versus competition? And I\u2019m not really so focused on next quarter, even this year but thinking really about what the evergreen model is over the course of that medium-term strategy? Michael Hsu : I think Steve as I mentioned when we were together, I\u2019m really excited about the growth opportunities the company has ahead of it. And really for me the three big strategies of what I call elevate the core which is premiumizing our categories with value-added innovation or capturing the growth or leading the development of developing and emerging markets and then building this consumer digital relationship I think are really kind of robust growth opportunities that are really, really good for us. I think to accelerate our progress we\u2019ve outlined a handful of capability areas that have to do with innovation or doing a better job on innovation, sales execution, our digital execution and also revenue growth management or pricing management. So those are four big planks. I would say one of the reasons why we\u2019re encouraged with our progress in Q1 is we\u2019re starting to build and improving in these four areas that I just outlined on the commercial capability and it\u2019s starting to play through. I mentioned Brazil where our 15% organic is driven by pricing but it\u2019s also driven by strong execution. We\u2019re seeing the same across ASEAN where we\u2019ve got good double digit growth, price increasing but volume also going up. Central and Eastern Europe is doing the same thing. So I think overall it\u2019s putting all these pieces together for us which is the core of the strategy and we\u2019re going to stay focused on delivering consistent growth. Steve Powers : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Herb Eppich : Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Herb Eppich on for Kevin. One quick one just on restructuring, so specifically 60 million in savings for the quarter and your outlook for 100 million to 125 million for the year. So savings has been building sequentially for the last couple of quarters but outlook assumes that this should slow. So is there anything we should be aware of, maybe any phasing or shifting into the first quarter? Any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you. Maria Henry : Yes, we had 60 million in the quarter which is a good savings number for us. But you\u2019ll recall that we had no savings in the first quarter of last year as the restructuring program was announced in January of last year and then it took some time to ramp up. If you look at the 60 in relationship to the expectation for the year of 100 million to 125 million, when we start to get into the second quarter we will be lapping quarters where we were building savings through 2018. And so that\u2019s really the driver. Herb Eppich : Okay. That\u2019s all. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Thank you. Paul Alexander : Okay. Thanks, Herb. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi. Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. Michael Hsu : Hi, Steve. Steve Strycula : So I had a question, the last quarter you mentioned that there might be some lumpiness on the quarter-to-quarter trend and first quarter clearly came in well ahead of what a lot of the investment community was expecting. So is there any lumpiness you would be mindful of for like Q2 or like the balance of the year in terms of sell-in versus sell-out particularly as you start lapping some of the price increases that you phased in towards end of last year? Maria Henry : Yes, I\u2019ll make a comment and then Mike can jump in. We don\u2019t give quarterly guidance but a few things that I\u2019d say keep in mind. We have some benefits in the first quarter with the Lunar New Year happening and we typically have a strong first quarter around that. As we move into the second quarter, Kleenex will be kind of out of season in terms of cold and flu. And then the final thing as Mike mentioned earlier, the pricing just went in on diapers here in the first quarter. So I think we haven\u2019t seen how all of this is going to play out in our numbers and we commented that we expect the second half to be somewhat in relationship to the first half. So that kind of gives you a lot of different things to think about as you think about how you\u2019re going to layout your expectations on the quarters. Steve Strycula : Okay, great. Mike a follow up for you. How should we think about \u2013 it seems like volume trends were generally better than what you were expecting. Did you guys have success in winning some planograms that were some key callouts you\u2019d want to shed light on? And then what key emerging markets if any would you say were sequentially the end market demand just improved quarter-on-quarter? Thank you. Michael Hsu : Steve, I think maybe the second part first. I would say broadly across most markets demand improved versus where it was maybe last quarter. And so if you go through the markets, CE was up about strong double digits for us; ASEAN was up double digits; obviously Brazil we already mentioned; Argentina obviously a big number; India were up double digits as well; China fem care up another strong robust double digit quarter; China diapers obviously still down but I think improving sequentially behind our new product improvements. So I think across the broad array of markets improving. And I think in North America again improved commercial execution. There probably are some distribution changes here and there and I think we made some progress in some areas. But the other part of it is better product performance. And we have made improvements broadly across diapers, across adult care both on Depend and Poise. Poise is just shipping this quarter. Our Cottonelle bath tissue, Scott Comfort Plus is all gaining increased consumer traction. So we\u2019re feeling good about kind of the innovation piece of the puzzle. Steve Strycula : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much. Michael Hsu : Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Feeney : You had a little drop in developing and emerging market volume in both Personal Care and Tissue, just the volume piece and I know there was a ton of pricing in there driven by commodities. But can you update us on the market level volume growth roughly in your developing and emerging market portfolio overall and was that a gain \u2013 a loss of volume share and who would pick up that volume share? I\u2019m looking at the demographics. It would seem to me there would be ongoing volume growth in those markets. Thanks. Paul Alexander : Yes, Jonathan, maybe I\u2019ll start just to put the volume decline and a little bit of context and then Mike can give obviously more color. If you looked at across our total D&E line up and set aside China and Argentina, our volumes would have been up a little bit in the quarter which given the inflationary pricing environment we are all facing and consumers are facing, that was a pretty solid outcome. Michael Hsu : Yes, so overall I think we feel good about where the markets are heading. We feel good about our commercial execution broadly across D&E and I think most of the volume declines were related to price changes. Jonathan Feeney : So did others not \u2013 am I right that there\u2019s a little bit of share loss there and did others not take that pricing? I\u2019m just curious like what the competitive dynamics are in the wake of it. Michael Hsu : Yes, I think it\u2019s market by market but I would say as a general rule of thumb I would say the major branded competitors moved in line with us or some ahead of us and then you have some stickiness in local competitors or some of the smaller players. And so we\u2019re keeping a sharp eye on that. Jonathan Feeney : Very helpful. Thank you very much. Michael Hsu : Okay. Paul Alexander : Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Michael Hsu : Hi, Ali. Ali Dibadj : Hi. Thanks for the follow up. I just want to touch base on China in a little bit more detail. I know you put it in the prepared remarks and the PowerPoint, but can you give us just some more color about what\u2019s going on there from a pricing perspective? We clearly see the volumes as well. But that\u2019s been a hotspot recently. Just want to get an update please. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Yes. Thanks, Ali. I would say in diapers pricing is kind of about where it was last quarter. So overall for us our premium Huggies is gaining traction behind the innovation that we talked about last quarter and our fem care continues the really strong momentum. We\u2019re really not satisfied with our performance yet but we\u2019re making progress. Our Personal Care organic sales were down high single digit which is improvement versus the prior quarter. The competitive activity on price remains elevated. It remains kind of where pricing has been. But I think specifically in our team\u2019s view and my view is the consumers in that market are still looking for better solutions and our improved tier 5 and 6 diapers are gaining traction. They were up significantly in volume and up in value as well. And we\u2019ll be rolling out that technology that we put into that across other tiers and other channels this year. So we\u2019re building for the long term and I\u2019m really feeling good about what the team is doing there. Ali Dibadj : Thank you. But what do you think the competitive situation is looking like whether it be from the regional players there, Japanese in particular or from P&G? Michael Hsu : Well, we\u2019re still seeing pricing suppressed and then we are getting wind of some additional product introductions. We don\u2019t have visibility on everything yet. But obviously I think products and technology still matters a lot in China and that\u2019s what the consumers are looking for and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the response in this in the premium tiers. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Thanks very much. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Ali. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Thank you so much. A couple of things. How important is the roll price of oil which is up so much to the outlook for polymers? Maria Henry : Yes, the price on oil has gone up and so when we think about our outlook on commodities, overall as I went through in the beginning of the call, 10 of our puts and takes on the fiber-based commodities and other material commodities, the oil prices definitely have us watching the market. The relationship between oil prices and the exact commodities that we buy has not been as correlated as of late as it had been historically, but it certainly does have us remaining cautious on the full year outlook for the oil-based derivative materials that we\u2019re using. So it\u2019s kind of mixed with the sequential improvements that we\u2019re seeing in some areas, but with the oil run up we\u2019re just keeping an eye on it. Caroline Levy : Right. Thank you, Maria. And could you elaborate a little bit on the outlook for transport? Maria Henry : Sure. Distribution costs were up. They continue to be inflationary for us. They were higher a year ago and distribution costs are a meaningful portion of our overall cost of sales and the outlook for the year assumes that we will have distribution inflation for the full year. But it hasn\u2019t changed from what our position was when we talked to you in January. And I should note the increases on distribution costs are global. Michael Hsu : Yes. And the other note I\u2019ll make, Caroline, is that last quarter or at the end of fourth quarter of '18, we did have some additional expenses because of some distribution challenges. I think our team is making progress there and we are improving. Caroline Levy : That\u2019s great. Thank you. If I might, just a couple more. Could you comment on Mexico? It doesn\u2019t look like things have improved there in the way they have in Brazil, but maybe I\u2019m missing something. And then the last one would be to discuss your overall \u2013 how you think about development of private label, just whether you see it as a significant longer-term or medium-term threat and whether you would consider participating in it in any way? Michael Hsu : Maybe the last one first, Caroline. We do do a bit of private label right now. It\u2019s not a strategic part of our business but it is in certain instances we will produce some private label. We generally don\u2019t have the capacity of taking on as a big strategic bet especially given the amounts of capital we got to put in generally I think is not necessarily a great return on our capital to invest in on that type of capacity. However, I will say we\u2019re moderating it closely because especially in North America right now in bath tissue I\u2019d note that private label is up a bit and pricing has not moved upwards yet on a lot of private label, so we\u2019re keeping a sharp eye on that. We\u2019ll be able to adjust our plans if necessary. Maria Henry : And then on Mexico we\u2019re not going to comment because they haven\u2019t released yet. But what I would say is if you look at equity company contributions it\u2019s relatively flat year-on-year. Caroline Levy : Yes, I saw that. Then if I might just sneak in one more on China. What percentage of your business there is premium, because I thought you largely only played premium but your total sales are still down? Michael Hsu : Yes, the most two premium tiers for us, Caroline, are a little bit more than half our total Huggies diaper business. Caroline Levy : Thanks so much. Michael Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Caroline. Maria Henry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have no further questioners in the queue. Michael Hsu : All right. Well, we appreciate everyone\u2019s questions today and we will speak with you next quarter. Thank you very much and have a great day. Bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning\u2019s presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines and thank you for joining us this morning.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here is the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of second quarter results. After that, Mike will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the full-year. We will finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook, which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I will turn the call over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 5% driven by higher net selling prices. We achieved strong cost savings, margin improvements and growth in adjusted earnings per share. And finally, we are broadly on-track with our overall capital plan and we continue to return cash to shareholders. Now let's cover the details of our results starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That is even with a year-ago and includes a five-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales were up 5% compared to flat performance in the base period. Net selling prices increased 5% and product mix improved one point, while volumes fell slightly. Mike will provide some more color in our top-line in just a few minutes. Moving on to profitability. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 34.6%, up 120 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 3% [indiscernible]. We now expect full-year commodity inflation of $150 million to $250 million. On average that is $150 million lower than our previous estimate. The reduction is driven primarily by cost and secondarily other raw materials. Other manufacturing costs also increased in the quarter compared to a relatively modest level last year. These costs are expected to be a bit higher than we planned for, for the full-year. Moving further down the P&L, between the lines spending was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales. That included higher advertising as we are investing more behind our brands, particularly in digital. G&A expense also increased, driven by higher incentive compensation. For the full-year, because we have raised our sales and earnings outlook, we have also increased our incentive compensation estimate. The increase versus our original plan is equal to more than 1% of total operating profit. About half of that increase was reflected in our second quarter results. Foreign currencies were also a headwind in the quarter, reducing operating profit by a high-single digit rate. All in all, adjusted operating profit was up 2%. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.2%, up 40 basis points versus a year-ago. That included broad-based margin improvements in all three business segments. On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.67, up 5% year-on-year. In addition to the higher operating profit, the bottom-line benefited from a slightly lower adjusted effective tax rate, higher equity income and a lower share count. Let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $609 million compared to $787 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was generally in line with our expectations and driven by higher tax payments and increased working capital. Capital spending was $253 million in the quarter.  As expected that is up versus last year, driven by supply chain restructuring projects. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. Second quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled $520 million and we continue to expect that full-year amount will be between $2 billion and $2.3 billion. Looking at our segment results, in Personal Care, organic sales were up 8%. Net selling prices increased 5% and volumes and product mix were each up one point. Personal Care operating margins were 21.2%, up 80 basis points year-on-year. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth and cost savings. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up 4%. Net selling prices increased 5% and product mix improved slightly, while volumes fell 2%. Consumer Tissue operating margins were 15%, up 90 basis points versus year-ago with significant benefits from higher pricing. In K-C Professional, organic sales grew 1%. Selling prices rose 3% and product mix improved a point [while volumes were down 3%. K-C Professional operating margins of 19.7% were up 50 basis points versus prior year. So all in all, we delivered very good results in the quarter while continuing to invest for future success. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying we made excellent progress in the second quarter. We are executing our 2019 plan well with a strong focus on price realization to improve our margins. We are launching innovations investing more in our brands and pursuing growth priorities for longer term success. We are also continuing to return significant cash to shareholders. As Maria just mentioned, we delivered 5% organic sales growth in the second quarter and while that compares to a soft year-ago, this was our best performance in over three years. Our pricing initiatives are on-track. Our volumes are ahead of expectations both in terms of the impact from price increases and from our growth initiatives. We also continue to improve mix, which was up one point for the second consecutive quarter. Let me share some of the top-line highlights starting in North America. Organic sales in consumer products increased 5% compared to a 2-point decline last year. Year-to-date, organic sales were up 3%, which is likely a better reflection of our ongoing performance. Growth in the quarter was driven by 4% higher selling prices. Our pricing plans are on-track. Volumes in North America were up slightly overall. Adult care volumes were up high-single digits and we recently launched innovations on both Poise and Depend to keep that momentum going. Earlier this month, we launched Huggies Special Delivery, our new super premium diaper. Special Delivery uses the best of our technology from around the world. This is our softest diaper. It's made with plant-based materials and provides ultimate skin comfort. It's also premium priced and a great example of our elevate the core strategy in action. In North American consumer K-C Professional, organic sales increased 2%, driven by disciplined execution of our pricing initiatives. Turning to developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 9% and that included 3.5 points of growth from Argentina, which is consistent with our plan. In terms of our key personal care businesses, in Brazil, organic sales were up double digits driven by higher selling prices. While category volumes remain sluggish, we are driving strong growth through disciplined market execution and focused expansion efforts in baby wipes and adult care. In China, organic sales were up double-digits compared to a soft performance last year. In diapers, our net price realization was helped by reduced and more targeted promotional spending. While Huggies total volumes were down, the product innovations we have launched are delivering growth in the premium end of our lineup and improving mix significantly. In fem care, we had another strong quarter and we are on-track to achieve 20%-plus organic growth for the third consecutive year. In ASEAN, organic sales rose about 10% with continued volume strength on Huggies diapers in Vietnam. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased about 20%, driven by double-digit volume growth and positive pricing. Our momentum on both Huggies and Kotex reflects excellent sales execution, winning product innovation and great marketing. Finally, in developed markets outside North America, organic sales were up 1% with solid performance in South Korea and Australia. Beyond sales, I'm very encouraged with the margin improvement we have delivered while investing more in our business. Now turning to the full-year. We are raising our outlook on both the top and bottom-line. On the top-line, we are increasing our organic sales outlook to 3%, and that is one point higher than our original plan and driven by stronger volumes. On the bottom-line. We are now targeting adjusted earnings per share of $6.65 to $6.80, and that compares favorably to our prior outlook of $6.50 to $6.70. Our updated outlook reflects strong execution, the improving commodity environment and higher reinvestment levels. We are encouraged that the commodity outlook has gotten better, and that is especially true for pulp, which has retreated from all time high levels although costs remain elevated from a longer term perspective. We aren't expecting a significant increase in market promotion activity despite the improved commodity environment, but we will continue to closely monitor competitive activity. We are increasing growth investments in our brands and commercial capabilities to position us better for the long-term success. Brand investments include more digital advertising, digital continues to improve marketing ROI and help us grow in many parts of our business. We are also going to invest to improve our commercial capabilities, including revenue management, which is a focus of K-C Strategy 2022. Overall, we expect to bring some of the commodity benefits to the bottom-line while also reinvesting more for top-line growth. That is consistent with our balanced value creation model we outlined in K-C Strategy 2022. So in summary, we have made excellent progress in the first half. We are raising our full-year outlook and investing more for the long-term, and we are confident in our ability to create shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be glad to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys. A few questions for me actually. One is on free cash flow. Maria, you mentioned that particularly on the working capital side, it was a planned change, but a pretty big reduction in free cash flow this year versus last year even if you try to adjust for some sense of restructuring. So I would love a sense of why that shouldn't worry us at all in terms of that trajectory, and what you think the trajectory looks like going forward on the free cash flow side. Maria Henry : Sure. We said coming into the year that we were expecting operating cash flow to be down slightly year-on-year, and we still expect that. If you look at the quarter, the cash from operations of 609 was driven by higher cash taxes, and working capital was also a use of funds. So let me talk about both of those. On cash taxes, it really has to do with timing. You look at the first part of 2018, we were in an overpayment situation, and so we were paying out less cash taxes last year than what would be kind of a normalized level. This year we have the opposite. We have some catch-up payments that we had to make in the first half of this year and in the second quarter, and so that is what is going on with cash taxes. It just has to do with timing. I wouldn't call anything unusual out there. In terms of working capital, there is a number of factors. Our cash conversion days were 13, which compares to what was a very strong 11 days in 2018. And you'll recall that in the fourth quarter of last year, we had very strong cash flow benefits from working capital. We had very low cash conversion days. Part of that was driven by a higher payables balance, which got paid out in the first part of this year. In terms of working capital and cash conversion days, we are expecting and we are seeing inventory build around our execution on the restructuring programs. As we close down facilities or prepare to close down facilities and shut down lines and prepare to stand up new lines, we are building inventory so that we can maintain our service levels with customers, and we are seeing that. On the accounts receivable or DSO side, we have got in the second quarter some timing differences between the sales and collections, particularly with the quarter ending on a Sunday. So I would expect on the receivables side that to correct itself as we go through the remainder of the year. And finally, on payables, the team is executing some projects to get some benefits there, and that was a positive, helping to offset the drag on inventory and the timing differences on DSO. So it's a long answer, but I would expect for the second half that we will have stronger free cash flow and that, for the year, we will still be down little bit, Ali. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Okay. A bit of improvement for me. Okay. I appreciate the confidence of answer and will keep watching it. A couple of other things. One is, I guess I was initially encouraged to see the emerging and developed markets growing 9% this quarter, saw China pricing a little bit better and start to ask the question of, oh gosh, are we back to kind of this high-single digit type growth rates sustainably in the emerging markets for Kimberly-Clark? But then, I saw that you mentioned Argentina with 3.5 points of that 9% growth, Mike. Brazil probably helped you out a little bit as well. China, it seems like you are investing a lot in that marketplace as well, hopefully on the volume side. So just that kind of perked my expectations and my hope to a return of improvement in Kimberly-Clark emerging in developed markets. Could you kind of right size our expectations on that on a sustainable basis, please? Mike Hsu : Yes, Ali. Good point. I think I would say overall in D&E, we are very encouraged and we are making strong progress. That 9%, it's robust, and I would say it's the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerated performance. If you go back to the third quarter of last year, I think we were up 3%, then 4%, 7% in the first quarter and then 9% this quarter. And while Argentina is a chunk of that, about a little over 3 points, we are seeing improved performance across many of the markets. Obviously price mix is a big piece of it, but we are seeing certainly less volume impact from pricing from some of the significant pricing we have taken, for example, in Brazil and Argentina, less volume impact than we originally expected. And then, on the positive front, in other markets, I would say, CE continues to grow at a strong double-digit rate. We are seeing ASEAN growth at double-digits, and then China obviously returning to growth, certainly aided by pricing or maybe, said a different way, some reductions in promotion spending in China. But we are seeing a good volume growth in our premium tiers, and we are very encouraged by that progress. Ali Dibadj : Okay. And just my last question may be a little bit of a broader question, the discourse around Kimberly-Clark among investors is that I think people generally understand that pricing has been pretty good because of commodity-driven pricing and the SKUs were better because P&G and GP and perhaps some of the competition in China was a little bit more stable. Brazil seems like it's getting a little bit better. Commodity costs were less than what we had anticipated, and all those things in kind of the Kimberly-Clark ecosystem are doing pretty well. But the challenge often in that discourse is, okay, so what is Kimberly-Clark itself doing? What was company-specific here that Kimberly-Clark is doing that could benefit it differentially besides cost savings in particular? I think we all appreciate that cost savings has been quite good. But it's kind of like the ecosystem's going in Kimberly's favor, but we are not quite sure what company specifics are happening here. So if you could help us, at least enlighten us on that, that'd be helpful. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes, Ali. Great question. It's certainly, I think, one of the big things is the operating environment has improved, right. And I think that is significantly better than when we met maybe toward the end of January. And I think the consumer demand is healthier than it was then, and I would say our performance is better than it was then. One of the reasons why we are seeing less volume impact is not because elasticities are lower. In fact, as we do the analysis, the elasticities are pretty close to what we modeled. It is really more than market execution. And what we got is, I think, very strong innovation and new products coming out across, let's say, North America, particularly in Personal Care. We have got strong marketing in those markets as well driving an improvement consumption. I think, the China business I think is, we are in China for the long haul, and I think the team really believes in innovation there and I think the consumers following. And so, we are seeing strong growth in our premium tiers behind, we think, the best diaper in the marketplace right now. And so there is a lot going on there. And if you look at Latin America, double-digit pricing with almost minimal volume impact, it's not because there is low elasticity. It's because there is really strong innovation marketing and actually terrific sales execution. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just following on that, I think it's telling, Mike, how many times you just mentioned kind of terrific sales execution, and it feels like in some of your larger emerging markets, I'm curious to the degree to which I guess what is changed? So you alluded to, of course, better operating environment but the Kimberly-Clark specific piece, let's go back to maybe what was missing or not as strong over the last two to three years from a commercial execution standpoint, because I think that is a piece of the equation I'm still not grabbing onto and then it would be and so many markets at once that the executions driven have been like a step change. So anything further you could offer there would be great. Mike Hsu : Yes, Lauren. I think it's a combination of factors I just mentioned, which is, I think, the operating environment has improved, in which I think the consumer can see the innovation and the product and the marketing and respond to it. And if you rewind a couple of years ago, it's tough to see innovation and advertising when you are going against a buy one get two free, right. So pouring advertising into a marketplace like that is not effective. But I think where the teams - and we always believe in elevating our categories or driving better product benefit by making the premium products worth it. And so I think we have got plenty of innovation across markets that I just mentioned that is taken a hold and getting the consumers' attention and we are encouraged by that response. And then obviously, I think all of us in CPG we all know when you have good innovation, it allows your sales force to execute much more effectively and get the shelf space you need, drive the promotions you need, and all that kind of behavior close with it. So I don't think there is a magic bullet there, but I would say that I think we all were focused on a disciplined way building our capabilities both in innovation, in digital, which is a big space for us for marketing, sales execution and revenue management. Those are the big capability areas we have been focusing on, and we are making a lot of progress. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then now with the commodity environment being more benign and even just with your outlook obviously for this year but even as we look forward to 2020, with that as a backdrop and thinking about the things you laid out as core to your tenure, investing in selling capabilities, marketing, digital, revenue management, there is data needs to get it at those sorts of activities, how are you thinking about the greater flexibility you may well have today versus what you thought six months ago and the reinvestment needs of the business, particularly the new Chief Growth Officer coming on who may have sort of a different perspective on what can be done with your suite of brands? Mike Hsu : Yes, I mean - Lauren, we are very bullish on our categories both in the near-term and long-term and I think that comes back to kind of two of the core strategies we have, which is in big developed markets, elevating the core or premiumizing our categories by making the categories worth more to our consumers. And then of course we are still in the very early stages of development. So, I think maybe the commodities have been a little lower than we expected at the beginning of the year, that does give us the flexibility. I think, the - when you add up the operating environment, which I think is more conducive to growth and consumer demand is healthier than we have seen maybe in the past year or so, I think that gives us the confidence to invest. The other part of it is, we have talked about this back in January, which is I think our - with the innovation and the marketing initiatives and the sales initiatives working, that gives us more confidence to put more money behind that, and we are very excited about that. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Ms. Mohsenian, your line may be on mute. You may unmute to ask your question. Dara Mohsenian : \u2026mid-single-digit pricing in the last couple quarters, but that was predicated upon a much higher commodity environment than we are sitting at today. So, curious if you are seeing any initial signs in pickup and promotion from either branded label or branded competitors with the recent commodity pullback? And as you look going forward, you commented that you don't expect to see a significant increase in market promotion. What gives you confidence behind that, and that you won't have to dial back some of this pricing eventually? Mike Hsu : Hey, Dara, I think we only got the last part of it, so I will try to answer it, but maybe you can push me if I'm not kind of going the direction you were asking for. But I think it was related to pricing and what the environment looks like. Right now, I would say, overall our pricing initiatives overall across globally are on-track, maybe a little more focused on North America, they are also on-track. Probably the big area for us was in North America Consumer Tissue. I think the pricing was up as we expected. The big difference was private label in general still has not moved, but we are still seeing good volume growth from our brands, and probably a little bit in excess of what we had planned. I think, at this point, we have not seen an uptick in maybe competitive promotional pricing. Don't expect it, mostly because this is a multi-year issue for us, and we have had commodity inflation at record highs. It's still at a very high level. And so, for us, we are not planning - our plans don't have high promotion intensity. We are really focused on marketing the innovation that we have, and driving the advertising. I will pause there, and maybe is that what you were looking for or something else? Dara Mohsenian : Yes. That is helpful. And then, if I could just slip in a second question, the gap between North American reported results and the U.S. scanner data looked like it widened pretty significantly to a few hundred basis points. Was there some inventory build that retail, particularly with the innovations that you mentioned, or is that more just a function of very strong untracked channel growth? And maybe while we are on the subject, can you give us a bit of an update on e-commerce in the club channel, your sales growth and market share performance there? That'd be helpful. Mike Hsu : Yes, a little different there. I think what we said in our commentary that maybe the plus 3% was probably a better - if you look at year-to-date, we are plus 3%. That is probably the best indication of where we think our business is right now. We did have a few differences, certainly non-measured for us is generally stronger than measured. So that is an ongoing refrain, and a good thing in some ways. Also we had some spending changes that affected net revenue realization. I recognize we are still - dialing back to your prior question, we are still dialing back our promotion intensity. And so that affected it. And then we did have some minor retail inventory changes, but we had those in a lot of quarters. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. That is helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Good morning. There was just a comment in the North America commentary in Personal Care that caught my eye, which was number one, that volumes were up high single digits in adult care. And I was curious what drove that because I know that is been obviously a very high margin area for you, but it's an area that is been under pressure. So is that category growth or is it innovation or more promotion that you doing? And then, similarly, volumes down mid-single digits in fem care in North America. What is the plan there? I know it's been - I mean, your Kotex restates that you did a few years ago was so successful. Are there any plans for a follow-up to that? What are your plans in fem care to get that business growing again? And I'm really focused on volumes, not pricing. Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes. We are making progress on adult care, Wendy, up high-single digit. I think the category is up somewhere - probably about mid single-digit in that range, and I think really it's about innovation and category messaging, category-building messaging that is gaining traction for us. Definitely our product enhancements that we launched last year are gaining traction, discrete sizing. We have got Fit-Flex on Depend is going out now, and then Poise Active, and those are all working pretty well for us. And then, we have got strong brand investment and more messaging that is more category-building. So I think those of the two things that are working in adult care. In fem care, it's a great category. We have got a great global franchise. We know we need to strengthen the performance of the brand in the U.S., and the team is focused on product enhancements and improving our messaging. Wendy Nicholson : Perfect. Then just going back to your comment on pricing generally, I can't remember the last time companies like you got the benefit of favorable pricing and favorable commodity impact. It's just been a long time. Those usually work opposite. And so, just as you think about the current commodity environment, I know you said you don't expect promotional levels to increase, which, I hope that is the case, but that would strike me as a surprise. But as you look toward calendar '20, the pricing that you have taken, at what point in the cycle do you get to a point where you need to contemplate may be rolling back some of the price increases you have taken, particularly in categories where you still are struggling from a market share perspective. Why not be the aggressor there, if you will? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes, I think, if you sit on this side of the phone, you have a memory like an elephant. So, last year, I think our commodity inflation was $500 million or $600 million more than our plan. And so, this year, it's a little more favorable but not even close to that. And so, again as I said, the commodity impact is a multi-year impact, and I think that is driving our behavior as we work to recover margins. And right now, I think, we are seeing in the retail environment consumer demand is healthy. I think, in this environment, consumers could be more responsive to innovation and marketing, and I think that is a bit more value-added for us and our competitors to grow the categories versus driving a doom cycle of promotion. Wendy Nicholson : Fair enough. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Alright. Thank you. Good morning. I actually had a follow-on question on private-label pricing, which has remained largely unchanged in some of your key track channel category such as diapers. So, just want to hear from you guys how concerned you are with private label choosing not to follow your pricing moves. And then, separately, could you comment on whether you are seeing any stepped-up competitive pressures from some of your online retail partners with their own private label offerings? Mike Hsu : Yes. We are watching the private label pricing pretty closely. It hasn't moved notably in Consumer Tissue or specifically in the Bath category, or in diapers yet. I do think our brands are performing very well despite that. And I think that speaks to the iconic nature of Scott 1000, our new advertising and our product enhancements with Cottonelle, so we feel good about that direction, but it's something that we have got the keep a sharp eye on. Obviously we are a volume-sensitive business, and so while we may fine-tune our promotional plans to make sure we get the volumes that we need, we are going to manage this category - our role in the category very responsibly. Bonnie Herzog : Alright. Thanks. And then just a second question for me on China. Could you drill down just a little further on your performance in that market? And it seems like volumes still seem to be under pressure, so just wanted to understand from you when we can see that turn positive or improves further. Mike Hsu : Yes, OK. China, our biggest short-term opportunity and our biggest long-term opportunity, and I think the team is working in the right direction, which is making the investment in innovation. And we feel like we have the best diaper in the market right now. Organic was up double-digits with big contributions from both Diapers and Fem Care. In Diapers, we launched a breakthrough, what we call, our 5D diaper toward the end of - middle of last year, and we think that is the best in the market, and that is really fueling the gains. We are up significantly in the premium tiers, still down a bit in the value tiers, but we are managing through that. Some of that is conscious because we have chosen to dial back the promotional price points or raise our promotional price points. And so that drove some of the net price realization that we had in the category. But I would say, we are growing in the tiers that are very important to us, which is premium, and still declining a little bit in the value tiers. Bonnie? Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Cody Ross : Good morning, everybody. This is actually Cody on for Jason. Perhaps the biggest surprise to us was the 8% organic sales growth in Personal Care. Developing and emerging markets were led by price, which could be fleeting, but North America had a balanced contribution for the first time in many years. Can you provide more details and tell us what is driving this specifically? What you think your end-market growth is compared to what it was a quarter or two ago? How much market share do you think you are taking? And which categories are you seeing the most share gain in? And how sustainable do you think that is? Mike Hsu : Yes, good point, Cody. I think we are very pleased with the balanced nature of the growth in North America Personal Care. I think organic was up 6%, and that was balanced between being up 3% in price and 3% in volume for us. And that really reflects, in our mind, strong product innovation and really strong end-market execution. In Diapers, we just launched - we got great innovation coming out, and we just launched Huggies Special Delivery, which is going to deliver ultimate skin comfort. And it's got a lot of features. And if you'll indulge me, our softest diaper delivers really trusted protection. It's got plant-based materials, free of parabens and other harsh chemicals, and hypoallergenic for baby's skin. So it's got a great product, great designs and packaging. And it's priced at a significant premium. And Cody, that is been a - it's really a good indicator or a good example of our elevate-the-core strategy in action. So we are excited about that. In adult care, likewise we have got, as I just mentioned earlier, a number of product enhancements in Depend and Poise, and those are both working - those are all working well in the market. Cody Ross : Great. Thank you. My other question was your revised guidance calls for higher marketing spend and G&A costs. Can you just provide more details about your spending initiatives? What products is it behind? When should we expect it to hit? And then also, what caused you to increase your spending outlook? Was it just reinvesting the savings that you have from a lower commodity outlook? Mike Hsu : Yes, Cody, it's a couple things. One, certainly the outlook had a piece of it, but it's also, given the robustness of consumer demand and I think the improving conditions in the operating environment, gives us the confidence to invest. And then, that said, some of the early returns from our innovation and our marketing thus far to date, I think, gives us more confidence to invest further. So the big areas, I think Maria mentioned - Digital is one big area for us that is working effectively for us in a lot of areas. It has strong ROIs, driving a lot of the parts of our business, what we would call direct digital marketing in North America Personal Care and Tissue. China, Fem, Diapers in Russia, I think we have got multiple markets. And then, from a capability perspective, we are also investing in people, process and tools to accelerate some of the capabilities that I outlined, including our end-market execution and our revenue growth management initiatives. Cody Ross : Great. Thank you. And if I can just sneak in one housekeeping item, you guys have had strong cost savings so far year-to-date. Even if commodities should come below your outlook for about $150 million to $250 million, should we still expect you to hit that target range of $400 million to $450 million in savings? Maria Henry : We are tracking well on our way to delivering the $400 million to $450 million savings this year. What I would say is the composition of that may be a bit different than what we were thinking. Our teams are delivering solid FORCE cost savings as they work to deliver productivity and cost reductions in our manufacturing operations. Our restructuring program is very much on-track. At the end of the day, it's possible that our FORCE savings for the year may come in a bit light, and our restructuring savings may come in a bit better than we had anticipated coming into the year. But in total, on the $400 million to $450 million combined savings, I think we are well on our way to deliver that. Cody Ross : Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it along. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. How are you? So I have two questions. First to Maria, on the new guidance, what are you assuming for pulp prices? And should we see commodities, I guess, the spot prices have been rolling over by more than anticipated. So, in your outlook, as we progress for the year and probably as you said in a multi-year effect, should we see the timing of these contracts finally having a bigger impact and the levels like being conservative on this guidance and the revised guidance is because you don't have visibility of how long it's going to linger these lower prices? And then, the second question is about China. So, you have an impressive quarter. So in the premium segment that is finally more than offset the near tier segment decline, is it sustained more or you are seeing or you are being able to increase the marketing in spite of these marketing spend that you alluded to for the fast-growing channels, including online and baby stores? Thank you. Maria Henry : Alright. Why don't I start with the commodity outlook. I guess, a good place to start on commodities is just a reminder that commodities were inflationary in the quarter, and still a headwind for us in the second quarter to the tune of about 10% impact on our operating profit. But that said, they did come in a bit better than we expected. And while they were inflationary, it was the lowest level of inflation that we have seen in two years. So we are pleased with that. Costs on some of the resin-based materials as well as pulp and results of fiber all these versus our plan mostly in North America. We still do see inflation outside of North America, particularly in Latin America. Distribution costs are also continuing to run high. There is no change in our view on that, but they do continue to run high. On your question around the contracts, the contracts in general are negotiated annually. So I will remind you that we discussed the negotiations that we had coming out of 2017 when we got - I'm sorry, coming out of 2018 when we got on the call in January. So we have nothing new to report on that, and we will have to see where we land and where commodities are as we close out the calendar year and we get into our discussions with suppliers and set our contracts for next year. We will update you on where all of that lands in January. And then, the other thing I would comment on is that, in general, our outlook for commodity assumes that costs are relatively consistent with the recent spot prices, except for pulp, which is forecast to move down a bit further from here. So that is kind of what is going on with commodities. Mike Hsu : Yes, OK. Andrea, and then on China, what I will tell you is, we are really encouraged by the progress the team is taking. Their strategy is to elevate the category by driving sustainable long-term growth. And I think, do we believe it's sustainable? I think that is our intent. And the way we are doing that is through product innovation that seems to be working very effectively in the marketplace. We have got a diaper that we launched toward the end of last year, middle of last year, the 5D diaper that is soft and flexible, breathable as much as any product out there except that the differences in the marketplace and while it's winning is that it protects better than the other products in the category, at least that is our perspective. And so that is getting traction in the premium tiers. But just to be clear, our volume in diapers was down in the quarter. It's just that it was growing significantly in the premium side of the business. That said, organic was up because of the volume differences and also because of some net pricing changes. So I think the business is heading in the right direction. We think the work that we are doing is to drive long-term sustainable growth. Andrea Teixeira : That is helpful. Just on the follow-up with Maria, now I understand the contracts are one year set with suppliers, so can you kind of bridge to us because kind of last year was obviously a big hit. This year, what is your assumption for pulp embedded in your revised guidance? Paul Alexander : Andrea, this is Paul. I would say, in general, there has been no change in how we forecast commodities. And so we are using the forecasters that you are doing well, including RECY and then we generally would line up with what they forecast. Andrea Teixeira : And include the timing of the contracts, right? I'm assuming that they don't rollover the way your contracts roll, right? You can't have the spot prices because they're significantly lower now, but you can't embed it because of your contracts. Is that the way we should think? Maria Henry : We have got both things that affect us, obviously with the market prices, and then as we have discussed, we also have contracts that affect what we report as commodity inflation for Kimberly-Clark. One you have visibility into, and the other one you don't. Andrea Teixeira : Correct. Yes. But you are not ready to give us as you did in the past where you gave us exactly the price of the pulp at this point? Maria Henry : If you are after what we are thinking in terms of our fiber commodity? What I would say is that, on eucalyptus, which is a major input for us on the fiber side, we have reduced our outlook range to $1,050 to $1,100 per metric ton, and that is down $75 per metric ton. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. Obviously, given your commentary around brand spend initiatives, a few questions there. Clearly that is helping support some of your pricing and mix initiatives. But when do you actually expect these initiatives to drive some improvement in volume? So that is the first question. And then second, just a little bit more around the new Huggies Special Delivery. Curious as to how you went about in terms of the thought process and the marketing around it because it's conveying a very different message versus what both you and your competitors have done in the past and it obviously stands up very dramatically on the shelf. So a little bit more color there would be helpful. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes. On the brand investment, I think maybe the overall sale, Olivia, I think it has been working and that is a piece of the reason why it gives us the confidence to increase the investment in the back half. The example I will give you maybe is, if you talk about Brazil, pricing is up in the teens, volume is essentially a little bit less than flat. And so, while our assessment is, the elasticity has taken hold, but we have got a lot of other things going on that make that volume better than what the elasticity would've modeled, which is innovation. We have got growth initiatives on adult care and baby wipes that is getting very, very strong growth, and marketing behind those initiatives. And then, increased advertising spend or improved advertising on the diaper products. So, I think just kind of one example, but I think we have seen that and it's part of the reason why we have more confidence to spend more. Paul Alexander : And then on Special Delivery, Mike? Mike Hsu : Yes, Special Delivery, we are very excited about that. You can definitely see some different hands on the business. Very - maybe a contemporary look and feel. We have got a great young team on it that is kind of in tune with, I think, millennial mom and very well tested. The technology is terrific, it's a showcase of, I would say, maybe an enhanced approach from us, which is a partnership globally from a technology perspective. I mean, it takes the best of what we have been doing in North America, China, Korea and Latin America, and the team worked together to launch this product and we are very excited about all the features it has which is softness, skin protection, plant-based liner, a lot of free forms that make it more attractive to the consumer and then obviously the standout designs. Olivia? Olivia Tong : Sorry, I was on mute. Just following up on Huggies Special Delivery, I know it's only been on shelf for a short time but any early color on retailer feedback so far? And did pipeline fill help at all in the quarter? Mike Hsu : Yes, there is probably a little bit of pipeline, it's still relatively - we are still relatively early, so I wouldn't say the pipeline was huge and then again in the quarter. But retailer response has been very positive. I think they're very excited about obviously a look in the product quality and so got the expectations for Special Delivery. We are excited about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with the Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey, great. Thank you both. Just a quick follow-up on pulp. Maria, we have heard from others the idea of expected deflation from where we are now in the near-term followed by some level of tightening later in the year and into 2020. Is that your expectation as well or do you have an alternative view on where the underlying commodities trend? Mike Hsu : That would be consistent with what we see and saying, Steve. Steve Powers : Okay. Mike Hsu : It's a little too early for us to talk about 2020 but we see those same forecast. Steve Powers : Okay. Just to be clear, it's fair to assume that sort of embedded in the planning process? Mike Hsu : Yes. Maria Henry : Yes. Steve Powers : Okay. Alright, great. And then, I guess, another follow-up on the reinvestments you are making above and beyond the incentive comp that you called out. It sounds like for the year it's mostly marketing with a bit more in people, processes and tools to further the ROIs you have been seeing and maybe counter some level of presumed competitive action as the industry benefits from costs. But Mike, in the past, we have also talked about Kimberly-Clark maybe being in a position to make some more assertive investments and assertive leading-edge investments in opportunity markets like India going forward, just a position in the company better for long-term growth. How are you thinking about that? Where do those types of initiatives rank in terms of the prioritization for future investment dollars? Mike Hsu : Yes. Great question, Steve. And obviously, I think, as I mentioned earlier, I think what is changed over the past six months or so is the category conditions make investments, I think, more worthwhile or more productive, and we are seeing some of that across multiple markets. Most of the current investment that we are talking about for the second half is going into digital and capability building around revenue growth management and sales execution. So those are the near-term focus areas, but we do believe we have great opportunity to enhance our investment and categories, let's say, adult care globally, baby wipes, and then in markets like India. And so, working through those as a team, and I think we have got a lot of good opportunities to invest into and accelerate growth. Steve Powers : Okay. I will pass it on. Thanks. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi. Good morning and congrats on a good execution quarter. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Steve. Steve Strycula : So, a few quick questions. For Maria, I think I heard you say that on manufacturing expenses were going to be tracking a little bit higher than you expected versus the start of the year. What is driving it? I haven't heard a lot of other companies really speak to that. Maria Henry : Sure. There is a number of items that affect what we call other manufacturing costs, which are general expenses that hit us in our manufacturing operations. They include things like fixed cost absorption, labor rate changes and inflation, product improvement investments and other one-time types of impacts such as write-offs or start-up costs associated with new equipment. It's not unusual that this is an inflationary area for us, but it is running a bit higher than we expected when we came into the year. Specifically, for the second quarter, we saw increases across all of those levers. We talked about our volumes being off a bit, which leads to fixed cost absorption impact. With our labor rates, all the inflation that we are seeing particularly out of Latin America affects the cost there. And then, one area which has a question on investment, one area where we are investing is in product improvement and we are investing there behind the innovations that we have been talking about. And those increased investments in product quality and improvements in innovation flowed through that line item. So that is what is going on there. And I would point to the fixed cost under absorption in the product investments as two of the drivers. Steve Strycula : Okay. And as a follow up to that, if we think about the $150 million reduction to your initial inflation outlook. That is about $0.33 to earnings or 5 percentage points to EBIT dollars. And it feels like you are flowing through about a third of that to shareholders. So is it, Mike, that we just - this is a really good opportunity to address the wish list of things that you have that are actionable right now in the marketplace, including increasing on bonuses and why not out there or is this just conservatism as we think about the back half? Mike Hsu : Yes, I mean, I you know, I think that our mass was somewhere between - flown through between a third to a half. But again, I think, part of it is the market opportunity and we think the conditions are good for us to invest. The brands are responding, and it's going to be productive for long-term health of the business. And so that is what we are doing that. Some of the comp stuff is more formulaic. Last year we were cutting comp and this year, it's just a math formula but it goes back up. So - but really the focus for us is about brand reinvestment in both, as Maria said, and products in the digital or in the marketing spending and then in some of the capability built. Maria Henry : Yes. I think if you took compensation aside, it would look a bit more like two-thirds flowing through. Steve Strycula : Okay. And to close out, Mike, can you just walk us through a few of the key geographies as to what is happening on the constant currency basis across Brazil, Argentina and China? Can you touch on at a high level on a few of them, just give us a little bit more texture as to what is happening in those markets? Mike Hsu : Yes. Very solid growth. I think, in Brazil, double digit growth overall net selling price and mix were up in the teens. Volume was about down slightly, I would say, or almost even. Overall in Brazil, I think the market price has generally moved, although some local competitors have been lagging. The better expected than expected volume performance really is related to great execution. And when I say execution, it is the whole ball of wax, meaning it's the innovation, it's the marketing and then it's the selling. And all those things are working well for us. In addition, I think in a market like Brazil or Latin America more broadly, we have got very developed plans to expand kind of the categories in adult care and wipes and that is paying off this year. Argentina, I guess, I would say, high double digit organic growth. The volume decline was in the, I think, mid single digit level. So you could - again, you could chalk it up the same thing, which is I think the consumer has kind of reset their expectations for price, but also very strong end market execution of the teams to kind of reduce the volume impact that you would have expected from that level of pricing. So, Latin America, very strong performance from a revenue perspective. Central and Eastern Europe up almost 20% or a little bit over 20%, very strong performance in Ukraine and CIS. Russia continues to grow at a very good pace for us, although I will tell you, our share are little bit more under pressure there than we have experienced over the prior couple of years. But the formula there is also same thing, it'll be refrain innovation, marketing and greater in-market execution. ASEAN, up double digits. So we are feeling good about most of D&E markets. Steve Strycula : Great, thank you. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Stephen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie Capital. Caroline Levy : Good morning. Thank you so much. I have kind of a fun one first, which is, I was very surprised to see a black diaper package. Are young families no longer doing blue and pink for their babies, bedrooms and stuff? So if you could just talk about the logic behind black packaging? Mike Hsu : Yes, Caroline, interesting, Yes. I was saying we have got some new hands on the business. I think that the team is attuned with kind of what millennial mom is looking for. The black packaging kind of is striking off the shelf. I will tell you, we have gotten strong retailer response to it. It is the first black packaging in the category and for us in the diaper category. Obviously, we have been black for a while in the fem care category. So, I think it's so far early returns I would say, even though it's too early to really say. But it's doing its job, which is it striking it's shelf. And it's got a great shelf impression. And I would say overall, a more contemporary look and feel. And I think we are trying to address millennial mom, and so far it seems like it's heading in the right direction. Caroline Levy : Excellent. Thank you. So I wanted to just talk birth rates. I mean, I remember maybe a year-ago you are talking about a shocking decline in South Korea. We are reading about North America seeing birth rate declines. And yet you are able to put up some really good numbers despite that in some of your - in Sydney and North America. What do you think is going on and how do you deal with that as a long-term trend? Mike Hsu : Yes. Still a decline, maybe a little less shocking than the numbers that you may recall. South Korea, I think a couple of years ago, it was a low double digit decline. I think this year it looks like maybe about a high single digit. So that is an improvement, but it's still down. And the driver in South Korea is slower family formation. I mean, in fact, marriages are still down. So, I think, that is when - that South Korea and North America similar birth rate has improved, but it's still down about in 2018 our estimates are down about 2%. And so, I think, in big developed markets, I think that is a trend that we have to deal with. And that is why you are seeing Huggies Special Delivery or some of the things we are trying to address. The big thing about Special Delivery is, it sells at a significant premium to all the other products in the category. And the reason we feel good about that, and it's pretty well tested, it's got a lot of benefits that consumers are looking for. And that falls in line with the strategy we are really driving, which is elevate the core, which is - you have got, in big developed markets, the way to grow them is to drive premiumization. But the only way to make premiumization work is if you make the products work more and worth paying that premium for and that is what we are trying to do. Caroline Levy : Excellent. Thank you. And just regional pushback. I mean, you have talked about the fact that you haven't seen competitor dynamics change around the price increases. But I think there is quite a bit of fear that as retailers continue to try to compete with Amazon, they may come back to the manufacturers as costs come down and push back. Can you just address that? And this is history. Are you seeing anything different? Mike Hsu : I don't know that we are seeing anything different. I think that is an ongoing issue, Caroline, in the industry. But it's also one that those of us who've been around for a long time have been dealing with for a long time. And so we are used to this dynamic and managing through it. I will say, like most retailers that we deal with, they're mostly interested in driving growth. And so, while they may not like pricing in some categories or some retailers, they do like growth. And so that is where we are focused on working with them and partnering on the right way to grow the category. Caroline Levy : Got it. And just my last one, on K-C Professional, your Western Central Europe volume was down 8%. Can you just talk to what is going on there? Mike Hsu : Yes. The biggest driver in KCP and I would say another solid quarter for K-C Professional organic overall was up 1% in North American developing in emerging markets were up 2%. I think the biggest thing is we are leading price in, you know, with our leadership position in KCP generally, not all markets have followed, but we feel like this is the right move for us and we recognize as a little stickiness competitively and there is going to be some volume impacts. Caroline Levy : So you think that is temporary? Mike Hsu : Yes. Well, we will see if it's temporary, but it's something that we are prepared to kind of deal with as we work through the year. Paul Alexander : Caroline, I think what I would add to that is, focused on the net of price mix and volume, especially in that market. And if you do that across developed markets, we were down about 1%. Caroline Levy : Got it, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Good morning, everyone. Hey, Mike, congrats on a good result this quarter. Not to beat a dead horse, but I wanted to ask the question on the reinvestment a little bit differently. So the context, of course, company's results have not been when you have hoped over the past three years. So far so good first half of this year. But even, Mike, like as we look at the Nielsen data of market share trends, I suspect in the U.S. still not quite where you would hope. So the question is, as you are working through the quarter and thinking about how the business is progressing, what the guidance is going to be with pulp prices rolling over was there any thought to investing all of the upside to try to sustain the top-line, which arguably is going to drive the most value for shareholders over time? So the question is really around the adequacy of the reinvestment and how you were thinking about that because when we met with you early in the year, the thinking was, you were not going to do any sort of earnings reset because you didn't necessarily see the innovation pipeline sort of justifying it. So, sorry for going on a bit, but it's really around the adequacy of the reinvestment as you saw it and balancing that with the earnings flow through. And then, I have one follow up. Mike Hsu : Yes. Kevin, I'm really glad you raised that. That is one area we have got to really focus on. And if there is one part of the quarter that we need to improve on is our share results, and we are a little bit behind what our expectations are. Part of that is related toward leading price or being first mover on price in a lot of our markets and categories. And so, we were in some ways expecting some share impact due to that. However, it's also a big reason why we wanted to drive this reinvestment here to shore up our share positions and make sure we are healthy for the long-term. I think we laid out on our Casey strategy 2022 that we are going to deliver our balanced value creation plan. And we think that this is an example of that. Kevin Grundy : Okay. Alright. Fair enough, I can leave that, I guess. And then separately, you guys, of course, in tuck in M&A sort of picked up a bit here in the HPC space, particularly with an emphasis on personal care, largely skin care. Kimberly, of course, has not been very active on the M&A front in the past. And Mike, I think your commentary earlier was, we probably should not expect much of a change. I just wanted to kind of revisit that in the current environment. Is that still the course we should really sort of expect investment behind the business and returning cash to shareholders? Mike Hsu : Yes, I don't think we would expect a significant change versus what we told you earlier this year. I mean, we like our categories. We still think there is a lot of growth potential in our categories, especially when you look at both our opportunity to elevate the categories and also to grow in D&E. However, we are going to continue to look at opportunities and we do that consistently. We have got a - it may not appear to be, but we have got a very active M&A and development team that is always looking at opportunities for us. Kevin Grundy : Mike, would you care to comment just on what specific areas and or geographies? Mike Hsu : Maybe I will pass for now, Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Okay. I thought I would try. Alright. Thank you. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue. Paul Alexander : Alright. We appreciate everyone's questions today and thanks to the support from our shareholders. And we will speak with you next quarter. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you.

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning's remarks, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's third quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here is the agenda for the call. Maria will begin with a review of third quarter results. Mike will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook. We will finish with Q&A. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I will turn the call over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 4% driven by higher net selling prices. We achieved strong margin improvement and growth in adjusted earnings per share while increasing brand investment. And finally, we are on track with our overall capital plan and we continue to return cash to shareholders.  Now let's look at the details of our results starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's up more than 1% versus year ago and increased the two point drag from currency rate. Organic sales were up 4%. Net selling price increased 4% and product mix improve one point while volume sale 1% . Mike will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes.  Moving on to profitability, third quarter adjusted gross margin was 35.8%, up a strong 260 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 9% with selling prices well ahead of currency headwinds. We generated solid total cost saving of $95 million from our course FORCE and Restructuring program. Year-to-date cost savings are now $300 million. And is more likely that full year saving will be towards the low end of our $400 million to $450 million target range. Within that, our Restructuring is expected to over deliver while FORCE savings are anticipated to be below plan. On FORCE, performance has been solid in most businesses this year. That said, we were below plan in North America for our supply chain is facing tight capacity and higher than expected demand. At the same time, they were executing our restructuring activities. Commodities turned favorable in the quarter, and were a modest benefit of $10 million. This is the first time in almost three years that we've seen commodity deflation. Other manufacturing costs also increased in the quarter compared to a relatively modest level last year. Moving further down the P&L. Between-the-line spending was up 130 basis points as a percent of sales. That included higher advertising as we continue to invest more behind our brands particularly in digital marketing. SG&A expense also increased compared to a relatively low spending in the year ago quarter, and included higher incentive compensation expense. We're also starting to make investments to improve our commercial capabilities to drive future growth. Most of our investments for 2019 will occur in the fourth quarter. Foreign currencies were also a headwind in the quarter, reducing operating profit by a mid-single digit rate. All-in-all, adjusted profit was up 8%. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 18.5%, up a 110 basis points versus year ago. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.84, up 8% year-on-year. A higher adjusted effective tax rate was essentially offset by higher equity incomes and a lower share count. Now let's look at cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $886 million, compared to $692 million in the year ago quarter. As expected, this was a strong quarter including improved working capital and lower pension contributions. Capital spending was $298 million in the quarter. That's up versus last year driven by supply chain restructuring projects. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. Third quarter dividends and share repurchases total approximately $570 million and we expect the full-year amount will be $2.2 billion. Looking at our segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales were up 5%; net selling prices increased 3% and volumes and product mix were each up one point. Personal Care operating margins were 21.3%, up 60 basis points year-on-year. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth and cost savings. In Consumer Tissue, organic sales were up 3%; net selling prices increased 5% while volumes fell two points. Consumer Tissue operating margins were 17.8%, up 340 basis points versus year ago with significant benefits from higher pricing along with cost savings and modest economy deflation. In K-C Professional, organic sales grew 3%; selling prices rose more than 3% and product mix improved one point, while volumes were down 2%. K-C Professional operating margins of 21% were up 210 basis points versus prior year. The improvement was driven by higher net selling prices and cost savings. Overall, it was a strong quarter and I am pleased that we are in a position to raise our outlook while we invest in the business for the long term. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying, I'm pleased with our third quarter results. We achieved stronger improvement on organic sales margins and earnings per share. We continue to launch innovations, invest more on our brands and pursue our growth priorities. We also return significant cash to shareholders. As Maria just mentioned, we delivered 4% organic sales growth in the quarter. Our pricing initiatives are on track and driving our growth. We also continue to improve product mix which was up one point for the third consecutive quarter. Encouragingly, the pricing of promotion environment remains broadly constructive. Let me share some of the top-line highlights for the quarter starting in North America. Organic sales in consumer products increased 4% and within that organic sale rose 4% in Personal Care and 3% in Consumer Tissue. Growth in North America was driven by 4% higher selling prices led by Consumer Tissue. Mix was up point and led by Huggies diapers which included modest benefits from the launch of Huggies Special Delivery. Volumes were down one point overall. Adult care volumes were up double digits. Poise and Depend had strong momentum driven by product innovation, marketing investment and robust consumer demand. Baby and child care volumes were down mid-single digits compared to a mid-single digit increased last year. Results this year included softness on baby wipes and Huggies snug and dry diapers. In North America, K-C Professional organic sales increased 5% and growth was driven by continued strong price realization while category volumes remain sluggish. Now turning to developing in emerging markets, our performance was solid with organic sales growth of 5%. That included two points a growth from Argentina. Now in terms of our key personal care businesses, in China, organic sales were up mid-teens compared to a soft performance last year. Sales were up double digits in both diapers and femcare and in diapers, our net pricing was helped by reduced and more targeted promotional spending. In addition, innovations we launched on premium Huggies are delivering strong growth and improving mix. In femcare, our innovation and premiumization strategy supported by great digital marketing continue to deliver strong results. In ASEAN, organic sales rose high single digits led by Huggies in Vietnam. In Eastern Europe, organic sales increased high teens with healthy gains in volume and pricing. Growth was strong in both Huggies and Kotex reflecting excellent sales execution, winning innovation and strong marketing. In Brazil, organic sales were up mid-single digits compared to high teens growth last year, as we're starting to lap the price increases we took in 2018. We've also modestly increased promotion support to enhance our competitive position. Growth this quarter was relatively balanced between pricing and volume with volume growth led by adult care and feminine care. We experienced softer results in Latin America outside of Argentina and Brazil and that included Peru where sales were down in a challenging environment. And as a result, we've dialed back the price increase we took earlier this year and we've launched a value to your diaper. Overall, I am broadly encouraged by performance in D&E markets and remain optimistic about our future growth prospects. Finally, in developed markets outside North America organic sales were up 1% with solid performance in South Korea and Australia. Beyond sales, I'm pleased with the margin and cash flow improvement we delivered in the quarter. Our teams are working hard on both those fronts. Turning to the full year, we're raising our outlook on both the top and bottom line. Our revised organic sales growth target is 3% to 4% which compares favorably to our prior target of 3%. While we're up 4% year-to-date, the fourth quarter is our toughest quarterly comp of the year. That said, we expect a solid fourth quarter which should bring the full year well within the 3% to 4% range. On the bottom line, we're now targeting adjusted earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.90 that's $0.10 per share higher than our prior outlook. I'm pleased that we're increasing our outlook while we continue to invest for future success. I know many of you are starting to look ahead the next year and so I'll briefly comment on 2020. Our teams have recently started planning for next year. And in terms of the external operating environment we'll be operating in, we're encouraged with commodity cost trends. On the other hand, currencies remain volatile in recent forward rates imply headwinds to the next year, especially in Latin America. We'll continue to closely watch global economic conditions which in general suggest slower growth going forward. At this point, we're focused on building a robust plan for next year that's consistent with our balanced approach to value creation. One that includes higher growth investments in generally aligns with our K-C strategy 2022 financial objectives. As a reminder, those objectives are 1% to 3% growth in organic sales and mid-single digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. Certainly things could evolve in the next three months but in the broad terms that's how we're currently thinking about next year. We will provide our specific outlook in January. In summary, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making in 2019, while we invest more to enable longer term success. We're confident in our ability to deliver balanced a sustainable growth and create shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks and now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. BonnieHerzog: Good morning. Hi. I have a question on pricing in the US. I guess I'd love to hear your outlook for pricing especially as you guys are starting to lap some of the price increases you've taken over the last year. So just like to hear from your perspective if you are concerned at all that we might see pricing stagnate or even rollback, again given we're not seeing as much commodity pressures we saw last year or do you think you've got some pricing power to put through another modest increase later this year possibly early next year? Thanks. MikeHsu: Yes. Bonnie, overall, I think your question was regarding North America specifically. Overall, obviously we're on track for this year. Volumes better than our plan which we feel good about where we are. I think we should going forward is there may not be as much list pricing extra given where the commodity environment is. We're not really seeing downward promotional pressure at this point. So I think though the category remains relatively stable, robust and consumer demand remains healthy. I think going forward whether or not there is list pricing being-- one of the things I mentioned in our K-C strategy 2022 is our kind of commercial capabilities as I'm calling them. One area which is revenue growth management and we're really emphasizing driving that revenue realization, whether that comes from list or it comes from trade efficiencies or price tax what I might say price pack changes .So those are areas I think we're going to continue to push globally to kind of drive revenue growth of whether or not there may be list pricing. BonnieHerzog: Okay. So it's more revenue management and not a function of price mix. if I hear you correctly? MikeHsu: Revenue mix, yes for sure. BonnieHerzog: Yes, okay. And then if I may just ask a second one on, you're developing an emerging market growth. So it looks like it moderated a bit sequentially. So could you walk through the key drivers of this? And then separately most of the growth in you're developing in emerging markets, it still seems to be coming from pricing and really not from volume. So how much of this has been a response to FX headwinds and then do you expect volume growth to re-accelerate here, especially given your volume comps across the emerging markets should be relatively easy? Thanks. MikeHsu: Yes. Bonnie, great question. We feel really great, very good about D&E growth. I think that demand remains robust. We are cycling our pricing that was pretty strong in the second half last year, particularly in Latin America. Just for reference, we're up 7% year-to-date in DNA, up five in a quarter and it's five consecutive quarter, quarters of mid to high single digit growth for us in DNA. So I think we feel very good about the progress we're making. We are seeing double-digit growth in multiple markets including Central and Eastern Europe. China now importantly on both diapers and femcare. Our ASEAN business was up high single digits. And Latin America overall was up high single digits. And even excluding a market like Argentina which has a lot of list pricing but Brazil in the quarter was up mid-single digits with volume up as well. And so I think we internally we have a lot of emphasis on driving volume. Certainly, we have some benefits from pricing this year, but we feel good about the innovation that we're launching this year that's getting traction. We feel great of our about our investments in advertising particularly on the digital side, which we continue to increase our investment in. And so part of the plan is you may not expect to have this level of pricing every year, but we are looking at drive and earn our growth going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers with the Deutsche Bank. StevePowers: Thanks. Good morning. Hi. So to follow up on Bonnie's question ,the gross margin and commodification that you're seeing now is great as is the pricing resiliency. But as we look to next year especially with the market concerned about potential economic slowing as you had mentioned, Mike. Does this year's gross margin upside increase the odds at all of competitive activity in the year ahead? And how do you monitor that risk from where you sit? MikeHsu: Yes. I think any prudent person would say that could happen. I would say largely I think we've said on previous calls, the commodity inflation that's occurred has been a multi-year effect. Multi-year impact and so we're only now recovering margins from where they were from a couple of years ago. So from our side I wouldn't expect us to be very aggressive on price points going forward. But certainly we'll want to be competitive. And then as we think about next year, I think we do believe commodities are stabilizing a bit and maybe we'll be less of a factor for next year. But we still expect to see some modest pricing carryover effects from this year into next year, at least in the beginning. StevePowers: Okay. Great. And then as this quarter began, you welcomed Alison Lewis aboard as Chief Growth Officer. Can you talk a bit more about her role and her mandate and how perhaps her presence is expected to influence the planning process as you plot out 2020? MikeHsu: Yes. We're really excited about Alison coming on board. We feel very fortunate to have her and she brings a wealth of experience from some great companies and has great background both innovation, marketing, digital spaces. And all the areas that we're trying to grow. She -- her title is Chief Growth Officer that encompasses our marketing and our commercial functions, which include kind of our global sales. We don't have -- it's not a global sales organization, but it's a kind of center of excellence that going to drive better sales capability, revenue growth management, and digital and in our innovation. So aside from that she's got that all the functions that you might attach to a CMO as well. So we feel great about it. She's bringing a lot of thinking that's I would say additive to kind of how we're thinking about things. And she's going to bring a lot of expertise and an insight. So great start, we're really excited about it. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. LaurenLieberman: Hi. Good morning. First thing I just wanted to follow up on was the mention of capacity constraints in North America. And do you just -- what business that's been in where that surprise has been? That's my first question. MariaHenry: Yes. The North America system is running at very high capacity levels. And it is across the segments, Lauren, in the consumer business. The high capacity is or high utilization rates are one of the drivers that are affecting our FORCE cost savings in the quarter. Typically, you like to run it at very high capacity utilization, but it does limit your flexibility when volume comes in stronger than you anticipated. And so we're seeing some additional costs as the North America team looks to maintain high service levels, deliver on the volume that is coming in and that's one of the factors that's showing up with the lower FORCE cost savings in the quarter. LaurenLieberman: Okay. Great. And then I want to also follow up on D&E market because at least the way that we've been tracking it, it looks like where there was maybe a little bit of away disappointment in the quarter by my reckoning anyway was in KCP in the D&E markets because consumer tissue and personal care continued to be pretty solid performance as we've seen for several quarters now. But KCP slowed pretty materially being flat. So can you just talk a little bit about what's going on in that business? If this is sort of intentionally stepping away from major maybe lower margin business or if it's macro volatility and because that was I think more of a factor in the quarter than I would have expected. Thanks. MikeHsu: Yes. Thanks, Lauren. Overall, I think we feel very good about KCP. I think it was real strong performance in North America, solid quarter overall, but D&E was about flat on organic for the quarter. I think nothing really systemic there. In fact, actually our leader there has a real emphasis on expanding D&E going forward. We feel like we have a lot of good growth opportunity. We've got a couple major projects to kind of dress a couple key markets for us which include Brazil and China for us. So I think we're very bullish about the D&E overall for KCP, but just a little softness in the quarter but nothing systemic there. We were really pleased with our 5% growth in North America which I would tell you is a great result in a market where category actually -- category demand is actually softened from what we can tell in the categories. So I think that the strategy of kind of elevating these categories with our premium products is working fairly well. LaurenLieberman: Okay. Great. And then I wanted to also just talk a little bit about the longer term and reinvestment. Because you mentioned when you're talking about the sort of preliminary outlook or just conversation points around next year, you've got encouraged by commodities. Of course, the FX headwinds as we can all see higher growth investments which you've already spoken to and sort of articulating your vision and sort of long-term plan. And but I was curious if you talk about sort of maybe top three priorities for reinvestment? So degree of granular you can. Is it salesforce capabilities in the US? For example, but any kind of thought process around the top three priorities for investment and to what degree that's getting started like you said in the fourth quarter of this year and should start to see results as we go into 2020. MikeHsu: Yes. Great question. Thanks for holding us accountable. I think the one, I'd say a couple things which is I think that things have changed a lot over the past for the course let's say 12 to 18 months. And I think we feel very good about reinvesting more in our businesses. A couple of key factors is certainly I think you mentioned in your note this morning which is the market environments much more conducive to investment, given kind of the competitive environment, I think it's giving an opportunity from marketing innovation to breathe. And so we're finding that investments we are making in marketing are more productive. Investments we're making innovation are more productive. So that's probably the first big thing. And so certainly if you follow that line of logic then one key area for us is to invest more in digital, which is very high return for us. We're making a lot of progress there. And we're up in our capability. I'd say it's multiple markets and not only kind of our high kind of e-commerce markets, a more broadly overall across markets.  Second, we are investing in capability. I talked a lot about with Bonnie about revenue growth management. A very important capability for us, helped us realize all this pricing this year. But if there's not as much list pricing going forward it becomes a little harder. And so we have to up the capability of the organization. We've been investing this year in training and development and tools to help our organization do that. And then the third key area is the product investments. And that's kind of the lifeblood of our business is that innovation we feel very positive about the innovation that we've been launching. The 5D core diaper in China is doing very, very well. We just launched special delivery although it's just gaining distribution now. So it's too early to tell, but we're very excited about the prospects for that in our business. And so I think those are probably the three big areas. And then when I might add is I mentioned in my prepared remarks a couple hotspots in areas that we want to address to improve our share performance. I mentioned Peru in our prepared remarks. Snug & Dry, North America just as always you're going to have some businesses. They're going to need a little bit more work or investment and those are some targets for us. LaurenLieberman: Okay. And is there just as you're looking forward, is there any reason-- you're talking in a fairly conservative way I would think around the commodity environment. And tailwind should be material as we go into next year at least on pulp. So does anything you can offer as to why that might not be the case? MariaHenry: Yes. I think it's too early to give a confirmed outlook on 2020, Lauren, there. We look at the forward curves in addition to looking at the spot rates. We've seen some estimates that have commodities above where spot is today. But we'll have to wait and see. And we'll give you our perspective when we get to January. MikeHsu: And, Lauren, if I would just build on that briefly. Some of the things that are not quite as visible in the marketplace, but where we're experiencing pretty good levels of the inflation this year includes local costs in Latin America just as businesses like ours are raising prices, our suppliers are also raising prices. And that's a factor in the results this year. Where that is next year we'll see, we'll give you our perspective in January. And then also distribution costs continue to run higher year-over-year this year both in Latin America and really globally around the world. So where that ends up again will give you a better visibility in January but those are two factors that are certainly inflationary this year that you may not see fully. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. JasonEnglish: Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for taking my question. I want to come back to is Lauren's question on the capacity tightness. And, Maria, your answer, you mentioned that it's both tissue and personal care. I love to understand more what's going on in tissue because your volume has been down 2% in 2017 in North America; 2% in 2018, tracking down 5% year-to-date. So in context to the sort of multiyear volume erosion what's led to capacity tightness in that network? And the second sort of derivative question is, is this really just a byproduct of your reorganization and how many plants that you've targeted right I think there's eight maybe that you've announced or identified. How many of those sit within the North America tissue network? MariaHenry: Sure. They are very related, Jason, on the tissue side of the house as we've been executing changes to get pricing into the market that is one of the factors that is driving the utilization rates and the capacity within our tissue plant to execute against the volume demand. The Restructuring is also a major factor in what's happening in the supply chain in North America as we execute some facility shutdowns. We re standing up additional capacity in various places across the network. So if you think about everything that's moving in North America with the pricing changes that we're making, the restructuring activities that we have going on; the innovations that we have going into the market there, there's a lot going on right now in the North America Network and obviously executing the restructuring with excellence and expeditiously is a high priority for a business. In terms of the plant closures, we've announced seven of approximately 10 that we intend to close. One of them is our Fullerton operation, which is a tissue manufacturing facility out in California for North America. MikeHsu: Yes. And just to pile on, Jason. So as Maria said, we like, we prefer to run at high utilization. And it doesn't leave you a whole lot of wiggle room in your base date. and then when you're working through a restructuring, you are building inventory to kind of move the tissue asset or move production over. At the same time, when volume is a little bit better than your plan to kind of add to a triple witching event. And so we got a great team. I would say these are not systemic issues. But we're just putting a lot of challenges on them and we'll work through it. I would tell you that some of these cost issues, they're not going to be systemic. But they do reflect some of the operational difficulties that you might have. JasonEnglish: That's helpful. One follow-on just to help me consider understand how the restructuring fits in with all this. You step back and it's been a little surprising for us to see you and not defending market share a bit more aggressively in tissue. But then you mentioned your tie-down capacity and you're actually working to shut down more capacity. Is there a concerted effort here to actually shrink your tissue business volumetrically to get to a more profitable base going forward? MariaHenry: No. There isn't. What -- the net result will be that we continue to have strong capacity in the tissue business. The more productive assets are the assets that we will be continuing to run and some of the less productive assets are the ones that will be taking out of the system. But overall, we are not looking to reduce volume in our tissue business. MikeHsu: Yes. Jason, our teams would be really upset with us if we told them to shrink share a little bit. So we recognize actually share this year is probably one of the areas we really want to improve on. That's one of the reasons why we want to reinvest. So we're a little light in some areas and we'll work on our way back there. And that's why we want to make some of the investments we are making. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. AndreaTeixeira: Hi. Good morning. How are you? So I wanted to go back to 2020 initial guide. So it seems to me and your stock obviously is getting impacted now when you say you gave the initial outlook of I think the long-term is 1% to 3% organic growth. And correct me if I'm wrong if that changed with you are changed now to the 4%. And the mid-single digit EPS seems to me a bit conservative given that you're going to be lapping all these challenges in commodities. And you inflected, as a matter of fact you inflected the commodities finally this quarter. So me -- I understand when you're coming from the price increase, but the price increase it was about like 100 bps or something in some of the areas. So I was just wondering if you can kind of unpack that long-term and why giving us that outlook if you're still moving - still looking at the commodities. And how the commodities will play out for next year? So I just wanted to, if you can unpack both the top line and the bottom line. Thank you. MikeHsu: Yes. Andrea, I think we came out in January with under K-C strategy 2022 kind of targets for us which we said organically was 1% to 3% and mid single digits on organic and then mid-single digits on the EPS line. And so we just put those out in January. We still think those are the right ones for us. We recognized that we had a little benefit with some commodity easing perhaps this year. But on a long-term basis, we still see the fundamentals of our business kind of tracking toward that. And so we are working towards that and that's how we're thinking about our plan. Certainly next year we think commodities are less of a factor. But we still have some FX issues particularly in Latin America. And we'll be working through those. So that's how we think about 2020. I don't know, Maria, you want to add anything to that. MariaHenry: Yes, no. I think that's right and the midterm algorithms that we discussed with K-C 2022 on the top line is also informed by what we're expecting for the market growth rate and is reflective of that. AndreaTeixeira: Sorry if we can go back to China, if I can squeeze that commentary on baby diapers and also the commentary on incontinence. like if you can talk to us like how that is inflecting and how you're seeing that thing out into 2020? MikeHsu: Sorry, Andrea, about diapers and incontinence -- MariaHenry: In China. AndreaTeixeira: Yes. In China, yes. MikeHsu: Yes. Overall, I'd say diapers, we're excited about our 5D diaper, and it's off to a very good start. Overall, I think in China right now shares overall flat. I'd say we're growing at a strong pace, double-digit rate and the value in the premium tiers and then down a bit in the value tiers which is aligned with our strategy. But we think one of the key things about China we're saying is I think the terms of competition of a game is shifting back to innovation, which I think is important and good in the market in which consumers want a better product.  We feel like we have very good products and if not the best products that are in the market there. So we feel great about that. Adult incontinence for us is still a huge opportunity. It's a relatively small category in China, but I think ripe for development and we're increasing our focus there. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. AliDibadj: Hey, guys. So I want to go back to a couple things. One is around the cost savings efforts and it's really rare to see you go to the lower end of any cost savings plan like you're doing FORCE even more broadly. And to Jason's question, I think it was around the implications of perhaps, I think you are getting to consumer tissue volumes down and still having capacity issues i.e. maybe you've gone too far at least my interpretation of the subtext there. How do you get comfortable that perhaps the cost savings and the shutting down the plants from the restructuring or anything else just isn't going too far and you might have kind of pushed a little bit. I know it's a question we've asked all of us for many, many years but this is really the -- a really big sign here particularly given the tissue volumes are down. And in that area you're running it too high of a capacity. MariaHenry: Yes. I think, overall, we think that the plans that we have and that we're executing on the restructuring are completely appropriate, Ali. I think that working through a restructuring of this size at the same time that there are a lot of other factors going on in the supply chain network is certainly not an easy task. So as we get through the execution period on the supply chain restructuring. It's not totally surprising that there are some challenges around flexibility. And that's what you're seeing here. In terms of the savings, I think the total savings are solid and when you look at the details of it, our teams are delivering on savings from product optimization, savings from productivity and waste improvements. We talked about coming into the year that on the savings front, we would have lower negotiated price savings associated with our long-term contract. So that's been flowing through the numbers this year. The other thing I say is that the numbers outside of North America where we've been talking about some supply chain challenges are strong on FORCE. So good savings across the globe and the challenges that we're having in North America with the high utilization rates just mean that we're incurring more costs to meet stronger volumes than we anticipated, maintain the service levels and so that's what's really going on. I think importantly, we still see lots of opportunity for productivity in our supply chain. And so we're working through a lot of things this year with a lot of moving pieces. We're focused on getting that restructuring executed and on the personal care side, we'll be adding some capacity into the network and that will catch things up on the North America side of the house. But overall the teams are doing a good job executing it. There continues to be strong opportunity in the supply chain. And I think when we have completed the restructuring program, we're going to be in a good place. MikeHsu: Yes. And overall I think restructuring, Ali, I'd say we're moving out of higher-cost locations into more efficient locations that will deliver low, total deliver cost lower. AliDibadj: Okay. So just a playback so I'm dead clear on this. You anticipated more than a negative for volume and consumer tissue in North America. So some more worse than that and that's why you have this capacity constraint. And as we go forward FORCE and cost savings we should be very surprised if there's a slowdown in that pace in 2020 or beyond. Is that the right playback? MariaHenry: But I haven't given any numbers specifically for 2020 but what I will tell you is that there continues to be opportunity for additional productivity out of our global supply chain. AliDibadj: Okay. Thank you. And then on pricing just two vectors on that. Would love your guidance historical perspective on what happens to pricing when commodities look like they're doing what they're doing now. Certainly my perspective from outside in view is it's not just a possibility but it's a likelihood that the pricing comes down, particularly in tissue perhaps a little bit less than diapers in North America. So love your perspective there and then secondly on pricing. The word that everybody is using and certainly used over the past several months is premiumization in the whole industry. But I always find your guide is sense of this is really useful in the lens for the whole industry which is how should we think about premiumization in a world between North America where the consumer may actually be slowing down again over the next few years. And does that raise risk profiles of a lot of Kimberly-Clark and other companies as such. MikeHsu: Yes. I mean, Ali, I think you know, we're very focused on having the right value proposition. And so I do personally believe premiumization is the path that a company like ours needs to take globally. I think certainly holds in a core market like the US, but certainly D&E and many D&E markets are ready for that too. But we're going to keep our sharp eye on kind of having the right value proposition for the consumer. And so therefore for us premiumization means we're going to earn it by making the products perform better or do more for the consumer. So that's the first part of it. I'd say with regard to the first part of your question and when the commodities ease, I'd say part maybe the first part is that this has been a multiyear issue. And so we're still well above kind of some of the commodity levels that we were a couple years ago. And so and still recovering the margins. That said in the past and I've been around long enough seven years now. long enough to see couple cycles of this. And we have seen a little bit more promoted activity when you get some long-term deflation. I'd say we're prepared for that. I mean one of the areas in our revenue growth management initiative is we have invested in tools, the capability to let us pick kind of the more efficient events and trade optimization and promotion optimization is a key word for us inside the halls here. And so we'll work through that. But I think we're prepared in either scenario, but right now I think we're seeing pricing and promotion relatively stable in the marketplace right now. AliDibadj: And you're not seeing any incremental questions being raised by retailers for the industry or across the board given perhaps their greater desire for margin in these categories? MikeHsu: I would say no more than the typical. AliDibadj: Okay. MariaHenry: Yes. I just add that while we're all pleased that pulp is deflationary in the quarter. The full year 2019 pulp cost outlook is still above 2017's level and frankly all other years since 2010 with the exception of 2018. So we are happy with the trend but it's still an elevated level. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. OliviaTong: Great. Thanks. I want to talk a lot about specifically about D&E about pricing. Because it sort of feels a little bit like you're knocking on the upper limit that the market can handle on pricing. So can you talk about the outlook there and your overall outlook for D&E going forward? MikeHsu: Yes. I think primarily biggest factor in D&E this quarter was we're starting to cycle or laugh our pricing that we had in Latin America last year. I mean this time last year we launched increasing prices, high single, low double digits and brought that forward being in this year. I think we've rolled over our pricing in a market like Brazil right now. And so you're starting to see that. So I think last quarter in Brazil our organic was up teens, this quarter is up mid-single digits. Still a good number with volume up, but certainly cycling the pricing. And I don't know that we will have cycled the upper limit. There are a lot of factors in play including the FX cost. The inflation internal in the market and the wage inflation that occurs like in a market like Argentina. So I don't think I'll judge on whether we're at a limit or not. But I do think we have cycled a lot of the pricing that we had planned this year. We don't have a lot more going forward for the balance of this year. Olivia? OliviaTong: I am here. So appreciate the answer but just in terms of the offset maybe volume increasing. Is there innovation coming to market or there are other things? Is it -- usually in the second half you've got a little bit more of an innovation heavy period, so just kind of understanding what's coming down the pipe for D&E. MikeHsu: Yes. I think we feel good about what's been in the marketplace and overall for the year, I'd say with the levels of pricing that we have, our volumes overall have been a bit stronger in a market like Brazil with volumes up with pricing last quarter of teens. I think that's a very good result. A lot of that was an artifact of a few things which is one great in market execution. We're expanding distribution on key brands; expanding our presence on key items. And so I think that's driving very good results. We're really growing and expanding the adult care category. The femcare category and the femcare category in Brazil into more geographies. And I think we're up double digits in those categories. And so we're really excited about that progress. Similarly, like in CEE, I'd say it's a combination of innovation and market execution and marketing. This driving high teens organic growth including volume. China, similarly the innovations working in our 5D diaper. We saw return to growth last quarter. It's accelerated this quarter. So overall I think the teams are doing -- been doing a very good job in D&E and are driving the volume with disciplined market execution, innovation and good marketing. OliviaTong: Got it. If I can turn to pulp, obviously, that market is now --the prices there are stabilizing a bit. So could you lock-in more than you typically would at this point in the year in terms of the price on pulp? And what kind of visibility do you have on the cost outlook for yourself in 2020? MariaHenry: Yes. I would remind you that as part of pulp price management strategy, we look to negotiate contracts that are generally a year in term. And we look closely at how we do that and we look at a combination of mechanisms. We consider floors and ceilings. We consider fixed pricing and we balance out how much we look to basically have a hedge on the pricing going into the following year and how much we want to leave flexibility to take advantage of the spot market. So we're working through all of those things. I don't have any specific thing to share with you on how we're thinking about that next for 2020 but when we provide our outlook in January, it'll be reflective of how we land on that. But obviously, we have visibility to spot market and the forward rate curves. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. SteveStrycula: Hi, good morning. So quick clarification question. Can you quantify what Argentina was as an impact for --to the global comp in the quarter? And then I have a follow up question for Maria. MikeHsu: Yes, Steve, it was about two points of our total developing and emerging markets growth, and D&E is about 30% of company\u2019s sales. SteveStrycula: Okay, super helpful. And then Maria, just to kind of piggyback on that last question, if we just assume spot rates just hold where they are for like the next 18 months, so we don't assume it better or worse. Should we think about the fourth quarter being the maximum flow through from call like pulp deflation or should we actually expect that to build further next year as we think about some of these contracts being reset on an annual basis? And then I have one last question for Mike. MariaHenry: Sure. In terms of this year's outlook, our outlook for 2019 is generally aligned with the spot market. And then for next year, as I mentioned earlier, it -- the forecasts are still moving it, Some forecasts have the outlook for next year above spot and there's a lot of factors that are still moving around. So I hate to keep going back to this. But we'll have more to say on that in January, as we continue to lock down our mechanisms for our pulp size into next year. SteveStrycula: Okay. I appreciate that. And then, Mike, fundamentally a lots going right for you this year or for the broader team rather. And one of the few things you mentioned on the call where you would say there's an opportunity for improvement in 2020 is maybe selectively some pockets of market share. Would you kind of comment on your top priorities from like category comp, product or category country combination for next year? And what do you think is like the mechanism of delivery in the form of reinvestment that we need to see to kind of jumpstart the shared trends in this category, country combinations? Thank you. MikeHsu: Yes. Maybe, Steve, great question. I think maybe the caveat or precursor is, we're right in the middle of our plans for 2020 right now. So I actually haven't even seen kind of the detailed role of a 2020 for us yet. Although, I'd say if you look at our business, I\u2019ll start with North America. Overall, I think our shares a little soft than we like this year, although we are seeing sequential progress this quarter. I think the team is feeling very good about the progress they're making especially with the innovation and the marketing plans that they have. So to see an ongoing improvement in North America is a top priority. Certainly we -- usually, we don't get very far into the call before we start talking about China. It remains our biggest growth opportunity, both in the near term and the long term. We're really excited about I think that the progress that the team has made. So our investments in both the product especially in diapers, and then the marketing side, both in diapers and especially in femcare, digital marketing, I think is working really well for us and I think that's really important. I think we've had great growth in Central and Eastern Europe both either double digit growth, whether it's in the 20s, or the high teens for a couple years now, and we feel great about that. So that's continues to be a high priority.  Latin America, as we talked about, I think the Brazil team is doing a great job executing. We have a couple pockets in Latin America, which are important markets for us like Peru that I mentioned, that we're seeing a little increased competition. And so we're going to make sure that we have the right product offering in that market to be competitive and strengthen our position in that marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. KevinGrundy: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Maria. So just to kind of build on the last question. Mike, I'm not sure if you can say much more. But if the question relates to innovation pipeline and adequacy of investments, so when we spoke with you earlier this year and you took over leadership of the company, the comments were you weren't comfortable resetting earnings kind of for the sake of resetting earnings in the absence of having the right sort of innovation pipeline to spend behind. But kind of building on this, we've had a lot of conversations around sort of a lack of satisfaction with your market share trends in the US. Where do you kind of stand now? I mean what is the satisfaction with current investment levels for the company broadly? And then kind of marrying that up with the higher growth investments, in your slides you kind of gave us a few data points qualitatively at least between FX and commodities. And then you did include their higher growth investments looking at the next year. How should we be thinking about that? Is there potential for acceleration relative to what we've seen? And then I have a follow-up. MikeHsu: Yes. I think we've been working on what I would say the commercial capability development of which innovation is a key area. The four pockets that I'll talk about. Innovation, digital, marketing overall but digital especially, revenue growth management and then selling capability or in-market execution. So those are our big four. I will tell you I feel very good about the progress we're making globally across the enterprise in these areas. One of the areas I do think we're making progress is on the innovation front. And I think we're starting to see our team's work much more effectively together across markets to leverage our enterprise scale on technology. And I think that's hitting the market or is going to affect what we're doing in the market. Some of the 5D line that we saw in China was developed by other parts of the world. The Huggies Special delivery that we just launched in North America was jointly developed between Korea, China, Brazil and the US team. And so we're starting to see more of that activity. So suffice it to say we want bigger, more impactful innovation with our consumers. And you'll see more of that going forward. And then in terms of the investment, it's just to support that. Whether it's in the product cost or it's in the marketing of that product. And be more aggressive and how we market that. I think those are areas that we're going to want to invest in. And then the last area and it coincides with our market execution capability pillars. We want to play a bigger hand in developing categories. And we're seeing more of that I think I mentioned in Brazil, we're seeing double, high double-digit growth in adult care and baby wipes. And that's because of a concerted effort by the team in Latin America to focus on geographies and categories and expand the development of those categories. And so you'll see more of that investment going forward as well. KevinGrundy: Mike, it sounds like -- it feels like you believe the company can execute on that and still deliver on the company's long-term EPS algorithm. I didn't detect anything that suggests an outsized investment would be needed. Is that fair? MikeHsu: Yes. I think that's been our stance since I think our January meeting which is, that's why we set forth these medium-term targets that would one to three top and mid single digit bottom and at the same time we would create the funds and room necessary for us to drive some of the investment that we think we need to do to improve the share position of our brand for he long term and then also build the categories in kind of the big opportunities that we have in D&E for the long term. KevinGrundy: Okay. That's helpful. One quick follow-up. The net revenue management which you've spoken a lot about, that's a big number. I understand it approaches the company's cost of goods sold in terms of absolute dollars. Is that something you will ever put a number on for investors in terms of the opportunity in over what period of time you think it can be realized? MikeHsu: Well, I was about to say something but Maria shaking her head. So --[Multiple Speakers] I'm just kidding. We're not ready to put a number on that it probably, they're probably not yet-- not at this point.  End of Q& A Operator : Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. At this time, we have no other questions in the queue. Paul Alexander : All right. So, Caroline, if you're not there, we appreciate everyone's questions today. And we'll wrap up with a quick comment from, Mike. Mike Hsu : Okay. Well, we're very pleased with our results this year. We have a strong quarter and we feel very good about the performance thus far this year. And we're very optimistic about our growth prospects for the future, both in the near term and the long term. And our plan is to deliver balanced and sustainable value creation. So thank you guys very much. Paul Alexander : Thank you very much.

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask an audio question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's year-end earnings conference call. With us today are Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Here is the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with a review of full year 2019 results. Mike will then provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for 2020. We will finish as usual with Q&A. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Finally, we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both excludes certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Let me start with the headlines on our full-year results. Organic sales increased 4% driven by higher net selling prices. We achieved strong margin improvements and bottom line growth while increasing our brand investments and we improved capital efficiency and returned significant cash to shareholders. Now let's cover the details of our results starting with sales. Full year net sales were $18.5 billion, that's even year-on-year and included a three point drag from currency rates. Organic sales were up 4%. Looking at the top line by geography, in North America organic sales in consumer products increased 3%. Within that Personal Care grew 4% with positive volumes, pricing and mix. Consumer Tissue grew 2% with selling prices up 7% and volumes down 5%. In KC Professional in North America, organic sales increased 3%, driven by higher prices in all major product categories. In developing and emerging markets, organic sales rose 6% that included about 2.5 points from Argentina. In terms of key Personal Care markets, organic sales increased 20% in Eastern Europe and high single-digits in Brazil, China, and ASEAN. Outside of Brazil and Argentina, we experienced increased volatility and soft results in Latin America, particularly in the second half of the year in Peru, Bolivia and Chile. In developed markets outside of North America, organic sales rose 1%. Moving on to profitability, full year adjusted gross margin was 35% up 180 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 5%. We generated $425 million of cost savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs that was right in line with our initial target and slightly better than we expected in October. For 2020 we're targeting to deliver between $425 to $500 million in total cost savings and that includes $325 million to $375 million from FORCE. Commodities were a drag of $145 million in 2019, although they turned favorable in the back half of the year. Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit at a high-single digit rate. For 2020 we expect commodities will be somewhat favorable mostly offset by currency headwinds, particularly in Latin America. Other manufacturing costs were also higher in 2019. Moving further down the P&L, between-the-line spending was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales. That included higher advertising spending, which was up 60 basis points. SG&A spending also increased and included higher incentive compensation along with capability building investments. Adjusted operating margin was 17.8%, up 80 basis points and adjusted operating profit grew 5%. Operating margins were up nicely in all three business segments, led by Consumer Tissue and secondarily KC Professional. The adjusted effective tax rate was in line with plan and a drag year-on-year, partially offset by higher equity income and a lower share count. In total, full year adjusted earnings per share were $6.89 up 4%. Our October guidance was for earnings of $6.75 to $6.90 and our original outlook last January was for earnings of $6.50 to $6.70. Now let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations was $2.7 billion down year-on-year as expected and driven by higher working capital. We expect a solid increase in cash flow this year, driven by higher earnings. Capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2019 in line with plan and up year-on-year due to supply chain restructuring projects. Spending will remain elevated in 2020 because of our restructuring. We improved adjusted return on invested capital by 70 basis points to 27.2% which is an all-time high. On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.2 billion, that's the ninth consecutive year we've returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. We expect to return a similar level of cash to shareholders in 2020 and our Board has already approved our 48th consecutive annual dividend increase. Let me finish with a short update on our restructuring program. Overall, we've made significant progress as we close out the second year of this program. The implementation of our redesigned overhead organization has gone very well and we've already realized most of the total program SG&A savings. In terms of supply chain, activities continue to ramp up. We've announced 7 of the approximately 10 facilities that we expect to close or sell and we've taken action on 6 of those. In 2020 we will start up approximately 20 new assets globally, which is roughly twice the level of activity that we would have in a typical year. Looking at the key metrics, we're about 70% to 75% of the way through pre-tax charges and workforce reductions. Cash payments are about 65% complete and on saving we accelerated savings in both 2018 and 2019 and so far we've generated $300 million of savings compared to our total program target of $500 million to $550 million by the end of 2021. So overall, it was a very good year and I'm pleased that we delivered top and bottom line growth ahead of our plan, while we invested more in the business for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying, I am encouraged by our results and the progress we made in the first year of executing K-C strategy 2022. On the top line organic sales were up 4% in '19 ahead of our original plan for 2% growth. Our team has maintained strong focus on price realization and executed their plans well throughout the year. As a result, pricing was up 4% and that's the highest realization we've achieved in a decade and it was necessary because of the multi-year inflation that we faced. Our strategy is to elevate our categories and drive trade up also helped us improve product mix by one point. While volumes were down 1% that was better than our original expectation because of strong end market execution, higher brand investment and less impact from price increases. Beyond sales, we delivered broad based margin improvements and above plan earnings. We continue to leverage our financial and capital discipline as we achieve significant cost savings, improved ROIC and return significant cash to shareholders. We also invested more in our brands and businesses in 2019. As Maria noted, we increased advertising spending by 60 basis points. Digital advertising is now about two-thirds of our working media mix and it's helping us target consumers more effectively and deploy our campaigns more quickly. We're leveraging our digital expertise and more businesses around the world and our marketing ROI is improving. Importantly, our digital strategy is helping us grow volumes and businesses like in Fem Care internationally, Diapers in Eastern Europe and Adult Care in North America. Now beyond advertising, we've also started to invest behind and focus more on improving our other commercial capabilities, including revenue management. We're taking a disciplined program management approach to this effort. This includes making sure we have the right tools, processes and resources so we can better leverage these growth capabilities. While it's still early days, we're making good progress and I expect more going forward. All in all, our teams have made excellent progress in 2019. And I'm proud of their accomplishments. Now I'll turn to our outlook for 2020. Our plan is consistent with our balanced approach to value creation includes higher growth investments and aligns with our K-C strategy 2022 financial objectives. On the topline, we're targeting organic sales growth of 2% and that's consistent with our medium-term objective and similar to our expectation for category growth. We expect selling prices, product mix and volumes to all improve in 2020. Pricing should be weighted for the front half of the year, while volume growth will likely be more weighted to the back half. We expect the promotion environment to be competitive but remain broadly constructive. We will continue to increase our growth investment in 2020 and that includes investment in digital marketing, in our commercial capabilities and in our products as part of our innovation agenda. In the first half, we will launch innovations in North America on Huggies, diapers and adult care along Cottonelle bathroom tissue. In D&E, we have several upgrades coming in personal care in key markets such as China, Eastern Europe and Latin America. We're confident in our growth investments and innovations will help us grow volume and improve product mix this year and improve share performance over time. Our investments will start right away in the first quarter while the benefit should build as the year progresses. We're targeting to grow adjusted operating profit 3% to 5% and on average, that implies 50 basis points of our operating margin expansion. Gross margin should increase more than that. On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share of 710 to 735. At the midpoint, that represents growth of 5% in line with our K-C strategy 2022 objective. Finally, as Mario said we expect to improve cash flow and return significant amounts of cash to shareholders. So in summary, I am encouraged by our progress in 2019 and our outlook for 2020. We're investing more in the business to drive long-term success and we're confident in our ability to deliver balanced and sustainable growth and create shareholder value. Now that concludes our prepared remarks and now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I guess, first thing is I'm struck by the 60 basis point increase in advertising spending and my model which goes back to dare I say 1997, that's the largest one-year increase in advertising in the company's history that goes back that far. So that coupled with the fact that you had $100 million of incremental SG&A in the fourth quarter and then looking ahead into next year, the implied reinvestment spend. So can you just talk about like are there areas where you feel like as a company you've been under-invested that it requires this much step up in spend, some of it's being supported by the fact that it's a benign input cost environment, but the plans that you'd laid out a year ago didn't contemplate the deflation that we're seeing. So I'm just kind of curious like the aggregate amount that's going back in, where you would say it's most focused and what it takes to start to see a return on that because the revenue guidance for 2020 while healthy doesn't seem to tie with the amount of money that's going back into the business? Mike Hsu : Yes, I think there is a part of it - maybe there is a small part of it, which say, hey, we had a tough couple of years, and so we had trimmed back a little bit of A&CP. So part of that is restoring a bit of that. But the other part, I would tell you is, we feel really good about our stance on investment, and I think it really reflects, in our view, the quality that we have in our commercial programming for this year. And also I think the fact that the category conditions we think are very conducive to growth and I think that's a big change versus when we talked this time last year where we were uncertain about the marketplace and we still were launching new innovations and new commercial program. So we feel really good about that. I think consumer demand has been pretty darn resilient and the competitive environment has been - we would say broadly constructive and so that makes the conditions pretty - very good for growth. And then the commercial programming, we've got great innovation that launched in 2019 in North American Adult Care, in China in Diapers. We've got great innovation coming this year across Personal Care in multiple markets that we're very excited to support. And so we feel good about that, so a big chunk of it is increased investment in the product and ongoing and we have some good news coming. And then Importantly, I mentioned digital, which is about two-thirds of our overall advertising spend is being very productive for us and we feel really good about our campaigns and the content we have out there and our team's ability to manage it effectively at a higher ROI level. So that's the second area, and then commercial capability. And for us, I'll translate commercial capability it includes kind of the innovation process, it includes revenue growth management, it includes sales execution and then the digital aspect. And so all those areas we're investing and building our capability there. Maria Henry : Yes, and Lauren, I chime in that we were up 200 basis points in the fourth quarter. We were also up in the third quarter. And if you recall, fourth quarter and the back half of 2018, we had particularly low spending between-the-lines, so I think the full year comparison is the best way to look at this. And for the full year, we're up 90 basis points, 60 basis points of that. With advertising, Mike mentioned the investment in commercial capabilities which ramped up toward the end of the year. And then the other thing I call out is incentive compensation which we've talked about before. This year, we over delivered on our plan and therefore had higher variable compensation. In last year, the opposite was true, we under delivered on our plan and therefore the variable compensation was lower. So you look at the year-on-year increase and that's an effect. And the last thing I'd point out there is the way that our plan was constructed back in January, we had planned for a ramp on between the lines spending in the second half and even more or so in the fourth quarter, just the way that timing of our programs in areas like IT, we're scheduled to execute. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Wanted to talk about the pricing contribution for fiscal '20, interesting to see that you're expecting to be positive. So is that price that's already in place that had yet to lap or more pricing that hasn't been introduced yet that you're putting in place or more a function of decisions you're making on promotional levels like you did on in China as you focus on revenue management? Mike Hsu : Yes. Olivia Tong : Has there been any - sorry and just any change in your promotional expectations for fiscal ' 20? Thanks. Mike Hsu : No. Yeah. Thanks, Olivia. Yeah, I think broadly I'd say with the pricing environment 2019 was broadly constructive and we - our expectation is for it to remain still in 2020. We do have some pricing in our plan. I would say, a big chunk of that - the majority of that is carryover from actions we took in 2019, right and so you'll see most of that come through in the first half. And then we do have probably some pricing plan to address specific issues in specific markets where we've got some volatility in currencies or the economy. So that's that aspect. I think in the - the overall, I'd say not pricing in 2019, I think it was ahead of plan and the volume impact was less than plan. There were probably a few isolated hot spots and there are probably a few isolated hot spots now. Our teams are staying close to those situations and we're going to fine-tune our promotional plans as appropriate, but maybe the headline, I would say is, we're more focused on driving category growth and driving it the way that you would want us to do that by launching improved products and driving advertising. We'd rather I think earn our share and own our share through innovation and advertising instead of renting it through a promotion. And so I think right now our expectation is the environment should remain constructive. Olivia Tong : And then just following up, obviously you've talked about China price promotion actions you've taken in the past, just your view on the market for D&E, Personal Care because it's nice to see the volume growth again, but the sales have decelerated a bit. So just if you could talk to that a little bit? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Okay, Olivia just to be clear that was about China. Olivia Tong : Yes. Specifically in China. Mike Hsu : Yes. China, we're feeling very encouraged by our progress. We're up double digits behind really strong momentum on Fem Care and really an improving trends in the Diaper business. I'd say on the diaper side, really what's driving our improvement is really good innovation that's gaining a lot of traction with consumers in the marketplace. It has been to-date mostly launched in our premium tiers or Tier 5, 6, 7 and which is growing at a pretty good clip. I'd say we still have some issues on our lower tiers where we have - we look still little more softness there. We are expanding our innovation. We have more exciting innovation that we're launching this year and we're rolling that out across the business in Diapers and so we feel really good about our position. The birth rate has been down a little bit '19 versus '18, we expect to probably be flat to down a little bit in this year as well. But we still think there's plenty of developed market development opportunity in China and we're still very early I think in the life cycle of our categories in China. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : So I have a couple of three questions. One is on your comments about constructive pricing, we've - I asked this earlier this morning too, but we've kind of seen this movie before where there's sometimes of air pockets where pricing stay that combined rollover, so gross margins expand for this opportunity to invest in the category through advertising everything else which is what your plan is for the year. But again, having seen this before, you've seen it before as well. Often times a quarter from now, maybe two quarters from now you start seeing competition creep in from a pricing perspective and things - it'll get that worse not that it gets bad, it'll just get a little bit worse than the plan. So how are you confident that this movie is not going to end the same way or have the same competitive pressure picking up over the next little while here and tactically how much notice do you get about that? Mike Hsu : Yes, I mean I - the scenario that you paint or that possibilities always exists. And I think the overall is, we're going to remain competitive in the marketplace and we'll be competitive on price. However, I think maybe the emphasis, Ali, for us is we feel really good about our innovation and we feel really good about our commercial, our marketing programs and so that's where we want to invest. And you may have covered categories that have commoditize I worked in categories that people seeing that commoditize over time and that's a dead end. And so for me, I think we want to take the high road and build our categories. We have - if you - our thesis say there's a lot of growth left in our categories in D&E and in elevating our categories in developed markets, but to do that you need to bring innovation and you need to get the consumer good reason to buy which is by creating more value for our products. So that's where our focus is. We will be, however, competitive, but the other factor on pricing. I'd say it's also, if you look at it, we're still above our 2017 cost levels. And so we're still - we still want our margins back to kind of where they are. We're now all the way back at it and to the extent that we would like them. And then the other side of it is that we are anticipating some pulp inflation in the back half of the year. So there is a lot of other factors going on, but our teams, I would say, have gotten sharper and more tuned with our revenue growth management capability to the market conditions. And so we'll stay close to it, but we're going to run the play which is the highroad play right now. Ali Dibadj : I'm not - again I'm not questioning you guys, I just wonder others follow that same high road who are in more private label prone or smaller or more private or whatever. Okay. I guess we'll watch it. Second question of three is on free cash flow, it looks like certainly for the year, it was down quite a bit, a lot of that was CapEx driven. Could you talk a little bit about and Maria, if you could you talk a little bit about the drivers of free cash flow in 2019, how we should think about it for 2020 and in particular the CapEx as a percent of sales still looking perhaps elevated? Maria Henry : Sure. The cash flow in the fourth quarter was actually strong at $924 million for the year. As you call out, operating cash flow was $2.7 billion and that's down from prior year. It's not - it's in line with our expectations. So it was a very plan for - as you know, we are funding the restructuring last year, this year and so we've got elevated expenses coming up on CapEx. The big driver on operating cash flow which we've talked about before is that we had a big shift in working capital, particularly around payables where in the fourth quarter of 2018, we had a very high inflow from working capital driven by payables timing. We basically had to pay that back out in the first quarter of 2019 and that affected operating cash flow for the year that was the big driver. Encouragingly though, Ali, when I look at our cash flow from operations, we were up nicely year-over-year in the second half of 2019. We were up about 10% and the trends on working capital are positive, but that was true both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. I'd also call out related to that, our cash conversion cycle was 10 days for the year which was a day better than it was in the prior year and it was better than our expectations. In terms of CapEx, CapEx was elevated in 2019 and it will be elevated again in 2020 as we work through the restructuring. And as you recall, we said we'll main out the restructuring program that we were expecting incremental CapEx of $600 million to $700 million on that program. And so during the time of the supply chain activities which is '19 and '20 on restructuring on a percent of sales we've got a pretty high number, I think it was 6.5% of sales or something like that. But we did say that coming out of the restructuring, our expectation is that CapEx will be 4% to 5% of sales and that is down from our historical model of 4.5% to 5.5%. So a long answer, but I feel that the cash flow for the year was good and as expected CapEx. CapEx is in line with what we've been talking about as we execute on the restructuring. Ali Dibadj : So it's still going to ramp down after 2020. Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks for indulge me for my last question. We talk about China with a question earlier, but just more broadly the emerging and developing markets for you only grew 3% that continues to be a slow down. I get the comp is tougher, but are there signs of improvement in that growth rate or should we continue to expect kind of again taking into account compares that we're talking about this low single-digit type of emerging market - emerging and developing market growth rate? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Ali, I think we feel very good about our D&E performance. I know it's slowed down sequentially a little bit in the fourth quarter, but if you look at the key markets, Brazil continues to do very well, we would say excellent performance in a tough market. China, I think the trends are improving CE, as Maria pointed out, 20% growth on the year. So we feel good on our key markets. I think the big driver of the slowdown, if you look at the fourth quarter was one we're starting to cycle pricing in some key markets in Latin America, for example, in Brazil, I think our pricing in the front half was up double-digits and so we're starting to cycle that. And the other part of it is, as we mentioned, we've got some softness due to some macro issues and competitive issues in, what we would call, South Latin America which is, Peru, Bolivia and Chile and you're probably aware of what's going on there but there's a lot of social unrest which is actually affecting some of our categories, and so we're managing through that. We've got a great team, they're very experienced in kind of working through this and we've got very solid plans to address at least some of the competitive issues in those markets. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : My question is on [Technical Difficulty] Mike Hsu : Andrea you're cutting up. We can barely hear you. Andrea Teixeira : I'm sorry, I don't know if you could hear the question. So my question is on emerging markets. So with China growing double digits, I think you just mentioned Brazil doing well but lapping the double digits price increase. So is the other South of Latin America markets which I understand that is much smaller, what are you embedding in terms of deceleration for develop emerging into your guide or you just are expecting it to continue to be in the low-single digits into your 2%, so that obviously embeds the developed markets would be about 1%? So I would just want to kind of double clicking your separating emerging markets and developed markets? And then just a clarification question on the reinvestment question, so I understand that you were try - like you were saying like we have a lot of innovation, but according to our math, you're kind of reinvesting about $400 million on top of your base of SG&A and already invested about - you already increase around $170 million. So I understand the breakdown in assumptions, but if you can break into the large line items including compensation, R&G and advertisement into your guide, so that we can understand why it's kept into the mid-single digit growth? Paul Alexander : Sure. This is Paul here, Andrea. There were several questions there. So I'll take the first one or two and then we'll pass the investment questions over to Mike and Maria. On the outlook for 2020 in developing and emerging markets, we don't have a hard and fast number to give you, there are several moving pieces in the business. But as Mike said, we're confident about the underlying trends in several of the markets. There is some increased volatility that we saw in the first - in the back half of 2019. We think that those have largely stabilized, but probably at a lower level. So as we enter 2020 that will be with us for a period of time. But overall, we would be looking to deliver solid organic growth in developing and emerging markets in 2020. In developed markets, in general, our expectation is unchanged from what we have been delivering over time, which is modest growth. Maria Henry : And then on the between-the-lines outlook for 2020, we are expecting it to increase both in terms of dollars and as a percent of sales and that we expect to be driven by higher advertising as well as I'd say secondarily capability investments. Just as a reminder, there is a few other moving pieces in SG&A, we are expecting some modest benefits from restructuring in 2020, we'll have the benefit of incentive compensation normalization. And then going the other way, we'll have our normal labor and other cost inflation that run through SG&A. Beyond that, we're not providing a specific target for the level of increase, but we are interpreting that it will be a healthy level of increase. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : I wanted to come back to emerging markets because I'm having a hard time footing the narrative with the numbers. The 3 points organic, how much did Argentina add to that this quarter? Mike Hsu : It was slightly less than two points. Jason English : So we've got slightly north of 1 point is sort of underlying emerging market growth right now. And you're saying China is up double digits, Central Eastern Europe growing like '20s, Brazil strong. Is it the declines in the sort of non-core EMs or that substantial that there weighing you down or were the growth figures you are giving us for these other markets where they annualized and not just the quarter? Just having a hard time because I always view Brazil, Central and Eastern Europe and China is like chunky and if they're growing the EMs I thought it would do better. So I'm really having a hard time footing strength there but really no growth kind of in aggregate? Mike Hsu : Yes. So again, I think it's as you postured which is good growth out of those markets and I think a continued growth and a little softness and what I would term our other Latin America was probably the big chunk of that. It's actually probably a little more substantial or when you add it all up, then you might think. Maria Henry : And then also K-C Professional outside those North America has had lower numbers in the D&E markets than what we would have anticipated. And the same factors as we talked about with the volatility, but obviously when we get the total numbers that includes K-C P as well as the consumer business. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Wendy Nicholson : Circling back on kind of a line of questioning about the international markets. We talked about the margin internationally before and I know there's just a lot of structural lower pricing and whatnot. But just in terms of - has a longer-term kind of over the next three to five years, how much will be international margin benefit from the restructuring and a lot of the restructuring you're doing is North America centered, but I'm just wondering how long will it be until we can see real margin improvement in those international markets? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes, I mean. Well, I would say, we are planning for margin improvement over time and I think there's a couple of different things, one related to the restructuring which gets us to better and more common assets across the world, especially in Personal Care, so that's going to be one factor. But the other piece is our strategy to elevate our categories. And so we are going to see - we are expecting and planning for mixed premiumization and innovation that's going to drive more positive mix and margin over time. A good example of that would be China. We feel great that we've delivered substantial product improvement. Our gross margins are at record levels with that product improvement. So that's kind of a win-win innovation in our minds. Paul Alexander : And Wendy, you'll be able to see our geographic disclosures when we publish our 10-K in February, but I can preview it to say that our international margins in total were up somewhat in 2019, despite the volatility and the currency headwinds. Wendy Nicholson : So I'm just thinking obviously to the extent of focus is on accelerating the growth there for long as the margin gap is a significant as it is, it's actually a headwind to your margins. So I'm just trying to balance that as I think about it over the next few years, would love to see you grow faster outside the U.S., but obviously going to come at a cost if you can't ramp up those margins as well? Maria Henry : Right. Wendy Nicholson : Second question just back on the North American business. Are you surprised, I mean just given sort of the size of private label in some of your categories, we're surprised that we haven't seen more promotional aggression on part of private label? Do you think we should expect that in 2020? I mean I guess, we've been surprised not only because so many retailers are talking more about private label investments, but also in your categories, it seems like given the commodity environment we're at pretty unique opportunity for some of those private label guys to get more aggressive on pricing. So what's your take on that and is it just that consumers are really loyal to brands and innovation in your category all of a sudden or is that a legitimate threat as we look at 2020 and the cost environment? Mike Hsu : Yes, I guess maybe the key thing for me is, in general, we're seeing a little increase in private label throughout '19 pricing particularly in Tissue has not moved up, right. And so maybe in some select pockets, but in general has not moved up at the same levels that the brands have. So that's one factor. I really don't expect and wouldn't think it would make sense to overly promote private label, mostly because of the reason that you probably surmised which is, I don't believe consumers drive retail choice or their choice of retail outlet by because of private label. I think the study after study that concludes that they make choices based on national brands and they - and that's what drives that behavior. And so I don't know that necessarily promoting on the private label side is a productive behavior. In fact, I would say, I have skin in the game here but I would suggest that if they drive the right national brand strategy, I think that will help grow the retail business more effectively. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Mike, I wanted to come back to the topic you were kind of dancing around I guess asking it different ways, but with respect to gross margin, so your performance was fantastic as was Procter's this morning. Still seeing some pricing benefit albeit one dissipating and commodity costs lower. So from a retailer's perspective and understanding the importance of brand. So we've been asking this from, okay what are Procter moves, what are private label moves or so forth on promotion. But from a retailer's perspective, why wouldn't they be coming back to you guys now to the manufacturers and asking for some of this to be dealt back through trade promotion. They never want to take a price increase, right. So now in the current environment, now why wouldn't - what's the risk that retailers sort of force the issue and lean on manufacturers to start dealing some of this back? And then I have a follow-up. Mike Hsu : Yes, well I think, Kevin, again I still point out that we still had inflation in 2019. Our costs are still higher than they were in 2017. And so when we say this inflationary impact has been multiyear, our pricing hasn't - even hasn't fully recovered that, it's actually far from fully recovering that. So that's kind of my view from my chair on the pricing. On the other side of that, I think you'll need to talk to the retailers to get their views, but my personal side would be our discussions with retailers tend to be around how we're going to grow the category and that's what they're most interested in. As long as we've got the right plans with innovation and category support to drive category growth that's really kind of where their focus is and that's what - where most of our conversations are about these days. Kevin Grundy : I'm bringing a quick follow-up to a question that was asked earlier. I think what investors, what analysts will try to figure out is the level of conservatism that's in your guidance versus how much investment whether that's advertising and marketing or other areas, excuse me, of OpEx that are there more sort of locked and loaded. Can you help us think about that, because in the absence of kind of putting some parameters around that, given the benefit that you're seeing from commodities, that you're seeing from FORCE, that you're seeing from Restructuring, it certainly looks conservative and it's hard to envision advertising and marketing stepping up to a level that's implied. So can you help us as best you can with the level of conservatism and flexibility maybe behind the competitive environment? Maybe kind of help us think about that? And that's it from me. Thank you. Maria Henry : Sure. What I would say is I think that we've got a reasonable and balanced plan that we're shooting for in 2020 and we've shared with you the primary assumptions that go into that. What I can also tell you coming up on my fifth year here is that there are lot of variables that happen that we can't accurately predict as we go into a year. We've seen that happen on the downside a couple of years ago, a bit on the upside last year. And so as we go through the year we'll react to the environment that we're in, but there is potential volatility on the commodity side, there is potential volatility on the currency side. We've talked a lot about strong competition and competitive activity, so far in this call. So there is a lot of moving pieces and as we always do, we will make the decisions that we need to make during the year to deliver on the balanced model that we strive to achieve year-on-year. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : I've got a question for Mike and then a quick follow-up for Maria, Mike on your organic sales outlook for the full year, should we interpret that to mean that volume should improve from the rate it was in '19 or we should see absolute volume growth for the full year fiscal '20 and what specifically is driving that. I imagine you're going to say innovation. So how do we put the Diaper innovation in the context for 2020 relative to how the special delivery diapers for Huggies did in, call it, 2019? Mike Hsu : Yes. The organic outlook is 2% and that really reflects our expectation for both the category and then obviously our performance as we cycle the pricing. The volume in our plan is absolute growth, again, we're expecting balanced growth from volume mix and still a little bit of pricing, Steve. Its innovation, I probably would say that the flip on volume is not going to be as daunting as you might perceive because, I would say, our underlying volume performance in 2019 was very good. And what I mean by that is obviously if you're going to take pricing you're going to have a negative volume effect in accordance to whatever you think your elasticity is. And so we saw that, but I do think we had really good underlying initiatives whether they were driving distribution and new categories and new markets in different countries or launching innovation and increasing advertising. We saw the volumes come underlying that offset most of or some of the price elasticity effect and actually more than we had anticipated. So we think we've got very - we had very good execution in 2019. And I don't think the effect in '19 was related to elasticity impacts were less than we expected, it was more related to execution of volume initiatives were better than we had expected. Did that help? Steven Strycula : No it does. For Maria just quick follow-up to Ali's question, could you give an operating cash flow number of $2.7 billion in 2019 should that be a little better or a little worse in 2020. And then on the commodity piece, if it was $60 million deflationary in the fourth quarter, but the full year outlook is $50 million to $200 million. Can you help us think through what is basically baked into your commodity outlook assumption? Thank you. Maria Henry : On cash from operations, we are expecting that to be up in 2020. And on Commodities, we are expecting fiber to start to pick up particularly in the back half of 2020 which is built into our assumption of the $50 million to 200 million for next year. Operator : At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. Mike Hsu : Great. Well, we appreciate everyone's questions today and have a good day. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines and thank you for joining us this morning.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of the presentation, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce our first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Please go ahead, sir. Paul Alexander : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today, you will hear from Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we'll be referring to adjusted results, which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Hsu : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. We joined you today during an unprecedented time, and we hope all our stakeholders are staying healthy and safe. The COVID-19 crisis is severely affecting individuals and society at large, and it's forcing companies like ours to adapt to overcome near-term operating challenges and uncertainty. Kimberly-Clark\u2019s vision is to provide the world with essentials for a better life and we know our consumers are counting on us now more than ever to fulfill that vision. We take this responsibility seriously and our teams are working around the clock to ensure our essential products get to our consumers who depend on us. The K-C Foundation and our brands have launched programs to support COVID-19 relief efforts. And thus far, we provided donations of more than $8 million to organizations, including UNICEF, the Red Cross, and the United Way. We are also donating millions and millions of our products to other organizations in need. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have taken decisive action to manage our business effectively through this crisis. We have three key operating priorities. Priority number one, protect the health and safety of our employees and our consumers. Throughout our 148-year history, this has never been more important than right now. We have taken aggressive action to protect our employees around the world, no matter where they work. That includes implementing extensive sanitization, quarantine, and social distance protocols in our manufacturing facilities, work-from-home policies, and of course, travel restrictions. We are also recognizing our manufacturing employees with well-deserved bonuses in appreciation of their efforts. Priority number two, proactively manage our global supply chain to ensure supply of our essential products to our consumers. Our supply chain teams are meeting multiple times each day to effectively navigate the dynamic environment. They are doing a great job in keeping our global supply chain largely operational, in many cases, delivering record output. We are running our assets flat out and greatly simplifying our assortment to improve product availability. We are working with raw material suppliers and distribution partners to ensure continuity and maximize deliveries. In some cases, we are incurring additional costs to keep the supply chain rolling. We have experienced some disruption, including temporary manufacturing slowdowns and shutdowns, but none have had material impact to date. The supply chain environment is dynamic and we expect ongoing challenges in the near-term. However, we are encouraged with our team's ability thus far to manage effectively in the current environment. Priority number three, prudently manage the business through near-term volatility, while continuing to strengthen the long-term health of Kimberly-Clark. We will continue to operate with a balanced perspective on both the top and bottom line as we assess both risk and opportunity. We will continue to invest in our products, our brands, and our commercial capabilities to maintain the near-term health of our business and position us for long-term success. That said, some investment in brand support, including promotion activity will be deferred temporarily because it isn't effective or appropriate in the current environment. We will also manage our discretionary overhead even more tightly. And as Maria will describe, we have taken additional steps to further strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our financial flexibility. While the environment continues to evolve rapidly, our teams are managing our priorities and our business well. I am extremely proud of our entire K-C team. I want to express sincere thanks for how they are fulfilling our vision. Maria will take you through the results of the quarter, but as you can see from the release, we are performing well, have a strong balance sheet, and are delivering solid cash flow. In a few minutes, I'll discuss the outlook and then open the call for your questions, but for now, I'll turn it over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me echo my comments and say that I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during this global health crisis. I'd also like to thank our 40,000 employees for their incredible actions during this time period. I've never been more proud to work at this great company. How we are managing through this crisis is, of course, the most important thing right now, but I do want to spend a few minutes reviewing our results. Overall, first quarter results reflect both significant volume increases from consumer stock up as well as excellent execution by our teams. We generated strong cash flow and further strengthened our balance sheet. In addition, we continue to invest more in our business and our market share positions are in good shape. Let me cover some of the details of our results. First quarter net sales were $5 billion. That's up 8% year-on-year. Organic sales increased 11%, while currencies were a two point drag. Volumes were up 8%, including significant shipments to support consumer stock up related to the COVID-19 outbreak. That stock up occurred in all major geographies and benefited all three business segments, in particular consumer tissue. In addition, we were off to an excellent start to the year prior to the outbreak with good performance in several areas. That included premium-tier Huggies Diapers and adult care in North America, personal care in Asia broadly, including China and also in Eastern Europe. Net selling prices in the quarter were up 1% driven by increases taken last year. Overall, the pricing and promotion environment remained broadly constructive in the first quarter. Product mix improved 1%, reflecting our strategies to elevate our categories and drive trade up. Let me pause here and touch briefly on our market share positions. In North American consumer products, our first quarter market shares were up or even in five of eight categories year-on-year, and up or even in six of eight categories sequentially. In key D&E markets, in personal care, market shares were up or even year-on-year in Eastern Europe and China, and in most categories in Brazil. Shares were down in some other countries in Latin America, including Peru, although our position there was stable sequentially. Overall, our market shares are broadly healthy, which is a good place to be in this environment. Turning back to the financials. First quarter adjusted gross margin was 37.2%, up 370 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 20%. We had a strong quarter on cost savings with total savings of $125 million from our FORCE and restructuring programs. Commodities were a benefit of $115 million, somewhat better than we expected. Other manufacturing costs were higher year-on-year. Foreign currencies were somewhat worse than we expected and reduced operating profit at a high single-digit rate. Between the line spending was up a 100 basis points as a percent of net sales, including a nice step up in advertising spending. Adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, up 250 basis points and adjusted operating profit grew 24%. The bottom line also benefited from a slightly lower tax rate, higher equity income and a lower share count. All-in-all, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $2.13, up 28%. Now let's turn to cash flow restructuring in the balance sheet. Cash provided by operations was strong at $704 million compared to a soft quarter last year of $317 million. The year-on-year increase was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. Capital spending was $352 million in the quarter, including significant activity related to our restructuring. Looking ahead, some of our near-term capital projects and restructuring activities will be temporarily delayed or reprioritized because of the complexities of managing in the current environment. We now expect that charges for a restructuring program will continue into 2021 rather than wrapping up at the end of this year. We also expect the charges for the total program will be towards the high end of our previous estimate. We expect that total restructuring savings will be consistent with our previous estimate, although it is possible that we won't hit our full target until sometime in 2022. On capital allocation, first quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $575 million. We are prudently managing and further strengthening our already strong balance sheet and liquidity position in this environment, and our liquidity overall remains robust. It is also our intention to maintain our A credit rating through this temporary period of uncertainty. We executed two long-term debt transactions in the quarter. The first was a $500 million 30-year bond offering that essentially pre-funded the $500 million of notes that will come due in August. In late March, we executed a second transaction. This one, a $750 million 10-year bond offering. That transaction enhanced our overall liquidity and flexibility and reduced our near-term need for commercial paper. We also continue to maintain two revolving credit facilities totaling $2.75 billion that we've never drawn upon. We are also temporarily suspending our share repurchase program for at least the remainder of the second quarter to provide additional flexibility. We will continue to monitor the uncertainty in the environment and we will give you another update on share repurchases in July. Longer-term, there has been no change in our capital allocation strategies. I will finish with some perspectives on the currency and commodity markets. We originally expected that currencies would reduce our net sales by one point this year. Using first quarter actuals and forward rates at the end of March, the headwind would be approximately 4% and rates remained volatile on a daily basis. For your benefit on a historical basis, the currency impact on our operating profit taking into account both translation and transaction effects has typically been two to three times the impact on our sales. In addition, our equity affiliate K-C to Mexico is facing many of the same uncertainties that we are, including a much weaker Mexican peso. Improving net realized revenue remains one of our strategies to offset currency headwinds, however, in this environment, much of a new incremental price realization will occur \u2013 much incremental price realization will occur in the near-term is more uncertain than normal. On the commodity front, forward-looking trends look favorable, although markets remain volatile and as usual cost changes could impact the promotion environment. Raw material markets that can be influenced by oil, including resin have started to move down some recently, although much less than the decline in oil, and where oil goes from here is certainly unclear. On pulp, recent industry forecast for North America eucalyptus market prices are in the lower half of the range we use to set our full-year plan in January, which was $900 to $975 per metric ton. So all-in-all, I am encouraged by our execution in the quarter, and our balance sheet, our business fundamentals, and our financial health are all strong. I'll now hand it back to Mike. Michael Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Maria. Now I'll provide some forward-looking perspective. We are focused on ensuring business continuity and we are developing robust contingency plans to address a wide range of scenarios. I feel good about where we stand right now, but we are navigating a very dynamic environment. Due to the lack of visibility and uncertainty about the potential impact of that pandemic, including its potential effects on the global economy, our markets, and our supply chain were temporarily suspending our forward-looking guidance. Now, as the situation progresses and we get more visibility into the impact of the pandemic, we will resume guidance. Today, our teams have done an excellent job navigating through the volatility, however, the inherent unpredictability of the pandemic creates uncertainty and that makes it difficult for us to assess future outcomes with any precision. In addition, the volatility in currency, commodities and supply chain, there are effects on demand and I'll share some perspective on that right now. Our essential categories have historically performed well in times of economic turbulence. In consumer, our underlying momentum is solid and we are making strong progress on our strategic growth initiatives. We will continue to support our brands with innovation and marketing. Near-term innovation launches, include upgrades in Huggies in China, North America, and Brazil, Kotex in Eastern Europe, and Poise and Depend in North America. Consumption in the first quarter ran ahead of shipments and as a result, we expect retailers will rebuild inventory and that will see additional volume in the second quarter, and we are seeing that play out thus far in April. We expect most, but not all of the demand increase from consumer stock up will reverse out later in the year. However, with more people at home and also paying closer attention to personal hygiene, it's likely that consumer tissue consumption will be higher during shelter in place periods. We are also closely monitoring pandemic and economic conditions in leading markets, including Latin America and evaluating how that could impact the health of our consumers and our categories. Now shifting to K-C Professional, demand was solid in the first quarter and boosted by stock up activity that occurred in March. Given the economic shock that's occurred and with much of the population staying at home, KCP is likely to face volume decline starting in the second quarter, that will persist until economic conditions returned to more \u201cnormal levels\u201d. We are seeing early signs of that softness thus far in April. Impacted end-markets are likely to include, obviously, offices, travel and lodging, high-track accounts, including retail and manufacturing. Now I'd like to conclude with a few important messages. First, we are very confident in the strength, the resilience and the overall health of our company. We are navigating near-term uncertainty well and appreciate the commitment of our K-C strong team. We are managing prudently in the near-term and strongly believe in our ability to create long-term shareholder value. And that concludes our prepared remarks and we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time the floor is open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Michael Hsu : Hey, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. Hi. So two different things. One was first on K-C Professional. Just hoping, definitely a lot of people are looking to understand better sort of the mix of that business. Kind of how much exposure is roughly, let's call it, hospitality versus offices versus manufacturing, number one. Number two, kind of what your market shares are in K-C Professional versus in the consumer market? And then three, also thinking about the exposure there to more the cleaning product side of things, the wipers business, some of the safety businesses that you have in there. If you could talk a little bit about that, I think it'd be very helpful too. Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yes. Thanks, Lauren. I'll point out, Paul, Maria and I were all in remote locations or separate locations. So this maybe a little clunky, and we may need to do logistics over the phone. But Lauren, regarding your question, overall we do expect some near-term volume decline in K-C Professional. However, I will say there's a long-term opportunity to serve a very important need as creating healthier workplaces and focus on hygiene becomes more important going forward. However, in the short-term, I would say the majority of our business is the washroom business. That's the largest part of our business. Overall, more than half of our business. And we expect that to be hit particularly hard by what I just mentioned, offices, which are \u2013 our early data shows that office use is down about 80%, where we can see that data through our Onvation products. Travel and lodging, significantly down. I think hotel occupancy is the latest data we saw, we're at 21% of capacity. And amazingly, ceded restaurant traffic was down a 100% globally in the latest week, so we could see. So there will be an impact there, but I will say we will see a commensurate or increases in our wipers business, our safety business, which does provide some PPE, and we're ready to make that pivot, and actually believe that we can do a better job helping employers create healthier workplaces. Lauren Lieberman : And then right now in that wipers and safety business, I think on the QCP website, sort of talks about, we're doing our best to keep up with demand. So can you just tell us a little bit about, I think just the educational for people, what those PPE products are? If you are currently running full out on those businesses, what growth looks like there? Because again, I\u2019m just trying to fit together that order of magnitude of K-C Professional being down in the second quarter makes perfect sense, but how much, right? And we can all \u2013 if you give us the tools, we can try to come up with estimates on our own of what that looks like. Michael Hsu : Yes. I may ask Paul to jump in, but I will say, maybe the bigger part of the business that we feel like we can expand right now is on the wiper side. And that's a great business for us and strong performing. And we're seeing that commensurate increase starting to come through now. On the safety side, it is a relatively small business for us. We don't produce any of the PPE masks or gloves directly. We have those co-packed. And so we are in a tight supply situation as everybody else in the world has. And so we expect that to grow over time. But in the near-term, we're in a tight supply situation. Paul, anything to add there? Paul Alexander : Yes. Thanks, Mike. So Lauren and for everyone on the call just to level set on KCP's rough product exposure, about 65% is tissue-based products, about 20% is wipers. And then about 10% is \u2013 are these safety and scientific products that Mike mentioned. The safety and scientific products are primarily apparel and gloves with a little bit of eyewear as well. Masks are an insignificant part of the business. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then switching gears to being a bit more strategic and longer term. The mix \u2013 personal care mix, I think, was up three for D&E market, which was really sort of a notable number. And I was just hoping if you could talk a little bit about where that's coming from? Referring back to the goal to elevate the categories to bring innovation. So it just seems like there was sort of a step change in that happening in the D&E markets on personal care. So anything that you can offer there would be great. Michael Hsu : Yes. Thank you, Lauren. And first of all, I'll say we remain committed to our K-C 2022 strategy. And that strategy is working very well. As Maria said, we felt like we got off to a very good start at the beginning of the quarter and then we saw the pronounced stock up effect that started occurring toward the end of March. So we\u2019re very excited about our innovation and commercial programming. I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to elevate our categories and also expand our markets or expand the categories in our markets as well. Maybe some of the big pockets, China, notably, I think the really \u2013the team there is doing an excellent job navigating both COVID-19 and delivering strong growth at the same time. We were out and the country was down or the \u2013 our business and our manufacturing was down for about three weeks. January, February, they were the first ones obviously to feel the effects, but we've been fully online since. Organic was up low-double digits in the quarter for China overall, with strong double-digit growth in femcare and mid single-digit growth in diapers. And the important thing about diapers is, and I'm very encouraged by the trend is I do believe the category is reverting back to competing on product performance. And we feel like we're well positioned. We saw strong share growth in the premium tiers and strong volume growth in the premium tiers. Still down a bit in value, but we're managing through that. Similarly, D&E in Central and Eastern Europe was up high teens. Brazil was up, I think, low-double digits as well. So we're seeing very good performance across our D&E markets. Notably, Lauren, I also would tell you, there was much less stock up behavior in the D&E market. So the China team would say there was none in our categories. I do think in Brazil, we saw a little bit in consumer tissue. Lauren Lieberman : That's great. Thanks so much. Paul Alexander : Thanks, Lauren. Michael Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Michael Hsu : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys. Good morning. Hope you're all well. Maria Henry : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So Mike, can you just run us through a little more the decision to pull full-year guidance and suspend the share repurchases at least in Q2. I was just looking for a bit more clarity there. Is it more just that the external environment still unknown at this point that it doesn't make sense to have guidance? Or is there something specific internally as you look at the balance of the year that's causing concern versus the prior guidance? Obviously, we understand the consumer pantry deload, which you mentioned. So not all of that Q1 upside sort of flows through, but just trying to understand given you seem to have a pretty defensive portfolio on the EPS outlook side, what drove that decision? And then also with repurchases, you obviously seem to be in a pretty strong liquidity position. So just try to understand the motivation behind that. Michael Hsu : Yes. Dara, it's a great question. It's definitely the former. I think, obviously, to date, our performance has been strong. We feel very good about that. We feel confident in our ability to manage in the current environment. However, I think there are a lot of unknowns and it's \u2013 as I said in my remarks, it really has to do with what the future path of the virus takes and what the commensurate impact is going to be. But maybe I'll let \u2013 I'll let Maria comment on maybe both the outlook and also what we're doing with share repurchase and all that. And then maybe I'll come back with some additional perspective at the end. Maria Henry : Sure. On the guidance, our business is performing well and we're confident in our strategy and our plans that the volatility and uncertainty in this environment is meaningful. And nobody really knows at this point what will happen with the COVID-19 infection rate. I'm sure as you have, we been reading all kinds of epidemiological studies and looking at models and talking to outside folks to try to get some perspective on it. But the numbers range anywhere from 1% to 4% infection rates north of 50%. And it's just nobody really knows what this has in store for us and what the impacts will be. And as we think about that and model various scenarios for our business, an increased infection rate could potentially affect our supply chain, including worker availability, availability of supply, the depth and the length of the recession caused by the virus is unknown at this point. The length and significant impacts of social distancing. We don't know how long that will last post peak and that obviously affects the outlook for our professional business. And then currency and commodities have been very volatile. So with all of that, there's a wide range of scenarios that are potential here, and given that and the lack of certainty around any of those scenarios means we can't confidently provide you with an expected range for 2020 at this point. But we'll continue to monitor the environment when it stabilizes, we'll be in a better position to provide forward-looking guidance consistent with our past practices. Those same factors that led us to pull the guidance for the year weighed in on suspending buybacks. It's for all the same reasons. As you said, we are in a very strong liquidity position. I mentioned some of the stats in my prepared remarks. The suspension of the buybacks is really in line with the fact that overall we're prudently managing the business given the heightened level of uncertainty right now. We'll continue to monitor that quarter-by-quarter, we'll have more to say to you in July when hopefully we have more visibility both for the outlook for the year, what that could mean for our P&L and our cash flows. So I'd sum it up by saying, we are prudently managing overall the company in this period of uncertainty and that affects both our view on guidance and our view on the temporary suspension at least through the second quarter on our buyback program. Michael Hsu : Yes. I'll follow-on, which is I think we are definitely encouraged by our start, even this tough environment notwithstanding. I think we're managing through this uncertainty effectively. As Maria mentioned, in our jobs, I don't think we ever felt like we would be arguing over epidemiological models and we are. And we're working through actually through 11 of them and they all have different assumptions. And now while that makes it difficult for us to call the business for this purpose, I will tell you from an operating perspective, we are using those models to predict outcomes to drive scenario planning and contingency plans for all of our operations around the world. And so we've got a great team, global team managing the COVID-19 crisis for us. And very thorough in terms of how we're thinking about it and very proactive about how we're applying learnings to how we take care of our employees and our consumers and keep operations rolling. Dara Mohsenian : Great. That's helpful. And then if I can ask one other question. Just the promotional environment, you mentioned a pull back in promotion. It's obviously \u2013 there's a lot of traffic at stores and consumers aren't exactly price shopping as much right now. But as you look forward to the back half of the year when theoretically the social distancing restrictions and curious for your thoughts on the promotional environment. On the one hand, some of this consumer behavior probably lingers. On the other hand, assuming there's a consumer pantry deload, the volume situation is going to be tougher from a manufacturer standpoint. So just curious for your perspective on if this lower level of promotion is sticky or not? Or if there could be some ramp up as we look to the back half of the year? And then also in emerging markets with the FX pressure that you mentioned, would you anticipate pricing some of that away as you look out or is the consumer environment likely to limit the ability to take pricing in emerging markets? Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yes. Dara, I think philosophically, I think we \u2013 again, I think I mentioned on the call last time, we prefer taking the high road, which is build markets and brands through innovation and advertising and grow the category overall. I'm not a huge fan of overpromoting categories. That said, we are seeing a reduction in promotions, mostly because demand is running ahead of supply. And so it doesn't make sense to be promoting when the shelves are not full at this point. So we are seeing some pair back. I would expect us to be in that kind of environment for the \u2013 into the second quarter. I think there will be a recessionary impact. Obviously, I think it will be pretty significant and maybe among the largest that we've seen in recent history. While consumers I think become more interested in value in those times, I'm not necessarily certain that that drives us to aggressively promoted environment. I wasn't here at the time, but I was managing a business that competed in the food categories. And the strategy was not promotion, it was more about explaining to consumers about the value of the products and the value of the brands. And at that business, we saw our best years during the recession. So I think we're well positioned for the recession. We're not a premium niche player, even though premiumization is our core strategy. We're not a niche player in premium. We cover most tiers and we're happy we do that and we want to serve consumers and meet consumers where their needs are and we're going to do that. Dara Mohsenian : Great. That's helpful. And any color on emerging markets? Any more detail there on the strategies in emerging markets from a pricing perspective? Michael Hsu : Yes. I think in some cases we will price and we have priced already to recover some or offset some of the FX issues. Although in some markets like, notably in Latin America, we are seeing more price controls put into place in the short-term given what's been going on with the pandemic. But in general, we will be taking price in some markets and we have already done that. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. Thanks guys. Michael Hsu : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Michael Hsu : Good morning, Nik. Nik Modi : Mike, I\u2019m just curious how the current situation has made you maybe possibly rethink feature engines of growth for Kimberly-Clark. And I'll ask this against the backdrop of Jeff Melucci taking over the responsibility to lead the business development team given his background in M&A. So any thoughts? I mean, obviously there are a lot of different categories that are showing their colors right now in terms of accelerated growth. Some of that would fit probably well with your portfolio over time. You have a good balance sheet. Asset prices are likely to get cheaper. So any context around that would be helpful. Michael Hsu : Yes. Nik, we're committed to our K-C 2022 strategy. We love our categories. I think there's a lot of potential there, both in terms of how we elevate and premiumize our existing markets and also how we develop our markets and expand the categories in our markets over time. So for those reasons, we remain very excited about the strategy and I think it's working. I think maybe with the current situation with the pandemic, if it does create more opportunity or other opportunities for us to think about how we accelerate that, we're going to look at those. I can't tell you there's anything active on that radar right now, but Jeff is very experienced. As Maria always says, every quarter we're always actively looking at M&A. Certainly, I think our focus would be within our existing categories, and if it had a either a technology or a product, a brand that fit in very well or a geography or brought us into a geography or strengthen the position in the geography, that we would be very excited about it at the right value. And obviously, we're very disciplined. But we'll continue to look for those opportunities, and Jeff is very experienced. Maria, anything to add there? Maria Henry : Yes. No. Well said. Nik Modi : And then maybe Maria, this one is for you or Mike if you want \u2013 do you want to address it? I know you're not giving guidance, obviously it makes sense, but how should we think about pantry deloading? Because clearly, I mean, we saw what was going on in March. People loading up on a lot of your products. I know people are staying home more, but it's hard for me to imagine they're using it at the rate at which they\u2019re buying it. So how should we think about that? I'm just kind of thinking about how we can think about the \u2013 consumers actually coming back and buying under normal purchasing cycle maybe two months from now or three months from now. So how do you guys think about that? Michael Hsu : Yes. I'll start maybe and Maria. There will be a de-stock, right. So there was consumer pantry stocking. It definitely went into homes and not at retail. And I think there's maybe two effects, which is one, and I mentioned this in my remarks, we still will \u2013 with consumption running so far ahead of shipments, we will be looking to rebuild inventory or our customers will be looking to rebuild inventory in their systems. I also think in general, consumers will want to carry a bit more inventory on their own, so that's a second effect. So while there will be, I think, significant de-stocking, I think it will be lumpy. And the other reason why it will be lumpy is I don't think the stocking occurred evenly across our consumers. Meaning, it would be very easy to predict if every household bought 30% more. But I think what's happened is it's a fraction of households that have it. And so we will continue, I think, some households will be looking to build up their inventory or get their hands on more product, while others will be de-stocking. And for that reason, it's going to be a little more challenging in the call, and we're still working and sifting through the data there. Nik Modi : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So a couple of questions around navigating these huge swings in demand. You mentioned you obviously didn't see much stock up yet in emerging markets, and there's just frankly covering not a lot of room to do that. So what are you planning for? Are you trying to run more capacity right now? Are they getting more in store? Like what changes have happened as the virus shifts there? And then secondly, just overarchingly what changes are you making along the supply chain to drive production right now, while also not overextending yourself? And then the reverse for professional, what are you doing to keep those facilities productive and how much repurposing can you do there? Thank you. Michael Hsu : Yes. Olivia, I'll tell you our supply chain is executing very well and they've had a very disciplined approach to managing through the COVID-19. We've had a few sporadic outages that I mentioned, but really the focus right now is on increasing and driving our utilization on our throughput. And in general, I think, I mentioned in my remarks that in a lot of cases, we're achieving record output. What we've really done is significantly pared back the number of SKUs we are producing. We're just producing the large volume SKUs and that's given us more theoretical capacity and we're getting more output out than we ever have in a lot of locations. And so right now that is the focus and I will say, it's working and I think, you'll see us catch up to demand in the second quarter and made progress during the second quarter. Sorry, I missed probably the other part was around KCP. Olivia Tong : Correct. Michael Hsu : Yes. As we finished the first quarter with the demand that we saw in KCP, KCP was also running flat out as well. I think, at some point given kind of the relative shift, lower demand in professional as we mentioned and also increased demand on the consumer side, there will be an opportunity for us to shift some capacity to consumer and we're looking into that and working through that now. Olivia Tong : Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on profit and margins as we go forward, two areas, just savings realization and advertising. Advertising business savings from FORCE actually accelerate pretty dramatically. And I assume a lot of that was related to obviously the sales surge and the leverage there. So as you think about the go-forward, how have your expectations of savings changed? Does it come in from here as sales normalized? Or are there incremental actions that you're taking because it sounds like they're pushing some of those projects out. So just your view on savings opportunity going forward. And then on advertising, you mentioned you raised advertising in Q1. I assume that's pre- COVID, and that comes off of a big increase in Q4 as well. So just if you could update us on your view on advertising against this backdrop? Michael Hsu : Yes. Maybe I'll make the comment on the advertising and maybe ask Maria to talk a little bit more about the savings. But one, the headline, Olivia is we're going to continue to invest in our brands and our capability to grow the business. But we're going to just defer. What I would say is the, maybe the clearly demand generating marketing in the second quarter or parts of the second quarter until we have a better handle on and catch up a little bit to fulfilling the existing demand that's out there. So we feel really good about the quality of the innovation, the quality of our marketing, we're excited about the plans that we have this year. But as I mentioned, it doesn't make sense to over promote a category where there's not the full stock available on the shelf. And so for that reason, we're going to focus on ROI because it doesn't drive a big return. We will pair it back, but it's tough to watch right now. It's a temporary shift, and we want to continue to invest in the brands. Maria? Maria Henry : Great. And on the cost savings side on FORCE, I'll start there. We had a good quarter with FORCE. It was in line with our expectations and we drove savings across all levers of that program. One of the noticeable things in the first quarter delivery is on our negotiated material price savings. Those are back in line with what they were historically is. Remember in 2019, those were lower than normal for reasons we've talked about extensively throughout last year. So good savings quarter on FORCE at $100 million that also compares to a light first quarter of FORCE savings in the first quarter of last year. As you recall, as we were working through some cost issues in our supply chain in North America. When I look forward, we should have a good full-year outcome with our FORCE savings. Although where we actually end up on that lever is less of a priority right now than it would be in normal times given all of the complexities that our supply chain is working through. Clearly the focus of the teams in our supply chain is producing product and getting that out to market to fulfill consumer demand and customer orders. And so how all of that plays out for FORCE for the year? We will have to see. In terms of the restructuring program, we did continue to make good progress on the restructuring program overall. We do expect delays on the implementation of some of the activity there, which is related directly to the impacts of the COVID-19 situation. If you think about that, there are travel restrictions as we all know, so we really can't get the people that we need to get to the places that we need to get them. As you can imagine, we've got very experienced engineering teams both in-house and with third parties that we work with. And right now those people cannot travel, and therefore, we're experiencing project delays. And the other factor there is, as I mentioned a minute ago, our supply chain teams are absolutely flat out, trying to meet the surge in demand for our products. And so all of that\u2019s leading to delays on the restructuring. We are working hard to have those delays go away, but when they'll go away and when we can get back into full swing on those projects in our supply chain is currently unknown. So how the restructuring savings will play out for 2020, I can't tell you at this point, but that's where we are. Olivia Tong : Thank you. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Olivia. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. And hope all is well. So follow-up on the consumption against the shipments. Internationally, you mentioned some of the stock up in Western Europe and Brazil tissue, but not much elsewhere. So are you likely just catching up with consumption and stock up from most places? And have you seen growth in diapers, for example, in South Korea in April, because I'm assuming there's not much of a stockpiling there because they were early to get the impact. And because they're very developed in ecommerce, perhaps, you know, that was fulfilled as they were going through the social distancing. And on ecommerce, how much did you grow this quarter globally, and how much it represents for you at this point? And just a couple of clarifications, Maria, do you expect gross margin to continue to expand as we find the first quarter, in particular, ex-commodities are coming in even better than anticipated and the mix will likely shift from tissue to diaper. So I'm assuming that's going to be a bit of a benefits for your margin. And some of the other \u2013 sorry, the three parts of the question that as you pivot some of the KCP production of paper into consumer tissue, which is obviously a great competitive advantage at this point. How much is your production capacity in tissue likely increasing with this initiative and also the simplification of SKUs? Thank you. Michael Hsu : Yes. Maybe I'll start \u2013 I\u2019ll take through. I think the consumption effect, yes \u2013 largely the stock up effect Andrea was largely a D&E \u2013 sorry, a developed market phenomenon. So North America, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Korea to some extent. In Korea that you're probed on. Yes, I would say less so in personal care, although I think there was some small effect. We definitely saw \u2013 we are excited to see improved diaper performance from our business and share growth in our diaper business. So even though I think the category trends remain down in Korea on infant and childcare, our diaper business put up very solid growth. And then we did see \u2013 earlier, it occurred more in February some stock up behavior in consumer tissue in Korea as well. But in general, yes, significant stock up impact across Western Europe, including the UK and North America, a little bit in Brazil and in Korea, New Zealand \u2013 Australia, New Zealand. With regard to ecommerce, I'll ask Paul if he has an all-up number. I don't have the all-up number. I will tell you, ecommerce, shipments and demand dramatically accelerated in the quarter. And if you've been reading the news, the consumer behavior has shifted to some degree pretty aggressively because of people not wanting to go out to stores. And so we're feeling that in our business. And I don't know, Paul, if you have \u2013 I don't have the overall number. Paul Alexander : Yes. So a couple things for you, Andrea. Globally, ecommerce would be a low double-digit percentage of our sales. It was up very strong double-digits in the three biggest markets. So that would be, China, South Korea and the U.S. All of those markets accelerated compared to where they were last year. We actually don't have a global total just yet given that we're still early in the year, but I can confidently say in total it accelerated meaningfully. Maria Henry : And I'll go ahead and comment on gross margin. Our gross margins were at 370 basis points year-on-year, and they were up 120 basis points sequentially in the first quarter. And the drivers around gross margin included the volume upside, the continued price realization that we talked about, our cost savings and the commodity deflation that we had in the quarter. That was offset to some extent by currencies. And if I look forward, commodities are trending better than we expected coming into the year and we provided the updated outlook on eucalyptus in the prepared comments. But currencies are trending worse also as we discussed. And on the price point, our net realized revenue or pricing lever is a key lever for us to help offset the negative impacts of currency in a typical environment. However, our ability to get priced in the near-term is more uncertain than the normal. And that uncertainty is around the economic health of the consumer. If you think about Latin America in particular, that's a clear risk. In this environment, there are potential societal and political uneasiness around taking price and increasing our price on some of our products during these times. And finally, a lot of currency challenges came from developed markets internationally, and in general, it's more difficult for us to raise prices in those countries. So how the effects of those three major factors that affect our gross margin will play out for the year, we'll have to see. Andrea Teixeira : That is super helpful. Just on the follow-up on the capacity from KCP. Is that something that will increase your tissue capacity by 20%? Or should we expect that to be material for besides your SKU rationalization, your throughput increase? How should we thinking of issue going forward? Michael Hsu : Yes. Maybe I'll ask Paul to jump in. I think we're still working through that. I mean, we definitely have the opportunity to shift some capacity. I don't know that I can pencil a number next to it. But Paul, I don't know if you thought about. Paul Alexander : Yes. I mean, I would just add. It's not as simple as making decision and then go do it. There's a lot that will be involved if we do this, including different tissue technologies between the two business segments. So I think that for right now the message is, we're taking a look at it, and we'll \u2013 if there's an opportunity, we're certainly going to go after it. It had no impact on the first quarter though. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. I'll pass it on. Michael Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Andrea. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Excellent. Thank you for spotting me in, and good morning, everyone. A couple of quick questions. First, Michael, you mentioned some of the headwinds that you expect to KCP to face going forward. I guess my question is why was it doing so well in the first quarter? You mentioned it was running flat out. What was driving the strength and do we have inventory issues to be cognizant about the business right now? Michael Hsu : Yes. On that one, we did see a stock up effect on anything about tissue. And we're not exactly sure at this point, I think a lot of it went through to end user, and a lot of it went to distributors as well. But there was some pull through toward as we got toward the late in the quarter, particularly on washroom products. So strong demand, again, we obviously expect that to diminish as we move into the second quarter. Jason English : Okay. And then I totally get the idea of some of this demand spike being stock up and likely to reverse, particularly on personal care where it's easy to understand the usage occasions don't really grow. I'm not as convinced on the consumer tissue side yet though. Can you give me a sense of how many usage occasions typically happen in-home versus out-of-home if you know that statistic? Michael Hsu : Well, I don't have that off the top of my head, but I definitely \u2013 where your line of thinking, I agree with which is, look, consumers are going to be home more, and so there's many more occasions for them to interact with our brands then they traditionally would have. The other thing is, it's kind of \u2013 the KCP to consumers shift is an apples and oranges shift in the sense of KCP, the big horse products tend to be towels. And on the consumer side, the big horse tends to be bath tissue. And so there is a shift effect. Obviously, I think we have a good position in bath tissue on the consumer side that we like, and we're going to be ready to meet the consumers where they need us here. Jason English : No. Totally, I get it's apples and oranges for you, but not for the industry. And it's hard to imagine that we aren't seeing actual at home consumer tissue consumption up at least 14%. I mean, arguably you could make arguments that should be up 50%, and that would be real demand, not just stock piling. And a different, but somewhat related question. You mentioned you're trying to divert some capacity of KCP towards consumer. I imagine some of your other competitors who are much more deeply tethered to the washroom side and the industrial side are working even harder and faster to do just that. Are you seeing any evidence of that shift and what risk is there that we get a bit of a glove coming? So a lot of in ground supply coming to the consumer side, I don't know, two, three, six months out, however long it takes to refit some of that stuff. Michael Hsu : Again, I haven't seen any evidence of that thus far. I think certainly in the short-term given the supply situation in the market, maybe there has been a little more flexibility and some people looking to sell different products in the marketplace for consumer use. But in general, I think what Paul was talking about, which is our shifting capacity is to make Scott 1,000 or Scott products or Cottonelle products the right way when we make that shift and we're going to \u2013 and it'll have every bit the same quality that our consumers would expect. And so that's kind of the thought we're doing. I haven't seen any evidence of that shift as far from other suppliers, but certainly something we're going to keep watching. Jason English : Okay. Very good. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Michael Hsu : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with the Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Hope you're doing well. Thanks. Hey Mike, on the K-C strategy 2020, I guess my question here is around just how you're prioritizing investments that encompass that strategy. Are there capabilities that you think you can still make progress on in this environment or maybe take on more urgency versus others that need to be deferred or just seem a little bit less critical today versus even a few months ago. Can you just give some color there? Michael Hsu : Yes. I think the capabilities are all critical for moving forward and they're foundational for consumer products good company. I mean, I'll just kind of walk you through and we're kind of using them all right now, right. Innovation, a big one. Marketing with a special emphasis on digital, the sales execution or in-market execution and revenue management. And so if you click through all those, I think they all have important effects for us this year. Innovation, we're seeing strong traction in China, Central and Eastern Europe, North America on our product launches. And so we want to continue those. Obviously, digital is kind of how we are competing, and it's really the lion's share of our media investment. And so we got to get better at that and continuously. I think if you think about this environment though a lot it does come down to in market execution and we're still seeing very strong execution locally, and that matters more when we're in a tight supply situation, the coordination there. And then lastly, the revenue management, I think that will be \u2013 I think that\u2019s an important capability and especially given what we might anticipate some recessionary impacts and what that might do to create pressure in the promotion or pricing environment and we are very glad we had that capability to help us manage through that in an effective way. Maria Henry : Yes. I just add on there that, we came out of the gate strong as you would have expected in the first quarter and as we discussed our K-C 2022 strategies with you back in January. We executed that right out of the gate and you saw that come through in the numbers on between the lines spending with the advertising being up meaningfully in the quarter and also investment around the capability areas that Mike just described. We've already talked about how we see the advertising spend and trade spend in this environment. And then on the capability building activities, as you can imagine, again, with things like travel restrictions in place, some of the spend on those programs will take a pause here in the near-term, especially in the second quarter, just as people can't get to where they need to be in terms of some of the work that we\u2019re planning to do there. So strong out of the gate in the first quarter completely in line with what we talked about in our growth strategy around K-C 2022, a bit of a pause given the restrictions here in the near-term. But as soon as we can turn those activities back on full speed, we remain fully committed to them and we certainly will do that. Stephen Powers : Okay. That's great. And I guess second question, if I could, and you've talked a little bit about it, I just want to really hone in on it and be clear about how you're thinking about the expected trajectory of net price and mix realization through this cycle versus what we've all experienced in the past. Because it sounds like \u2013 because of input cost deflation and recessionary pressures, it sounds like you're saying we might see more trade down or net price givebacks promotion in developed markets. Just once you get through the surge demand, and while pricing will undoubtedly be sought after in D&E markets to offset FX, it sounds like you're preparing us to that we might see less than we might've expected based on past precedent. I don't want to put words in your mouth. I just want to run that back by you, and is that what I should have heard because I just want to take the\u2026 Michael Hsu : Yes. I think I probably am in a different place there. One, I would tell you that the pricing environment right now still remains broadly constructive. And in the current environment, we have dialed back significantly our promotion activity just given the demand environment. I think, in general, my preference is to drive category growth through innovation and advertising and to grow the overall categories. But we will stay close to what's happening in the marketplace and we're going to continue to be competitive. But it's not where I want to go. But I do think we have the capability to be very effective in a recessionary context. And I think we're well positioned in both cases with the right brands that offer value to the consumers. And when I say that, Steve, it's not necessarily price or promotion driven. And a lot of it I think will be communication or marketing relating to the value that our brands provide to consumers. Stephen Powers : Okay. So in this moment, you're not leaning one way or the other, you're just leaving all options on the table being ready for it and we'll see what happens. That's the message. Michael Hsu : Yes. And if I were to lead, again, I prefer in the high road, and I'd rather grow through innovation and brands. Stephen Powers : Okay. That's clear. Thanks so much. Michael Hsu : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. My first question has to do with the competitive environment and thinking strategically for the company. I would imagine that not only some of the competitors who supply private label to retailers, but also on the professional side are less well capitalized than you and Procter or GP, for example. So I'm wondering as you think about that, again, this goes back I think to sort of a strategic question. This could be a good opportunity to either expand your professional business, sign new contracts on the private label side. How do you think about that as opportunities maybe for outsized growth to sort of take advantage of some of your weaker competitors, if you will? Michael Hsu : Yes. Well, I think \u2013 Wendy, I think maybe the general theme is certainly there's been some significant change in the overall environment and also the competitive environment. And so what we really want to do is pivot to where the opportunity is for us to fill better needs are. And certainly when you talk about K-C Professional, I think I mentioned the opportunity for us to provide healthier workplaces I think is a very big opportunity and for us to compete more effectively. I think we are starting to have very good conversations there. I think we're starting to see success, much more faster success in our towel business despite a lot of locations being closed for now, but in our towel business, and because they're healthier or safer than jet air dryers. And so we are making those types of moves, and we'll work through the other areas. We also feel like obviously we're stronger. We have a stronger balance sheet, better capitalized. And so there are some customers who recognize the value of doing that. And so we want to leverage that opportunity as well. Wendy Nicholson : And do you think that, I mean as you think about what you've seen in the past from an economic perspective, if we are heading into a longer depressed economic environment, is private label something, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but it's kind of 5% of your volumes at this point. Is that something that you would actually be interested in increasing? Or you kind of want to keep it more focused on the branded side? Michael Hsu : Yes. I think we're certainly more focused on the branded side and thus far it's been a relatively small piece of our business. And certainly, Wendy, right now, with \u2013 given all what we got with our capacity limitations in the near-term, we're really focused on filling all the brand demand that we got right now. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. And then last question just on feminine hygiene in the U.S. Your market shares are so much better across so many different categories, but feminine hygiene is one area at least in Nielsen data, so I recognize that might not tell the whole story. But that's the one area both on the pad and the tampon side, where you continue to lose a little bit of share. Do you think that is pricing? Is it branding? Is it innovation? What's the \u2013 and again, it may not be \u2013 if we had all outlet data or whatever, that might not be an accurate reflection, but what's going on in that business? Michael Hsu : Yes. Wendy, in femcare in North America was up about high-single digits on volume, but we\u2019re down about a point on share. So I think you're right on what you're pushing on. We have a great global brand positioning with our She Can global brand idea, and I think that's been working for us globally. I think we do have our team that is working to improve that execution in North America and also bring the right innovations to the market. And so we love the brand positioning, but we got to do a better job of executing that North America and the teams all over it. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. Thanks so much. Michael Hsu : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Two unrelated questions. First one, Mike on the diaper business and the impact on birth rates from the recession in the U.S. So when we look back, we saw birth rates had begun to improve heading into the global financial crisis, and then we saw birth rates dip into the recession and they continued their decline. So I was curious if part of your planning process here, what your updated thoughts would be on the potential implications on birth rates from the recession and how that may inform your view for the category looking out not just over the next 12 months, but maybe over the next three to five years. And then unrelated on ecommerce, I would say, there's little debate that the adoption shift there has only accelerated given the nature of this recession. So I think it'd be helpful to get updated views on the company's market share positions in your biggest categories versus traditional retail, your margins in ecommerce versus traditional retail, and then maybe some comments on your positioning relative to private label? And that'll do it for me. Thank you for all that. Michael Hsu : Yes. With regard to diapers, I think we did see some improvement in the birth rate in North America over the past year or so. Now just recognize Kevin, we lag a year. So I think it had been down for the previous few years, down about, I don't know, 2-ish percent. And I think maybe the most recent year, our expectation was it \u2013 for it to be down about a point. And the category, I think through the back half of last year and through the first couple months of this year, really was rebounding quite well, and I would say up almost mid-single digits or technically mid-single digits. So I think it was a nice rebound in the category. Obviously, the stock up effect really kind of affected that and got it up to double-digits in the latest quarter for the full quarter. But we are very excited about our diaper business globally.  And in particular in North America, we've got great products, we've got a significant product improvement coming and Huggies Snug & Dry. And we've got great products across premium and strong momentum in our premium business. And so, again, I think, I think Jason's point, and I wouldn't expect the pandemic to grow category consumption and diapers. So there's pronounced stock up effect. But I do think, we are seeing an improvement or expect to see some improvements in the birth rate. On ecommerce, right now, given the supply situation, I think, again, as Paul mentioned, very, very strong double-digit growth that we had in the quarter. The focus right now is getting the supply out there and we are allocating products to customers and making sure that we get the right products out to our customers. And so really, maybe the focus in the near-term is about getting supply ramped up and out there and increasing our capacity. So \u2013 and then I forgot the third question. Kevin Grundy : It was all ecommerce related, Mike. It was not so much what's going on now because I realize there's a pantry load going on. So the sort of sell-through looks phenomenal. Selling it, of course, is very good as well. It's really, it's your market share positioning online relative to the traditional retail and your margins for online relative to traditional retail and even private label relative to traditional retail. Michael Hsu : Yes. Well, I'll break that down to our three principal markets. So obviously, our biggest ecommerce markets are in the U.S., China and Korea. In China, well over 50% of our businesses in ecommerce, and we have a very strong ecommerce position there. Similarly in Korea, almost 90% of the diaper business is on ecommerce. And obviously we\u2019re far and away the market share leader in Korea. And then in the U.S., I would say, across our categories overall, we're about fair share, although, however, we're probably a little ahead on consumer tissue and a little bit lighter on diapers, but we've been making progress there. In fact, I think we had a multiple share point increase last year on our online diaper shares. So we're making progress. With regard to margins, generally the way we price out particularly in North America, we price our customers, they're all on a similar program. So margins at the highest level tend to be about the same. There are going to be some differences because we do reflect advertising investment back to the customer because they are a customer. And so there will be some differences and it may appear that the margins maybe slightly lower, but that really reflects what we're doing, let's say, with Amazon media or Walmart media or those kinds of things. Kevin Grundy : Thank you very much. Yes, that's fine. Mike, thank you very much. Michael Hsu : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : Hi, good morning. So want to go back to the BRIC countries and really focus in on the volume piece rather than the price mix piece. Particularly, I wanted to understand from a COVID situation more of just from a recessionary situation. So if we could piece those two pieces apart, would love to understand first. What are you seeing in the BRIC countries in terms of consumers\u2019 ability to access your products because of some of those markets, maybe the retail stores aren't open, and how do you think about near-term demand being able to secure that? And then on the recessionary piece, do you think that volumetrically, some of these countries like in Latin America, China, and even India, that the business cannot just grow through a recessionary period based on what we know from 2008, 2009? And then I have a follow-up. Michael Hsu : Yes. With regard to BRIC, maybe I'll have to talk through the different pieces just because we don't want them together. But I think the \u2013 with regard to China, I would say the business for us has been largely back online both figuratively and literally. And since we tend to have a big portion of our business sold online, I think sales have, I would say, resumed, if not normal levels, closer to normal levels. And we feel very good about that. And I think our team feels very bullish about how that market is performing and where the consumer is headed there. Brazil is still early to tell because I think the impact of \u2013 we've been experiencing the recessionary impact in Brazil for a while now. And then the pandemic is a more recent phenomenon there. There's a little bit of a lag of it affecting it there, but it's starting to have an impact. And that's why we did see some of the stock up behavior. I do think we are seeing continued strong demand in tissue. It's a little tough to see what was the stock up effect versus what was the normal pull through effect, but it was definitely elevated. And then on the personal care side, we did see demand soften a little bit. And again, we\u2019ve been seeing that occur in the category over the last several quarters just based on the economic impacts. Let's see. BRIC \u2013 India, right now, we're strong double-digit growth and continue to have strong double-digit growth. But the more recent emphasis with COVID-19 now is making sure that we can maintain operational supply, and that's been a big focus. We were down for a period of time, while we were getting the right permits to operate as an essential business and we're back online now fully, but as you know or may read that, I think the COVID, we\u2019re very concerned about the repercussions in the marketplace and the effect it's going to have on consumers. And so we're staying close to that. That said, we experienced strong double-digit growth in the quarter there. And then Russia or Central and Eastern Europe for us overall continues to perform very strongly. It was up high teens overall. Strong share growth in diapers and femcare in Russia last quarter, multiple share points in both. It turns out, I was in Ukraine and Uzbekistan and Russia right before we went on work from home. The markets are performing great. Ukraine, we've achieved share leadership. I think we're about a 40 share at this point, nearly a 60 share in Kazakhstan, and we feel very good about the marks. I don't know that I have a clear view on maybe the pandemic effect yet because I think that's still working its way through, but we're watching that very closely. Steven Strycula : Thanks Mike. That was really helpful. And I have one quick follow-up and I'll pass it along. On the innovation slate for this year, how does the pandemic really impact that to certain products that may have been slotted or earmarked for March and April? Did those make it onto retail shelves? Or did maybe pieces of innovation slate get put into the back-to-school reset? Just help us understand what are you really excited about in the pipeline? Thank you. Michael Hsu : Yes. I mean, as I mentioned, we've got a lot of innovation coming on diapers this year with both in North America and Snug & Dry. Our premium products are fantastic. China, we're launching \u2013 we feel like we already have the best diaper in the marketplace and we're launching a significant upgrade to that this month that the team is very excited about. We've got a significant innovation coming in Latin America \u2013 well, especially Brazil on diapers. So that's diapers, I'll come back to it. Femcare, we have pad improvements and great marketing plans around the world and also in our adult care business. So we have a lot of good innovation that I mentioned earlier. I think in terms of the phasing in general, especially in personal care, it is going as per plan with a couple exceptions, which is, in Latin America because what Maria mentioned, we've delayed, we don't have the ability to get engineers internationally into locations to install new equipment. And so some of the innovation that we had slated for launching that we\u2019re going to launch in Brazil. We were also launching in other markets. We're delaying that just for executional reasons until we have access to the mills, and we don't \u2013 because we're prioritizing safety of our employees, we don't want people who are not traditionally going into the mill, going into the mill and creating a different \u2013 a germ environment, right. So it's not just for travel restrictions, but it's for safety restrictions also. And so we're consciously making some of those trade-offs. And so yes, net-net, we will delay some innovations, but it's more for executional reasons. Steven Strycula : Understood. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I'm all set. It was covered. Thank you so much. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Lauren. Paul Alexander : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have no other questions in the queue. Paul Alexander : All right. Well, we appreciate everyone's time and questions today, and we'll wrap up with a comment from Mike. Michael Hsu : Thank you all for joining our call. We're really encouraged by our solid start to the year and our ability to manage through these challenging conditions. And while they're challenging, we're obviously realistic about our near-term challenge, but we remain very optimistic in our long-term potential. So thank you for joining us today. Paul Alexander : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines and thank you for joining us this morning.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] At the conclusion of today\u2019s presentation, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Paul Alexander. Please go ahead sir. Paul Alexander : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This morning, you will hear from Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest quarterly and annual report for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. I hope everyone is continuing to stay healthy and safe in this environment. Let me go ahead and start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 4%, reflecting good underlying momentum and net benefits from increased demand related to COVID-19. We achieved significant cost savings margin improvements and record adjusted earnings. And additionally we achieved all-time record operating cash flow. Now let's cover the details of the results starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's up slightly from a year ago and includes a four point drag from currency rates. Volumes were up 2% and net selling prices and product mix each improved one point. By segment, organic sales rose 14% in consumer tissue and 2% in personal care but declined 10% in K-C Professional. Mike will provide more color on the top line in just a few minutes. Moving on to profitability. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 39.8%, up 520 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 16%. We had outstanding cost savings performance in the quarter. Combined savings from our FORCE and restructuring program totaled $175 million, including strong productivity improvements. We are now targeting full year cost savings of $510 million to $560 million. That's up nicely compared to our original range of $425 million to $500 million. Commodities were a benefit of $80 million in the quarter driven by pulp. We now expect full year commodity deflation of $150 million to $250 million. On average that's $75 million better than our original outlook. On the other hand, foreign currencies were a headwind in the quarter, reducing our operating profit by a high single-digit rate. For the full year, currency effects are expected to be a high single-digit drag on operating profit. Versus our original plan, the incremental currency headwinds are about twice the benefit of the improved commodity outlook. Other manufacturing costs were also higher year-on-year. For the full year, these costs are expected to increase more than we originally planned. That's due to incremental expenses related to COVID-19 partially offset by improved fixed cost absorption. Moving further down the P&L. Between the lines spending was up 40 basis points as a percent of sales, driven by a nice pickup in digital advertising. All-in-all, adjusted operating profit was up 28%. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, up 470 basis points versus year ago. Margins were up in all three business segments with significant improvement in consumer tissue. Consumer tissue margins included an approximate 175 basis point benefit from improved fixed cost absorption. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were a record $2.20, up 32% year-on-year. Let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was an all-time record of nearly $1.6 billion, compared to $609 million in the year ago quarter. The increase was driven by unusually strong working capital benefits, higher earnings and a temporary delay in tax payments. While cash flow is expected to decline in the back half of the year, we expect full year cash flow will be up very nicely year-on-year. Second quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled about $400 million. That was lower than normal because of our decision to temporarily suspend share repurchases for most of the second quarter. As we mentioned in this morning's news release, we will be restarting our share repurchase program beginning tomorrow. All in all, we delivered very good results across the board, while continuing to invest for future success. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Thank you, Maria. Good morning everyone. I really want to wish you and your family's good health and safety. I'll begin by commenting on how we're operating in the current environment and then I'll turn to our results and the outlook. Now, since the outbreak of COVID-19, Kimberly-Clark has taken decisive action to manage our business effectively through this crisis. Our key operating priorities remain as follows. First and foremost, we are focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and our consumers; second, we're proactively managing our global supply chain to ensure supply of our essential products and third, we're prudently managing the business through near-term volatility, while continuing to strengthen the long-term health of Kimberly-Clark. I'm really proud of how our 40,000 employees are managing through the challenges we're facing every day. Our global supply chain organization led by our frontline manufacturing employees is doing an outstanding job keeping our supply chain rolling. We have not experienced material impact even as we've had disruptions in several markets with elevated infection rates. Despite the tough environment, our teams continue to deliver strong cost savings and productivity improvements. While much of our attention has been on the near term, we are continuing to execute our longer-term strategies. Our teams pivoted rapidly to pursue new growth opportunities, that have been created in the pandemic environment and this includes opportunities to better meet consumer and end-user needs around health, wellness and protection, both in home and in the workplace. It also includes opportunities to accelerate e-commerce and digital as consumers change how they engage with our brands. Now, I'd like to make a few comments about our results. As Maria mentioned, organic sales increased 4% in the quarter. In North American consumer products, organic sales were up 12%. Now within that personal care rose 5% and that was driven by ongoing momentum on premium-tier Huggies, child care and baby wipes. In North American consumer tissue organic, sales increased 22%. Category demand was strong reflecting increased at-home consumption and some continued consumer stock-up in bath tissue. Category growth moderated in the latter part of the quarter. Shipments exceeded category demand especially in bath tissue as we work 24/7 to restore customer inventory levels. Turning to K-C Professional in North America, organic sales declined 3% and volumes fell 9%. This decline reflects the challenging environment. And I'll note that we experienced strong shipments early in the quarter which included benefits from higher-than-normal customer orders in late March that were ultimately fulfilled in April. Now, by product category, second quarter volumes were down about 20% in washroom, down double digits in safety. Now volume was up double digits in wipers and other products. Moving to D&E markets, sales were down 3%, driven primarily by K-C Professional. Personal care organic sales in D&E were up 2%. Now in key personal care markets, organic sales were up mid-teens in China and up double digits in India. In Eastern Europe, organic sales were up slightly, although results were impacted by some destocking and the impact of economic lockdowns. In Latin America, organic sales fell low single digits despite favorable pricing in Argentina. Category demand in many D&E countries has been impacted by a drop in consumer purchasing power and government restrictions on social mobility and store operations. In developed markets, organic sales were up 3%, driven by strong growth in consumer tissue. Now, as you know, we're also very focused on improving our market positions and we're making good progress. Overall, we're growing or maintaining market share in approximately 60% of our 80 category/country combinations that we track. In North American consumer products market shares are up or even in five of eight product categories. In D&E markets shares were up in Eastern Europe up or even in China and somewhat mixed in Latin America. In developed markets shares were up in South Korea and the U.K. So to summarize our first half, I'm very encouraged by our progress. We're delivering strong financial results. We're strengthening our market positions and we're managing through this crisis safely and effectively. Now I'll address the outlook. The duration and impact of COVID-19 on our business remains unclear and there continues to be uncertainty in the environment. However, our visibility is improving and we're restoring forward-looking guidance for 2020. Compared to our original plan we're raising our outlook for both organic sales and earnings. We're also increasing growth investment, primarily in digital advertising. On the top line we're targeting organic sales growth of 4% to 5% which is above our original plan of 2%. And this increase reflects a combination of improved underlying brand performance and higher demand driven by COVID. A few additional thoughts about our second half organic outlook, we have good underlying momentum and we'll continue to support our brands with strong advertising and innovation. New innovation includes launches on Pull-Ups in North America and feminine care in Eastern Europe Brazil and ASEAN. In addition, we expect bath tissue sales in North America will benefit from more people being at home and from our actions to improve customer inventory levels. We expect to continue facing challenging conditions in K-C Professional and in consumer categories in some D&E markets. We also expect to see additional consumer destocking in the second half. On the bottom line our revised outlook is adjusted earnings per share of $7.40 to $7.60. That's up 7% to 10% year-on-year compared to our original plan of $7.10 to $7.35. While, we're increasing our outlook we'll also invest more in our brands and capabilities. We temporarily paused some investment in the second quarter and now plan to restore and further increase investment this year. We're doing this to fuel market share momentum and to better position us for sustainable long-term success. In conclusion, we remain very optimistic about our opportunities to generate long-term growth and create shareholder value. We'll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our people and our consumers. We're executing our strategies well and we continue to operate our business with a balanced and sustainable approach. Now that concludes our prepared remarks and now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Mike Hsu : Hey Dara. Dara you may be on mute. Dara Mohsenian : Can you guys hear me? Mike Hsu : We got you. Paul Alexander : Yes. We got you. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. Great. Hope all is well on your end. Your full year EPS guidance even at the high end seems high single digit year-over-year earnings dropped in the back half of the year. So I was just hoping for a bit more clarity on some of the drivers behind that? First, I'm assuming a consumer pantry deload probably depresses top line results a bit given your comments about moderating category growth towards the end of the quarter, but perhaps that might be offset by you guys rebuilding retailer inventory levels from a shipment perspective. So just any commentary on sort of the hangover from a topline standpoint in the back half versus the first half elevated levels would be helpful? And then second, you mentioned the reinvestment back behind advertising. Can you give us a sense? Is that a significant amount of reinvestment versus your original guidance a couple of quarters back, as some of the other P&L line items have come in better than expected? And then just last have you budgeted more conservatism into that guidance than you normally would for the back half, just given the volatility in the environment? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks Dara. Yes, yes. A handful of questions. Let me lead off and I'll ask Maria to jump in because I think she'll give you a little bit better context. But I will say, resuming the guidance that definitely reflects our growing confidence in our ability to safely operate in this COVID environment. There are some big puts and takes certainly in demand. We see net favorable impact on demand overall though. And that reflects the strong demand growth in North America obviously in tissue which happens to be one of our largest businesses. We are seeing some offsetting effects, both in KCP, and as I mentioned, some D&E markets outside of China. And I think that still remains to be seen. And at this point of year, I think our range is still fairly wide and that probably reflects to some degree some of the uncertainty that still exists out there. But on the overall, we feel like demand should be for us overall a net positive. On the investment side, definitely in the second half, our plan was tilted to increase investment in the second half or a little bit more investment in the second half. We feel very good about where our product quality is and where our marketing and communications programs are for consumers, and we feel very good about the underlying brand performance across -- globally in most markets. And so, we really feel good about increasing our investment. The plan is for us -- we had a pretty significant uptick last year. I think it was about 60 bps in advertising increase, and our plan this year would be north of that. And that was our original plan, and we plan to meet that. But Maria, do you want to jump in there? Maria Henry : Sure. I think Mike you covered the highlights. When I think about the year, the overall financials look really good. As we raised our OP growth forecast, and we've raised our EPS forecast for the year. Operating cash flow should be stronger for the year than we expected back in January. So overall, financially this should be a really good year for Kimberly-Clark, and all of that with increased investment in our business not only for the near term but the long-term. The way that that favorability comes in is that, it's first half weighted, for obvious reasons given the COVID situation and its flow-through impacts on our business. So, when I look at the full year outlook, we're benefiting from solid top line growth, which is led by volume growth plus benefits from mix and price. Currency headwinds are expected to be partially, but not entirely offset by commodity deflation benefits. Savings are strong. We raised our outlook on total savings from FORCE and GRP to $510 million to $560 million for the year. And as Mike said, we are significantly increasing investments this year, particularly in advertising, but also in other areas like long-term capability builds. So for the total year, it looks good. If I compare the first half to second half and give you a little bit more detail. In the second half, for profit, we will have a -- we're expecting slowing volume growth, which impacts our profit where we had a sizable benefit in the first half. A little further benefit from 2019 pricing actions, and also as shelf availability improves in the back half we should see a return to more normal levels of promotion. Commodities are becoming slightly -- modestly inflationary by the end of the year. And in addition, our cost savings are not expected to be as strong in the second half. And we're also increasing our investment in the back half of the year, as Mike talked about. So that's really what's going on. And my comment on the guidance is, I'm happy to reinstate guidance at this point, given that we have more comfort and fight into our supply chain team's ability to maintain our operations during spikes of COVID. That was less uncertain to us back in the April time frame. So the supply chain risk has been reduced, number one. Number two, the commodity currency environment overall, has calmed down since where we were in March, April. And so I would say, the guidance is realistic and it reflects what we're thinking based on what we see and the actions we intend to take through the remainder of the year. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. That's very comprehensive. That's helpful. And then on the promotional environment, you mentioned in the pricing environment, obviously, we've seen a big promotional pullback in the U.S. here post-COVID. What are you guys expecting in the balance of the year? Does some of that linger? Do we get more back to a normalized type of environment? Particularly, if category growth weakens a bit, does that create more risk? And perhaps just touch on what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint, particularly on the private label front here in terms of the U.S. pricing environment. Mike Hsu : Yes. U.S. in particular I think Dara I would say, the same thing I said last quarter is that I think the market has broadly been constructive. And that's because right now, especially the focus is on supply and we still are rebuilding inventories. I would say, we've made progress on the personal care side. We are still catching up and we're gaining on tissue. But we're -- our service levels still aren't where we want them to be and our in-stock still isn't where we want it to be. And so we're still working through that and so we're not promoting as much as we had in the past in this environment. I think actually the categories or other players in the market are not promoting as much either. I think just a couple of factoids. Volumes sold on promotion in the quarter for the category was down depending on the category somewhere between 25% and 50%. And so I think that does reflect the situation and I think that makes sense and as -- makes sense for the business at this point. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And I was getting more sort of the back half of the year, what you guys are expecting, what you started to see towards the end of the quarter so far in July? Have you seen any changes in behavior? And is this sort of new environment post-COVID likely to linger in your mind, or could you see a ramp-up with category growth dissipating a bit? So, looking more ahead as we look out to the balance of the year. Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes. I don't see it changing significantly in the balance of the year, because of the supply situation. I mean, I think I just said that we're making a little progress in improving our supply situation on tissue, but we still have a lot of work to do to catch up, and because of that supply is still tight. And so I don't see certainly from our end a heavy promotional environment from our perspective. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks so much. So I was hoping first you could talk a little bit about mix. Mike one of the things that you've talked about quite a bit is elevating the categories and some of the efforts that you're putting towards that in terms of innovation. So personal care mix was up 2% this quarter. So if you could talk a little bit about that where you're -- if you're seeing some greater traction with the higher-priced innovations. And then how we should think about that in more economically challenged markets like in Latin America or perhaps as it evolves over Central and Eastern Europe, how we should think about mix in your innovation agenda? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes. Great question. Yes. Mix overall, I think, across both consumer personal care and consumer tissue and in KCP mix generally has been favorable for us across all markets. And it's part of the core strategy which is elevate our categories being one. We have recently been more focused on premiumizing our categories with higher margin products that serve the consumers better with better product features, and so we've driven that. And for reference, we've shifted our mix in Brazil diapers significantly. We were primarily -- a couple of years ago primarily a value-tier brand. And we're at the precipice of being primarily a premium-tier brand at this point two years later. And so now the caveat to that is with the shift in economic conditions, we've got to be able to pivot and meet the needs of our consumer. And so even the -- all of the team has focused on premiumizing or driving the premium tiers in Brazil for the last couple of years and made a lot of progress. They've shifted rapidly. And if you look at the quarter, I think Brazil the category was down high single-digits mostly driven through macros, right? There's as we mentioned in the remarks less consumer purchasing power, literally less money for consumers to spend and so they're really tightening up their household budgets. And so for us, we like having kind of a broad portfolio that we play in the value tier and the premium tier. And while our long-term strategy is drive premiumization, we want to be able to play both sides. And so we're pivoting accordingly and driving the value-tier business at this point. And so that's occurred in consumer tissue as well. Notably our Cottonelle share was up almost a couple of points I think this quarter and that has a positive effect on mix for us in some ways. If you look at diapers, obviously, our premium-tier diapers are little movers. Little Snugglers have been growing faster, in our business. And then, interestingly in KCP also a strong positive mix shift this quarter behind wipers, which tend to be a little bit higher margin for us. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great and just to complete the thought on Brazil, you've mentioned that the category was down high-single digits in Brazil. And then what was your performance? Mike Hsu : Yeah. So we were up slightly, right? And so -- and -- and so overall -- and I think this would apply to many of our D&E markets. I think our end market or underlying brand performance has been strong, across D&E. But as we maybe highlighted in the last quarter the unknown around COVID was the implications or what the impact was going to be on some of the market conditions. And what's happened in some of these D&E markets like Brazil and Russia is the government doesn't have programs like PPP, in the U.S. And so the consumers don't have a backup plan or a subsidy when they're out of work or not going to work. And so it really battens down the hatches on their household spending, pretty tightly, pretty quickly. And because of that, I would say, we're pivoting our programming around which products we emphasize. But the underlying performance continued to be strong. For example, in Russia, which had a similar slowdown in the category, the category was down slightly. We were up. But we gained three share points, but there was a pretty big macro effect. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. That's great. And if I can ask a slightly longer-term question, so I know we're going to have challenging comparisons in 2021. But just in general, as you've laid out your Strategy 2022 plan, you're looking for organic sales growth sort of in that 1% to 3% range 2% originally for this year, with the idea that as you were making investments to upgrade capabilities, marketing, innovation, product quality all those things that you could reaccelerate toward 3% to 5%. With the higher spending, that both the commodity environment and the serve consumer demand is allowing you, how do you think that plays out in terms of the time line to kind of get closer to those long-term organic targets, as we look beyond -- again beyond the sort of COVID-enhanced if you will, near-term environment? Mike Hsu : Yeah. Great question, the -- we would like to get back to our longer-term targets over time. And I think one of the reasons we moved to kind of the medium-term targets originally was the categories had slowed down significantly. And obviously in this environment the category has ticked up again. And I think, we're building the fundamentals and building our capability. And as we get more confident, both in our plans and the quality of our investments and our ability to invest, we would hope to get to a faster growth algorithm at some point in time. But right now I think we're still -- we still believe the medium-term targets that we put out there are the right ones for us. And then, we'll update those when we feel like it's appropriate. Lauren Lieberman : And again, Mike, that would still have more to do with category growth. And not wanting to call that rather than your, I guess, the magnitude and strength of the advertising programs, the innovation product quality and so on? Mike Hsu : Yeah. I think, it would be a combination of both. I think we would -- definitely when I see a little more from the category, more consistency over a longer period of time. And also get more confidence in our own executions and our own plans, Paul and Maria, any other commentary there? Maria Henry : No. I would just say that the investments that we're making, we are expecting a return on those investments. And much of the investment is growth-related investments. Although there is also investment on core capabilities not only growth related, but also productivity related. So they -- we are expecting a strong return on those investments. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks so much. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Lauren. Next one. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Hi. Good morning everyone. And congrats on the strong results, in the first half of the year, particularly given the environment, Mike, just to pick up on, some of the line of questioning regarding investment levels, particularly around advertising and marketing. So my question is, what do you think is the appropriate level longer term? Will the step-up that you're targeting this year be a permanent one? And maybe help us think about the magnitude of the increase this year because when we kind of tumble through the numbers and then for you as well Maria just given what you've provided with respect to commodities and for savings and restructuring and FX there's a pretty substantial offset to get to your numbers. So, how much of that is advertising and marketing? And then how should we be thinking about that? And Mike how are you thinking about it longer term? Mike Hsu : Yes, I'll let maybe Maria comment further on kind of the details of the step-up. But we are planning a significant increase this year just as we did last year. The -- Kevin I don't -- we have not set internally a long-range target but I -- in terms of what our overall A&P spending should be. But I would recognize while historically our advertising has been about average for the industry, it's been less than some of our direct competitors. And so we feel like there are two factors that we want to do which is to accelerate growth we feel like we need to fuel that with better products and better programming, both advertising and sales programs to drive our business and market development programs. And at the same time, it's going to require more investment and so we're doing that. Now, we don't have a long-range target that's public but I would say we would like to be north of where we are today and what we finish this year. Kevin Grundy : Okay. Maria anything to add? Maria Henry : Yes, I would just add that as a reminder our advertising investment will be back-half loaded and our capability building investments will also be back-half loaded. You may recall that when we were on the phone in April, we talked about the fact that with all of the volatility and uncertainty we were pausing some of our investments. And so the back-half higher numbers are partially related to that stepping back up to our original levels of investment and then also increasing the level of those investments given the overall performance for the year. Kevin Grundy : Okay. Thank you, both for the color. Appreciate it. I have a number of questions, but I'll pass it onto other folks. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Thanks Kevin. Paul Alexander : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with the Deutsche Bank. Mike Hsu : Good morning Steve. Steve Powers : Morning. Morning. Thank you. I don't know if you guys have looked at it this way. But I guess Maria maybe I was hoping you could talk us through the second quarter gross margin less so relative to a year ago, but relative to the first quarter just because I know there were a lot of variables. But just based on the headline disclosures it's hard to conceive of how the margin gets 260 basis points better in 2Q versus 1Q. So, I'm just -- maybe you can unpack a little bit of that to give us a sense of the moving parts. Maria Henry : Sure. A few pieces to comment on. The savings in the second quarter were very strong as we discussed. On the margin side of house, we also have benefit from geographic mix. So, when you look across the board the stronger performance in North America where our margins are higher than in developing and emerging market, definitely helped us on the margin side of the house. So, those were two of the bigger drivers. Steve Powers : Okay, okay. That makes sense. I guess the other question and I think you talked a little bit about this. But I guess as I listen to your answers to Kevin's question to Lauren before that is there -- maybe you can just talk a little bit more to the extent you can on the specific nature of the second half investments. Just a little bit more specificity would be helpful. And I guess I'm really trying to get a sense for how much of those investments are more tactical where we can think of the returns that you mentioned sort of being yielded in the next 12 months versus those that are longer term in nature that are capabilities that won't yield a return necessarily next year but in the coming two or three-plus years. Is there a way to describe that balance? Mike Hsu : Yes, yes. I think -- let's see Steve. I guess I would probably characterize them all as longer term in nature, but that includes advertising and brand building and capability investment. And both I classify as more long term -- more longer term in nature versus what I would say short term, \"Hey we're going to do a big buy one get one free promotion\", right? So it's less tactical in that sense and more long term in the sense of building equity over the long term. But now, the caveat of that is a lot of the -- most of the advertising investment is in digital and that does generate returns sooner. And now we can evaluate those real time and that's one of the reasons why we do it. But that has both an equity-building component and in some ways a volume -- or short-term volume-driving component. And so I'd say a big chunk is as Maria mentioned in her remarks digital advertising. We are investing a significant sum that will flow through to more of the overhead lines in capability building. And really a couple of areas that we're investing aggressively in is what we've called a revenue growth management which was going to help us with trade promotion efficiency and our price pack architectures and how we do pricing globally. And really the notion here is as we're building the global capability, we have a global framework and approach to it. We need to have the right analytics around the world. We need to have the right talent and we need to have the right tools. And so they're significant investments we're making to improve that capability there. Similarly on digital and our digital capability, not only in the spend, but what we're driving is what Alison would call performance marketing capability. And that requires the same things that I just highlighted in revenue growth management, which is analytics, talent and tools. And so those were some longer-term investments we're making. Steve Powers : Yes. That's helpful. I guess just last follow-up on that is just the lead time you need to make on these investments. Are these investments that as we sit here in July, you've kind of earmarked and locked in for the back half or -- especially there's not a lot of flex in it, or are there elements to the investments that can be flexed to the extent that the pricing environment that right now looks good kind of looks differently or the demand environment dries up? Just how much discretion and flex do you have in what's lined up for the second half? Mike Hsu : Well, maybe I'll let -- I'll defer to Maria's judgment here, but I would say there's always some flexibility. Nothing's ever set in stone unless we bought upfront everything, which in our case we haven't. And by definition, I think there's a lot more flexibility in digital in terms of how we go to market there. So Maria, any additional insights? Maria Henry : Yes. I think that's right. We do have some flexibility on the discretionary investments that we plan to make in the second half of the year. And to circle back to your first question, which I missed one other relevant component on the Q2 to Q1, you may recall that we made meaningful investments to shore up our mills and that included additional compensation as well as other supply chain investments. Those were first quarter weighted. And then I just reiterate my comment that we did take a pause on spending an investment in the second quarter and that affected our G&A. So the G&A increase was lower in the second quarter than the first quarter. So just to try to help with the math there. Steve Powers : Yeah. Thank you. That's all. All those comments were really helpful. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Nik. Nik Modi : Yes. So Mike, I just wanted to kind of get your sense. Obviously things are changing at a rapid rate in terms of openings and closings and that has an impact on consumption, especially at at-home consumption. So I was just hoping you can give us some context on what you're seeing in July as it relates to some of the changes that have been taking place on a regional basis? And is your supply chain in a position yet, where it can actually execute based on some of these very kind of micro regional changes whether it be by county or by just that city or state level? Mike Hsu : Yes. And Nik, I assume you're really asking as infection rates change around markets or locations? Nik Modi : Yes, yes. Just given that's dictating how open an economy is. Mike Hsu : Yeah. Well, I'll talk maybe operations and then the economy. One, I will start with our operations, which I think the team has been doing a phenomenal job executing very well and with a really disciplined approach to COVID-19. Nik, we really have been prioritizing the safety of our employees in our plants. And we've had some sporadic outages. I will tell you, we're on the mode now is we're tracking the infection rates very closely to the lowest level possible. And in the U.S. that means by county is where we \u2013 we make our decisions. We proactively closed plants for cleaning or make other decisions based on what those infection rates are. And so overall, as I mentioned earlier, I think we've become more confident in our ability to operate in an infection rate environment that fluctuates, and we've done that throughout this year thus far. And so on that component, I think we've really escalated our safety procedures and we feel good about that. I think from an economy perspective, again, we're still kind of working through kind of the changes. And I think we highlighted in Q1 that there were some question marks in developing and emerging markets how that would be affected. I think that has come to be realized particularly in Latin America where we're seeing a fairly high impact of COVID plus in a lot of the markets down there a lot of countries down there very strict government lockdowns on social mobility, and as I mentioned earlier, less money for consumers to spend. And so we're seeing a bigger impact. I think we've made the call in our forecast, and we feel like we have it called right. But it is one of the reasons why we left the range a little bit wider, because there still is some uncertainty there. But net-net, I would say, if you look at the U.S. we would expect and we mentioned in bath tissue probably would be modestly higher, because of people being at home more often. And with the U.S. being our \u2013 by far our largest market that's a net positive financially, and then we'll work through some of the challenges in some of the D&E markets even though our underlying brand performance continues to be strong. Nik Modi : And then, if I could just follow up real quick on a quick online question. Just it seems this is kind of an arms race to get in the consumer's basket, especially because those new online consumers. How do you feel about your current positioning around that in terms of being the number one choice in the basket right now? Because it seems like that going forward will be a lot more sticky than what you would normally see in a brick-and-mortar environment. Or you could disagree with me. Do you think that's not the case? Mike Hsu : No, no. Overall, we feel very good. I mean, I think we \u2013 over time \u2013 and I think we've made progress in our digital and e-commerce capability, e-commerce in particular. We've got very highly developed businesses in Asia, particularly South Korea and China. The U.S., I think we've really strengthened over the last five years or so. I think when we started off, we're probably in the U.S. a little lighter or a little later to the party in baby and child care, but I think we've caught up, and I think we're at our fair share online now. And in tissue, we've been a little bit \u2013 I think a little bit ahead. And so we feel very good about our overall positioning. The interesting areas are some of the D&E markets, where even 18 months ago nobody was talking e-commerce in Brazil, and it was an infinitesimal part of our business. It's becoming fairly significant and we're making a lot of progress at best. And the interesting thing is in the capability development we're talking about with this digital and e-commerce global capabilities, we really are applying lessons from our top markets like China, or South Korea globally and that's really having a big impact. For instance, one of the key strategies that Brazil is running is really adopted from our South Korea business. Nik Modi : Great. Thanks, Mike. Good luck. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Nik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : Hi. Good morning. And congrats for restoring the guidance and buybacks and also the Brothers team for shipping all this volume. So can you \u2013 can you comment on what you saw in orders exiting the quarter for both developed and emerging markets on the consumer side? And in the professional business in other words, what was the volume rate in June much lower than the quarter, or you were still catching up on the shop and destocking as you said a couple of times in this call? And following up on the mix comments in emerging markets, it's great to hear about the margin accretive innovation in Brazil, but are you seeing category improving also in China and Eastern Europe, or disposable income pressures are more than offsetting the reopenings? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes. Maybe I'll start with -- I think the KCP, just to give you a little more texture. I think definitely the business is impacted by the global slowdown, but the team is really pivoting aggressively to create healthier workplaces. And so the organic overall for the business globally was down 10%. North America was down 3%. And per your question and I think, I mentioned in my remarks that we had significant orders in March that we shipped in April. So that offsets. So I think the run rate is a little worse than 3%. And -- but there's a couple of factors. I mean definitely declines in the core washroom business, I mentioned globally, but I think the washroom business was down about 20%. Offices, industrial travel and lodging all significantly down and remains significantly down. We do see some pickup in health care grocery and e-commerce that's offsetting that to some degree. And then also in K-C Professional, we are capturing growth. As I mentioned wipers is up double-digits and so that's a positive one for us with a positive mix effect. And then we are expanding our mask offering. We had sold some co-pack masks so we're -- we have a very small mask business, but we have begun self-manufacturing masks. We actually think we have great technology from a materials perspective. We're a large non-wovens producer and we feel like our non-wovens fabrics are excellent materials for masks. And so we are producing some masks. Primarily we started for internal production for our mills using our plants, but we are selling them externally now and that will be a good part of our business going forward. So that's the KCP part. And again I think your question on the consumer side. Again in personal care, there was a pronounced stock-up in the first quarter as you might recall and we have double-digit growth across the categories. If you think about personal care like a diaper there's no reason for a surge like that. And so subsequently in Q2 we're seeing -- if you look at the Nielsen some of that reverse out. And -- but I do think in personal care overall it'll level out to more normalized numbers still probably positive, but more normalized. In tissue people at home are equals more use at home. And so we will see I think a fairly significant growth this year overall for the tissue categories. And we're up in all three tissue categories in North America up double-digits. And we think despite -- there's been a little softness in the last quarter some reversals, but we still should see a higher overall consumption in tissue both in North America and other developed markets for the balance of the year. So I'll pause there. I think there were a couple of other questions there. If you could just remind me Andrea what else you want me to hit on. Andrea Teixeira : Yes. Sorry, Mike. Yes. I wanted to just go -- if you take us throughout the world. But before you do like just to finalize your comment about the consumer tissue business. Are you seeing\u2026 Mike Hsu : Yeah. Andrea Teixeira : Because what we've seen Nielsen obviously, doesn't capture the non-track channels. Are you seeing -- are you losing share or like industry? I mean, I think, you mentioned like five out of eight categories that you're gaining share. So that I'm assuming is encompassing of all channels. So if you can take us through that and then talk about take us throughout the world also for China and Korea in terms of share of those categories? Mike Hsu : Yes. Okay. Yes. So largely I think, we feel very good about our share performance and we're making progress there. By the categories, we track and we track 80 country-category combinations what we call in the cohorts. We're up or even in 60% of those. And in North America we had five of eight. Within consumer tissue we -- the way we tracked across all outlets we're up in all brands with the lone exception of Scott -- or Scott bath tissue. And that was mostly driven by -- we're probably the most supply-constrained on Scott 1000. And so Cottonelle was up about two share points or almost two share points. Kleenex was up over a point. Kleenex up in many markets up significantly and so we feel good about the share performance overall. Importantly in North America, Huggies was up two share points and so behind strong momentum on the premium side of the business. If I click around the world, strong share momentum in Central and Eastern Europe. As I mentioned earlier, category has slowed down because of consumer purchasing power. But across CEE, our shares were up significantly. In diapers, in Russia, we're up three share points; femcare up 1 point. We were up about 2 points in the Ukraine and up about 2 points in Kazakhstan and growing -- still growing well across CIS. And so, I think, that we'll continue to make progress there. Importantly in China, I think, we are about even in share in diapers and up pretty significantly in feminine care. And the mix on diapers is really a tale of -- we're probably up almost two share points on the premium side of the business, but offset by declines in value, which we're deemphasizing a little bit in China, right now. So we feel good about the strategy in China and the progress we're making on the China business. And, overall, in China, I think, we were up strong double digits or mid-teens in the quarter on performance. And then the other areas, as we mentioned, I think, Brazil, I think, we were up in one category, even in one category and down in one category. But overall, I think, the story in Brazil is more about the category and the economy and the team is holding up well and pivoting accordingly. The other areas that we mentioned in the past, we are making pretty good progress in Peru. We've mentioned that's been an issue for us towards the second half of last year. We're making very strong progress with pretty significant share improvement -- sequential share improvement in our diaper business. But similar story to Brazil, the story is more the category there. The category was down about 10% in the quarter, which is the biggest drop, I think, perhaps, in Peru in 30 years. And so -- which has been a strong growth category for us for a long time. And that's all related to COVID. And I see really strongly improving brand performance. So, I know, I just threw a lot at you. I'll pause there and ask if you have any other follow-ups here. Andrea Teixeira : No. That's great. Appreciate the color. And then on the e-commerce and all the capabilities that you're putting together, can you update us how it evolved since the first quarter to the second quarter? And what is your goal as you put more money behind those capabilities? Mike Hsu : Yes. Well, I think, from the capability perspective, we've resourced teams. We've built out kind of an overall global approach and we've got leaders kind of in each of the four kind of core commercial capabilities that we've talked about. They report through Alison Lewis, our Chief Growth Officer. And so, we stood that up and now we're in the process of making the right investments, as I mentioned, in the tools, in adding talent, adding staff, or people who know how to do this stuff cold and then in driving the analytics, to help us to better decision-making. Andrea Teixeira : And how much do you -- are you ready to share, like, how much it represents on your -- from your sales now in the second quarter and how much it grew, e-commerce globally? Mike Hsu : I don't think we're ready to share that yet, but I'll pause and maybe I'll defer to Paul here. Paul Alexander : Yes. Mike, I can take that. So, Andrea, on a year-to-date basis, from what we can see, we would say sales via e-commerce or an omni-channel perspective would be, growing at 30% across the company. Andrea Teixeira : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Paul Alexander : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Thanks. Paul Alexander : Hi, Olivia. Olivia Tong : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I hope you guys are doing well. Want to ask you about cost savings. FORCE and the other restructuring savings were quite a bit better than -- your expectations are quite a bit better than your January expectations. So, are these new projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the pandemic? Or are these savings that came -- that have come out because the efficiencies required to meet COVID-related demand? Because it sounded like, you pushed out some projects from the first half into the second half, some of the cost savings projects. So that's my first question. Thanks. Maria Henry : Sure. Some of the benefit is COVID related, but let me talk both about FORCE and restructuring on FORCE. It was a very strong quarter and better than we were expecting and that's really coming from productivity in our manufacturing sites, as well as a step-up in expected savings associated with negotiated material pricing. On the productivity side, the reason I say some of it is COVID related is, as we've discussed before we did do some SKU rationalization. And with fewer SKUs to run, the output on our machines is much higher, so strong productivity there. And we also see less waste when we have fewer changeovers. When we talk about some of the COVID-related delays, which we mentioned back in April, those are going to impact the second half more than they did in the second quarter. So that's on FORCE. And then on restructuring, you get that same benefit on productivity. The assets that we have stood up as part of the restructuring program are running better than we expected. And again the delays that we had there on starting up those restructuring programs, as we can't get people into the mills with the travel restrictions and safety considerations, those will impact the second half more than the first half. Olivia Tong : All right. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the -- you parse it out. What came just from COVID and potentially comes returns? Basically those are reinstated costs that go back in once things get better. And then the other thing is, just if you could talk through the flexibility in your manufacturing and distribution, particularly if a region sees a spike in cases and you do end up with cases in a plant that results in a -- obviously, lower productivity in a plant. Now, that we see cases rising in areas where you guys actually make stuff. So, what kind of plans do you have in place? What kind of flexibility do you have if a particular area shut down? And is there capacity in another region to ship from there? It's a little bit tough when it comes to tissue towel obviously and a couple of the other categories given these are things that don't typically move very long distances. Thanks. Maria Henry : Sure, sure. I think the strong productivity gains that we had related to SKU rationalization, we wouldn't expect the level of rationalization that we're currently delivering in order to meet the elevated demand, but we also don't expect to go back to where we were. So, there should be some ongoing benefit from that as we look out longer term. Productivity and savings also are driven by higher volumes. Higher volumes have a lot of benefit across the P&L and cash flow. If you think about one of the elements of our FORCE savings program is the benefit from product design changes. And so, if we reduce the cost of producing a product, you've got the net savings and then that's multiplied by the volumes. So, when you've got higher volumes you have bigger savings. So, part of that goes as the volumes go on the way it shows up in our P&L. And on your other question on supply chain and inventories, we've done a few things to help ensure that we've got the supply to meet the customer and consumer demand. The supply chain team has taken a number of actions to move inventory closer to where the demand is coming from. We have also looked across the globe at where we have production capacity to help out where we are capacity constrained. As you note, that's more efficient on some of our products, particularly in the personal care area versus the tissue area. But on the tissue area, we're also getting some help from K-C de M\u00e9xico, which has been great. And the team has been actively working to qualify third-party suppliers to help us meet the high levels of demand. Olivia Tong : That's super helpful. And then just one question, Mike on the personal care side of the business. So, can you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment and the balance you're looking for, as you try to drive market share growth, but of course thinking through what may become a more difficult macro environment as we go forward? What's your view in terms of -- it sounds like supply is now sort of pretty much caught up to demand. So what's your view on the promotional environment? Does it still stay suppressed, or does it actually come back as supply and production normalizes? Mike Hsu : Yeah. I think we're on the personal care side, generally I think we're -- at this point, we haven't caught all the way up but we're getting closer, certainly closer than we are in tissue. I do think though the terms of competition in personal care are healthy at this point. In most markets they have turned, I would say to product quality and to advertising notably in China, which I think had been very price-sensitive for maybe the prior three years or so. I think there was a return to maybe a healthier competitive dynamic in the category in the sense of bringing more innovation and meeting consumers' needs in that dimension. I think -- and that's something that -- certainly our strategy, which is to take the high road, make better products and to bring more consumers into the category is, kind of, our focus versus trying to rent share. And so we're seeing that generally in most markets. Maybe there is a little bit of a competitive entry in Argentina and Brazil with some local competitors. But overall I would say generally in North America, China, Central and Eastern Europe, I think it's been -- we've been competing on innovation and marketing and I feel like that's healthy for the category. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you so much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Olivia. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Mike Hsu : Good morning Jason. Jason English : Thank you. Congratulations on the strong results this quarter and the strong results year-to-date. It's impressive particularly in context of the environment. I want to come back and just come back to the same line of question you were getting early in the call on the implicit guidance for the back half of the year, because I'm still left a bit befuddled. You've talked about currency and commodities netting neutral in the back half. You've got 210 to 260 of productivity still to come. You're expecting organic sales growth on both volume and price yet EBIT is going to be down $120 million to $220 million or so roughly in the back half of the year. You stack it up and it implies well north of $400 million of reinvestment in the business, and that's on top of the heavy investment that already came in the first half. There doesn't look to be a lot of evidence of you deferring expenses. SG&A is up 9% in the front half. So I think everyone's going to walk away saying, this is really conservative. They're not going to spend that much. And why would that conclusion be wrong? Like what are we missing? That's a huge chunk of money. Are there other offsets, or where will you spend such a big slug of dollars if that is the right figure? Maria Henry : Yeah. Let me, kind of, go ahead and tick through it, and then I'll turn it over to Mike to talk more about the investments that we are making. If I look at currency commodity and price Jason, we had a meaningful benefit from that in the first half of the year and that will be a drag in the second half of the year. On price, as I mentioned, the year-over-year benefit from the 2019 pricing actions that we took has now materialized itself in the P&L. Input costs, inflation benefits are weighted to the first half. And while input costs are expected to stay relatively stable to maybe slightly inflationary in the back half when you look at the year-over-year comparison, you'll remember that input costs turned deflationary for us in the second half of last year. So when you look year-over-year, we don't have the benefits that we enjoyed in the P&L in the first half. We're getting lower benefit from volume mix. Our other manufacturing costs will continue to remain elevated, given the safety and sanitation protocols that we have in place. We talked about the step-up in advertising and capability investments and then we have lower savings from both the restructuring program and the FORCE program in the second half, so just to be clear on where we stand on those main drivers. And then I'll turn it back to Mike to comment on the investments. Mike Hsu : Yes. I mean, I think it is \u2013 we do have significant investment plan. We feel like we have good opportunities to spend it on, as I mentioned, primarily digital advertising and then the capabilities that we talked about revenue growth management and digital marketing. But I think for me the other two things I'd mention is, there's still a lot of uncertainty in our back half. Part of it related as I mentioned in my remarks related to KCP. And I would say because of the April \u2013 or March, April, North America impact, I would probably say there's probably still a little more slowdown that we would expect in KCP planning for. And then there's a lot \u2013 still a lot of COVID-related uncertainty in developing and emerging markets, where we just saw kind of the beginning of that in the second quarter. And so there's two \u2013 really two impact aspects which is there's definitely investment but there's also we're \u2013 in our plans we're leaving ourselves some room to manage through some of the COVID-related issues that still exists that are still widely unknown. Jason English : Okay. I understand that. Real quick on the elevated manufacturing costs because to me maybe that's the one thing that's missing from our bridge. When we look at the second quarter though there's not a lot of evidence and the gross margin expansion was heroic. And when I bridge it through with volume, price, the productivity and the input cost figures you gave, it kind of all fits. There's no sort of leakage despite what seems to be some decremental margins with just the business mix. So it doesn't look like there's a lot of elevated manufacturing costs in the second quarter. What was it? Like why wouldn't that same sort of margin build hold? Why would we start to see leakage on that sort of simple build in the back half of the year if that makes sense? Maria Henry : Right. I think for the back half versus the first half on the \u2013 what we call other manufacturing costs, the drag will be relatively similar. And within other manufacturing costs that category is generally inflationary so that's not unusual. And it continued to be inflationary on the standard components including our investment in product improvements, which shows up in the form of on costs in the manufacturing part of the P&L and also regular labor rate inflation. What is new and related to COVID is that we have those cost increases related to the supply chain impacts around standardization and safety protocols that are elevating these. And then that's partially offset by fixed cost absorption from the stronger volumes but it's not completely offset. Jason English : Okay. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Wendy. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. I know this has been a long call, so I want to make my questions really direct and short. And then simply on the professional business, that business we all expected I think to be weak. I'm wondering number one, what are you seeing in third quarter has just started. But what are your expectations for trends in that business in the third quarter, same type of volume decline better or worse? And can you remind us of the gross margin in that business? Is it above or below corporate average? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yeah. Maybe I'll have the trend. And maybe Paul or Maria if you could, the gross margin, I don't have that off the top of my head. But I think the, the trend I would say and given kind of the remarks we made Wendy would be, probably slightly worse than what we had in the second quarter, because of that the high orders that came at the end of March that were shipped in April. And so the run rate was probably a little -- a touch lower in North America than the 3% that we ended up in the quarter. That said \u2013 so, we'll have the core washroom business down, double-digits. We are making progress on our wipers. And as I mentioned, our new mask business. And so those will be offsets to the good. Maria Henry : And Paul, I'm not sure about -- if we comment on gross margins. So I'm going to pass that to you. Paul Alexander : Yeah. Thanks, Maria. So we don't provide specific numbers at the segment level on gross margins. What I would say is that, maybe not surprisingly margins for KCP would be in between personal care and consumer tissue. And they're pretty healthy overall. Wendy Nicholson : And the reason I ask is because... Mike Hsu : Hi Wendy my apologies. Wendy Nicholson : Yeah. Yeah. Mike Hsu : I'll just -- I'll apologize. The three of us are in separate rooms because of COVID. So normally if I started answering that Paul would slap me with a ruler, but he's not able to do that right now. Wendy Nicholson : No problem. And the reason I ask is because that business in particular -- I mean obviously you saw a sharp -- shortfall in sales again which we expected. But your cost control, and the benefits of the gross margin, or the benefits of commodities really insulated your profits there. And so I'm wondering, just as we think about the second half and modeling, I assume that's a business that all of the investment spending, you're probably not going to spend quite as much from an investment spending perspective. So I would think that that's a business that could whatever, continue to kind of carry the day from a profitability perspective, simply given the commodity environment is still so favorable et cetera, et cetera. Is that a fair assumption? Sounds like, you've made significant cost cuts which have sort of restructured that business a little bit. Am I reading too much into that? Mike Hsu : I think that one the team is doing an outstanding job managing the costs. But also they're doing an outstanding job pivoting to maybe what I think our -- Russ our president of that division would call kind of the essential to create healthier workplaces, right? It's now mission-critical to create a healthier workplace. And so, the notion that wipers and masks will become a bigger piece of the business, it has a positive mix effect, from a margin perspective. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. And thank you so much. Maria Henry : And that business is -- yeah. That business is also benefiting from the geographic mix component that we talked about, so I would call that out. Wendy Nicholson : Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Wendy. Operator : Thank you. Speakers at this time, we have no further questioners in the queue. Paul Alexander : Great. Well we appreciate all the questions. We'll close -- go ahead Mike. Mike Hsu : Okay. Yeah. I just want to thank everybody for dialling in and joining us today. We remain very optimistic about our opportunities to generate long-term growth and create shareholder value. Our K-C 2022 strategies are working. And we see more opportunity for us to elevate and expand our categories. So thank you. Paul Alexander : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines. And thank you for joining us today.",

Please go ahead sir. Paul Alexander : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This morning, you will hear from Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. We have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements this morning. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest quarterly and annual reports for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Lastly, we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales increased 3% with good underlying momentum and benefits from increased demand related to COVID-19. We significantly increased our growth investments and improved our market positions. We had another strong quarter of achieving cost savings and returning cash to shareholders. And finally, while earnings were down as expected, we are increasing our full-year outlook. Now let's look at the details of our results, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.7 billion. That's up 1% from year ago and includes a two-point drag from currency rates. Volumes were up 2% and the combined impact of changes in net selling prices and product mix increased sales by 1%. By segment, organic sales rose 10% in Consumer Tissue and 5% in Personal Care, but declined 15% in K-C Professional. Mike will talk more about our top-line and our market share performance in just a few minutes. Moving on to profitability. Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.2%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 2%. We had excellent cost savings performance in the quarter. Combined savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs totaled $140 million, including continued strong productivity improvements. Commodities were a benefit of $25 million in the quarter driven by pulp and other raw materials. Other manufacturing costs were higher year-on-year that included incremental costs related to COVID-19. Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit by a high single digit rate in the quarter. Moving further down the P&L. Between the lines spending was 18.9% of sales. That's up 180 basis points and driven by a big step up in digital advertising. G&A also increased including capability-building investments and higher incentive compensation expenses. We expect between the lines spending will rise further sequentially in the fourth quarter. Our SG&A spending is typically high in the fourth quarter and this year we'll also have project activities that were temporarily delayed because of COVID-19. All in all, for the fourth quarter \u2013 for the third quarter, sorry, adjusted operating profit was down 6% and operating margin was 17.2%, down 130 basis points versus year ago. By segment, operating margins were up in Consumer Tissue and Healthy and Personal Care. K-C Professional margins were down significantly, including an approximate 600 basis-point drag from fixed costs under absorption. On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 in the quarter, compared to $1.84 in the year-ago period. Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $559 million compared to $886 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was as expected and driven by the timing of tax payments and higher working capital. We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Third quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $560 million. And for the full year, we expect the total will be $2.15 billion. So let me now turn to the full year. The overall headline is that we're raising our top and bottom-line outlook. On the top-line, we now expect organic sales growth of 5% compared to our prior target of 4% to 5%. Through nine months, organic sales are up nearly 6% and we expect a solid fourth quarter. On average, we expect slightly less headwinds from currency rates than previously anticipated. In addition, we'll begin consolidating the Softex Indonesia business into our results on November 1 on a one-month lag. All in all, we expect net sales will grow 2% to 3% this year. That's one point better than our previous estimate. On the bottom-line, our new outlook is for adjusted earnings per share of $7.50 to $7.65. That represents year-on-year growth of 9% to 11%. Our prior outlook was for adjusted EPS of $7.40 to $7.60. The increase in our outlook is driven by improved top line, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense and other manufacturing costs. Overall, I'm encouraged that we're improving our near-term outlook and investing significantly in the business for longer-term growth. I'll now turn it over the Mike. Mike Hsu : Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reinforcing that we remain focused on three near-term priorities that we established since the outbreak of COVID-19. First, we're focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and our consumers. Second, we're proactively managing our supply chain to ensure supply of our essential products. And third, we're prudently managing the business through near-term volatility, while continuing to strengthen the long-term health of Kimberly-Clark. Our 40,000 employees continue to do heroic work in this COVID environment. Our supply chain operations have remained online with strong productivity gains and fewer COVID-related disruptions over the last three months. The environment is still dynamic and we're closely monitoring virus hotspots. And thus far, our supply chain has been resilient and our teams have done a great job overcoming daily challenges. Now turn to our results focusing on organic sales category conditions and our market shares. As Maria mentioned, organic sales increased 3% in the quarter. In North American consumer products, organics sales rose 8%. Now within that Personal Care grew 6% driven by broad-based volume growth in baby and childcare. We improved our market shares on diapers, baby wipes, and in childcare. In late July, we launched Pull-Ups New Leaf training pants which features super-soft natural materials and is our most premium training pants. This is another example of our elevate the core strategy and action. And New Leaf is off to a very good start. In North American consumer tissue, organic sales increased to 11% and that reflects strong demand due to the COVID-19 work from home environment and strong momentum on Kleenex facial tissue. Bathroom tissue shipments benefited from our efforts to restore customer inventory levels. In the fourth quarter, we expect more benefit from those efforts and from people continuing to spend more time at home. Our market share performance in North American consumer products was strong in the third quarter; shares were upper even in six of eight categories. Turning to K-C Professional North America, organic sales declined 15%. Sales were down about 35% in washroom products. And as you'd expect, the category has been significantly impacted. There are fewer people working in offices and lower levels of business activity, including in travel and lodging. Sales were a bit better in September, but we're planning for only a modest near-term improvement in the environment. On the other hand, KCP sales were up double digits in wipers, safety and other products. Our efforts to expand our face mask business by leveraging our superior non-wovens technology is off to a good start. We're also expanding our wipers line-up with Scott 24-Hour, which delivers long-lasting surface protection from bacteria. Moving to D&E markets, organic sales were up 2% that was driven by 7% growth in Personal Care. In terms of key personal care markets, organic sales were up mid-teens in China, mid-single digits in both Latin America and Eastern Europe and strong double-digits in India. Organic sales were down mid-single digits in ASEAN. We also improved our market shares in many countries in the quarter. And that includes Brazil, China, throughout Eastern Europe, India, and Peru. While category conditions remain difficult in many D&E countries, government restrictions on social mobility and store operations have eased somewhat since the last quarter. Finally, in developed markets, organic sales were up 3% driven by strong growth in consumer tissue. Looking ahead, we're launching Kleenex Proactive Care in the UK and other markets in EMEA. This lineup includes hand towels, anti-bacterial hand and face wipes, sanitizing gel, and face masks. Now in terms of market share performance, we continue to make good progress. We're on track to grow or maintain share in approximately 60% of the 80 category/country combinations that we track. This is a result of higher investment levels, innovations, and strong in-market executions. Our capabilities are driving our results and our investments are working hard for us. Through nine months, I'm very encouraged with our performance, how we're navigating this environment and how our teams are taking care of each other and our customers. Before closing, I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition of Softex. This transaction is a strong strategic fit with our focus on accelerating growth in personal care in D&E markets. Softex expands our presence in a high-growth market where we had limited exposure. The diaper market in Indonesia is already the sixth largest in the world, and that's projected to nearly triple in size over the next decade. Our Softex team has built a strong business with deep local market knowledge, excellent brands and market positions and strong profitability. This transaction improves our underlying growth prospects, and we're looking forward to leveraging our combined strengths in innovation, marketing, and go-to-market. In conclusion, we're managing through the COVID environment safely and effectively. We remain optimistic about our opportunities to generate long-term growth and create shareholder value. We're investing in our brands and improving our market positions. We are raising our full-year outlook and are on track to achieve excellent financial results. And we continue to operate our business with a balanced and sustainable approach as we execute K-C strategy 2022. Now that concludes our prepared remarks and now Maria, Paul, and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Hey. So I was hoping we could just dive in a bit on K-C Professional and that operating margin headwind from lower absorption that Maria called out. I know, you don't discuss gross margins at the operating unit level, but was wondering if that's really kind of the core drag on gross margins this quarter on the manufacturing costs. And if that's the case kind of what made it so significant this quarter versus in Q2 right, because the business is already under pressure. And then in that vein, as we look forward, how should we think about manufacturing dynamics of that business? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Okay. Hey, Lauren. Let me start and then ask \u2013 go ahead, Maria. Maria Henry : Go ahead, Mike. Sorry, we are not in the same room, as you can tell. Mike Hsu : Yes, sorry. I'll give you the high level and then Maria can give you a little bit more texture there. But I would say overall Lauren here's the \u2013 overall as the business was down about 15%, I would think \u2013 I think the business actually outperformed what mobility tells us what is the general kind of B-to-B environment, what that looks like. And so we feel good about the pivot that the teams are making to drive safety and wipers and masks. But the washroom business is significantly down. I think for us overall, maybe the big change between Q2 and Q3, a big impact was we knew we had deferred, maybe some of the volume impact in Q1 and Q2, and it may \u2013 it did come to realization in Q3, because I think that the market environment was soft in Q1 and Q2. But as we mentioned on those calls, there were distributors and end-users buying in and make sure that they had the right inventory when businesses were set to go back. And so we experienced some of that at the tail end of Q1, at the beginning of Q2. I think this does represent kind of a current run rate of where the market is. And I think it's better than kind of where the overall market is, but it's a pretty significant hit. And so it's affecting our \u2013 obviously we have high fixed costs, and so it's affecting our fixed absorption and other factors. But Maria, maybe you can give her a little bit more detail here. Maria Henry : Sure. Lauren, I would say your spot on in how you're thinking about it. And while we don't give specifics on gross margin, when I tell you is that we had a nice improvement in Personal Care in the quarter and a very nice improvement in Consumer Tissue as you would expect on the organic sales in that segment being up 10%. The whole story here is around K-C Professional, which the gross margins were down meaningfully primarily driven by these other manufacturing costs. The 600 basis points on fixed cost absorption that I mentioned in my prepared remarks that's a meaningful dollar number and was a big contributor to why \u2013 are there manufacturing costs were up meaningfully in the quarter. So, you're right on with that. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. That's great. And then sticking with that, I know, at our conference and you were brought up again today the \u2013 some of the innovations that you're launching, can you just talk a little bit about how that's progressing if you're adding staff kind of what needs to happen to sort of build up a more material, but even more material business, I guess I would say in safety and wipers and anything in terms of progress, or is it still too early days on, kind of incremental opportunities on the hand towel business and professional towels and transitioning customers away from air dryers? Mike Hsu : Yes. I think we're making very good progress on all those fronts, Lauren. In fact, we have added staff. We did announce that we are making some organizational changes to exactly do what you're saying, which is add more resources to where the growth areas are. And not only we're adding people resources, but we are making capital investments to support the growth and expansion of that business particularly in more advanced non-wovens capacity. So, I think we feel very good about where that is going. Our mask business is off to a very strong start. We just started shipping in Q3. And so we feel good about the trajectory of that business. We're launching, as I mentioned in my remarks, Scott 24-Hour relaunching in a different format. And we think that would be a very good offering for customers and end-users. And so we're excited about that as well. So we are going to be bringing more innovation. We think both in safety masks, wipers that there's a lot more room for more fundamental and innovation. And with our superior non-wovens technology, I think we feel like we can offer differentiated solutions. So we're looking forward to building that business. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. All right. Thanks so much. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great, thanks. Good morning. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Olivia. Olivia Tong : How are you? I wanted to ask you about price mix, which continues to be pretty positive in Q3, but it looks like what's really driving that is a Professional business. So I assume lower away-from-home tissue while hurting you on gross margin is benefiting you a bit on price mix and no more in the industrial wipers and such. So does that price mix benefit reverse when COVID conditions normalized? And then, flipping over to the consumer business, can you talk about the promotional environmental overall like what's your expecting over the next 12 months? And obviously this applies more to Personal Care and Consumer Tissue and kind of compare and contrast what you expect to see from branded versus private label competitors. Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes. Thanks, Olivia. Yes. Overall, I would say, the organic was more driven by volume in the quarter. And so price mix combined overall for us up about a point. And I think that the dynamic that we saw in Q1 and Q2 is persisting. I thought \u2013 I think in Q3, which is that price has been in general, fairly neutral, mostly because in developed markets where there's been high demand. Our promotion intensity for the category and for our brands in particular have come down a bit. And so I think as demand remains elevated, we'll see this. There are some categories that we are seeing perhaps they return to more normalized promotion levels that that happens to be more in Personal Care at this point. And so I think the overall pricing environment, Olivia, I would say is generally constructive, but there are a few selected hotspots. We're seeing elevated promotions in adult care in North America in particular and promotions have increased a bit somewhat, I would say, in the Consumer Tissue business in Europe. Olivia Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And then your U.S. diaper performance is actually quite strong. So just want a little bit more color there in terms of what you're seeing, the state of competition, promotion levels and things like that. Procter did talk on their call earlier this week about I knew mid-tier diaper. So just a level of more color there. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes, Olivia. Our North American diaper team is doing a fantastic job. And I think, when you peel the onion, there's no kind of secret bullet or silver bullet going on there. It's really very strong product offering lineup. And I think they've put very diligent efforts to improve the product offering and bring innovation. This year the big innovation was a new and improved, not going dry our tier 4 product on a shape diaper. That was a significant improvement versus our previous version. But when you take a great product performance with very strong marketing and strong digital investment, we feel like it's working very hard and they're working in great partnership with our customers with great retail plans. And so, we feel very good about it. The business overall was up low-double digits, despite the category being down a couple points overall. And our share was up as you can see in the Nielsen's. I would tell you that all outlet wasn't up as much because we had some promotion timing or promotion events that came out of the quarter versus prior year. But we feel very good about our momentum on that business, and we'll continue to bring strong innovation. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks, I'll pass along. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, guys. So Mike, can you discuss your viewpoint on birth rates in the U.S. and some of the other key geographies around the world as we look out to 2021, how much impact you're expecting from COVID on birth rates and category growth as you look out? Mike Hsu : Yes. Dara, I'll start with North America. I think the last set of data that we had, which generally lags a year, Dara, would say that, the category birth rate was down about 1% which was an improvement over the prior couple of years which were down about two-ish percent. So I think that it was heading the right direction. We're reading the same articles. You may be reading about the category and there's all different kinds of productions including baby boom, because there's less to do and also decline because there's \u2013 the affordability is tougher. And so we're not seeing that yet. And thus far as I mentioned, the category has been off about 2% year-to-date. And so we're watching that very closely. Glad to say our performance has been better than that. And that's, as I just mentioned with Olivia because of the strong share performance and the strong product performance and marketing performance that we have in North America. I think in other markets, I would say it's \u2013 there's a lot of, it's a mixed bag across different markets. Certainly one of the big reasons why we made the acquisition of Softex was to bind to a market that was expanding on the cusp of strong income \u2013 household income growth in the population and strong birth rates and that's Indonesia, several of the markets that have that profile for us. In our bigger developed markets, we have seen somewhat of a slow down now in, for instance, South Korea, I think our team has done a great job rebuilding our share position. And so we've seen significant share gains, but the birth rates in South Korea continue to be a bit soft. So overall, I don't have a great view right now at this point is long-term effects of COVID. I will say the long-term math is our categories have a long runway of growth particularly in D&E markets, which is why we're continuing to invest to build our business there. The overall, Dara, is my theory would be, the categories less than a third developing D&E. And so we're going to continue to emphasizing and building that business. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. That's helpful. And then obviously with the new earnings guidance, you're expecting growth around 10% of your midpoint. That's clearly well above that the mid-single digit longer-term algorithms. So just wondering as we think about 2021, 2022 sort of medium-term earnings going forward, should we think about 2020 is the right EPS base to work off of, is it more 2019 is the right base and look at two and three-year averages versus whatever you might consider a typical algorithm to be, as we look out to 2021 2022. And part of it the reason I\u2019m asking that question is in the past you\u2019ve sort of flexed marketing spending, I think, to get to more of that sustained mid-single digit type of earnings growth rate year to year both on the positive and negative side. So just sort of wondering sort of conceptually coming off this above trend year how you view the medium term earnings growth profile from here? Mike Hsu : Dara I\u2019m going to ask Maria to comment, but I will say one, we\u2019ll provide our 2021 outlook in January. I think a good thought from my perspective would be to look at the combo of 1920 as a trajectory. But for certain for us we\u2019re in the middle of planning. There is a lot of uncertainty in the environment as you can probably well surmised and so we\u2019re still working through the details. You can expect us to cleanly focus on improving our market positions and by making the kind of investments that we\u2019re making this year. And we need to make progress on the value drives like in investing brands, in brands and commercial capability. Cost savings and Canadian drive force is going to be a big feature of our plan and ongoing discipline and capital allocation. Maria any additional thoughts here? Maria Henry : Yes, I think that\u2019s exactly right. And I would not look at 2020 as a baseline year as we benefited from some onetime net positives from the effects on our business from the COVID situation. Next year as we look ahead mathematically that will be a challenging comps, but if you put the two years together on 2020 and 2021, I think, that\u2019s probably a good way to look at it. And we are not coming off kind of K-C 2022 algorithm as this point. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Mike Hsu : Good morning Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Hey good morning. I want to start on the advertising spending in the quarter. Mike mentioned, or excuse me in the press release you indicated it was up significantly year-over-year. And if you just sort of tumble to the numbers, in terms of the benefits behind FORCE savings, and restructuring and commodities, it could be up quite a bit. Can you frame that number for us either year-over-year, or percent of sales, or both? And then I have a follow-up for Maria. Mike Hsu : Yes, overall, I think, our investment between the lines overall, which includes advertising, but also some of our capability build, and, I think incentive, comps affected, I think we said, it's in the remarks, or in our release, which was up about 180 basis points. So that's pretty significant impact in the quarter. We do feel like we have strong business, underlying business momentum across our businesses, both globally in both consumer tissue and in personal care. Pleasant surprise in the quarter was, I think, a very strong improvement versus Q2 in developing emerging markets. So we feel good about that. We feel like the spin is working. And it's something that we feel like is going to yield dividends in quarters to come. Maria, you have any additional thoughts here? Kevin Grundy : I'm sorry? Maria Henry : I think nothing to add. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. And then just quick follow-up. And I hate to belabor this, but the K-C Professional margins, I think, it's important. I just want to make sure I understand it correctly. I think it currently overshadows what was otherwise a pretty strong quarter for the company. Maria what was treated differently about the fixed costs absorption? I guess I say that in the context, volumes were down in the segment 16% 2Q, 21% 3Q. So obviously worse, but margins were up 170 bips in the second quarter down substantially 160 bips in the third quarter. So what specifically changed with regard to how fixed cost absorption was being treated with change in terms of customer mix or otherwise? I just want to make sure I understand it clearly. Thank you. Maria Henry : Yes, I think, what you are seeing is that in the second quarter, we had record levels of performance on the consumer side of the house. And so we had a big fixed cost absorption benefit coming from that. And that was offsetting the fix \u2013 the negative fixed cost absorption that we were experiencing in the K-C Professional business. As that has come down from the second quarter, our total fixed cost absorption for the company was negative in the third quarter driven by the professional business. And it just wasn't up by nearly as much in terms of a benefit on the consumer side of the house as it was in the second quarter. And so what you see in the third quarter on the margins is the impact of the volumes being down meaningfully in the K-C Professional business showing up on the total company P&L. Kevin Grundy : Okay, I'll take it offline with Paul. Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it. Paul Alexander : Great, thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Thanks. Mike Hsu : Hello Steve. Steve Powers : Maria \u2013 hey, good morning everybody. Not to belabor this even more but I just on the professional thread is the out size magnitude to be limited to 3Q? Are you expecting that fixed cost to leverage impact directionally persist into 4Q as well? Maria Henry : The macro trends that are affecting the K-C Professional business are not likely to change from what they were in the third quarter. And as long as those volumes stay down, as people continue to work from home and as mobility is limited, I would expect to continue to have a negative fixed cost absorption impact coming through the P&L. Steve Powers : Okay. Okay, thanks. I think we've got that one pretty well better now. I guess, Maria maybe while I have you talking, I guess, can you just maybe frame for us in a bit more detail how you are sizing up the cost outlook exiting the calendar year and I guess entering your 4Q contracting season? We've seen some upward pressure on inputs, as well as freight. And PNG echoed those sentiments earlier this week. So how would you frame that outlook from where you are currently situated, just looking at over a year end and out of the horizon? Maria Henry : Sure. Well, on the commodity side of house in the quarter, it was in line with our expectations overall. When I think about what's new from the last time we spoke in July, well recycled fiber is still inflationary, it was down from the peaks that we saw in the second quarter. On the other hand, resin-based materials are rising. And if I look at what happened in the quarter, our polymer costs increased double digits versus our expectation coming into the quarter. So we are seeing that oil-based commodities rise. And so that'll certainly be a factor exiting the year.  The other area that you mentioned is on our distribution costs, which are also a bit more inflationary than they were in the first half of the year. And that's due to the tighter capacity in the system. So those are kind of the big trends as I see them. As I look forward, Paul has been favorable, globally, year-on-year and it's been quite stable sequentially. If you look at the forward paths there, the forecasters are calling for it to rise, although they've been calling for that for a while. And so with COVID, I think, that gets pushed out a little bit. What else would I tell you? The other thing I'd call out is in the fourth quarter, overall commodities could be inflationary for us. And I think you see that kind of the outlook that we gave for the year where that $215 million benefit year-to-date, my current point of view on that is that we be at the midpoint of the range for the year, so commodities turning slightly inflationary in the fourth quarter, and as we head into next year. Steve Powers : Perfect, thank you so much. And I guess if I could just squeeze in one more and round and just put that in the context, Mike, of what you were talking about earlier, I don't think you were painting a picture negatively at all. But you did mention some competitive, I think, you used the word hotspots in adult care, tissue in Europe. Again, harking back to PN0 this week, they were talking about elevated promotion that they saw from competition, I presume, from you in pocket diapers. So just, as you have these elevated, competitive, hotspots, I guess, juxtaposed against that more inflationary outlook, is that a concern from where you stand or that's just sort of be aware but overall it's all pretty rational and level-headed? Mike Hsu : Yes, I feel like \u2013 general, I think, I use the term generally constructive and I feel that way. I think there have been some hotspots. Hopefully I don't think they were talking about us because I think our promotion levels have been down and our percent sold on promotion has been down consistently through this year. And frankly, we feel good about driving volume through product innovation and advertising, particularly digital. And so that's kind of the direction we've been moving in, Steven. And I think it's working. I think when I say some hotspots, we are seeing some elevated promotions, actually from Proctor in adult care. And then in a few other categories, I think, that may be more driven by retailer strategies. But I wouldn't say \u2013 again, I think, it's still, I think, constructive. And we feel good about where it is right now. But we're keeping a close eye on it, obviously. Steve Powers : Okay, thank you so much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you. So could you discuss a little bit of the consumption and shipments in particularly in personal care? And also in tissue if you can ensure guidance for the fourth quarter? So I think if we discuss a little bit, also the promotional environment that we elaborate more in the last question, I think, you Steve posed, I think in other larger markets, as I can see from your prepared remarks in China, Australia, South Korea, and I would say, I don't know, in Brazil, it seems the same. But from your comments it seems like the prices went down. And I'm surprised that you needed to do that now, given that volumes are still up. So is that the mixes of trade down, or are you seeing in those countries also some competitive environment, increasing from, I think, what we hear from your competitors as well? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes. Okay. Good morning, Andre. Yes, let me start with the \u2013 maybe the consumption and shipments dynamic. I'll probably speak mostly about North America, as I think that's where kind of the big divergence has occurred through the first three quarters. In personal care, I'd say consumption and shipments have largely caught up. And so in the first quarter, there was a period where demand had kind of exceeded supply a bit on personal care. But I think most of that kind of reversed out during the second quarter. And I think overall our performance has been solid, and shipments have been strong, and kind of reflecting kind of where the consumption has been. I think in consumer tissue we've been working to catch up to demand all year. I think in the first quarter the category is up about 30%. And as you're well aware, and now consumer tissue businesses aren't geared to be able to ramp up at that speed. And so we have been working to restore customer inventory levels, we're making progress. In the third quarter, the category of tissue was up about 9%. That's an overall category number. And you can see on our numbers, we shipped 11. And so we shipped a little bit more than what was consumed with consumers. And that's restoring inventory levels. I think it will take us at least all of Q4 to get our customers back to the inventory positions on tissue that they really want to be at. So that's our point. And then with regard to global pricing, I wouldn't say \u2013 at this point, our plan is the hold pricing kind of where it is. There have been some changes I mentioned earlier in Europe, I think, pricing has come down a point or two and that's more reflecting of retailers wanting to get back to their promotion strategies. Similarly, in China, we are seeing a little bit more promotion activity. Again, that's not our strategy in China. And our strategy is to drive. And we feel like we're doing a very good job growing the business right now through strong product performance and digital advertising. So generally, our strategy has been as we articulated in K-C 2022, great innovation supported by strong executional capability. Promotion is not really the way that we want to earn business going forward. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, Mike. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Andrea. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Paul Alexander : Good morning Jason. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Hope all is well. Congrats on the market show momentum. I know we've kind of come at margins a few different times. But I got to be honest, I'm still really confused here. I'm looking at your margins in K-C P, or tissue, or consolidated at the gross margins. And the volumetric components for the company don't float with a deleverage story from 2Q, to 3Q. It looks like there\u2019s something else going on. But if I look at 1Q to 3Q, it kind of makes sense. So it brings me back to the question of was 2Q just inflated to a degree that's on sustainable in a substantial way. And our issue is less about where 3Q landed. It's more the comparison, the sequential comparison of 2Q. So why the big swing between the two? Is there an accounting thing going on? Where we not absorbing enough cost in the second quarter, and we have to push into the third quarter? Just help me understand the moving pieces, because overall firm volume growth, 1Q, plus nine-ish, plus 1.5 in 2Q, plus 1.5 and 3Q, volume leverage doesn't seem to explain the swing factors we're seeing Q-to-Q. Mike Hsu : Yes, maybe I\u2019ll start \u2013 yes go ahead Maria. Maria Henry : No, go ahead. Mike Hsu : No, I was just saying, I think, just to amplify on Maria's prior response, I think, Jason it does reflect, I would tell you extraordinary performance in our consumer tissue business, under extraordinary circumstances, right. There was extraordinary demand, and we simplified our assortment and drove strong utilization on the consumer tissue side in the second quarter. I think that has probably come back a little bit in the third quarter. And at the same time, we probably didn't fully realize the full fixed cost absorption in K-C P in the second quarter, because we had a little additional volume then. But Maria any additional thoughts here? Maria Henry : Yes, I think that that said, if I look at the drivers of the gross margin in third quarter, we've already commented on the differences by the three segments. But overall, the margin was up on volume mix benefit, continued price realization, strong cost savings still had some modest commodity deflation in the quarter. And the benefits of that were offset by the higher other manufacturing costs and currency headwinds. So that is it, there was no accounting change or any other unusual things going on that would have affected the results. Paul, I don't know if you have any additional color to add. Paul Alexander : Yes, thanks, Maria. The one thing I would add Jason is that if you look at where the volumes were up, in the second quarter, we had very strong performance in North America. And that's where our margins are the highest, both gross and operating. And in the third quarter, the volume growth while still strong in North America, was not nearly as strong as Q2. And we had better performance internationally in developing and emerging markets where our margins are lower. So there was a geographic mesh component sequentially from Q2 to Q3 as well. Jason English : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Mike Hsu : Thanks. Paul Alexander : Okay, thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning. Paul Alexander : Good morning, Wendy. Wendy Nicholson : My question, believe it or not actually has to do with the top line growth in a professional business, not so much the margins. Can you give us a sense, I mean, I was actually a little bit surprised, I know, you said it came in line with your expectations? But I was surprised that there was as much of a sequential deceleration on the organic volume side as there was. So can you talk about maybe what you're seeing? I know, it's only whatever, three weeks into the new quarter, but what are you expecting in that business in the fourth quarter? And kind of \u2013 obviously, we get into incredibly easy comps, by the time we get to the June quarter. But when do you think that business starts to pick up? Mike Hsu : Yes, Wendy, I do think overall, I think, the businesses are performing well, at least our data would suggest is kind of the B2B kind of activity, or general business environment for offices, and industrial, and travel and lodging, et cetera. And you're probably well aware of kind of where those are. But, generally the data that we say mobility data would tell us, those are generally up between 30% and 50%. Our business is down 15%, does reflect we're down 35% in the washroom business in North America. But overall, we were down 15% in North America, and that's because our wipers, and our safety business has really started to grow at double digit rates. And so I think we are pivoting to where the growth is right now, I think, the washroom business is where it's going to be at for a while. I mean, you can look at the projections for what the COVID inflection rates are going to do. There is going to \u2013 appears to be an acceleration in Q4, before it starts to come down sometime in Q1. And I do expect people to remain working from home for the next \u2013 for the foreseeable period into next year. And so I think, again, overall, I think, our professional business is outperforming what the environment says, but it is a pretty significant decline. And we're managing through it. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. And I guess, second question, just as we sort of think about capital allocation, the acquisition sounds like it's a great fit and all that good stuff. But your CapEx has been running high both last year and this year, higher than we've seen for a while? Where do you expect that to be next year, just directionally? That would be great. Maria Henry : Sure. On CapEx, it is higher than it previously had been driven by our global restructuring program. When we launched that program, we said that we would have $600 million to $700 million of incremental capital that we would be spending as we execute that program. And so that's what's driving the elevated CapEx. When I look at the number for the year, the range is 1.2 to 1.3. I believe we will come in there. I would comment that we have had some programs that were scheduled for this year, moving to next year, as there were COVID-related delays as people couldn't travel, people couldn't get into our manufacturing facilities for safety reasons. And we needed to keep our operations focused on producing products, given the elevated level of demand. Some of the 2020 projects have been pushed into 2021. And then we added some very attractive projects this year, that were enabled by COVID-related opportunities, particularly around PPE. So we're not giving a number yet for next year. But I would call out that we know that some of the programs that we're expecting to do this year are pushed into next year. We're in the midst of our planning process, as Mike mentioned. So we'll be evaluating the opportunities on CapEx both for growth capital and productivity capital. And as always, we'll be disciplined on that. But we also won't be shy about investing in our business if we have high return opportunities. But we'll have more to say in January. Wendy Nicholson : Fair enough. And then Mike, I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up on one of the comments you made. You said that the retail [indiscernible] we are getting a little bit more aggressive when it comes to some promotional activity. Can you just clarify do you mean that they are promoting national brands, or are they promoting more of their own private label? Mike Hsu : Well, I think I meant in that comment reflected national brands, overall, Wendy, if you look at the private label shares, I think, they are up in one of our categories and flatter down in seven. Right? Wendy Nicholson : Yes. Mike Hsu : And so generally, I would say there has been a flight to quality, at least in North America, and generally in developed markets, I think, given the tough economic times. But, I think, we find typically, in times of uncertainty, that consumers look to the big brands for reliability. And so, I think, we're seeing that reflected in some of the numbers. Yes, the pricing environment, I think, it's no more than the typical, I would say, skirmishing that happens across channels and across retailers with price points. Some of that has been off less so this year overall, because of extreme focus on supply, and the reduction in promotions overall, but especially in tissue, I think, it's been lower levels. But I think with personal care, back kind of in in-stock positions across the industry, I'd say there has been more of a return to more normalized levels of promotion. And so it's no more than that. Wendy Nicholson : Fair enough. Thank you so much. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Wendy. Operator : Speakers, at this time, we have no other questions in the queue. Mike Hsu : Okay, well, thank you very much, everyone. I'm encouraged by our ability to manage through challenging additions and deliver healthy business results. And so we thank you for attending our conference call this morning. Paul Alexander : Thank you very much. Maria Henry : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines and thank you for joining us this morning.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning\u2019s remarks, we will be opening the floor for questions. And at that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Paul Alexander : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark's year-end earnings conference call. This morning, you will hear from Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. We sincerely hope everyone is continuing to stay healthy and safe and in keeping with our social distancing procedures, this morning, Mike, Maria and I are each in different locations in our Dallas office. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Finally, we will be referring to adjusted results and outlook, both excludes certain items described in this morning's news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Maria. Maria Henry : Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call this morning. Let me start with the headlines for the full year results. We delivered strong top and bottom line growth and exceeded our previous outlook. We significantly increased our brand and capability investments and improve our market shares. We generated excellent cost savings and cash flow and we returned significant cash to shareholders. Now let's cover the details of our results starting with sales. Full-year net sales were $19.1 billion, that's up 4% year-on-year and included a 2 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales grew 6% with healthy underlying performance and increased demands related to COVID-19. Volumes were up 4% and net selling prices and product mix, each increased 1%. Mike is going to provide more color on our topline and market share performance in just a few minutes. Moving on to profitability, full-year adjusted gross margin was 37.1%, up 210 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 10%. We generated $575 million of cost savings from our FORCE and restructuring program, that was well above our initial target and slightly better than we expected in October. For 2021, we're targeting $400 million to $460 million in total cost savings. Commodities were favorable by $175 million in 2020, although they turned inflationary in the fourth quarter. We're planning for commodity inflation of $450 million to $600 million in 2021. Costs are projected to increase broadly in most areas, including pulp and recycled fiber, resins, superabsorbent and distribution expenses. Other manufacturing costs were higher in 2020, including costs related to COVID-19. Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit at a high single-digit rate. Moving further down the P&L, between the line spending was up 110 basis points as a percent of sales. That was driven by advertising which was up 90 basis points. SG&A spending also increased and included higher incentive compensation along with capability building investments. Adjusted operating margin was 18.7%, up 90 basis points and adjusted operating profit grew 9%. In terms of company profitability for 2021, the midpoint of our planning assumptions implies a 70 basis point decline in adjusted operating margins. And while there are a number of moving pieces, it's likely that adjusted gross margin will be down somewhat more than that. Turning back to 2020 results, full-year adjusted earnings per share were $7.74, up 12%. Our October guidance was for earnings of $7.50 to $7.65. In addition to the strong growth in adjusted operating profit, the bottom line benefited from higher equity income, a lower share count, and a slight decline in adjusted effective tax rate. Now let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency [ph]. Cash provided by operations was an all-time record $3.7 billion, up $1 billion year-on-year reflecting outstanding working capital performance and strong earnings. Cash flow is expected to be down year-on-year in 2021 driven by higher cash taxes and working capital. Nonetheless, cash flow should remain strong and well above 2019's level. Capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020, in line with plan and the prior year. We plan to spend between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2021, including activity for our restructuring program and a pickup in growth projects. Based on an initial outlook at longer-term opportunities, we believe spending will be elevated again in 2022. On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.15 billion. That's the 10th consecutive year, we've returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. We expect to return a similar level of cash to shareholders in 2021. And as mentioned in the earnings release, our Board has already approved our 49th consecutive annual dividend increase and authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program. Let me finish with a short update on our restructuring program. We continue to make significant progress as we head into the last year of this program. We're about 85% to 90% through the total pretax charges, which we've increased somewhat to reflect delays as a result of COVID-19 and costs for additional savings opportunities. So far, we've generated $420 million of savings and expect to achieve between $540 million and $560 million of savings by the end of 2021. Our original savings estimate was $500 million to $550 million. Finally, at this point, cash payments are about 75% to 80% complete. Overall, it was an excellent year financially, while we invested more in the business for the long term and navigated the COVID-19 environment. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Hsu : Thank you, Maria, good morning everyone. Okay, let me begin by saying that I'm very proud of our K-C team and our accomplishments in 2020. We worked tirelessly to protect the health and safety of each other by setting and maintaining strict safety protocols, all of which are in place today. We kept our global supply chain running and safely served the needs of our consumers and customers and in many cases delivering record output. At the same time, we delivered healthy topline growth across our portfolio, gained market share, invested the strength and long-term brand fundamentals and delivered strong financial results. Looking more closely at our business segments, we saw excellent performance in personal care, with 5% organic sales growth and strong share performance. In North America, organic sales rose 6% driven by broad-based growth in baby and child care. Our market shares were up nicely on both Huggies diapers and Goodnites Youth Pants. In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were also up 6% despite volatile market conditions. More specifically, personal care organic sales were up double digits in China, India and South Africa, up high single-digits in Europe and up low single digits in Latin America. We also improved our share positions in many D&E markets. Looking at our other segments, organic sales were up 13% in consumer tissue and down 7% in K-C Professional. As expected, both businesses experienced the effect of COVID-19 and the shift to more consumers working from home. We're pleased with how our K-C team managed through that volatility. To meet elevated demand in consumer tissue, we significantly reduced our SKU count and leveraged our global supply network to increase production, including support from KCP. We continue to focus on category expanding and brand-building programs, while improving our market execution. Those actions helped us gain market share for Kleenex facial tissue in North America and Europe. In KCP, where the washroom category continues to be a significant part of our business, we made good progress pivoting the growth opportunities in other parts of the business, including in wipers and safety products. Sales of those products were up double-digits in North America. Importantly, we grew or maintained market share in approximately 60% of the 80 key cohorts that we track. I'm pleased to see our brands winning in the marketplace. Overall, our results were strong and I'm encouraged by the way we executed in 2020. Next, I'll turn to our outlook for 2021. We expect a more challenging environment, especially compared to last year. More specifically, we expect some of the net benefit from COVID dynamics, including higher consumer demand to reverse. In addition, commodity costs are rising globally and were also reflecting our latest view on economic conditions and birthrate trends. Despite these factors, we're confident in our ability to deliver topline growth and expect to strengthen our market positions and improve our company for long-term value creation. Our plans call for total sales growth of 4% to 6% in 2021 and that includes 2 points from the Softex acquisition, and a 1-to-2-point benefit from currencies. We expect to grow organic sales 1% or 2%. We plan to leverage and scale our brand building capabilities and investments that we've made over the past two years. We have a healthy innovation pipeline including near-term launches for Huggies in North America, China, Eastern Europe and Latin America and we've also upgraded products for our global Kotex brand in several markets. We expect to benefit from selective pricing actions and other revenue management programs, but we're not currently planning for broad-based list price increases. And we will continue to make capability and technology investments to drive long-term success. On advertising, spending should be similar to 2020 levels and this reflects the increases we made over the last two years and confidence in the strong ROIs from digital. We believe this level investment is sufficient to support our growth plans in the current environment. On the bottom line we're targeting adjusted earnings per share of $7.75 to $8. That's evened up 3% year-on-year. We're focused on delivering our annual plan, while managing the quarter-to-quarter volatility that could be higher than normal in this environment. Finally, because of the different COVID dynamics in 2020 and 2021, we think it is relevant to consider our performance over both years. So on that basis, using the midpoint of our 2021 outlook we're projecting to grow organic sales approximately 4% and the increased adjusted earnings per share of 7% on average over that two-year period. Those growth rates are slightly above our medium term objectives. In conclusion, we're on track with K-C Strategy 2022 and we're managing effectively through a very challenging environment. We're improving our topline and strengthening our brands, our market positions and our company for the long-term. We continue to be optimistic about our opportunities to deliver balanced and sustainable growth and create shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks and so now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Michael Hsu : Lauren Lieberman : Thank you, hi. I guess the first thing is the area that I'm hearing I guess more concerned about in the outlook for next year is on sales and organic, and it's also the 1 to 2 is kind of above what we were thinking was likely. And I just was curious to kind of may be understand a little bit about how market growth is playing into that outlook, how mix and you said no pricing, but perhaps mix is a bigger part of it than may be is externally appreciated. And then also you've got the big lapse in consumer tissue, so I would be curious a little bit more on that build to organic sales being up in 2021 with the backdrop of the tougher birthrate environment? Michael Hsu : Yes Lauren, the 2020 outlook definitely reflects our confidence in our ability to sustain healthy brand performance, but we do expect to have a net drag due to the COVID overlap or the COVID affected demand overlapped from 2020. So and that 1 to 2 organic it's in the lower half of our range, but it does reflect health underlying performance in both personal care and consumer tissue, personal care being up as I mentioned about 5% organic in the fourth quarter. And then we believe towards the second half and improvement in K-C Professional. The drag from consumer tissue, the way we're looking at that business and we're tracking, we think there is a pretty good correlation with mobility data. We do expect the current environment in developed markets to look similar to what it is right now through the first half and then for people to gradually begin returning to work in the second half, and so that's what we factored in. We know there will be a cycle and in our plans right now certainly a part of it will be, there will be -- will be lapping some big stock of activity that occurred toward the end of the first quarter of last year and throughout the second quarter of last year. We know we'll be cycling that, but we do still expect at home consumption to be somewhat more elevated certainly than 2019 and down from 2020, but still certainly little more elevated. And then we feel like we have strong momentum in our personal care business globally. And as you go across markets we saw robust growth and share growth against most of our personal care businesses across markets. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. And what are you assuming for that birthrate, I know there is Brookings Institute study that talks about the birthrate being down an estimated 8% in 2021 in North America. Is that sort of what's folding into your outlook you know or is it something less severe than that? Michael Hsu : Yes, we have in our outlook in North America a birthrate decline, not as severe as that I would say, but in that mid-single-digit range. However, I do think the more recent category they would suggest that the caddy was running a little ahead of that and so we've seen that data. Our team especially in North America is working closely with that. I will see the category or sales were up about -- for the category about 3% in the quarter. And so for the past several quarters I think the North America category has been trending ahead of that. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then just the last thing on consumer tissue is about promotional activity, and so it was really just in the fourth quarter you had this very strong pricing number you specifically talked about the lack of promotion in those numbers, but I was just curious on, given the forecasted pulp inflation, given what you've talked about in terms of inflation that's in your outlook and then you said no pricing assumed, but how do we think about promotion may be coming back into the marketplace in 2021, is that 2 or 3 is that also contemplated in the organic sales outlook? Michael Hsu : Yes in North American\u2026 Maria Henry : Yes\u2026 Michael Hsu : Oh go ahead Maria. Maria Henry : No, no, please go ahead, Mike. Michael Hsu : Okay, sorry, we're in different rooms and so we have better job of playing the traffic cop, but I'll just start here and Maria can also add some thoughts. But, definitely the promotion activity in the fourth quarter was down as it was most of the year for us in North America. We're expecting what -- where demand is and we're still catching up to supplying our customers. That promotion intensity will still be down in the first quarter at least and probably the first half. We expect it to return to more normalized levels in the back half, but again our plans are for lower promotional activity in the first half. Certainly, given where commodities are, we expect to make the moves that we need to make to make sure that we can continue to drive our margins and so certainly additional cost savings and additional activities in RGM selective price increases will be on the plate for us. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, all right, great. Thank you so much. Michael Hsu : Maria? Maria Henry : Yes, the only thing I would add there Lauren is that in the fourth quarter, the North America consumer tissue pricing was a bit elevated, because we evaluate our trade programs on a full year basis, and as we close out the year, there was a bit of incremental benefit in that number. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Maria Henry : Those timings also sort of reflects in their backward place and timing. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, all right. Thank you, so much, that's helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with a Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Hi thanks, good morning. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about more about the components of your 2021 organic sales outlook, whether volume versus price mix or by product segment or geography. First, like similar to 2020, are you expecting fiscal 2021 to show segment growth in two or three segments, while one clearly lags? And then just a little bit more color on the North American consumer tissue pricing, I know you said that there was a little bit of timing. So, is it just a function of sort of like marking to market essentially at the end of the year and Q4 will obviously set up for a more dramatic comp next year, or is there something else in that? And then I have a follow up on my pricing, thanks. Michael Hsu : Yes, Olivia maybe I'll start there. Just overall on the consumer tissue, again I think there certainly will be a lap in the first half in developed markets like North America. We saw significant elevated demand through the -- by March of last year, and that ran through all the second quarter. There was two components to that, one is just people being at home more, and therefore driving elevated consumption, and then the other part was, as you read about in the papers, the high stock up levels, and people carrying a lot more inventory home. We do think just that we're going to have to cycle some of that extreme stock up behavior, but we do think consumption levels at home will remain elevated, at least for the first half and then, tailored -- feathered down in the back half of the year. So that was part one, I forgot what your other part was of your question. Olivia Tong : Yes, I think it was around North America, again. Right. Maria Henry : Yes, sure. So, we manage the trade programs on a full year basis and we make ongoing assessments throughout the year to keep those estimates updated. Given the unusual year that we had this year in consumer tissue and the way that demand and supply have played out, customer specific plans and events have changed more dynamically than they have in previous years and that made it even harder to forecast. So as we closed out the year, and really squared those balances, we had a bit of an incremental benefit in the fourth quarter. And so if you think about that, it's really timing related to the -- versus the previous quarters of the year. So that was part of it. It's important to emphasize though also in the fourth quarter with the dynamics we did indeed have lower promotional activity. Olivia Tong : Right, okay, thanks. And then, I know you said that you weren't embedded in the 2021 outlook is no pricing, but now pulp prices are obviously up a lot, but they're still below prior peak, so can you just, like is it possible to take price increases if pulp continues to inflate [ph] or does it have to reach the prior peak in order to even consider that? Michael Hsu : Olivia, I think we said, we didn't say no pricing. We said no kind of broad based list price increases, but we have plenty of select pricing actions across our businesses in multiple markets and so we will be making price moves. Whether that -- we have some plans around count. We have some selective list price actions in some markets, and then certainly with revenue growth management, how we manage our trade funding and how we get more efficient in our trade funding, we will be making some moves there. So, I think there's no absolute rules in terms of what you're cycling in terms of the commodity and everything else, but our goal is to drive margin expansion. It's called our KC 2022 [ph] strategy and we're confident in our ability to deliver long term. I think, given kind of the heavy puts and takes driven by the current environment, it's reasonable to expect some choppiness from quarter-to-quarter, whereas in the case of this year even year-to-year, but long term our intent is to drive margin expansion and cost management and pricing management is a core aspect of that. Olivia Tong : All right, thank you. Michael Hsu : Hey thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys. Michael Hsu : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So just two questions. First, I just wanted to follow up on pricing. Your commentary was helpful, but you are looking at significant commodity costs increases as you outlined for 2021. So maybe just talk a little more conceptually about your approach to pricing. Are you a little more hesitant to be aggressive in terms of pushing it given you're coming off a couple years of gross margin expansion? Is there may be more pricing later in the year? Just sort of how you think about pricing across your portfolio in light of what does look like it will be pretty significant commodity pressure? And then secondly, we did see some slowdown in this in the US in December, January, is that more temporary factors where there will be supply constraints or consumer de-loading? Is that expected to be more of a temporary phenomenon or how are you thinking about trends over the next couple of months given what we've seen in the recent U.S. [indiscernible]. Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yes, okay. Maybe Dara I'll start the last part first which is, I think yes we did see a run up in December from consumption, particularly on tissue. It has softened a little bit and so we saw that throughout last year. And so, it's moving around quite a bit from month-to-month and actually week-to-week, if you look at the details. So that's something we expect, but we do think that the fundamental dynamic is, there are more people at home at this time than they were last year, that will continue through a big chunk of 2021. And then at some point, when hopefully when the populations in markets get vaccinated and people will be returning to work and we'll see a decline in some at home tissue consumption at that point. But for our purposes I think we've got that in the call and we've gone through a thorough forecast of that. With regard to the pricing, again we do expect some significant cost inflation in the year. It's in our plans and that's going to affect both the consumer tissue side and the personal care side. We're going to take appropriate actions and certainly that's going to -- we're going to pull all the levers and I've mentioned already, certainly around cost management. But in addition to that, it's one of the reasons why we're very pleased that we've got a robust revenue growth management capability up and running globally across our regions and the levers that we are working. I mentioned Olivia will be selective count changes. Some selective price list price increases, and then a lot of work around trade efficiency and managing promotions. On the promotion front I would say the pricing environment, we expect that to remain constructive for the dynamics I just mentioned, but Olivia which is I think demand will continue to be a little bit elevated with supply under pressure in developed markets, especially in North America. And so we feel good about the progress we've made on our [indiscernible] strategy and I'm really not interested long-term on kind of renting share through promotion activity. And so we're going to work hard to continue to drive a strong base, a robust based business. Dara Mohsenian : Great, thanks. Michael Hsu : Thanks, Dara. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great, thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations on a strong year, particularly in the current environment. Maria, first question for you just on commodities, because naturally it is a big, big focus for the company. Can you maybe just spend a little bit of time on some of the key assumptions by your key commodity exposure that's embedded in your 2021 outlook? And then I believe it's fairly common not to enter into any notable hedging, maybe just confirm that if you do have any hedging in place and then I have a follow up next. Maria Henry : Sure. I'll start with the hedging questions. We broadly don't use hedging. We do take advantage of our contract negotiations to try to put some parameters around the highs and lows that we will experience on certain commodities, but no formal hedging. In terms of the 2021 outlook, is a reminder if commodity costs in general were at low levels in 2020, particularly in the first half of the year, and costs for many inputs, excluding pulp started to move higher sequentially over the last couple of months and exited the year already meaningfully above 2023 or average. So many of those are expected to move higher again in the early part of 2021. If you look back three months ago, we were expecting some inflation in 2021 and the forward outlook has moved higher, just in the last 60 days. The top two inflation drivers for this year are expected to be pulp and polymer based materials. Together those two input costs represent more than half of the inflation outlook. So if I tick through a few things, virgin pulp, we're expecting inflation, and that follows a year and a half of very low pricing. So in virgin pulp we're looking for it to be up high single digits on average. Polymer resins we're expecting to be up significantly, 30% or maybe even higher in North America, non-wovens and superabsorbent will follow that but to a lesser degree. Those dynamics are largely supply driven at this point. Recycled fiber, we're expecting to be up mid teens. Distribution costs we're expecting to remain inflationary and that's mostly due to industry supply constraints and other material such as third party purchased safety gloves and PPE and KCP are facing significant increases if you look at what's happening in those markets. So that's the assumption for 2021. Kevin Grundy : That's very helpful Maria, thank you. Mike, I'm going to apologize ahead. I'm going to ask on pricing maybe a little bit differently, not to beat the dead horse here, but just on the heels of what Maria just communicated, and the fact that the commodity increases like roughly 300 basis point unfavorable impact, understanding you're coming off of a strong gross margin year, also understand you said, at this point you're not planning on broad based list price increases. What do you think that either you or retailers want to see? I know sometimes there's you know retailers want to see certain permanence if you will, to price increases, they don't want to whip prices around, frankly nor do you as the brand owner. But, given the fact that you're looking at 300 basis point headwind close to it and then you sort of tumble through the numbers for what you guys outlined for FORCE savings and restructuring, and there's not a big offset, not a tremendous offset outside of those two favorable numbers at least we're kind of doing the math right in terms of what you're getting around revenue growth management, et cetera. So it kind of begs the question, why not, with respect to pricing behind a strong brand portfolio. So, hopefully I asked that a little bit differently, just would be great to get your response and I'll pass it on. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Yes, I mean, Kevin. Yes Kevin, I think we're still working through kind of the mechanics of how we will drive the realization. I will say the pricing calls have come in more recently and so they've changed over the last several months. And so we are working through that and, but certainly we recognize the goal is that we've got to drive margin expansion and we need to recover some of the input cost increases. And so for us pulling our lever across both the commercial side and our cost side, whether that's supply chain costs, or being a little bit more aggressive on taking the right pricing actions for us is going be important for this year, and so we are going to make those moves as we kind of work through the plan. Kevin Grundy : That's helpful. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Good luck. Michael Hsu : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers, with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey, great. Thanks, good morning. Michael Hsu : Good morning, Steve. Steve Powers : Hey, so I have a question also on guidance, but more on the drivers as it relates to operating income. So if I take the midpoint of your sales guidance and apply it to 2020's operating income base, grow it say 5%, subtract out the midpoint of your inflation outlook, add back expected savings also round about the midpoint, I essentially tie out your 2% OI growth guide. So first, just want to kind of validate if that's a fair way to think about it, and if it is, I guess I'm a little surprised at its simplicity, and so I'm guessing that there are some moving parts around those variables. If you could maybe call out some of those moving parts and think about how you're thinking about them and why they sort of cancel each other out? It looks like you get a little bit of net leverage on the constant dollar based marketing spend, but I'm just struggling to find out some of the nuance around the OI guide. Maria Henry : Sure, I'll go ahead and take that one. If you are thinking about it the right way, Steve, if I look at our 2021 outlook, we're expecting a solid benefit from top line growth. On the organic side of that we're expecting positive volume mixed end price. And then in addition to that, as Mike mentioned, we've got the benefits from Softex and currencies will be -- are expected to be a benefit on the top line. In addition to the benefits from sales, we are expecting good cost savings in this year and going the other way, we've got commodity inflation, which we talked about. And we're also continuing to invest in the business and experience kind of general non-commodity inflation. And, it is pretty straightforward as you've done the math, that kind of gets you to our guide on operating profit. And then below that, we would expect a lower share count. Non-operating expense will be lower. Equity income will be about similar, maybe up slightly and that will be offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate. And that's how you pick up the additional point on the top end of the EPS growth. So I think in terms of some of the nuances on advertising spend, we've given you the numbers for 2020. We would expect that to be roughly similar on a dollar basis in 2021. And we think that's appropriate for the environment that we're in and it follows two years of meaningful increases in our advertising investment. We would expect to continue to invest in capability building and technology on the between the lines side of the house. And I think those are -- I already went through the commodity assumptions, and we've talked about our pricing assumption as it relates to that. Steve Powers : Yes, okay, that's, that's helpful. It's confirming. I guess just a little bit, I guess, versus my own coming in expectations is a little bit less, net capabilities investment that's envisioned, based on the rough math? And I guess, is that just because, maybe Mike, is this just because you've been able to fast track more of those investments the prior two years, especially in 2020 and now you're a little bit ahead of the curve or is this sort of more in line with the relative reinvestment that you'd always anticipated coming into 2022? Michael Hsu : Yes, maybe. Yes, there's definitely a couple things, one we feel great about the investments we've made. We put in as you probably can do the math, a pretty significant investment over the last couple of years. And we feel like, that's working really hard and it's driving broad based growth across most of our markets at this point and so we feel great about that. I did say in my remarks that advertising will be -- I think 2021 levels will be similar to 2020 levels, I think we feel like that is sufficient for the growth that's in our plans for this year. But, in the near term, we want that to get more efficient, especially given everything that everybody's asked about with regard to commodities. So we're expecting productivity in terms of how we spend our advertising and how we make that more efficient and how we spend our trade, and how we make that more efficient, as well as throughout all the supply chain. So that's one part we feel like it's efficient for our growth plans for this year. That said, I will tell you that, we do have additional plans, and we are going to invest in other capability areas this year as well, right. And certainly, as we continue to drive our digital marketing programs, that's an area that we've continued to invest in in terms of capability. We'll be investing more in our cost management capability. We brought in a new supply chain leader from the outside who sees some good opportunities for us. And we will be investing to take the organization and bring the tools. And so we can systematically drive better planning and better capability across the organization across markets and deliver. We see productivity as a key enabler to our long-term strategy and to fuel the investment that we need. So, and then the last part, I would say, Steve, is, I do think that over time, I would like the investment levels to be higher for the company. And we'll continue to do that as we continue to build our plans and gain confidence in our ability to do that. Steve Powers : Great. And if I could squeeze one more in a different line of questioning, D&E markets, I'm just curious as to your assumptions around just overall volume growth in those markets, the outlook there, just in light of the economic backdrop, birthrates in those markets, et cetera? And relatedly any commentary on how you're thinking about pricing in those markets just given that I think you'd expect a little bit less dollar based inflation given where FX is? Thanks so much. Michael Hsu : Yes, Steve, I mean, overall, our business is fundamentally strengthening globally, but I would say, especially in D&E and we feel like we're building a better company. That improvement is really driven by better execution and the investments that we just talked about in innovation, advertising, and our commercial capability. So the improvement is really broad based. And I just think about D&E, I think growth in the fourth quarter was across every region. So we saw double-digit increases in China, Argentina, India. India, which is an important long-term growth market for us. Africa, which I may have mentioned for the first time on a call here, and then we had high single digit growth in Eastern Europe and Brazil. So we feel good about the performance our markets, I think the one area on in terms of 2021, that, we're going to continue to expect uncertainty due to COVID, particularly in D&E markets. And the reason I say that, that uncertainty is likely to be higher this year than it was last year, because infections are climbing and at a higher rate than they were last year. And so we are going to see new ways. We're expecting additional ways to hit Latin -- to occur in Latin America soon. And I think we're actually starting to see that now. And so that's going to have an ongoing effect. That is just hard to quantify. Our experience last year was an economy would maybe go on restriction on the mobility with the client for a period and then bounce back and then we saw that in Brazil.  So, for example, I think in the third quarter, the economy was locked down for quite a bit of time and then the fourth quarter, we had a high single digit organic growth increase in Brazil -- share growth in Brazil, and a very strong fourth quarter performance. And so our experience would tell us, we're going to expect and see some bumps along the way in D&E, but we are planning for overall growth. Steve Powers : Okay, very helpful. Thank you so much. Michael Hsu : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Hsu : Good morning, Nik. Nik Modi : Hi good morning. Mike, I just wanted to probe on online if I could, just a few thoughts, one, just give us general perspective on how you guys are progressing there? Two, is there any way you can measure incrementality of your online business in terms of, how many new consumers you're actually bringing into the portfolio, versus just share migration from other channels? And then three, just wanted to get your assessment on private label and how it's performing online? Because my understanding is that it's actually doing quite well relative to brick-and-mortar, but I just wanted to get your views on that. Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yes, overall online and maybe I'll start with the e-commerce side, Nik. Going very well, for us, overall the company grew over -- well over 30%, for the full year. Heartening to know that our biggest e-commerce business was by far our fastest growing business and grew well north of that. And so, we feel really good about that and certainly you can recognize, and then in North America, what's happening with all the retailers going to omni-channel, it's driving that grocery pickup and everything else. The incrementality question, we're still working through the math of trying to track that, the data is evolving, because, at this point, it's still tough for us to separate out, we do track online enabled. But when you get into things like grocery pickup, it can be a little bit difficult to parse. And so, I don't have a great answer for you right now, but that's something we're working on. But we do feel that we are gaining share on the online channels, and growing well, and that's globally and so we're really excited about our capability there. I think underneath it is our focus on data and our data analytics capabilities in our primary ecommerce markets, really in these categories is very effective and our customers like that and they want to leverage that to be able to market to their constituents and their consumers and shoppers more effectively. Sorry, I think I missed one part of your question Nik? Nik Modi : Just the private label share dynamic online versus what we see in brick-and-mortar? Michael Hsu : Yes, I don't have the specifics off the top of my head. I do, I will say, generally, certainly across all channels, we saw private label shares down in general across the marketplace. But I'll have to get back to you on the online component. Nik Modi : Great. Thanks, Mike. Best of luck this year. Michael Hsu : Okay, thank you, Nik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Michael Hsu : Good morning Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : Well, hello good morning. So, could you help us clarify the cadence of the first quarter? If I understand correctly, your Guide for 2021 is more back loaded into the second half because you're lagging this 8% growth in volume in the first quarter? And if my math is correct, you have a two-year stack in the last quarter that just closed of about 1% volume growth. So how can we bridge into the first quarter? I understand that you have used the comps for January and February and tougher just for March? So is that because you're building in those market share gains that you were talked about? And can you give us an idea of the volume share in dollar share in customer tissue in the U.S. and globally and how you stack most recently? And in a follow-up question earlier about the pantry stocking, your response seems to indicate that you expect consumption to improve for January and February, at least to what we have seen in the U.S. kind of data. And it seems like you really should be seeing some destocking happening early January, but you expect that to normalize into the rest of the quarter. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Okay, maybe Maria, do you want to talk about the phasing? And then I'll come back and talk about the stocking. Maria Henry : Yes, that sounds good. As, you know, we don't provide specific quarterly guidance and current volatility in this macro environment, is certainly making forecasting a bit more challenging. What I would say though is, the pace of our earnings in 2020 was unusual and we're going to have to face that lap as we go through this year. If you look at how 2020 played out, we had that very strong run on tissue at the end of March, which enabled us to deliver a record level of sales in Q1 followed by record profit delivery in the second quarter. So, you know that the first half has very challenging year-over-year comps for us just by the math. We do expect sequential benefit from things like growth and revenue management initiatives that we talked about. Our cost savings programs should build as the year progresses and you put all of that together, and you'll kind of get a picture of how the quarters in the first half, second half might play out. But I'll turn it back to Mike to talk a little bit more about the specific dynamics on the top line. Michael Hsu : Yes, Andrea, maybe I'll talk more to consumer tissue in North America. But, as we think about cycling, the demand from last year, I think there's one component which is, in general right now, I think we're still living in a world with elevated at home tissue demand with more people at home translates to more usage of particular bath tissue at home. Obviously, there's elevated consumption of towels as well, because people are cleaning more often. So that's one overall effect. Specific to last year though, starting with, I think it was the second or third week of March, we started to see extreme elevated levels of consumption, with consumers stocking up and that's when you recall, all the shelves were empty. I think the third week of March last year the scanner data would say the category was up 212%. So that's one lap I think we will not see that as much this year. And that's certainly a piece that we're going to have to cycle. And we saw that behavior starting in March and it remained through a big piece of the second quarter. So I think the consumer stock up effect will come out over time, but I think for the first half at least, we'll continue to see elevated at home usage. Andrea Teixeira : That's helpful. On the market share, can you help us like bridge as I know you mentioned that your market share is up which makes a lot of sense. So when \u2013 if you give us the cadence when your share really got better, so that's why you're probably building into that as well from a volume and value perspective? Michael Hsu : Yes, Andrea. And then when the share question you're talking about North America tissue or more broadly? Andrea Teixeira : Well, if you can open up both that will be super useful. Michael Hsu : Yes, overall, I would say in North America tissue our shares I would say, our shares are kind of even with year ago and we're even down a little bit in our back tissue, primarily driven by supply constraints and so the demand is there. We're shipping everything we can make and trying to fill up both consumer and customer demand there. But we're actually down a little bit on share. But, I think the category had unprecedented 20% growth over the year last year in North American, so we really kind of moved mountains to serve the demand. I think, overall our shares were very strong for the year, as I mentioned in the remarks, we were up or even in about 60% of our markets globally or key cohorts globally. And I think we saw progression through the year and really strengthening in the second half of the year. And that's really factored in our thinking and is why we believe, particularly in our personal care business globally, which has been less affected by COVID. And if anything, I think the categories have been more -- faced more headwind due to COVID and then tailwinds globally. But the, for the year personal care was up 5%. We did see acceleration in the back half and very comprehensive growth across markets. If I, I'll just tell you, Andrea the shared growth was very broad based. We saw very strong performance in China in both [indiscernible] and diapers, Brazil, in the fourth quarter, Argentina, or we took on share leadership in diapers during the year. Peru, which I mentioned was a challenging market for us, in 2019, has really improved and we were up by multiple share points in the back half of the year. Eastern Europe, Russia, continues to see strong, robust shared growth. And as I mentioned, kind of the, the important emerging markets for us, like Africa and India we're also seeing good, robust shared growth as well. Andrea Teixeira : That's super helpful. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Michael Hsu : Okay, thank you, Andrea. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Michael Hsu : Good morning, Jason. Jason English : Folks have, hey, happy New Year. I think it's I don't think it's too late to say that just yet, still January. Michael Hsu : Yes. Jason English : Thank you, thank you. A couple of cleanup questions. First, in response to Lauren's question on birthrates, you talked about the category of last year, so growing well above infant population. I guess my question is, why do you think that is? Is this like a COVID benefit, parents at home, changing more frequently than the caregiver usually would? Is it a stock up dynamic or is it something perhaps more enduring that would prevent this category for reverting back to some population or maybe even overshooting some of the stuff on once? Michael Hsu : Yes, well, Jason, I would say the category has behaved, as at least the data would suggest, meaning the last data that we had, and the birthrate data does lag by about a year. So the last piece of data we saw was down about 1% or 2%. And actually, as we got into 2020, I think a slight improvement, I think was down to one versus it was down two the prior year in 2019. In that range, and so I think the category, at least lagging year, with would say, has behaved similarly, in the sense of volume, I think, for the categories has been from quarter-to-quarter down one or two-ish, right in that range. So consistent with the birthrate, the category, dollar value has grown, because of premiumization. And I think, that is our core strategy for big develop markets, we still think there's a lot of opportunity for us to elevate our categories, our customers, believe that and I think we're seeing that in the performance, particularly with Huggies in North America, for the quarter, I think we were up over 3 share points in the diaper category. And, if you try to kind of put your finger on exactly what that is, there's nothing, there's no one silver bullet. There's a lot of things going on. And, we're excited about the innovation we've brought to the category. We have more comprehensive innovation we're bringing this year I think we're touching are focused on premium this year, and I think we're touching 75% our portfolio was really good innovation. And so we're really excited about that. But I don't know that we're defying the laws of gravity for category in the birthrate, it's been consistent. The things we hear Jason are are here, Jason around a five or Lauren mentioned 8% category declines. Those are forecast from third parties, but we haven't seen that in the data yet. Jason English : Yes, no Sure. I'm That's the unpacking between premiumization is by environment really helpful. So I appreciate that. But let's take on the topic quickly. The Brookings Institute is one source project with America there's reports abundant reports across the developed markets from Japan to Australia to Europe et cetera, talking about declines during COVID. And also deceleration or even declines in emerging markets. So what are you expecting on a more global basis in terms of infant population? And what, if any implications? Do you think this could have a competitive intensity? Assuming that the addressable audience does shrink? Michael Hsu : Yes, I mean, and certainly we're keeping close tabs on all that. And we have seen some deceleration in categories. I don't know enough data yet to call it birthrate, but certainly COVID related or population related. So certainly, we saw a decline in Russia, that actually tracks with the population dynamics with fewer women of childbearing age there. Korea, continues to -- I think we've seen improvement over the last couple years, but continues to be negative. And so I think in a handful of markets, we are seeing that in D&E, I think a little tough to call right now. And one of the things is, I think the COVID impact has been a little sporadic in those markets, where we've seen declines when the markets go into lockdown. But then, as I mentioned earlier with Brazil, a pretty good bounce back once the economy reopens. Jason English : Got it. Thank you guys so much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Michael Hsu : Okay, thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Hsu : Good morning Carey. Christopher Carey : Hi, good morning. So I guess, by my math, maybe portfolio wide promotions are still running down, I don't know, 700 to 800 basis points as a percentage of sales relative to the end of last year. And I guess I'm hearing comments about, how to be more efficient on trade spending, and maybe even how that's potentially sustainable. So I guess, these promotional levels stay lower over the course of 2021 especially if demand remains elevated. And it gets, just like more simply put, can these lower promotional levels stick longer than, I think what people have been anticipating, right, because that would potentially have pretty important applications for competitors, the broader sector. And so, maybe I'm reading too much into that. But if you could just talk about, if you've learned something from this past year about how much you do need to spend and how sustainable that might be going forward. And I appreciate any perspective there. Michael Hsu : Yes, well, Chris, I think you're hitting a kind of an important spot for me. I mean, philosophically, I just, I don't like, I don't believe in over promoting categories. And really, for me, but the purpose of promotion, at least that I tend to sign up for is it's the drive trial of your brand, right. And, whether you have important news or you're trying to get that brand to a population that hasn't experienced before, so, that's, for me that the strategic point. I do think when categories get over promoted; it tends to drive some commoditization. And over time, I think it lowers the growth potential of that category. So for me, I would like our organization to be very disciplined about how we reintroduce promotions into the marketplace. Certainly I think we're, we have great partnerships with our customers and recognize the importance to build their business, and we're going to be great partners with them. But I do think, how we think about promotions, I think you're asking the right questions. And so for us to be continue to be very disciplined about how we think about it, and how we manage it will be important going forward. And the other part of it is it's a big spend for us. And it's not, in any given year, the money is not perfectly spent and so we can always get better. That's why we've invested in capability and brought in a lot of tools and our revenue management capability to give us the analytics to help us spend that money more wisely going forward. Christopher Carey : Okay, thanks. And maybe just one follow up, just longer term and I guess to use your word, may be philosophically, the professional channel, is obviously going to come back to a certain degree, whether it comes back to the levels that it had pre-COVID as, people changed how they work and in general, how they interact with these locations. Can you just talk about maybe the capacity in this business and what if people are going to these channels much less often, what you might need to do to right size this organization for the long term or whether spare capacity can be used for other things? So just basically a longer term perspective on that professional business maybe over the next couple years? Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yes, great, great point also, as well, Chris and I will say our professional team has done a great job pivoting. And so, we did see strong sequential improvement in the quarter behind their pivot to wipers and safety products. And, but you're right, the core washroom business improved sequentially as well in the third quarter still down. I think the -- having both sides of the business, both professional side, and the consumer side is a good benefit for us. And so it does give us the ability to move capacity around to some degree. Certainly in the professional side, we do have some assets that are unique to professional, but over time, I think we are expecting the professional business to return. It may not return -- I don't know yet whether it will return to pre-2020 levels, that remains to be seen. I do hope that that does, but I think we have -- we will have proven over time to be able to manage our capacity and our asset investments to right size the business for either growth or to shift businesses or asset capability to other businesses, we can utilize those assets more efficiently. So we'll make the right business decision. And I'll just point out that again, margin expansion is core to kind of our job and what we do and so we'll continue to make the right management decisions over the long term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thank you. I'd like to get back in. I just had a question about longer term margins Mike and Maria. I mean, I know the 2022 plan speaks to a goal of longer term margin expansion. And you mentioned it again today in passing as something that's important for the business, even if it's a challenge in 2021. But I just was curious about any kind of view on margin trajectory from here; let's say over like a three-year time horizon, just given the conversation on commodity costs, given that you've had some nice benefits this year from the higher throughput. I was just curious if you thought margins had kind of hit, what one would call a peak level or if there's still margin expansion opportunity here for the company over the next kind of two or three years? Michael Hsu : Yes, Maria, I don't know if you want to lead off there. Maria Henry : Yes, sure, I think more longer term our outlook for the margins of our three segments haven't changed as you know this is -- this year has some unusual dynamics as did last year. But over time, it is our expectation and intent to improve the margin in the business over time. And that will go hand-in-hand with a number of the key things that we're working on, additional support on the top line, and we'll get leverage on the top line growth continued focus on productivity. We're not done on the productivity side of the house, there's, more to come there. And then the meaningful investments that we have been making and continue to make in terms of commercial capabilities, better positioning us to respond to what might happen in the macro environment. All of that is kind of the basis for our belief that we can continue to expand margins over time. And we've talked about personal care in the very high teens to low 20s tissue in the mid to high teens. And so we continue to have those as our long-term objectives. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, that's great. Thanks for letting me sneak that in. Michael Hsu : Okay, thank you, Lauren. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue. Michael Hsu : Okay, well, thank you. Certainly we feel like we're very well positioned. Our categories are essential. Our brands are healthy and we think there's lots of room for us to elevate and expand our categories. So thank you for joining us today. Paul Alexander : Thank you very much. Maria Henry : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this morning's presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines and thank you for joining us today.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning\u2019s short remarks, we will be opening the floor for questions. And at that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today\u2019s first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander. Please go ahead sir. Paul Alexander : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. I am joined today with Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Earlier this morning we issued our earnings news release and we also published prepared management remarks from Mike and Maria that summarized our first quarter results and full year outlook. All documents are available in the Investors section of our website. In just a moment Mike will share a few opening comments and then we will take your questions. During this call we may make forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We may also refer to adjusted results and outlook both excludes certain items described in this morning\u2019s news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I would like to start the call today with the few brief remarks. Our first quarter result and outlook have been impacted by supply chain disruption, softer than expected consumer tissue de-stocking and a sharp rise in input cost. Well, I am not pleased with the results on our outlook we are taking decisive actions to manage through the short term challenges we face. We continue to invest in our brands and commercial capability to ensure we are able to grow both in the near term and in long term. We gained market share in 2020 and our shares are up to a good start this year with strong gains in many key markets. At the same time we are moving rapidly specially with selling price increases to offset commodity headwinds. We have done this successfully in past commodity cycles and we expect to do this again now. And remain confident in the underlying health of our brands and in our growth strategies. We\u2019re operating in a very dynamic environment. We know how to manage through this. I\u2019m confident our team will execute with excellence and will continue to build a stronger company for long-term success and value creation. Now with that we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen at this time the floor is open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Michael Hsu : Good morning Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Good morning guys. So a couple of questions. First Mike you mentioned in the prepared remarks that were published price increases in many other businesses besides what you already announced in late March. Can you just put a little more meat on the bone there in terms of additional product categories in the U.S. where you might take pricing maybe some international countries where pricing is more likely? I know you want to be a vague at this point but any type of commentary on potential timing, magnitude of increases as you think about it across the portfolio? Michael Hsu : Okay. Yes. Thank you, Dara. Our teams have moved very rapidly and made decisive actions to realize additional price this year obviously. We announced many price moves back in towards the end of March and those will take effect over the next couple of quarters. In North America, pricing is typically going to be in the mid to high single digit range across both our consumer tissue business and our personal care businesses. It\u2019ll cover about 60% of our overall portfolio. We are taking pricing in multiple other markets including in Europe, Latin America and parts of Asia. We expect pricing and additional productivity to offset most of the raw material inflation, incremental raw material inflation this year and again we\u2019re off to execution. We have generally announced most of our moves thus far. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. That\u2019s helpful and the other 40% in North America do you think that comes eventually? Is it uncertain at this point? Is it more just timing and you\u2019re waiting for the right timing and \u2013 Michael Hsu : Yes. I would say phase effects and so obviously Dara you might recognize we do some actions and list and some and count and so we had plans for count that we\u2019re rolling out that we\u2019ll cover a little bit later. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And then looking at the full year top line guidance, it implies a pretty robust recovery relative to some of the softness that we saw in Q1. So just give us a sense for what\u2019s driving the confidence there. Is it more a category recovery as you look going forward or are there other factors? And then also, can you just comment on what you\u2019ve assumed on North American market share in both personal care and consumer tissue in the balance of the year? I\u2019m wondering what the assumptions are there, particularly in light of some of the price increases that you mentioned? Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yes, okay. Just on the outlook, again, I think one of the things around maybe the quarterly phasing is just recognizing that we had unusually high demand in the first half of last year, and that started in the back -- toward the end of March in the first quarter and then all through the second quarter. So that will -- that\u2019s really driving a difference in our outlook. One of the big reasons for our adjusted -- adjustment in the reduced outlook organically was we are seeing is a faster destock in consumer tissue, particularly in bath tissue, and I think you can see that in the scanner results as well. I do think it is a faster destock and that looks like it\u2019s related to maybe a faster vaccination and faster pace of mobility that\u2019s changing. Interesting, we track mobility data and it looked like January, February, Dara, in the U.S. mobility was down about 30% in January and February and it climbed to being down 15% by the time we got to March. So, again, I think it does -- a lot of it is the demand attracts with kind of what we\u2019re seeing happening in tissue. Maria Henry : Yes. And the other areas, we had the effect of the supply chain disruption in the first quarter that impacted our sales. And that\u2019s mostly a first quarter event. And then as Mike said the comps, so the comps get easier in the second half versus the first half. And if you look at any of our underlying business and market shares, the underlying business is performing well. And if you look at our KCP business with our expectations around mobility, we would expect KCP to pick up also. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. Just one clarification. Go ahead. Sorry. Michael Hsu : Go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : I was just going to ask is the Q1 volume loss, do you recover any of that going forward or is that more of that loss volume sort of applies to the full year or is there a recovery at some point? Michael Hsu : Well, we\u2019re hoping to recover some of it, but there was a pretty big impact of the quarter that we think will stick for the year. Let me just touch on the winter storm a little bit just to give you a lot more texture and our agreement would be conservatively on Q1. It would have been worth about $0.15 a share, and 2 points overall of organic, which would be about 5 points of growth, organic growth for North America. Important to note, this will also and this goes back to the phasing, Dara, it\u2019s also going to constrain our Q2 volume in North America, particularly in personal care, and it\u2019s also going to affect our shares in the second quarter. So the back story is -- and I think you may understand, but the February storm hit in the Southern U.S. and really significantly impacted our supply network. It shut down large personal care and consumer tissue facilities that we have based in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas for up to 10 days. And so sales were impacted due to -- it did flow through to sales for us, Dara. Typically, I would say, hey, a week or two down should not affect the business that much, but because of COVID last year, we were already running in a tight supply situation and so that\u2019s why it has rolled through and affected our sales. It\u2019s also going to continue to impact our raw material supply. Polymer producers have been affected more than us, I would say. And so, we\u2019re having some spot outages of some materials. And so again, overall, in North America underlying brand performance has been very healthy, but we do expect, because of supply issues, our shares to soften a bit in the second quarter. Maria Henry : Yes, and it\u2019s tough because we are in fixed consumption categories and so people use our products on a daily basis. So when you go to buy them, if we\u2019re not on the shelf, then they\u2019ll find it elsewhere, outside Kimberly Clark. And so typically in the first quarter when there is challenges, we would look to recover. It\u2019s a little tougher given the outages, given that it\u2019s fixed consumption. So, but that impact is definitely factored into our full year reduction in our top line outlook. Dara Mohsenian : That makes sense. Thanks guys. Michael Hsu : Okay. Thank you Dara. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Michael Hsu : Good morning, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about spending levels. So just thinking about the balance here, I think you commented that investment kind of steps up in 2Q versus 1Q. But one of the questions, I\u2019ve gotten from people couple of times this morning was just the degree to which you\u2019re going to tap into G&A spending for the balance of the year to kind of to deal with some of the -- with the unforeseen cost headwinds. And then also just related to that and just following up on Dara\u2019s question as a point of clarification. When you talked about pricing and productivity offsetting most of the inflation, is that on a calendar year basis or is that over time comment? Maria Henry : Yes. Let me take the last one first and then I\u2019ll come back to between the line. So, one way to think about the run-up in inflation that we have for the year is that within year we will cover about half of that with pricing. And then when you add in the additional cost savings both in terms of our increased outlook on the FORCE program as well as additional tightening of the belt around discretionary items you would get to cover a good portion of the inflation. And then if you look at the reduction on EPS outlook, you could look at it and say, after all of that, it comes down to the decline in volumes which are affected by all the reasons that Mike just talked about. So, within year, Paul, I think we\u2019re saying about half is recovered on pricing and then over time, we would expect to fully recover the commodity increases as we always do through a combination of price increases and cost savings, if that\u2019s helpful. Lauren Lieberman : Definitely okay and then again, yes. Maria Henry : I\u2019m between the lines, the way I think about that for the year is first and foremost, we will continue to invest behind our K-C 2022 strategy, which means we will continue to support our brand investments, we\u2019ll continue to invest in innovation and capability development as all of those things have been paying off for us. So I\u2019d look at that as protected investment. And then on discretionary costs, we\u2019ll certainly look to tighten our belt and prioritize any spending that we have this year given the more challenging conditions. And in addition, we are continuing to push the FORCE cost savings, and as I just mentioned, we upped our savings outlook for the year there and our teams are working hard to try to pull in productivity programs into this year as well as find new opportunities given the overall pressure there. Michael Hsu : And I\u2019ll add, Lauren. It\u2019s important for us to protect that investment in our brands, because we feel like it\u2019s working very well globally and our brands are responding well to the investment and performing very well despite I would -- what I would say are some challenging conditions. Definitely, we believe are better execution in our investments in our quality innovation advertising are really working. Market shares are broadly up globally in almost all key markets around the world. I\u2019ll just rattle off some shares just you may be able to see these, but North American diapers were up about a 1.5 in share and China almost 3 share points Korea, Australia, Peru were all over 4 share points. India, Argentina, CEE were up over 2 points. And so again we feel like we have great products in the marketplace, great marketing especially through digital and great execution from our teams and so we want to continue to support that. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. And just to double check my math, which I can follow up offline with Paul is super wrong, but it sounds like North America personal care was on track to be up like low single-digits this quarter, if the storms hadn\u2019t created supply chain issues, is that fair? Michael Hsu : That\u2019s a reasonable assumption, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. All right. Thanks. I will pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Michael Hsu : Morning Kevin Kevin Grundy : Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Quick question on K-C Professional. Did you see a pickup in the month of March? I guess like looking back to last year, there should be somewhat of a natural hedge. Mike, there was a comment in the prepared remarks about potentially seeing some early effects of social mobility picking up, which had an unfavorable impact on the consumer side of business. I wanted to tie that in two ways, number one, did you see that pick up in the month of March? Because it wasn\u2019t necessarily evident in the quarter, but again March could be looking better relative to January and February. And then two, was the demand elasticity in that business in line with your expectations? It looks like you took some pricing with an obvious effect on volumes, but the business did come in quite a bit lower than the street had modeled. So just hedging implications from weakness on the consumer side and then comments on demand elasticity would be helpful. Michael Hsu : Yes. Great questions, Kevin. I guess the short answer is regarding pickup not yet, and organic was down about 13% with continued improvement in North America, but I would say that improvement was more on the wipers and safety business than on the core washroom business. The washroom business was down about 35%, so about where it\u2019s been. I did say mobility is improving. So again just to refresh your memory, I think January, February was down about 30% and then in March it had improved to being down 15%. It isn\u2019t flowing through to our washroom business yet. And our business tends to be concentrated in travel, lodging, offices and high traffic locations like sporting events. So we may see some of that start to pick up as we go forward, but I do think that had been lagging and these sectors that we tend to play harder in, tend to lag the overall mobility a little bit. I will point out wipers, safety were up strong double-digits in the quarter. We feel great about the momentum of that business. And regarding your pricing. Kevin, I think there has been some significant pricing on the gloves side in our safety business that\u2019s driven a lot of the pricing. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s -- elasticity is probably coming in as we planned. It\u2019s just that there has been some unusual pricing, unusually high pricing on the safety side. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Very helpful. If I could just squeeze in one more. This is Mike for you and Maria as well. Just on, I think, this is building on some of the Lauren\u2019s question. The decision to maintain advertising and marketing levels, which I think there\u2019re some questions among the investment community, whether the company would decide to do that given increased commodity costs. Mike, of course, this has been a big focus of yours since taking over. Can you talk about how internally those discussions went just given the significant commodity cost pressure, the balance may be considering pulling back a little bit, your visibility on ROI and what\u2019s an arguably a really volatile environment and maybe some of the ROI model sort of less reliable given that context,, maybe just a little bit there in terms of what went into decision making and the visibility you feel like you have on maintaining these levels, and then I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Yes. Kevin, I think you\u2019re all over the issues as we discuss them. One point is, we feel like we have strong brand momentum as I just rattle off a bunch of share and growth. In what I would say are still fairly choppy waters in the categories, but we feel great about the share momentum of our business globally. And really we can tie it back to the investments we\u2019re making in product quality, innovation and marketing and team execution, which is excellent. So we feel good about that. There has been some discussion around that. I will say we will make some adjustments, but in a small manner. Overall, we want to maintain our investment levels, but for example, in North America, where we have supply constraints, it may not be the highest ROI decision in the short-term to be driving, let\u2019s say, promotions in that business when you don\u2019t have supply. So we will make some tactical adjustments, but overall, I think your point on ROI is also important, which is, it is going to vary, we don\u2019t have the latest data for ROIs on the quarter. But generally our marketing ROIs, especially digital, has been very strong. And so it may not be the lever that we traditional think of when cost conditions get a little tough, because it\u2019s hard to see how cutting advertising if it\u2019s working that effectively for us actually helps the P&L. Maria Henry : But as you can imagine, we had pretty extensive discussions at the market-by-market level to review the advertising plans for 2021 given the environment, where we believe we\u2019ve got strong ROIs that makes sense to continue to spend the dollars, because we\u2019re getting the payback on those dollars. But we did have some pretty deep internal discussions around that. And while it varies by market and by product line, the decisions, what I would say is in our current outlook we\u2019re expecting advertising spending to be relatively similar to 2020 levels on a dollar basis, and on a percentage of sales basis it will be in line with our original plan coming into the year. All of that said, the mix of it, and where it is, and on what it is, is different than we would have expected three months ago, but in total that\u2019s going to help how we\u2019re thinking about it. Kevin Grundy : Okay. Thank you both very much. Have a great weekend. Michael Hsu : Okay. Thank you Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Good morning. Thanks. I guess, maybe to round out what we\u2019ve talked about so far, can you just talk about in the context of the cadence of your EPS guidance over the balance of the year, because obviously 1Q was a tough start. It sounds like 2Q is going to be directionally tough as well, at least from an EPS perspective. So when you talk about meaningful EPS growth in the back half. I guess is there a way to better frame what that looks like and how confident you are in the drivers? I guess, because it sounds like they\u2019re going to be back-half of related savings and I\u2019m assuming you have good visibility there. But I just think what I\u2019m hearing this morning, just a lot of investors are concerned about market share movements in the back half, elasticity in the back half, and the actual efficacy of pricing rolling through, just given lost sales you\u2019ve highlighted in the first half, and then differences in the way that you\u2019ve announced price increases this year versus what we heard from P&G earlier in the week. So just any thoughts you have around that would be very helpful. Maria Henry : Sure. I\u2019ll give some broad commentary, and then Mike can talk more specifically about pricing. But when we look at the second half, we are expecting a stronger second half, and that is for a few reasons. The biggest reason being that our pricing actions and the benefits of that will be coming through the P&L in the second half. In terms of input cost inflation that is ramping in the first quarter and the second quarter. We expect that it will peak, and then moderated -- moderate and in some cases come down a bit in the second half. Additionally, we\u2019ve got our savings program ramping as you can tell from the FORCE cost savings of $65 million in the first quarter, and the outlook of $340 million to $380 million for the full year. So those will be ramping as is typical in a typical year. And then, we also have some elevated costs in the first half of the year, which will come down from -- in the second half of the year. So we have good visibility into it. The -- when I look at the factors driving that, the one area that has some -- well, what\u2019s the word I would use, some dynamism around it, would be pricing. So I\u2019ll let Mike talk a little bit more about how we see that come to fruition. Michael Hsu : Yes. So, Steve, so, we did make assumptions in our pricing around the elasticity impact. We do have volume coming out of the plan as well, as it relates to pricing, I would say we have good experience from it, from just a couple of years ago. And in general, our calls regarding elasticity generally were in the ballpark of what our original plans were. And so we feel good about kind of our ability to call it. But the one difference I would say in this market would be, what exactly happens due to the COVID environment and some of the volatility related to that. And then we did have some assumptions regarding competitive price points, which we still need to learn how that\u2019s going to be executed. Maria Henry : One other comment that I\u2019ll make just in terms of phasing to put a point on it is, in our performance in the first quarter, when I look at the second quarter, but while we don\u2019t provide detailed quarterly guidance, we do expect the second quarter conditions will remain challenging, and that will show up in the numbers. And if you think through some of those factors, there\u2019ll be more cost inflation that\u2019s coming in ahead of most of our new selling price increases that will have escalated costs before the pricing is really getting into the market. We\u2019ll be working through the tail end of the supply chain disruptions in North America that Mike already commented on. And then the category dynamics in consumer tissue and K-C Professional are more volatile than normal. And then, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect that the between-the-line spending will pick up from a relatively low level in the first quarter, and that includes more investment spending. And then, in addition to all of that, it\u2019s worth noting that we had all-time record earnings in the second quarter of 2020 behind very strong volume growth in consumer tissue. And last year, we also had commodity tailwinds. And in the second quarter, we had very strong FORCE cost savings. So all of that is shaping up to have challenging conditions for the second quarter with our performance ticking up in the second half of the year. Steve Powers : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And I guess, if I could just like how are you thinking about this setback in terms of the lower outlook for 2021 from -- in terms of the lasting impacts here? Could you -- I guess when I think about it in the context of K-C Strategy 2022, we\u2019ve been talking about the mid single-digit EPS CAGR for a while ever since that strategy was unveiled. And I think we\u2019ve all been doing that in our conversations, at least with like a 5% CAGR in mind, and quite frankly, you seem very much on track and even ahead in terms of your strategic investments coming into the year. So, in that context, is this -- are you approaching this kind of setback in early 2021 as a speed bump on that path or is this likely could have more enduring impacts into 2022? And I\u2019m not asking for 2022 guidance. I\u2019m just trying to understand how you\u2019re -- how impactful this is as you think about it in the context of that broader strategy. Michael Hsu : Yes. I\u2019ll check and see if I understand the question. But I think we view it as a temporary impact that should not affect our long-term strategy. That\u2019s why we are continue to invest in our brands. I think, as I said before, I think our investments are working. We feel great about where the brands are going. And -- but I don\u2019t really want to take a part what we\u2019re doing in China, because we had a plant that came down for a week in Texas. And so, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. And so, we recognize what our medium-term guidance has been. We plan to hit that over the long-term. We also recognize that we want to accelerate organic growth beyond what our medium-term guidance was and what -- we are making progress on that, but recognize that we operate in environments like COVID -- affected by COVID. And also, now this -- I think, once in a lifetime, at least living here in Texas, a once in a lifetime storm that we always prepare for, but you never really think it\u2019s going to happen. But the teams are doing a great job responding to the challenge, and doing the best with what they can. And our suppliers are doing a great job partnering with us. So, again, I think it\u2019s a -- I feel like it\u2019s a temporary effect. Maria? Maria Henry : Yes. I would agree. And we\u2019ve been encouraging people to take a two-year look on our business, given the meaningful effects that the COVID-related dynamics have had on primarily the tissue categories, both on the consumer side and the professional side. So, when you look at our performance last year, it is especially in the first half where we had the incredible shift in demand and some stock up dynamics. We didn\u2019t expect that to change our long-term outlook for the business. And when you look at this year with the consumer destocking around consumer tissue. This year we expected that consumer destocking would happen. We didn\u2019t expect that it would happen as quickly as it appears to be happening. So, if you look at the business over a two-year period where we had net benefits from COVID last year, we\u2019ve got some net headwinds on the consumer tissue side this year. The performance over the two years is -- actually looks good and relative to our medium-term guidance and does not affect the long-term outlook for our business. It\u2019s just we have this two-year period of big impacts from COVID-related items. Steve Powers : Great. Thank you very much. Very generous in your answers. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Michael Hsu : Good morning Jason. Jason English : Hey, good morning. Good morning, guys. Thank you very much for slot me in. I was hoping you could provide a little more context on cadence of your expected price realization, particularly relative to the promotional environment. One thing that really stood out this quarter was the deterioration about the pricing environment in North America tissue, I mean, last quarter, you reported I think 11% price growth in North America, lower promotions with price mix per se. We\u2019re back to neutral already. It looks like promotions are coming back certainly faster than I expected. Is that it\u2019d be what you\u2019re seeing and how much of a negating factor on your price increase will have? Maria Henry : Yes. Before Mike jumps in, I would call out that we had an unusually high price effect show up in the fourth quarter of last year that had to do with the timing on accruals where we had an accrual true-up in the fourth quarter that caused that to be unusually high. It was not indicative necessarily of the market environment. So, I wouldn\u2019t so much compare to the fourth quarter. I\u2019d point you more to the full year average from last year or at least the last three quarters of last year. But Mike, I\u2019ll have you comment. Michael Hsu : Yes. So, overall, Jason, that\u2019s why knowing that we had some different items in that statement, I would say, overall, we still view the North American market across personal care and tissue to be constructive. I think promotional volume in personal care returned to, I would recall, I think our team calls normalized levels a few quarters ago and so it\u2019s proceeded along that path. And I would say it\u2019s -- that\u2019s kind of where personal care is. In tissue, I would say promotional levels for us, at least our perception is and our planning is a little -- still lower than where it had been and primarily because we still have been in tight supply. Obviously, given kind of where demand is going, that supply situation is getting reversed a little bit now, but again we don\u2019t have significant plans in the first half to promote aggressively. And frankly as you\u2019ve heard me say before, we remain committed to our journey on the high road and we really believe we want to grow our brands by investing in products and innovation and advertising. And so over promoting categories for us in a fixed consumption category does not feel like a healthy way for the business. So, again, I would say, overall, the market appears to us constructive. Jason English : Now, that\u2019s good context. I appreciate that. I guess I didn\u2019t realize there was such a big one-time benefit in the fourth quarter last year. Quick math on that suggests it was almost $100 million, which suggest you\u2019re going to have north of $0.20 EPS headwind in the fourth quarter. Is that right? And given that your guidance is still back half-weighted, how are you going to overcome such a big hurdle? Maria Henry : Yes. Our guidance balances a lot of different moving factors as I described earlier. And I won\u2019t repeat myself in going through those points. If you look at the pricing on consumer tissue from last year and you look at the trends, it\u2019s about 1% in the first half, flat in the third quarter and then the net benefit of 6% in the fourth quarter. And so I\u2019d -- as I said, I\u2019d encourage you to look at the full year and trust that we\u2019ve taken all of the various factors into our second half outlook commentary. Michael Hsu : Yes. And Jason you\u2019ve been in our chair, so I think you recognize kind of we have a lot of -- what we\u2019re paid to manage through these things. And so these things come up every year. And so, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we know how to manage through these situations and we will. Jason English : Yes. No. I understand. Thank you guys so much for your time. I really appreciate it. Michael Hsu : Thanks Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Michael Hsu : Good morning Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. So I have three part questions for you, I\u2019m sorry for that. But first on, if you can comment on the competitive environment in personal care outside North America. I think you called out some market share gains which are encouraging. But first on China, we heard comments from one of your competitors that the market share -- the market has been more competitive as of late in diapers. What have you seen in your share dynamics there? And that\u2019s the first part. And then the second one is on the call out for the price increases you\u2019ve taken in Europe and LatAm, in -- and obviously you have some competitors that are local and report in different currencies. So have you seen any results of -- I mean, I know you had amazing results in Brazil in the first quarter, but have you taken prices there already and with the government incentives trading, how do you expect that to be the balance of the year. And, sorry, the third part is, what is embedded in the KCP guidance? Your comments about washroom\u2019s coming in a little bit more, obviously travel-related a bit more back loaded. What are you expecting for that business at the balance of the year? Thank you. Michael Hsu : Okay, all right. I\u2019ll try to -- I\u2019ll start with the competitive environment. Overall, again, I think we\u2019ve been competing as I\u2019ve mentioned, Andrea, kind of in this high road approach, which would be again build the brands through quality, innovation, marketing and local execution that\u2019s very, very good. And so, that feels like to us has been working very effectively, China, especially. We were up double-digits in China across both femcare and diapers. So we feel great about their business. Organic was up over 20% in China in the quarter and Huggies was up double-digits and that was driven by volume. And what I would say, they premiumizing mix. And so our share is up, as I mentioned, almost 3 points. And we feel like we have the best product in the marketplace and the teams are very good on both baby and in femcare around digital marketing agility. And so they\u2019re very good at building that digital relationship with the consumers. And so I think that\u2019s been a key component of driving our business. And so, yes, I think the market may be getting a bit more competitive, but we still feel like the Chinese consumer is looking for high quality products and right now, they view as our products as being the best in the marketplace. Andrea Teixeira : That\u2019s helpful. And on the price increases in Europe and LatAm, if you can comment on those. Michael Hsu : Yes. I would say, overall, we have announced pricing in Europe and we have been announcing pricing fairly continuously in Latin America. So, in general, I would say, we have seen competitive -- competitors move pricing in Europe. And then locally in Latin America, it has been mixed. And so we have seen pricing moves from some of the larger competitors. And then there have been one or two local ones that had not moved. And so that\u2019s just a dynamic that\u2019s been going on for a year or so now and our teams have been able to operate with them. Andrea Teixeira : And on KCP? Sorry for the three parted question. Michael Hsu : Okay. The KCP, I think the guidance is, yes, we do see -- we are planning for sequential improvement throughout the course of the year. And again as Maria mentioned earlier, we are seeing mobility pick up faster, but in the KCP business that hasn\u2019t flown through the washroom segments that we typically play stronger in. And so we will -- we do expect to see that occur as more people get back to work. I do think it\u2019s related to at least in North America would be a faster vaccine rollout that we initially saw as we were ending last year. Andrea Teixeira : That\u2019s great. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Hsu : Good morning Chris. Christopher Carey : Hey, good morning, everyone. So, just one follow-up and then another question. So just on the follow-up to a prior question, I know that you\u2019re planning to keep promotional levels steady or at least below pre-pandemic levels. Can you just comment on maybe how much control, you would have over that situation say if overall category promotions were to start to take off, right? So from a competitive standpoint, would you follow those promotions or do you have levers that you can deploy to keep market share if competitive activity reflected in higher promo, where to take off? And then my question is just around -- there\u2019s been a lot of focus on 2021, I think appropriately so. There\u2019s also this broader narrative around unemployment rates, impact on birth rates certainly, developed markets coming back a bit faster than emerging markets. But can you just talk about what you would expect from a category growth rate standpoint say over the next 6 to 12 months and maybe even a bit longer term as well? Michael Hsu : Yes, okay. I\u2019ll try to address, Chris. On overall promotion, I would say, our approach is to kind of grow the brands through investing in the quality of the products and in advertising. And then with digital, that\u2019s quite an effective tool for us. I mean, not only is digital tends to be higher ROI than any of our other spends, including retail promotions, it\u2019s also-- you get faster feedback on its performance, right. So, again, I think we have plenty of levers. We did shift to this approach a couple of years ago and I think it\u2019s working very effectively for us. So if you ask kind of do we have the levers in our control? I would say yes. And what we feel good about is we have programs developed that are robust in that sense. And as I just rattle off a bunch of these shares, we feel like those are working very effectively. That said, we want to be competitive on price or promotions, but I don\u2019t think promotions in a fixed consumption category are the right long-term way to grow the category, because it\u2019s different than, let\u2019s say, an impulse category like cookies, where you can drive incremental consumption through promotion. Our categories, you generally don\u2019t drive incremental consumption. You can drive share. But I\u2019d rather earn our share rather than rent our share for the short-term and it\u2019s a very expensive way to rent share, right. So, again, we do have the levers, and by the way, we are making significant investment in our revenue growth management capability. So we have the tools and even while we work to invest for more promotion. I think we\u2019d be very selective in terms of how we spent it and we want -- we would want to make that efficient as well. I don\u2019t know if that addressed your question. Christopher Carey : Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the birth rate dynamic, are you starting to see more impact in your results? Would you expect category slowing? I wonder if you can maybe divide your comments between developed and developing markets where maybe birth rates come down, but you have a more of a GDP per cap upside type drivers. So, anyway, just -- the broader question there is just around near and medium-term expectation for growth rates and whether you\u2019re starting to see some slowing there. Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yes. Great question, Chris. And we are seeing a little slowing in the growth rate, overall, both in developed and developing markets. For instance, in the U.S. where the data typically lags, we were down about a 1 point -- the birth rate was down about a 1 point in 2019. The latest data, although it\u2019s not officially published, I think Paul, but it would say roughly down 3 last year. And so that was a slowdown and we\u2019re seeing some of that too, where you may have read in China, the birth rate has come down significantly as well. I think the balancing factor is a couple of different components. One is our core strategy is to elevate our categories by creating more value-added products and premiumizing our mix over time and that\u2019s really taking hold. And as I mentioned, we\u2019re up almost 3 share points in China. That\u2019s all through a premium mix of products. And for instance this year we\u2019re -- we have the best product we feel like and then what we call our Tier-6, which is our premium tier, we are launching a Tier-7 product that brings a lot of the features that we have in our current premium products and escalates them further and we\u2019re launching Tier-7 at a 50% premium to Tier-6. And so I do think in some markets like China, where the consumer is certainly is willing to pay for what they -- what are better products in the near-term, we will continue to drive our business that way. That said, we also have many other developing markets like Indonesia and India that are continuing to grow and -- where the birth rates are not as impacted yet or still maintaining their birth rates and also we still have category penetration growth. So, again, I think we feel good about our overall strategy. Do recognize that the environment likely because of COVID has affected birth rates to some extent, but we feel like our strategies both in developed markets, which is to elevate our business and our categories and then continue to expand in D&E are the right ones for us. Christopher Carey : Thank you for both of those. Appreciate it. Michael Hsu : Okay. Thank you Chris. Operator : Thank you. At this time speakers we have no further questioners in the queue. Michael Hsu : Okay. I want to thank you all for joining us today. Our revised outlook really reflects some significant change in our environment. And I want to assure you that our teams are taking decisive action and we remain very confident in our hybrid approach to growing our brands. So, thank you. Paul Alexander : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may disconnect your phone lines and thank you for joining us this morning.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning\u2019s short remarks, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Taryn Miller, VP of Finance and Interim Head of Investor Relations. Taryn Miller : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's second quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Mike Hsu, our Chairman and CEO; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings news release, and we also published prepared management remarks from Mike and Maria that summarize our second quarter results and full year 2021 outlook. Both documents are available on the Investors section of our website. We hope you find it valuable to have prepared remarks ahead of this call. In just a moment, Mike will share a few opening comments and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We may also refer to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.  Now I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the Q&A, I'd like to offer some additional perspective on our performance. Clearly, our results did not turn out as we expected, and we knew it was a tough comp, given our strong growth and record profitability in the year-ago quarter. Now while we expected volatility this year, the external environment has proven to be even more volatile than our expectation at the beginning of the year and versus our April update. Since we spoke in April, commodity inflation has spiked higher and our supply chain has been challenged. These dynamics are impacting us and, more broadly, the industry. We're also navigating historic levels of demand volatility in consumer tissue. Last year, we worked really hard to support our consumers and our customers as demand increased at a record pace. While we expected the category to retract this year, that decline has meaningfully outpaced our expectations. This has been driven by reduced at-home consumption due to increased mobility and destocking of both consumer pantries and retailer inventory. Consumer tissue has historically been very stable and we expect demand to normalize over time. We remain confident in our brand fundamentals even as we acknowledge that the short-term tissue outlook has been difficult to call. We've taken decisive action to offset the impact of raw material inflation. We have announced pricing in key markets around the world. Our pricing actions are on track, and we expect to fully offset the effects of input cost inflation over time as we've done in previous cycles. We've also taken prudent steps to control and reduce discretionary spend across the business. We expect this to be reflected in our results as we continue to implement these actions. We view this level of input cost inflation and the COVID-driven demand volatility to be discrete issue. We will continue to take appropriate action to reduce the impact of volatility over time. At the same time, we remain confident and committed to our approach to building brands. Despite near-term challenges, we have plenty of bright spots in our business. Our strategy to invest in our brands is working. You can see this in our second quarter results broadly across personal care and especially in D&E markets. Excluding North American consumer tissue, our organic sales were up 4%. Personal care organic sales were up 6% globally, driven by a 4% volume increase. In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were up 8%, with very strong market share performance including in China, Brazil, throughout Eastern Europe, India, Peru, and South Africa. We've recently captured #1 diaper share positions in China and Brazil, which reflects the strength of our brand fundamentals with consumers. Importantly, we're starting to see green shoots in K-C Professional. The business grew year-over-year and sequentially as we saw strength in international markets and positive trends in washroom products. As more companies transition back to in-person environments, we expect KCP momentum to improve in the back half. We're encouraged by our underlying brand performance and have made significant progress in addressing the supply challenges we faced earlier this year in our North American personal care business. Looking forward to the second half, we are expecting better results across the business. We believe the major factors impacting this quarter do not reflect the fundamental health of our business. We remain committed to our strategy to deliver balanced and sustainable growth for the long term. We'll continue to execute K-C Strategy 2022 and we'll invest in our business for the future. This includes investments in innovation, commercial capabilities, and technology. Importantly, I also want to emphasize that we are acutely aware of the impact that this pandemic continues to have on our employees, our consumers and our partners and the world. We will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our people and all that interact with Kimberly-Clark.  Now with that, we'd like to address your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Wanted to first, to start with, I think, the biggest question, which is relatively short term but is the guidance reduction for this year. And I think it'd be helpful for everyone to just hear a bit about your degree of confidence that like, this is it, right? The environment has been incredibly volatile, but as you look forward from here, to what degree have you built in flexibility for things to perhaps worsen. So I think that's sort of an important starting point. And along with that, within the inflation basket, what has been the biggest delta versus when you last communicated an outlook to the guidance to the Street back in April? Mike Hsu : Got it. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, a couple of things. I'll start with the outlook and I'll ask Maria to provide a little more color. But first of all, I'll just say overall, my view on the outlook is, it reflects certainly, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, significant changes in that external environment that we, here, view as being discrete issues and that really -- that we're managing and fully managing, I would say the 2 issues that we're talking about are one, raw material inflation and then the consumer tissue demand changes, particularly in North America. And if you add it up, Lauren, year-on-year, if you add those two, it's well over $3 of EPS on a year-over-year basis. So it's a pretty significant increase. Obviously, given that amount and given our outlook, we are covering a significant portion of that, but we can't practically cover all of that this year, all right? And so, what I would say is; part 1, our pricing implementation is largely on track and we expect to fully offset inflation over time, not all this year but over time. And then the North American consumer tissue volatility is COVID-driven, and I view that as more episodic in nature or temporary in nature, and I think the team is doing a very good job navigating it. But certainly, Lauren, it's a little tougher managing shortfalls in the category versus some of the gains that we went up against last year. And so those are, I think, two that I would say are discrete issues. The big delta on the commodities, perhaps that's less visible to all of you is the polymer resin side of the business, right? So you could see the -- you could track the eucalyptus prices which have kind of remained in the space that we've called, but what's really escalated is resin, which I think for the full year, our estimate it will be up almost 100% and certainly at historic highs for us. And that should abate at some point, but I think it's -- initially, we thought that was going to come down some in the back half but it looks like the highs are staying high longer. And so, that does reflect some of the pricing that we've taken. So overall, I think those are really the 2 big issues. I do really want to point out, Lauren, that our brands are fundamentally very healthy, and we continue to see really robust growth around the world in both organic and in share. And even we're really, really pleased with our North American personal care recovery. Although we are a little light on share, I would say almost all of that is related to supply issues. We still under-shipped orders significantly in the quarter despite being positive on organic growth in the quarter. And so, we feel good about where the business is and where our brand fundamentals are, and we're expecting a stronger Q3 in our personal care business. But maybe, Maria, do you want to add some color? Maria Henry : Yes, sure. I'll -- on your first question, Lauren, about the full year outlook, we've been wrong twice now, and so it's an incredibly dynamic environment that we're operating in. And the changes versus our expectations are clearly on the input cost side as well as how the consumer tissue category in North America has unfolded here. So when I think about the guidance range that we've provided, we have 6 months left to go in the year, and there's $0.25 still in the range, and I don't like to take guidance down ever. And since we've done it twice, you can rest assured that the guidance that we provided is both thoughtful and based on the trends that we see, allowing for some ranges given how dynamic this current environment is. And then on the outlook for operating margin compared to three months ago, a couple of the things that I'd call out, higher commodity costs, lower volumes in consumer tissue, and along with these lower volumes. There\u2019s associated fixed cost absorption. The tissue business generally runs at very high utilization rates and has high fixed costs, and the actions that we've taken to offset that also go into our outlook, which include higher cost savings and reduce between-the-lines spending. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And Maria, when I look forward -- I mean, it feels maybe a bit early, but to look forward into next year, as I think about the headwinds that you faced year-to-date from those higher manufacturing costs, be it a combination of the storm impact in Q1 and really more materially the negative operating leverage, like the absorption on tissue, I mean as we look into '22, simply the absence of those factors, if you just go back to a more normalized demand environment for tissue, right, those should be -- they should just go away next year. I mean, is there anything I'm missing as I think about that kind of impact to profitability from operating leverage and higher manufacturing costs looking into next year and as we start to compare against these periods? Maria Henry : Yes. I'll say two things. It's very tempting to talk about 2022 given where we are with this year and the very unusual dynamics that we're facing. I'm going to resist that temptation as the environment has been quite dynamic. And I think we're best off waiting to see another 6 months before we call 2022, given that the macro factors are moving so much. But that said, Lauren, the way you're thinking about it is correct. Operator : Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So Mike, you mentioned you expect to be able to fully offset the cost pressures with pricing over time. Is that with just pricing alone, to be clear? Does that include other areas like cost savings, and just given the inflations unprecedented this year, do you think you have pricing in place by year-end to fully offset those cost pressures or might it take a longer period of time to realize the pricing necessary and sort of a couple of rounds of price increases? How do you think about that? And I'm particularly focused on how you think about pricing just given the magnitude of that inflation is much worse than it typically is when you take pricing. Mike Hsu : Yes, great question. I would say yes and yes. I'm not trying to be flip. But I would say, one, generally, we've taken really broad-based pricing action globally, almost -- I wouldn't say all markets but in nearly all key markets and pretty extensive. The price -- and the pricing ranges from mid-single digit to high-single digit, in some cases, double-digits, right, and so pretty extensive pricing. Obviously, we couldn't recover all of that given timing because we announced in March, generally implemented in June or in beginning of the third quarter, so we'll get a half year run on the pricing and then a full year as we get into next year. That said, commodities have continued to move, but even as we announced our pricing, part two of pricing is we remain committed to leveraging our revenue growth management capability. And there's a lot of other levers that we can pull beyond list to continue to manage pricing in our environment and we're committed to doing that. So that's part one. I do think kind of given where we are, and I think it's normal and reasonable to expect that, we're also going to leverage our cost savings program. I mean, we have a very strong program, as you're well aware, on FORCE and we've kind of beefed that up over the course of the past year or so, and we feel good about that. And so we'll continue to leverage that. So overall, again, I think the answer is yes on both. The bigger thing, Dara, is we do recognize the impact of raw material inflation over time. In our categories, they tend to be a little more volatile. And we're -- a fundamental underpinning of our strategy is margin improvement. And so because of that, we believe we really have to, on an ongoing basis, offset the effect of inflation over time. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And just 1 follow-up on the pricing front, where you have implemented pricing so far. What's the retailer reaction and receptivity been like? And it'd be early to judge consumer receptivity, but obviously, some pretty large price increases in your portfolio. So just any thoughts on the ability of consumers to handle that higher pricing and impact on market share, and any thoughts there on what we might see going forward would be helpful. Mike Hsu : Yes. Look, we never take pricing actions lightly, and we know they can be stressful for both the retailer and our consumers and their shoppers. So we think hard about that. I will say, we believe our pricing actions globally are generally on track. And I think broadly, the retailer conversations, though never easy, I would say, have been largely constructive. And certainly, they understand what's happening in the cost environment and so we're working through that. And then I think from an execution perspective, our teams have done a phenomenal job executing rapidly around the world. I would say in terms of other brands, I would say generally, we've seen a lot of the other brands move in a similar direction. I wouldn't say identical but directionally in that same place. But the execution of other brands and private label tends to vary market-by-market. And so some will lag a bit more but I would say, generally, we feel like our pricing actions are on track. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : A question for you, Mike, on advertising and marketing. So it looks like you did decide to defer some investments, which is unsurprising in the current environment. The intention was clearly not to do that. Maybe, Mike, just spend a moment on where you decided to pull back and why. And then just -- I know this is difficult, we can appreciate that in the current environment, but balancing appropriate levels of investment behind your best and highest return ideas with the current commodity cost environment. And then I have a follow-up. Mike Hsu : Yes. So overall, the thing about it, and when I say our challenges are kind of discrete, the challenges, as I'll remind you, I'm sure you remember, Kevin, is like the inflation in North American tissue. In the balance of our markets, our businesses are performing very well and generally above-plan. And so I would say maybe the thing I'll land with you is despite our near-term challenges, we're really focused on improving our long-term growth profile. We're really confident that our balanced sustainable approach to building brands is working and that the brand fundamentals globally are very healthy and that we're improving our market positions. We were up in share in about -- by our tracking, about 2/3 of our market category combinations in the quarter and so we feel good about that. And the brands continue to respond well to strong investment. I mean, we had multi-share point gains in infant child care across China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, in India, Indonesia, Eastern Europe, Argentina, Peru, pretty much double-digit growth in Brazil. So we feel good about the overall performance of the business. So because of that, we're really maintaining investment where that's working and where the businesses are on plan. We have dialed back in some markets. You can assume, for example, in North American bath tissue, given that the fluctuation in the category, we have chosen to pull back a little bit on the spending. And we're going to continue to do that. We're going to operate with discipline. I think we talked about it in prior quarters, but there is as much a mass component to our advertising program as there is a creative component, and we're pretty disciplined. It's kind of how we manage all of our consumer investments, whether that's trade or marketing. And so we're pretty disciplined on the ROI. And so our teams are reacting as you would probably hope that they would. Maria, do you have anything to add? Maria Henry : Yes. The only thing I'll add is if you look at our full year outlook, what's the thought on advertising is that it's down somewhat to 2020 for the reasons Mike just discussed but it's well ahead of 2019 on a dollar basis. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Thanks, Maria. One quick follow-up for both of you. Just on capital allocation and M&A, we saw that the buyback outlook came down with a lower earnings outlook. But when you're going through the type of environment you're going through now, you can't say pricing fast enough and even sort of leaning in and getting the organization behind productivity is still not enough to offset the sort of commodity cost pressure. Does it sort of give you pause with respect to the M&A strategy over time, and the school of thought that the company should look to diversify the portfolio away from some of these commodity sensitive categories and do that in a disciplined and accretive way? So your thoughts there would be helpful then I'll pass it on. Mike Hsu : Yes. We're always looking at acquisition or M&A opportunities, right, and whether that means additions to the portfolio or subtractions to the portfolio. Certainly, you saw that last year with Softex, which continues to be a really exciting opportunity for us and that business is performing very, very well, by the way, up in the teens, up multiple share points in the quarter. So we're super excited about that. Given where you are, I think we'll continue to look for opportunity to enhance the portfolio, and certainly, on both the plus, whether it's attractive markets or attractive categories. But also, we're going to continue to look hard at our performance of our existing categories and businesses that don't add to our overall growth profile or aren't going to be ongoingly accretive to our business, we're going to take a hard look at it. And so again, we manage capital with incredible rigor and discipline. And hopefully, that's what our investors will appreciate about our approach. Maria Henry : Yes. And on the buyback specifically, our -- at the midpoint of our guidance, our operating profit now expected to be down $450 million year-over-year. And you'll recall that in January, when we were coming into the year that our target for buybacks, we were expecting operating profit to be up slightly. So with the reduced cash flow coming into the business, that's really what's behind the reduction of $250 million to $300 million on the share buybacks. And then in terms of capital allocation, we also trimmed our CapEx plans for the year by $100 million, and we remain committed to the single-A credit rating and to make all of that work after having leaned into it with the restructuring as well as the acquisition of Softex, that's how we make all of that math work. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Carey : So I just want to actually touch on the consumer tissue outlook for the back half of the year. It seems to me that the kind of the important part to making the outlook work, but at the same time, you had noted, that's an area that's been a little tougher to call. And I guess, I'm trying to understand maybe just a little bit of the confidence around the normalization which you had noted in your prepared remarks. It seems to me that market share has really peaked during COVID, maybe some capacity benefits and that you just -- you've seen some reversion in market share back to pre-COVID levels. And so if you kind of run it flat to 2, 3 years ago, it's sort of unchanged. And I guess what I'm getting at is just what exactly you think is occurring in that business, and just maybe specifically, the types of things that you're seeing that give you confidence in this reacceleration in that business in the back half, which again to me seems to be kind of the important factor in making the full year outlook work. Mike Hsu : Okay. Yes, great question, Chris. And I'll try to unpack it and we can go back and forth on this a little bit. First, let me just say, I remain very confident in our North American tissue business. And we've got great brands, performed very well last year. I do think we have given back some share this year. What happened last year when the category spiked, and at this point last year, I think the category was up about 30% or so. Consumers were looking for tissue and our customers were looking for tissue. And so our organization really moved aggressively to try to serve our customers and consumers at a point where we felt like they needed us the most. And so we really pulled out all the stops. We probably did gain a little bit of share, particularly on a brand like Cottonelle, where we had a little more availability than maybe some of the other brands in the marketplace. And so it looks like to us, while our share is down a bit this year, I do think it's kind of reverted maybe to the prior year levels to some degree. And we'll continue to go forward and earn our share growth over time on that business. But we feel like our brands are healthy, but we are navigating what I would say is like the most volatile part of the demand curve that we experienced last year. So the front half is where all the spikes in demand. And so there are really 2 effects there is the spike in consumer demand and then there was a corollary effect on retailer supply. And so maybe the 1 disconnect that you might not have visibility to the data are the category in the quarter in North America, and I'm talking bath tissue specifically was down 12% in consumption, okay? And then our shipments were down about 27%. And so the difference between the 12% and the 27% is really, for us, we estimate as retailer inventory changes. And what happened last year on the inventory side was, I think exiting Q1 where there was the big spike, retailer inventories as a percent, if I index it to historical levels or 2019 levels, had dropped down to below 40% of what, I would say, the traditional turn inventory. And so retailers work really hard to get back in the supply. And so by the end of the year or toward the back half of the year, they were well north of 100% of overall levels. And so as we entered into this year, our estimate would be retailer inventories were probably in the 130%, 140% range. And so that's dialed back in the first and second quarter this year. And so it explains kind of a big chunk of the delta here on demand. Looking forward, again, I'll stand by it. I mean, I looked at this category for a long time and it's one of the biggest categories. Obviously, if you think about bath tissue in particular, it's a very stable category. And so the logic for me is, in a post-COVID world, I think there will be more people at home on an ongoing basis than there were pre COVID. I don't think the office environment or the work environment is ever going back to 100% every day. And so logic would say consumption should be a little higher than the base level of '19. Now year-to-date, we're below '19 levels for the category, but we think I would say logic would say that, that should kind of normalize over time. And I won't estimate whether that's at what point, but over the long term, this category has proven to be very stable. And our brands have proven them very, very stable and very healthy. Maria Henry : The other comment that I'd -- yes, just -- you were asking specifically on consumer tissue, which certainly has a big first half, second half effect. If I look overall first half, second half, in the first half, our organic sales are down 5% and our operating profit is down 26%. If you take the midpoint of our ranges, you get to a second half that looks something like plus 3% on organic and plus 5% on operating profit growth. And so if you think about the -- our second half outlook and the key drivers there, we'll have easier comps. We will have a step-up and benefit from volume growth and price realization in the second half. The majority of the consumer tissue destock, we're assuming, occurred in the first half. We won't have the winter storm effects that we had in the first half. KCP washroom is expected to continue to see sequential improvements. The pricing actions are now fully in the market. We'll see some build on our cost savings as we typically do. It's usually second half weighted and our other manufacturing cost headwinds should be lower. And then offsetting that what will be the higher commodity cost headwinds. If you take the 45 year-to-date and our guidance, it implies year to go is [765] at the midpoint. So -- that's -- those are the drivers for the second half, and certainly, the dynamics in consumer tissue are a key part of that. Mike Hsu : We threw a lot at you and I threw a lot at you on tissue. I don't know if that answered all your questions or I'm happy to take a follow-up. Christopher Carey : Yes, that was extremely helpful. The only quick follow-up would be just on the level of inventory -- retail inventory in tissue as you enter Q3, given some percentages, where do you see it today? And then if I might, I would just sneak in a question on how you're thinking about birth rates and medium-term impact on volumes, and then I'll get back in the queue. Mike Hsu : Yes, all right. And just -- I'm going to -- a disclaimer on my inventory, those are our estimates and so that's kind of how we look at it and think about it. I would say, close to historical levels. The caveat I'll say on, Chris, is we're not exactly sure and I'm not sure the retailer is exactly sure how they want to handle it at this point, right? And so I think kind of given the category volatility and on a retailer-by-retailer basis included, I think it's going to continue to bounce around a little bit, right? And so because -- and the example I'll give you is we were building up inventories, but there was another spike kind of in the fall period and then the winter period as well. And so I do think consumers largely understand that there is plenty of tissue availability. But that said, I've seen a lot of new things over the last 18 months. And so we won't be surprised if behaviors continue to shift around a little bit. So that's on the tissue side. And the other part of it is, certainly, there was a consumer -- we think consumer pantry destocking as well. I will tell you, the team in North America has done a phenomenal job conducting research to try to estimate that. I will say it's probably as accurate as trying to estimate share from panel data, right? And so you're asking consumers how much they're carrying. And so -- but we do believe consumers are taking a lot of their stock out as they have more confidence that tissue is available but that remains to be proven out. So that's on the tissue. And then on the birth rate. Yes, our estimate for this year, first of all, it's probably down about mid-single -- low to mid-single digit. And that's probably a little worse than the last -- the prior 2 years. I think the prior couple of years were down about 1% to 2% depending on the year. And then given COVID, I think it feels like some families have decided to defer family formation and so kind of in that range. I will say we feel really good about the recovery of our infant child care business and the fact that we're really recovering from a supply perspective. Our brand propositions, we feel very strongly about. And so we feel like in the third quarter, we should be back being on track in our infant child care business. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : You did throw a lot at us on that consumer tissue conversation, but I guess I have just a clarification coming out of the back and forth you just had with Chris and the commentary this morning. If -- I guess I'm still trying to ascertain whether you see a change in consumer takeaway expectations on the balance of the year. Because what I read in the prepared remarks is that the consumer pantry and retailer inventory rebalancing occurred faster than you previously assumed as it relates to 2Q. And you just kind of reaffirmed that, but I didn't really hear anything about a net reduction in consumer takeaway. So I guess, were you not assuming any rebalancing in the course of '21 before? It just happened in '21, where you thought it would happen later downstream? Or is there -- because I guess I can understand the pull forward in the rebalancing for the first half versus more spread out and not hurt 2Q, but there's still a net negative impact on the full year that I can't pinpoint. So can you just help me there? Mike Hsu : Yes, there's a couple of different ways for me to answer that question. I'll say let me anchor it versus our original plan, our plan expectations for tissue at the beginning of the year. We walked in the year -- and just think back to December, Steve, where the vaccines were really not rolled out, and so our going-in was that the category would be lower than 2020 overall, but in some ways, probably a mid-single-digit decline, right? Because we thought at that point in time, consumers -- people would still be at home generally, right? Now coming out of that, and as we entered our April update, it's clear that the vaccines rolled out much faster than anybody anticipated and mobility, the data that we track, show that we're returning to maybe 80% or 85% of historical levels. And so that was faster than we had anticipated. And so our expectations for the category, I'd say, were down a little bit further. I think coming out of the second quarter, I would say our category expectations, which were up about 22% in bath last year, probably, we would say, are going to be down at least in the mid-teens or so, mid- to high teens. And so overall, I think our expectations for the category are going to be worse than they were at the beginning of the year. That said, at that level, I would say that's still -- I still believe it should be above a base year of 2019, right, if you take the 2 years together. That remains to be seen. It feels like a kind of a sticking my neck out there call on that just because of what we experienced in the front half. But again, I'm working from logic that says there are likely to be more people at home than there were in 2019. And if people are home more often, then the consumption of at-home issue should be higher but that remains to be proven out. Steve Powers : Yes. Okay. Okay, that helps. And I guess that segues into my next question, which you sound pretty satisfied and happy and kind of upbeat with the trajectory of the Professional business, probably in part because of that vaccination reopening trend. I guess -- so that resonates with me, but I guess I was expecting a bit more just as it relates to 2Q, given the dynamics you said as an offset to consumer tissue. And so just maybe a little bit more color as to how you see that business trending and kind of what your expectations are in the back half? Mike Hsu : Yes. On KCP, I wouldn't convey happy. I would say it's certainly proud of our team and how they respond to all these challenges. I'm cautiously optimistic about where that category is, and I do see some green shoots. I mean, a couple of things kind of going on. Organic was up 2%, right, which is a sequential improvement versus where we -- we've been for these past several quarters. That was predicated on really strong growth internationally, which had a really soft comp from a year ago. But importantly, improvement in -- sequential improvement in the North American washroom business, which is a big business for us and really, really important. I wouldn't say it's taken off yet but we are seeing the impact of more people returning to work, whether it's in the office environment or a factory environment. And so I think that's -- those are all positives there. There are some offsets because we did grow significantly in our wipers and PPE or safety business last year due to additional COVID demand. That's probably cycling down a little bit this year and that's a bit of an offset. So we feel good about the KCP business. I think the team, even throughout last year, was working hard. I think somebody mentioned on the call last year around jet-air dry conversions, and we've got better offerings in our washroom business, great towel products, great dispenser products. And so we are winning conversions. But I think I said on prior calls, we haven't seen the -- we won't see the share until the products flow through the dispensers. So what we feel good about what the team is doing and looking forward to, I'm cautiously optimistic. Steve Powers : Okay. If I could just, Maria, you've mentioned that [770] or so at the midpoint of inflation to come over the back half. Do you -- is there any, I guess, color you can offer in terms of how you see that flowing 3Q versus 4Q, if it's weighted significantly one versus the other or if it's more evenly spread? Just some help with the cadence there would be helpful. Maria Henry : Yes. I think the expectations are that the commodities will reach peak in the third quarter and then start to ease a bit as we get into the fourth quarter. So I'd use that as the kind of phase-in guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : So you mentioned in your prepared remarks, and I was also pretty encouraged by the performance and commentary around D&E. And so obviously, you have pockets of strength, pockets of weakness, and you mentioned strong share performance there. But I was just curious, has the consumer been more resilient in those markets than you would have anticipated, kind of given the COVID environment? Or is this strength really just Kimberly-specific? Mike Hsu : Well, that's really hard for me to generalize because I think it varies. I think certainly, there's a lot of markets that were less impacted by COVID, and I would say a lot of that is in Asia. Although I caution when I say that because it's starting to pop up again now more significant, particularly in market big markets for us like Indonesia. So I think there is some aspect of resiliency. But the other aspect is and maybe underlying is the strategy that we're on, which is to elevate the category and expand our markets. And I think the teams are really concentrated, particularly in infant and child care with the Huggies brand, really great product offerings. I mean I think the big thing that's happened over the last, I would say, 2 years is, globally, our teams on diapers have really aligned around kind of a set of consumer benefits that we're going to win on and really aligned on kind of the product technology platforms at our global platforms that we're launching. For reference, we're up 4 share points in Australia, New Zealand in diapers. We're already obviously the market leaders there. But that diaper has specific lineage that's linked to our China diaper. I wouldn't say they're identical but they're highly related, right? And so that's kind of the work that we've been on. We've taken share leadership positions in Argentina and Brazil. And again, the diaper there is related to the diaper that we're making in North America. They're not twins but they're related, right? And so I think again, the teams are really focused on, I would say, a -- made a shift from product features to consumer benefits that we're focused on delivering. And I think that's really shown in the shares. And again, I'd say in China, we were up about 3 share points in the quarter as we were last quarter. I mentioned 4 share points in Australia and New Zealand, 4 in Korea, 4 share points in Peru. So we're seeing pretty broad-based share gains. But we feel like they're earned. We're certainly not promoting our way to those share gains because we don't really believe in renting share. I think it's basically great products, great digital execution and then really hard sales execution and great partnership with customers. Peter Grom : No. That's super helpful. And then I just wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions in regards to the commentary on second half organic sales growth. So first, I just want to make sure I heard the comment on volume growth correctly. Is that a total company comment or was that something specific to consumer tissue? I thought total company but I just wanted to be sure because I think Chris's question was on consumer tissue. And then just like anything you can share on phasing of that 3% growth between Q3 versus Q4, given the cycling of the accrual true-up in Q4 would be really helpful. Maria Henry : Sure. I was making the comments I'm just bridging from the question on consumer tissue to the total company because consumer tissue is certainly part of the story in the second half when we look at the total company outlook. So to clarify, I was talking about total company in my remarks about first half, second half. And the phasing of the quarters, I'm going to stay away from quarterly guidance. Here, I think the things to consider are the year-over-year comps. I did make some commentary around phasing on the commodity headwinds. And beyond that, I think I'm going to stay away from the quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : So a couple of questions. I guess I just I really want to focus in on tissue and pricing. You guys had phenomenal price growth in the fourth quarter '20 in North American tissue. And I believe it was because you had under-accrued or over-accrued -- excuse me, over-accrued for trade spend throughout the course of the year and had the true-up. So we're lapping a period where you had over-accrued for trade spend, suggesting that, well, I know list prices take time to get in, but I think I was expecting -- many of us were expecting you to at least get some pricing benefit from lower trade. Yet on a 2-year stack basis in North America, prices eroded. In developed markets outside of North America, prices are deflationary. In developing and emerging markets, your prices are deflationary, and you just achieved the worst price/cost deficit that I can find on record. So it begs the question of what's happening? What's really impeding your pricing power right now, particularly in an environment where as you're saying, you expect demand to be above base case 2019? Why aren't we seeing more responsiveness of sort of net price benefits flowing through the P&L? Mike Hsu : Yes. I will start, Jason. So part 1 is we have announced pricing in consumer tissue in many markets, in most of our tissue markets around the world, including in North America. I wouldn't say we've taken it across every product line. And so Scott 1000 is kind of a key product that we have. And so that's 1 area. Certainly, we did benefit, as you mentioned, from accrual differences at the end of last year. And the other thing that we benefited throughout last year was given the amount of demand in the marketplace, we reduced our promotional spending overall, right? And so we kind of earned maybe the same or higher volume levels without having to spend the trade. So that was a benefit last year that we are cycling this year, and so we are putting some investment back in trade. For reference, I would say, the category promotional intensity in a market like North America, still below historical levels but moving its way back to what I would say are more normalized levels, and so we recognize the need to do that. The thing that I will tell you is I think your point is on, which is we've got to get better price realization. I will say we don't necessarily view the additional spending of trade to be a negative profit driver in the sense of, we've invested in a lot of tools and revenue management, and we expect our teams to be able to use those tools to drive volume and growth profitably. And so we're going to hold ourselves accountable to that. But with that, again, we recognize the need to get additional price realization, and there's many ways for us to do that in addition to the list pricing that we've taken. And there's also ways for us to do that through revenue management, through trade efficiency, price pack and other things that we'll continue to look at. I don't know if, Maria, you have any thoughts. Maria Henry : Yes, that's right. Jason English : Okay. So there's other mechanisms, we're just not going to see them yet. They're going to take time to see. Last time we had inflation in tissue, you guys ran a price/cost deficit for 8 consecutive quarters before you flipped positive. Is there any reason to think that you could close the gap faster? Or given the environment that you're mentioning, with promotional activity actually picking up in the face of rising costs, could it actually even be more prolonged this time? Mike Hsu : Well, again, I think we've actioned generally our pricing in the marketplace. And so I would think that, hopefully, the duration of that gap would be shorter. Certainly, we didn't like the gap through the first half of this year. And so that's 1 part. Second, again, we're going to continue to review kind of all the levers that we have on revenue management and make sure that we make the appropriate adjustments to our plans on a market-by-market basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So I wanted to go back to pricing, I'm sorry to beat a dead horse here. But what is your read on the consumer elasticity, not only in the U.S. but also internationally as you obviously compete with players that oftentimes are private? But specific to the U.S., the dollar share that we're looking not only in tissue, in track channels, as you explained well through Chris' question before but also in diapers, are you seeing that the same decline across all channels? And is that an indication that consumers are probably down-trading now, that they see private label, for example, Scott 100 (sic) [Scott 1000] is the one that competes more neck-to-neck with private label? So are you seeing any issue there or perhaps you're going to tweak a little bit of your price increase now that you know what you know about tissue, and then perhaps do more RGM where you barbell a little bit of these price increases. So any update on embedded in your guidance, if you were changing some of your pricing or any second rounds in North America that we may not be aware or you embedded in there? So any color there would be great. Mike Hsu : Yes. Great question, Andrea. Maybe the short answer for me is I don't know yet. I think for reference, we took about a high single-digit price increase across our personal care businesses and then some selective price increases, for example, on Scott tissue in North America. And I would say those went into effect at the end of June. And so it's a little early for us to gauge that. If I go off the history though, I will say the last list price increase we took on these businesses actually in personal care was not list, it was more count, okay? But that said, I would say the consumer elasticity at that point back in 2018 was probably, in my mind, a little lower than what we modeled in terms of elasticity. So what that implies, I think there's a couple of different factors. If I would say, more price sensitive factors would be that I think consumers are facing broader inflation in this environment across all categories, right, beyond consumer packaged goods. So that may be 1 factor, right, that makes it a little more challenging. The other factor that I know talking to people in other industries is there have been reductions in other spending, consumer spending, which create a little more wallet for some of the more consumables, and so that's an offset. So for me, the answer is at this point, a little theoretical ambiguous. And so it remains to be seen but we'll know as we work through this quarter. Andrea Teixeira : And no, that's super helpful for tissue. And in diapers, like I felt that you don't have as much of this channel stuffing that we saw, even I'm assuming retail inventory. I think you spoke mostly from a consumer tissue perspective and not so much on the diaper. So what is happening there? Do you see that changing also the elasticities moving around as a moving target for you? Mike Hsu : Again, I don't see significant change, but again, it's still early for us to tell. Yes, I think you're right, Andrea, the dynamics in personal care were very different than tissue last year. And so there was a bit of a, I would say, consumer buy-in in the first quarter last year, but it was, I would say, a mid-single-digit kind of number, maybe mid- to high single-digit, whereas the first quarter last year consumer tissue was like up 30%. And so very, very different behavior. And then we unwound that, almost all of that in Q2 of last year. And so I think the consumer -- the personal care North America behavior has perhaps been a little bit normalized. And again, I think the same thing holds from what I was talking about with tissue, which is our pricing has been kind of in the market for about 3 weeks now. It's a little bit earlier for us to get a read, but again, I think we feel cautiously optimistic about it. Operator : Next, we have a follow-up from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Sorry, I was taken offguard. Wanted to ask about -- let me just find my follow-up question -- just the category growth in personal care in D&E markets. I know you talked a bit about -- very much so about market share gains. But one of the things that's definitely been out there like the resilience of some of the categories in D&E markets. So just anything you can offer in terms of perspective on why the categories have kind of held in as well as they have because even again, with your share growth, it still implies the categories are in a pretty good spot, too? Mike Hsu : Yes. And maybe I'll go around the world because it varies so much because of a couple of things, one -- probably the biggest 1 being COVID. I would say we were really positively encouraged by our performance across Latin America. I thought it was terrific performance in a really, really challenging COVID environment. I'm sure you're kind of reading all about it. But I mean, in a market like Brazil, our personal care organic was up over 20% behind volume and price, and we did take pretty significant pricing actions there. Overall, we maintained our share there. We're already in the leadership position. And I think what's happening in Latin America broadly and why we're winning is the team is doing an excellent job adding value by premiumizing the category but also pivoting, in some ways, back and forth, even within the same year between value and premium. So the big thing is we have very strong leadership positions throughout Latin America. For example, in Argentina, we're the leaders in value tier and we're the leaders in premium tier, and we're the #1 brand overall. And so the team, depending on kind of what's happening in the local environment, kind of makes the pivot as to what products they're going to maybe drive and emphasize a little harder. And certainly, I think in Latin America, maybe this year more than maybe even 2 years ago, value is very important. Consumers are stretching out their consumption. But we flow through a lot of our great product innovation to our value tier as well. And I think that's working. So that's kind of 1 set of things. I would say China is different. Lauren, we're up 3 share points in the quarter. We're proud, at least for now, we're in the #1 share position, which we feel great about and we feel really great about our products. And so I think the consumer continues to really respond to product superiority and innovation. I will say the category conditions are pressurized because I don't know how much you're seeing but the birth rates are coming down fairly significantly. And so we recognize that's going to be an issue for us to work through. But in the near term, our team feels great about their ability to grow the business, to grow share and work with the big e-commerce partners. And then in some of the other markets, Eastern Europe, I mean, I think we are multiple share points up in almost every market across Eastern Europe, somewhere in the 1 to 7 points of share in the quarter. And again, I think great offering. They're all related. The China diaper, the U.S. diaper, the Brazil, they're kind of all related to each other and very good. And I think the teams are recognizing how to drive those. So I think it varies. The 1 watch-out area that we're very kind of paying close attention to because of COVID is ASEAN, Indonesia, Vietnam, India as well. Again, those environments right now are really pressured with the pandemic, and so we're really keeping a close eye on that. So I don't know if I answered what you were looking for, if there's something else. Lauren Lieberman : Yes. No, absolutely. I really appreciate it. Operator : Next, we have a follow-up from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Super quick follow-up question, real tactical on your response to Lauren there. I think you said China growth for you on personal care was up maybe mid-single-digits, but you just said you captured 300 basis points of share in the quarter. It implies a pretty sharp market decline in the market. So can you drill down a little bit deeper there, like what is the rate of decline you're seeing? And I think you mentioned birth rates down and that we know, the birth rate is down, that has a prolonged drag on infant population. So is what we're seeing today likely to persist for a protracted period of time? Mike Hsu : Yes. Sorry, my bad. I was a little unclear. China overall, personal care was up mid-single-digit. Our diaper business was up double digits. But that said, I think your question still holds. Yes, there are expected to be some birth rate challenges in China, so it will slow down as a market. I still believe, and I think our team believes, there's still significant opportunity to premiumize our categories and we're still a low double-digit share. And so there's still plenty of share opportunity. That said, I do think there will be a slowdown on the diaper side of the business. Our fem care business has been growing strong double-digits. In the quarter, it was down a bit because we were cycling a promotion, a big promotion that we've decided to get out of this year. And so -- but we feel great about our fem care business. That's grown strong double-digits for, I think, 3 or 4 years in a row now. And so we expect continued growth in China, although I think on the diaper side, the category will be challenged somewhat. It also kind of points out our emphasis on diversifying our growth across developing and emerging markets. So one of the things I'm excited about, Jason, is I think we grew significantly in India. I don't know if I could -- I think -- well, strong double-digits in the quarter. And I would say, Indonesia, I'm really glad we made the acquisition of Softex. It's a great business. I think the business is up in the teens. Even though they are cycling or working through some pretty good COVID challenges, pretty significant COVID challenges but it's a great business and a great team. And again, with Indonesia -- in India, I think the growth in those markets is going to be very significant for us over the next several years. Operator : Thank you. There are no more questions at this time. Mike Hsu : Okay. All right. Thank you all very much. We're certainly navigating some high volatility in external environment, but we're taking decisive action and we're continuing to improve our brand fundamentals to sustain long-term sustainable growth. All right. So for that, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning short remarks, we will open the floor for questions. And at that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Taryn Miller. Taryn Miller : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today. Are Mike Hsu, our Chairman and CEO; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings news release, and we also published prepared management remarks from Mike and Maria.  The summarized are third quarter results and full-year 2021 outlook. Both documents are available in the investors section of our website. We hope you find it valuable to have our prepared remarks ahead of this call. In just a moment, Mike will share a few opening comments and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors Section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We may also refer to adjusted results and outlook both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to your questions, I would like to offer some perspective on our third quarter and further actions we're taking in response to this dynamic and challenging microenvironment. Organic sales were strong up 4 % in the quarter and included the impact of pricing actions implemented in the second and third quarters. In North America, Personal Care organic sales were up 11 % driven by mid-single digit increased in both net selling price and volume. In D&E markets, Personal Care organic sales were up 7 %. Organic sales increased double-digits in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Eastern Europe, and South Africa. Our top-line performance was strong, despite the resurgence of COVID, which impacted growth in ASEAN, Latin American K-C Professional. Our market positions remain strong and improving, reflecting strong innovation and excellent commercial execution in nearly all key markets. Our share positions in North America remains solid with good sequential gains in personal care. Our share performance in D&E markets remains robust, where we continue to strengthen our diaper leadership positions in key markets including China and Brazil. We also continue to focus on cost, with our teams delivering solid savings of $150 million in the quarter. In addition, we reduced between the[Indiscernible] and spending. Now, clearly our margins and earnings costs well beyond the expectation we established just last quarter. I'd like to highlight the effects of three areas of volatility that are most impacting our business. First, as we noted in July, and on the basis of external forecast, we had expected commodity prices to ease in the second half of 2021.  Instead, prices for resin and pulp increased further in the third quarter and are now expected to stabilize at a meaningfully higher level than our prior estimate. Second, a tight U.S. labor market and disruption in domestic and international transportation markets are having an elevated impact on our supply chain as we work to get our products to the shelf and meet consumer demand. Third, energy costs are up dramatically in Europe, where natural gas prices have risen as high as six times year-ago levels. Energy prices in North America are also up sharply, although not to the same extent.  As a result, our margins are down, but were down with declines only partially mitigated by the actions we've taken TO date. We're not pleased with our results and were taken further action to mitigate the impact of higher input and labor costs. These steps include further pricing actions, additional initiatives to ensure we achieve our cost savings goals, and tightening discretionary spending. At the same time, we remain committed to investing in our brands and commercial capabilities. While we expect to see some benefit from these actions in 2021, we have further reduced our outlook for the year. This reflects our third quarter performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter.  And while we're not ready to call our outlook for 2022, I will offer perspective on key variables that will affect our plan next year. First, we continue to build top line momentum. In addition, our pricing actions, brand investment, and commercial program should provide further benefit in 2022. Second, some discrete headwinds we faced this year will be behind us. This includes the U.S. winter storm and presumably consumer tissue destocking. Third, some headwinds we faced this year may become more persistent. We're now expecting further inflation on several key commodities. We're also expecting continued tightness in the labor and transportation markets, which will continue to impact our global supply chain all the way to our customers. In addition, the going forward impact of COVID on both demand and supply remains very unpredictable. We will continue to move decisively and navigate changing market conditions, we'll also continue to invest in our brands capabilities to maintain brand momentum. Our strategy is working and we remain confident in our future and are confident in our ability to create long-term shareholder value. Now we'd like to address your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Questions will be taken in the order in which they are received. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Mike Hsu : Morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. How are you. Mike Hsu : Good. I've been better. Dara Mohsenian : Yes. It's a tough environment. So you mentioned further pricing actions, Mike, could you just be a little more specific there? Maybe review what you've done globally in terms of percent of portfolio, magnitude of increases generally, where you've taken increases and maybe just some insight in terms of the forward pricing, are you looking at it more on the product category basis, geographic basis? But just as you think about the forward pricing, any more insight would be helpful. Mike Hsu : Okay,[Indiscernible]. Maybe I'll start a little bit philosophically. And I would say based on our strategy, in our improving margins is a core aspect of K-C 2022 for us. And so we've taken further actions to offset inflation. I mean -- and I believe margin improvement is a fundamental pillar of what we need to do for the Company. And so we expect to fully offset inflation with both pricing and cost reduction, so a combination. And while we took the fully offset that over time, so we announced some further actions in Q3.  The year-to-date, our actions are fairly broad-reaching every region, every business, generally, I wouldn't -- actually, not every single business, but generally across most markets. And so in Q3, we've announced broader actions in North America, professional and consumer Latin America, and other markets selectively. So I would say pretty far reaching. I will tell you Dara, our earlier pricing actions are generally on track as you saw in the release.  We had 3 points of price factor in organic in the quarter. We have seen some other brands move, particularly in North America. I haven't seen significant movement of private label yet. Although I'll note that typically occurs a little bit later, and we've had a little share of softness. But in general, I think our volumes are holding up well. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And on the advertising side, certainly you've cut back a bit in this tire commodity environment, is there a point when you get concerned that maybe you've cut back a bit too much? Obviously, you mentioned the market share results remain healthy. But how do you sort of think about flexing that line item and we're sure of voices today in the categories you're competing in? Mike Hsu : Yes. I mean, I -- you can probably see it in the release. I mean, we feel very good about our organic performance. I think our brands are very fundamentally healthy. And I think our investment in both innovation and commercial programming, especially advertising, are working very hard for us. So we're going to obviously work hard to make sure our margins improve, but we want to maintain that investment in the brands, especially where it's working.  That said, we have made some adjustments in some categories where it felt like it was perhaps a little less effective in the current environment. And so to that extent, we've done that. We have trend our between the line spend a little bit, but that -- I would tell you that's been more on the G&A front than on the MCP front in the quarter. So [Indiscernible] is there something you want to add. A - Taryn Miller : Yeah, I think I describe it as we're being -- we're being very pragmatic here. We had some challenges on the supply chain side that are affecting us. So we have challenges getting the product to our customers and where we've got a higher demand than we can fulfill at the moment because of the supply chain challenges. We're really looking at what are the near-term returns on our investments, and we've been prioritizing those as we look at the current situation. And so we've trimmed the advertising investment a bit, but that's on the back of significant step-ups for the last two years, and when I look at the year, our expectation is that on a dollar basis, we'll be up nicely from where we were in 2019. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And then last question, just as we look out, obviously there's a lot of volatility from a commodity cost standpoint. And things have been moving in the wrong direction, and you're taking a lot of pricing to help offset that. Is there a certain point you can look out to where you think the year-over-year pricing, at least based on the plans that are in place today, as well as spot commodities where we are today, where you are able to fully offset it on a year-over-year basis?  Obviously, there's still -- there's a big gap leaving this year, but I'm wondering on more go-forward basis, is it more in the middle of next year when you think you have enough pricing to offset year-over-year commodity increases? Could it be earlier than that? How do you think through that conceptually? Understanding will be some gap leaving this year, but when on a year-over-year basis do we get to an ability maybe to offset some of these cost pressures from your vantage Mike Hsu : Yeah, Dara, I mean, that's why we've been saying we'll offset, or get our margins back in line and improving over time with both pricing and cost reduction. I think the middle of next year is probably a good kind of perspective for us.  Because obviously what happened this year was we saw the change in the commodity line, obviously coming out of the first quarter, and so we announced pricing that was effective, or we announced it at the end of the first quarter and it was effective in our second quarter of this year. Certainly, commodities have moved significantly since then. And so we've made additional actions, and that's going to take us time to implement fully. So, that's one component. The other component I will tell you that looking forward is -- and I think we indicated this about 2022, is the global supply chain is under pressure, and we do expect cost to remain elevated for a period. Not not all costs.  Certainly, I think there's some fundamentals in the Eucalyptus market that would say, hey, there's more capacity coming along, so that should come back a little bit. But the polymer-based products seem like they're going to remain elevated for a little while. We mentioned the U.S. labor costs and pressures on transportation globally, I think that's going to remain elevated for a while because I don't see a fundamental catalysts to change that in the near term. And so that's why we're making some of [Indiscernible] A - Taryn Miller : I would add it will depend on the -- where commodities go, and any pricing actions that we take from here. So I might be a little bit more cautious than the middle of next year in terms of margin recovery. But we'll have to see how the dynamics play out. I think at this point, it's just -- it's too early to call. What I would say is, we understand the situation, we understand what the drivers are and we'll manage through it with an eye toward recovering our margins over time. Dara Mohsenian : That's helpful. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Mike Hsu : Good morning Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Thank you very much. Good morning. I wanted to just focus in a little bit on the supply chain disruption mentioned briefly in the prepared remarks and you guys just spoke to it a bit, so -- and it's also impacting your sales outlook for this year. So I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on what categories are we talking about? I s it you're not able to procure inputs, or is it about not being able to get from your factory to the store effectively and which element the supply chain is if it's under pressure and what category should we be looking for that pressure and particularly next quarter. Mike Hsu : Yes. Okay. Well, maybe I'll start when -- and Maria has probably got much more detail. But I would just -- not to be flipping around, but it is affecting almost kind of all areas of our operation. I mean, certainly, I think you can clearly see on Fiverr and resin-based the commodity challenges. And so I think that's kind of a well-established and visible for you-all. I think maybe -- what, maybe, as a little less clear is kind of how it's rolling through and what I mentioned, labor markets and the transportation market, it ripples through. And my take would be it, it looks like COVID appears to have increased the demands for goods over the past year or so, and [Indiscernible] shifting expanded a little bit from services to goods. And so, what that -- the other effect of COVID is, and you've read all the articles about the great [Indiscernible] whether that's the case or whether it's more -- that there are a lot more options for hourly work, it has really tightened the hourly labor supply.  And so because of that, that pressure on both sides, increased demands means much more demand for containers or trucking. Less labor means fewer drivers to drive the trucks. And because of that, as you noted in our third -- even in our third quarter, while our service levels are improving significantly, we were not able to get all our orders out the door on the timeline that we wanted. And because of that, that rolls through in multiple ways.  One is we pay higher rates for employees, higher wages -- were paying higher rates for transportation. It's rolling through -- in some cases, our employee tenure is -- has shortened dramatically, and so it's changing how we staff because we have to staff more people to get the product out the door. We've got production outages, missed deliveries, and that ripples through with fines and everything else with customers.  And so there's just the many ways that I think both this pressure on the labor side and the transportation markets ripples through the cost. And that's why you're seeing a little softness in our FORCE delivery. Most of that was because of the elevated costs. I don't know, Taryn do you have more to add? Taryn Miller : No. I think that was pretty thorough. It's basically across the board getting supply into our mills, getting supply out of our mills, getting the products moved around the distribution network, lots of challenges on the warehouse side. We need to hire -- in a normal time, if we have 30 people given the inefficiencies with the labor and turnover, we might need to have 40 people just to get the same amount of product at the door, as an example. It's -- across the board, primarily in North America. Although in the UK, there's also distribution challenges, it's another market where it impacted our sales in the quarter. And that also has to do with labor related to Brexit. So it's -- I've never seen a supply chain environment like this, and it's affecting us across the P&L. Mike Hsu : Yeah. Lauren, one thing I'll add is I don't know that there's a -- I think we said in the notes, not a short-term solution here, because it does feel like it's based on fundamentals, which is -- there's more demand for goods. And I think we're seeing that in many categories beyond consumer. And then there's -- it does feel like there's more options for hourly employment, and because of that, that's putting pressure on the labor markets and hiring for the roles that we need, right? Lauren Lieberman : Okay. And so when you also mentioned about, I think it was in the prepared remarks, that investing in the supply chain to meet demand, this is what we're talking about, just -- it just absorbing these higher costs. It's not structural Capex type investment, it's investment meaning in incremental workers and so on. Mike Hsu : Yes. Maria Henry : Right. Its the P&L investment. And then I think I've mentioned this before in terms of overall investment and Capex, and where are those dollars going on, part going to the -- part of the investment is in digital supply chain. And that's been a driver of our Capex and we'll continue to be for several years. And when we -- even when we look at things like the S4 HANA upgrade, we've wrapped a lot of supply chain digital capabilities into that program. But that's not new news. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. I'll leave it there because that was a lot that you gave me. Thanks very much. Mike Hsu : Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Hsu : Morning, Chris. Christopher Carey : Hey, good morning. Thanks so much. So a couple of category questions actually. On the Personal Care side, can you just maybe expand a bit on the strength that we're seeing in the business? There's been a lot of commentary around challenge birth rates and yet the business continues to see strong growth.  Think North America might seem entailed in[Indiscernible] this quarter. Our forecast was wrong for the birth rates this year, our [Indiscernible] income [Indiscernible] is doing better, is being offset the impact of the job losses. Just any perspective you might be able to provide around why that business seems to be doing better.  And then I'll just add on the second kind of category question here. I mean, I appreciate that the tissue business -- the consumer tissue business is seeing difficult constant continued destocking, but there has been some market losses. I wonder if you could just expand upon that as well. So there's one on the Personal Care side, and then on the tissue side as well, please. Mike Hsu : Yeah. Overall, Chris, our brand fundamentals are strong and really improving. And I think it's really based on differentiated innovation and excellent local commercial program -- really the driver. And I think our brands are about as healthy as I've seen for as long as I've been here.  Obviously, not all of them are working the way that we would like them to work. But in general, our brands are performing quite well. The birth rate issue mentioned in diapers is real, although there's a couple of dimensions of that, which is one, certainly a big decline in birth rate in China. Five-years ago, there were about 17 or 18 million births and this year, it looks like they'll be about 10 - ish, right?  And somewhere in that range. And that said, it's still going to be a big market and still the largest diaper market in the world for along time. So that's one thing, that's one that's on the downside. The US on the contrast because there was a little bit of decline in births last year that accelerated because of COVID, actually slightly up this year. And actually, we're seeing through the first couple of quarters and the projection is moving towards modest growth in the second half, so that's a bit of positive news. But the overall, I think the reason why you're seeing strong performance on personal care is more what I talked about previously, which is strong innovation pipeline and strong local programming on the commercial side. And what the teams will say it's not any one thing, it's the combination of a plan, meaning great innovation backed with great marketing, with a great sales plan and local execution, all working together. And I think the numbers you may have seen about Personal Care is accelerating globally, it was up 9 in the quarter with a strong recovery in North America that was up 11. And then we're continuing to see that strong performance across D&E in most markets. Making good progress in K-C Professional as well, that was up 12 with North America being up 16, and a healthy balance of both price and volume. And then consumer tissue, although still down in the quarter, was down 6, and down 9 in North America, I would say that was stabilizing. Our consumption in North America was better than our organic, and that's because we're cycling up big year-ago customer or consumer inventory build, that happened in the third quarter. Little bit happened in the fourth quarter last year as well. So we're cycling that. But I would say the good news on consumer tissue globally, it feels like its stabilizing. We have given up a little share in North America, we probably picked up a little share last year on bath tissue because we had a little more availability. Our teams were scrambling to put out as much output as it could, as we felt like there was a lot of consumer need for our products last year. And so we did that and we probably gave back a little share. But again, I think overall we feel like consumer tissue certainly stabilizing versus what we saw in the first and second quarters. Christopher Carey : If I could just think things for that, if I could just have one follow-up. Just on the pricing in consumer tissue, I was surprised to see it come in relatively low given the magnitude of the inflation that is historical as you've mentioned a number of times today. Is that just a function of timing? Was there promotional event in the quarter that offset some of the pricing? Do you expect that to build significantly from here?  Just any perspective. Or is that a function of some of the market share issues you're seeing at? Maybe not pricing, as much as -- any perspective you might be able to just provide on the pricing and the consumer tissue business. And maybe how you see that shaping up in the very near-term. Thanks for that. Mike Hsu : Yeah, consumer [Indiscernible] particularly in North America, will build as the year goes and into next year. And so, yes, so there was not that much in this year and then we did have a little additional trade investment versus a year ago, and so that offsets some of it, but we expect that to continue to build as the year goes. Christopher Carey : Okay. Thanks so much. Mike Hsu : Great. Thank you, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Mike Hsu : Good morning. Kevin, Kevin Grundy : Great. Good morning, Mike, morning, Maria. Maria Henry : Morning. Kevin Grundy : Mike, I wanted to wanted to come back just on market share. You touched on a moment ago, and you didn't seem overly concerned about the U.S., as we look at the Nielsen data, it's down across the board for the most part, in the most recent four weeks and 12 weeks; and to your point, Mike, it has been more pronounced in tissue and towel, but it's not entirely tissue and towel.  So I just wanted to get your opinion, your view on where you stand in the U.S., your relative satisfaction, how you believe your supply chain may or may not be more impacted, or impacted to a greater degree by some of the supply chain issues out there. And how you're thinking about, just broadly, to a question earlier, just pulling back on spending in light of some of the market share trends, which I suspect they're probably not where you'd hope they'd be, but I can stop there and then I have a follow-up. Mike Hsu : No, thank you for keeping us up for honest on the shares. But what I would say, we're improving from a tight supply situation, and so that's probably the big thing. And so we're recovering really well. I think we have for the year up, we're even in 4 of 8 categories in North America. That's a little less than what I would like. But 7 of 8 sequentially, so we're making progress.  And so if you remember, Kevin, we had really tight supply situation toward the end of the first quarter, and that flowed through the whole second quarter. We're down mid-single-digit share points, I think in diapers at that point. And so the team has really done a nice job recovering. I think in diapers, we're up 340 basis points sequentially in the quarter. And just about even, maybe a little bit less than even on share overall in the quarter. So we feel good about the recovery. I think we're making good progress in adult care tissue. As I mentioned, on the bath tissue side, we're a little soft because we had maybe a little [Indiscernible] by this year that I was hoping to hold on to, but we haven't held onto it. But that was more due to availability.  Kleenex is up pretty good, pretty substantially, and we feel good about that although the category is down. And then on towels, yes, we're down about -- a little over a point. The issue there is given supply conditions, we have shifted some of our supply of production from towels to bath, and that's caused part of that. Overall, I would say that the brands are moving in the right direction, not all, but we feel like we have the right plans in place and we're going to continue to make progress. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Got it. Thanks, Mike. And then a quick follow-up for both of you, just on trade promotion, Mike, I think you made a comment that the between-the-line spending was down, I believe that you said or maybe down sequentially. Just clarify on that. It's not just Kimberly-Clark's, but broadly for CPG, they continue to promotion levels are moving higher and understandably moving higher off of lower basis in the prior year.  But sort of triangulating that with the cost environment. What is sort of the logic between the CPG companies and retailers at this point to move trade promotion higher? Is there a right level? Is the normalization, we want to get back to pre -pandemic levels and if so, why? What is the sense behind that, particularly in the current environment? And then I'll pass it on. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. Can -- maybe I'll comment on the trade and Maria, maybe can comment on the between the lines. But one -- in North America, in particular, I think [Indiscernible] promotion levels have moved back to \"typical levels \". The percent -- as measured by percent promo sold on -- or percent sold on promotion was down 50 % to 75 % last year as we all curtail promotions because of demand.  At this point, I'd say it's returned to historical levels, both in Personal Care, which happened about the third quarter of last year, and then in consumer tissue, this quarter or the third quarter this year. The philosophically -- I do think retailers do believe brand [Indiscernible] occurs with brands and so promotions continue to be important our categories. There is potentially some share shifting. Frankly, my emphasis would be on the -- what I call the high road approach to growing brands, which is growing brands through great innovation and marketing. And using trade and promotion as a fundamental element of that to support what we're doing from a marketing perspective.  But I don't really value share from promotion alone. In general, we're going to be focusing on being efficient with how we spend our promotions and being disciplined about it. Especially Kevin, as you might imagine in this environment where certainly pricing and price realization is important, given what's happening with the cost front. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Thanks, Mike. Maria Henry : And then on the rest of it, just generally on between the lines for the quarter at 15.6%, that low. And the main driver of that is around incentive comp. As you can imagine with the updated forecast, the incentive payments will be meaningfully lower. And in the third quarter, we not only stepped those down, but we also had basically an accrual adjustment true-up from the first half. So there was a sizable benefit on incentive comp reflected in the third quarter.  And I will call out that we expect in the fourth quarter that the between the lines will step back up. And that's two things. We won't have the incentive comp true-up accrual, and seasonally, our SG&A runs higher in the fourth quarter than in the rest of the year. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Thank you both. It's so seemingly, Mike, it's the retailers that are driving more of this. Just not to put words in your mouth, but it seems like there's an appetite there among the retailers to normalize the categories. Is that fair? Mike Hsu : Well, I don't -- I wouldn't put it all at retailers. I think the manufacturers also rely on it as well. Maybe -- certainly my kind of attitude or philosophy for it is, I think I've said it before, I don't like to rent share through promotion. If we can use promotion to drive the trial that we want on our innovation, I'm supportive of that.  And so that's a little, but I may have a slightly different take than others, but I wouldn't lay it all at the feet of our customers. They're great partners. Our categories matter to them, and obviously, they matter a lot to us. And so it's a symbiotic relationship. Kevin Grundy : Understood. Thank you for all the color. I appreciate it. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Mike Hsu : Morning, Peter Peter Grom : Hey, good morning. Maria and Mike I just want to go back to the 2022 margin recovery, and maybe just a housekeeping one first. I'd like following up on Gary's question, the halfway through the year or maybe a little bit longer is when you [Indiscernible] margin expansion; is that year-over-year, or when you expect margins to return to more normal historical levels? And is that gross margin or operating margin?  My thought would be expansion in gross margin, but just wanted to confirm.And then this is a bit more conceptual, but I just want to understand how you think about adding back advertising next year, particularly after[Indiscernible] supplies constraint get better and gross margin improves.  Like how do you balance recovery of operating margins back to the high teens, versus reinvesting back in the business to set yourself up for growth in years to come, particularly given the lower spend you'll be cycling this year? Thanks. Taryn Miller : Sure. Peter, I'll start and then Mike can chime in. The -- next year, we will have some interesting dynamics, and it's probably going to be a bit of a tale of two-half when you look at the first half of this year and the second half of this year, that's going to drive some year-over-year comps that will have some Maria Henry : different dynamics. And as I've said, we'll have to see really how commodities play out and how pricing plays out, and I would characterize it as we'll look to recover margins over time if we are very focused on margin recovery.  And exactly when that's going to happe, I'm not prepared to say, but we'll have a lot more to say on that in January when we have three months more of visibility and three months more of additional actions that we'll take as a management , we're working through our 2022 planning cycle now.  And so, we're pulling that together. And given the volatility and the lack of visibility that we've had, it's too early to call the year, but we'll give you our best view in January. And Mike, I think you can probably comment on advertising and how you see that unfolding. Mike Hsu : Peter, we've actually increased our advertising investment significantly over the last few years and we feel good about that. And clearly, I think that's showing up in the numbers in terms of the organic growth and the overall health of the brands that we've -- as I talked about earlier on this call. So, we feel good about that.  I would say at this point, we will look to continue to build that where we're probably operating kind of in the five plus or minus range -- 5 % range of sales. It is still a little lower than our primary competitors. I would like that to be higher over time, although we probably never will match some of our competitors at the same levels they will.  But I still think we can productively invest more and make that a win-win for the brand while growing our margins at the same time. The unique thing about advertising of this -- in this environment, or as digitals unfolded is the returns are much better than they historically have been. And so we continue to improve our efficiencies, we're getting better at that. And so for us, we're going to continue to look for ways to grow the business.  And that's going to include through advertising investment. At the same time, Maria and I will also work to deliver a balanced plan that will deliver as we just mentioned, margin improvement over time, while delivering improved organic growth. Maria Henry : Thank you. Yeah, and I'd add that[Indiscernible] even outside of the advertising, and when we look at between the lines of spending, I commented earlier by embedded in there. I should note, beyond incentive compensation dynamics, we are reducing other discretionary spending, including in the kind of core of SG&A.  And at the same time we're continuing to invest primarily around IT digital types of investments and our commercial capability development, and so on the P&L you don't see the full net effect of the actions that we're taking there, because we are continuing to invest. Taryn Miller : We -- the commodity inflation ran up on us quickly. It was far in excess of what we expected in the third quarter. But we're continuing to make investments in the Company for the long term, and we're very committed to doing that, and focused on the long-term health of the Company and the brands. Peter Grom : Great. Thank you so much and best of luck. Taryn Miller : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey, guys. Mike Hsu : Hey, Steve, Steve Powers : Hey, Mike. Could you talk a little bit about [Indiscernible] savings? It just -- it's coming a little bit -- the lower end of your plan. And against the rising cost backed up, I guess, I've been sort of [Indiscernible] to think of those two numbers as positively correlated. So as cost inflation goes up, your procurement savings tend to also increase. Obviously, we're not seeing that right this moment. So is that -- what do I glean -- which I gleaned from that and in the near-term? And is it temporary that that reaccelerate \u2013 does [Indiscernible] savings reaccelerate to '22 because of timing issue or is it some kind of indication that you're starting to run out of runway on force? Taryn Miller : Sure. We're definitely not running out of runway on FORCE, and we continue to see opportunities in the supply chain, and some of the digital supply chain investments that I referenced earlier in the call will help us unlock those opportunities.  The FORCE cost savings for this year is really affected by the supply chain challenges that we've been facing, which are a headwind for our cost savings. And it's related to production and distribution inefficiencies caused by demand volatility, and also the logistics issues that we've been talking about. The way that the FORCE cost savings program works is Maria Henry : I've been negotiating material prices, a piece of it, which I'll come back and talk about in a minute. And then we have core productivity in our supply chain operations, as well as product revisions to achieve design-to-value savings.  So in the quarter, we had very good savings associated with the negotiated material prices. We also had benefits from productivity improvements and product changes, but not as much as we were hoping. And you have to net positive in terms of total delivered cost for it to count as FORCE cost savings. So as you have headwinds coming in, they offset the gross FORCE cost savings that we would report, and that's really what we're seeing now; the headwinds that are flowing through manufacturing are dampening the net results of FORCE, but there are strong gross savings there. The other issue that we thought on FORCE is, our supply chain folks are very focused on managing through this near-term environment to get product produced and to get it to customers, so it can get in the hands of consumers.  And that leaves less time for our employees to be working on productivity initiatives within the supply chain. So it's really those two things that are lowering the FORCE cost savings number for this year. But we have a healthy amount of room to go in terms of driving supply chain productivity as we move forward. Steve Powers : Got it. So playing it back. As the bottlenecks on supply chain hopefully alleviate themselves, then you have essentially some pent-up FORCE savings that just -- that should come to the surface. Maria Henry : We do, and I should go back to the other part of your question, right? There's really two pieces of those force cost savings. The negotiated material prices, our savings are much higher this year given the contract structures versus the rapid inflation on the commodity side. Those contracts get reset on a regular basis, so it will be reset at higher level. So when I look forward, I wouldn't expect as much benefit as we had this year just if you think about where we were coming into 2020 versus where commodities went, we got a sizable benefit in force there this year, so that piece of it. But on the core productivity, I would expect us to have more savings on that part of it as we move forward. Steve Powers : Perfect. And if I could pivot, we talked to incremental pricing, and like you touched upon through the views on trade and promo in the conversation with Kevin. But I was just -- I guess I was looking to think about next year and whether the path to margin recovery is really less price-focused. Or if there are sizable revenue growth management opportunities that you have around the list price, just what the balance of that is, as we start to think about just the building blocks into '22? Mike Hsu : Yeah. It's all of that. So a great question, Steve, and great perspective. I think I would share yours, which is, it's -- I think it's a balanced deployment. Obviously, this year we went with [Indiscernible] because it can be a little quicker and a little more efficient to implement for both us and our customers. T hat said, I think long-term in our categories, I would say for us, it will be a combination of list pack, right -- pack counts and pack architecture, right, and sizing, and then also promotion strategy, right? And I think all those are fertile ground for us. I've been talking about Revenue Growth Management for a couple of years now.  We're still early in the journey and getting better at it, but we have a lot of great tools globally that we're using to support our planning, and I think we're getting more and more disciplined about it. And again, I think the balance across the levers will be important for us into next year, but I think going forward. Steve Powers : Great. Thanks to you both, appreciate it. Mike Hsu : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Nik. Nik Modi : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Good morning. So Mike, just question on price elasticity, obviously things have looked pretty good, the consumer's in pretty good shape. But our stimulus fades, all that cash these consumers are sitting on starts to dwindle us into 2022.  How are you guys thinking about potential pricing and price elasticities? Just, I feel like more it's going need to happen because we all -- I think get the joke here that costs are going to continue to rise. And so I just wanted to get an understanding, do you have any strategies in place to minimize the amount of price shock that some of these consumers might feel as we get into 2022? Mike Hsu : Yeah. Nik, hey. I was just talking about what, Steve, again, I think we've invested a lot of tools and so at this point, I think our elasticity modeling is pretty good, fairly accurate. I would say, given our categories, Nik, that the elasticity tends to be a little less when realized than what predicted just because if you look at these bath tissue, the consumption doesn't change that much. Maybe the value tier you purchased that may shift a little bit.  And so there is that dynamic, but we are sensitive toward that and it's also what's core in our strategy, is developing a great value proposition to our consumer. And so we're always cognizant of that. And I think one of the things that we've done in many markets around the world is offer a great proposition on both the value side and also the premium side. And while our strategy generally is to elevate our categories and expand our categories, I do think pricing on our categories, where the premiumization of our categories a little less than some of the others that I worked in the past.  So I still think there's a room to grow. However, we want to be able to shift. And that's we've done in a market like Latin America. And one of the reasons why we've grown share this year is because we've been able to pivot between our premium tier and our value tier. For reference, two years ago, we were making a student body left to go premium and we shifted a significant portion of our mix in Brazil from value to premium.  And over the past 18 months, we've been shifting it back the other way because that's what the consumer needs. And so we're really cognizant of that, we're aware of the elasticities. Thus far, I would say, our volumes have held up, although I think what's really happening is we're seeing the intended elasticity, but we do have brand growth initiatives that are offsetting some elasticity impact. Nik Modi : Great. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Mike Hsu : All right. Thanks, Nik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Mike Hsu : Morning, Jason. Jason English : Hey, morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. Two questions. First is to follow-up for clarification. I thought Dara asked when you expect price and cost to be effectively net neutral, not when -- I don't think he asked when do you expect margins [Indiscernible] I think most of the answers have been around margin recovery, but so can you clarify -- you're not expecting price to be caught up with costs until the back half of the next year or not even? Like even that's too optimistic. It's somewhere beyond the midpoint of next year when price actually catches up with costs ceteris paribus. Taryn Miller : I think we'll hold on the 2022 comments until we get to January, and then we'll have more to say about that. Once we have three months more visibility into what's happening in the commodity market, what's happening with price that's either in the market or will be in the market, and we'll give you our best view there.I don't think it's productive to speculate on that right at this point, given the volatility. Jason English : Yeah. I'm just trying to get you to tell me what you actually said because I think I've heard like 2 different explanations on next year. So if you actually said a lot in 2022, I'm just looking for clarification on what you actually did say. But I appreciate if you don't want to add more. Pivoting back to just the core business then, good momentum on Personal Care. You're getting the price, your market shares are holding up, the business is turn back to the degree of profit growth. All pretty encouraging, but the tissue business looks very different, especially on the margin degradation side and the lack of price momentum. Can you elaborate on what's holding you back on price? What actions have you taken? What is in market now and why are we not seeing more momentum on price so far? Mike Hsu : Again, I think what you see in our Personal Care, we did move very early on when we had our commodity forecast update in the first quarter, and so we did move on that. At the time, I think the tissue side or the fiber side was less clear. And so I would say we probably moved a little slower on the tissue side. We haven't announced some broad pricing actions in multiple markets since then. And so that's why I said earlier, Jason, that I would expect our tissue price realization to continue to improve as the year progresses. Jason English : Have you raised prices in the U.S., in tissue. Mike Hsu : We announced some price changes in August with our retailers. Jason English : Got it. Thank you.[Indiscernible] Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I have two questions. One is a follow-up on the supply chain disruptions. Looking ahead on availability of raw materials, interest rotation lines, I believe those will linger into the first-half of 2022, setting aside the pricing commentary that you may not be ready to -- just in terms of availability of raw materials and transportation.  And then, a second one on the category growth between track and on track channels. [Indiscernible] you just see breaks growing faster than e-commerce because of the tough comparisons in the quarter? And do you see the share issues that you alluded to in North America mostly due to the fact that your competitors took longer to take pricing, or is that more of a availability issue? Thank you. Taryn Miller : I'll start with supply chain disruptions. I didn't see a near-term catalyst for them improving. I think the labor issues in the U.S. are very real, and that's where we're feeling the [Indiscernible] of the challenges on the supply chain side. More globally, I mentioned the U.K. market, but also with global shipping, those issues are also quite challenging in a number of our Maria Henry : markets. But the most acute issues and meaningful cost increases versus what we had been expecting is in North America, and that the labor market in the U.S., I just don't see a near-term catalyst, so I think the headwinds and the increased distribution costs will certainly be with us into 2022, and we'll have to see all of this plays out. It's not just affecting us, of course, it's affecting companies quite broadly, and we're we're all dealing with these challenges. And then, Mike, on category and share, I'll turn that one over to you. Mike Hsu : Yeah, Andrea. Yeah. Again, online continues to perform very well for us, and then on-track as well. And so I think that's probably why there's probably discrepancy in our view of our market share performance, which we see as a little stronger than maybe what you might see. And so overall, we feel very good about that and the category growth, actually in both channels and I think our brands are performing well.  The issue that we've had on share, a couple of different areas. In North America, it's primarily been an issue around supply. And so even though we've made substantial improvement in our fulfillment throughout the course of the year, we're still not meeting all orders out there. And so our share's still a little light from that dimension.  And then in a couple other markets, again, I think it is, as you point out, maybe some relative price indices that have expanded a little bit in the short-term. We have moved on pricing in most markets. And while we've generally seen moves from branded competition, we haven't seen that in all markets. And so there's still a little softness we're experiencing in Western Europe and in some markets in Latin America. Andrea Teixeira : And Mike, just to -- and I appreciate you both, but just on the track channels and non-track e-commerce, how much it grew this quarter vis - \u00e0 - vis last year, and how much it represents now globally. [Indiscernible] you have the [Indiscernible] number, it would be helpful. Mike Hsu : Yes. Overall, globally, we're probably in the mid-to-high [Indiscernible] at this point. I don't have the growth rate offhand, but it -- yeah, in the -- double -- strong double-digits is what I would say. Andrea Teixeira : On top of [Indiscernible] -- I would just [Indiscernible] also very strong performance last year. Or last year, you could have -- Mike Hsu : Strong performance last year. Right. With the great news being our fastest grower was our biggest market. So that was good last year. And so, again, online continues to be important and increasingly important. And we're operating very well there. Andrea Teixeira : Okay. Great. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no more questions at this time. Mike Hsu : Okay. Well, thank you all for taking the time to be with us today. We're working hard to drive sustainable brand growth and taking further action to ensure that we improve our margins and earnings profile. So thank you all. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce today\u2019s first presenter, Taryn Miller. Taryn Miller : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark\u2019s year end earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Mike Hsu, our Chairman and CEO and Maria Henry, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings news release and we also published prepared remarks from Mike and Maria that summarize our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Both documents are available in the Investors section of our website. We hope you find it valuable to have our prepared remarks ahead of this call. In just a moment, Mike will share a few opening comments and then we\u2019ll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We may also refer to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning\u2019s news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to your questions, I\u2019d like to offer some perspective on our results and outlook. In 2021, we continue to execute our strategy to elevate our categories and expand our markets. While our overall financial results were disappointing, we took decisive action to offset the impact of higher costs with significant pricing actions. These actions, which began in the first half, helped us deliver organic sales growth and improved net selling prices in the second half of the year, including strong fourth quarter performance. We continue to make significant progress accelerating organic growth in personal care. Through the year, our team launched strong innovation and support it with superior local market execution, all of which contributed to strong share gains in numerous key markets. We also strengthened market positions in several important growth markets, by integrating Softex in Indonesia, commissioning a state-of-the-art production facility in Nigeria, and advancing our route to market in India. While we are encouraged with our top line performance and the way our teams executed in a very dynamic environment, our margins and earnings were negatively impacted by a challenging operating environment. Input costs escalated well beyond previous levels and supply chain disruptions limited our ability to fully meet the growing consumer demand for our products. In 2022, we intend to accelerate organic growth further. We have strong brands and healthy categories. We will continue to support our brands with breakthrough innovation, agile digital and superior local market execution. We also expect performance in our tissue businesses to improve as we cycle the volatility and demand we have experienced over the past 2 years. We are committed to recovering and eventually expanding our margins and we expect to make progress this year. We have taken significant pricing actions and expect pricing to offset a majority of the impact of cost inflation. We are confident in our ability to restore our margins to pre-pandemic levels over time. We remain confident in the potential of our brands and categories and in our ability to create meaningful shareholder value, while we work to achieve our purpose of Better Care for a Better World. Now, we would be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Chris. Chris Carey : Can you just, maybe to start, just help frame the volume impact that you are expecting from the price hikes? I guess based on your comments around pricing that\u2019s going to cover the majority of inflation, it seems like you are suggesting maybe 4% to 5% range on pricing, maybe volumes down about 1%. Is that fair? And then maybe where you expect the volume hit to play out? Clearly, there is some momentum in Personal Care. Consumer Tissue is coming off of a year where comps shouldn\u2019t really be too much of an issue. I wonder if you can just dimensionalize that comment around pricing versus volumes and how you are seeing it play out and whether you could see some upside if elasticity stay where they are? Mike Hsu : Yes. I think that\u2019s a good push, Chris. And I think that\u2019s right, which is overall, we feel good about the momentum of our business overall. Personal Care, for sure, strong performance and we are expecting that performance to continue. We have got great innovation coming and great brand support throughout the year on both our Consumer Tissue and our Personal Care businesses. And so I think we feel good about the commercial programming. That said there is significant pricing in the plan. And so there will be an elasticity impact, which we have estimated. So, we have volume down a little bit, offsetting some of the organic growth that\u2019s being driven by the commercial programming. And so the reality is, thus far, I would say the categories \u2013 our categories are essential. And I think the demand that we saw in the fourth quarter kind of highlights the essential nature of our categories. And despite the price increases, we are seeing good volume performance. And so I\u2019d love to see that our elasticity assumptions are a little conservative and potentially, there could be a little upside. Generally, in our categories, if the other \u2013 if the market moves in the direction, generally elasticities are a little lower. Chris Carey : Okay. And just \u2013 yes, yes, no, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Just one follow-up on the outlook for input cost inflation, I think maybe that\u2019s part of the surprise today. Can you just maybe dimensionalize the significance of distribution of energy? You called out polymer-based materials, I guess pulp is secondarily \u2013 is a secondary impact relative to those. But can you just frame the relative impact of these and whether again the line of sight or whether you are just taking a bit more of a conservative view, cognizant of what you said in the prepared remarks, that visibility is a bit lower in this environment? So thanks for that. Maria Henry : Sure, Chris. Let me spend a minute on our inflation outlook for 2022. As you just mentioned, it continues to have volatility around it. For perspective, if we had given you our outlook on the October call, we would have been $300 million lower than the outlook that we are providing today. So, it\u2019s been quite volatile. And we are kind of calling it at a tough part of the cycle, hence, the range around it. But let me talk about what we see. Approximately half of the inflation for 2022 is expected to come from distribution and energy. And then of the raw material components, the inflation will be led by polymer-based purchase materials. So, things like superabsorbent and non-wovens and then followed by pulp. And so, let me just spend a minute on the two areas that will make up our commodity inflation. Number one is what happens with market prices and I will give you a little more detail there in a minute. But the second one is how inflation \u2013 commodity inflation flows through our P&L. And as you know, we use contract structures to manage some of the volatility on commodities and some of those contracts reset in the beginning of the year. So, they reset at higher prices this year. And then some of them also have some timing lag built in. So, some of the high inflation that you\u2019d see in the market in the fourth quarter will flow through our P&L in the early part of 2022. But that said, on the market prices, I will tell you what we are seeing. So, the market price in North America for eucalyptus will be down. The market price for softwood, we are expecting to be down in a similar amount to eucalyptus. And the full year average polypropylene prices will also be down for market pricing in 2022. So, those are the things you hear us talk about the most. But since the inflation is coming from other areas in 2022, let me comment on market pricing that we expect to be up. Fluff pulp, we expect to be up; recycled fiber, expect to be up; non-wovens, expect to be up; superabsorbent, up sizably next year; distribution, up; and energy, up. So, the basket of commodities, well, the traditional ones, thankfully, we expect to be coming down and we are already seeing that in the fourth quarter. There is meaningful portion of our basket that the market prices will be up on in 2022 and that\u2019s what\u2019s reflected in the outlook that we provided. Mike Hsu : Yes. So Chris, maybe I will just tack on. I mean historically, what we see is a quick reversion in our commodities, like typically, in 2018, right, the big driver of our increase was pulp. And so that quickly receded in 2019 and 2020 to some extent. And so that\u2019s typically we will see in our categories. We will see reversion. It always happens in our categories. And so I expect \u2013 fully expect over time pulp to come down and the resin-based, whether it\u2019s super board absorbents or non-wovens to come back down. But this cycle is a little different, because the peak is higher, it\u2019s broader and it\u2019s longer. And so regardless of what\u2019s happening with the cycle, we are going to restore our margins with both price and cost initiatives. And we expect our teams to cover the majority of inflation with pricing. So, that\u2019s part one. If we get a little more reversion, we are not expecting reversion this year. And if we do, then our recovery will be a little bit faster. That said there will be reversion at some point. But given the call and I think what\u2019s maybe a little confusing to maybe some of the analysts and investors, as Maria mentioned, it\u2019s a broader set of inflationary impacts than we typically talk about, which is typically \u2013 and energy is a big one. And labor and freight are big ones that we typically haven\u2019t talked about in the past, but are big ones for this year. Chris Carey : Okay. Thanks so much for all that perspective. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Hi, I wanted a little bit about pricing. In the release, there was a mention of \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I meant the \u2013 sorry, in the prepared remarks in the release, but about some incremental pricing. So simplistic question, are there new price increases that have been announced that we should expect to start flowing through? But then perhaps more interestingly, I was curious about the ability to price for energy, for logistics and then also for the fact that contracts are resetting higher. Because I was just wondering, is it more difficult if market pricing is down, so that what your customers see is a better relatively speaking, better environment, but you are talking about your contracts resetting higher and that being part of the difficulty here? Is it more difficult to get incremental pricing through and that\u2019s kind of the construct driving inflation? Mike Hsu : Yes. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, couple of things. One, we have executed multiple rounds of pricing. And I would say globally and generally, our pricing is on track. We announced \u2013 I\u2019ll just give you an example in North America. I think we announced in March, in August, in November and then I think we may have had another announcement in December as well. So there has been multiple rounds. I will tell you \u2013 and that\u2019s happened globally in most markets around the world for us. I will tell you, in most markets, the trade discussions have generally been very constructive. I think our customers are seeing the same things happen. Especially, as you mentioned in some of these other areas, they are more affected by freight and distribution and some of those things than we are since it\u2019s a bigger component of their P&Ls. So I would say the discussions have generally been constructive. We have seen some movement in other brands and some movement in private labels. There is a little stickiness in some markets like in Western Europe and Latin America for us. But as I mentioned to Chris, the consumer demand reflects the essential nature of our categories. And so we expect to make progress on pricing. We expect to make progress on recovering our margins. And as a principle, I would say we are expecting our teams to be able to price to offset the majority of the inflation. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then just one other question I had was on cost savings. Restructuring is complete and now ongoing for savings. The fourth forecast of $300 million to $350 million is a little bit low by recent standards. And I know also in the prepared remarks in the release, you mentioned less savings on the negotiated raw material prices. But I think one thing we talked about last quarter and I talked with other companies is sort of the difficulty of achieving typical run-rate productivity in a constrained environment, whether it\u2019s because of labor, access to the plants with COVID and absenteeism challenges throughout the supply chain. So, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on that on the absolute level of FORCE savings for this year? And just if these sorts of impediments are part of why the number might be a little bit lower than you might typically target in such a deeply inflationary environment? Maria Henry : Yes. Lauren, you are spot on with what you are hearing from other companies. It\u2019s the same thing that we are seeing within our FORCE cost savings, the negotiated material price component will be down meaningfully. If you think about the benefit of our contracts in 2021 was significant as those reset as we move forward, that\u2019s less of a benefit for us in 2022, but we do still expect to see benefits from product changes and from ongoing productivity improvements. The other line that\u2019s in our FORCE cost savings is distribution. So under normal circumstances, we would be driving productivity in distribution expenses every year. Those are going the other way right now. The distribution costs are up meaningfully and they will continue to be is our expectation in 2022. And then, as you said, given what\u2019s happening in the supply chain where our demand is exceeding our ability to supply at the moment, taking any downtime on any of our machines is very punitive. And so finding the time to do the work to drive the savings is a bit challenged and that\u2019s really what\u2019s behind the range. I will say that the team kicked off a program in 2021 to really look at the multiyear pipeline that we have around FORCE cost savings. And we have better visibility today than we have ever had in terms of what those opportunities are and how we need to \u2013 how we can unlock those. And that includes some investment behind the supply chain that you see showing up in other areas of the P&L. But we have never had better visibility to what those opportunities are and they continue to be meaningful for the company. And as things \u2013 when things normalize around supply chain, we will be able to drive a higher number on that FORCE cost savings line. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks so much. I will pass it on. Mike Hsu : Great. Thank you, Lauren. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Steve. Steve Powers : Yes, hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe a little more clarity and color around your guidance, I guess, from two perspectives. First is, in the first quarter, your prepared remarks suggests incremental difficulty in that first quarter with a sequential decline in earnings. I would think you might have some room for sequential acceleration on revenue even with a higher FX burden. So I am guessing that incremental pressure is coming from cost pressure and margin pressure, but just again, maybe you can dimensionalize that? And I want to juxtapose that against your \u2013 the strategic ambition to restore margins. And I am really curious as to where you think you can get to on that objective by year end. So I guess I am trying to get a little bit more depiction in my mind about what the kind of improvement curve looks like throughout the year as you slide south in 1Q and then build back, trying to get a sense of where you think the exit rate is in \u201822 with the base case? Maria Henry : Sure. I will start and then Mike will add some comments. But let me address the first quarter first. We usually don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. And even when you push us to do so, we generally don\u2019t do it. But I think it\u2019s very important to understand what we think is happening in this quarter, because we do expect that our earnings will be lower than they were in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s driven by a few things. One, the commodity pressure will continue to be intense and inflation in the first quarter will be high. The pricing isn\u2019t fully in, in the fourth quarter. And then we are in the midst of pretty acute supply chain disruption caused by Omicron. So \u2013 but we are seeing, as our other companies and as our suppliers and as are our customers, but we are seeing higher absentee rates, which is stressing our ability to fulfill the demand that we see and get the products manufactured and get them to the customers and the customers to get them on shelf. So that is all happening live right now. And so we\u2019re calling the year at a very challenging time to call the year given the amount of volatility right at this moment. And then as I look at 2022 in total, we\u2019re expecting stronger second half earnings, and we are expecting a ramp, what\u2019s causing the ramp. Some commodity costs are expected to ease. And while I talked a bit about contract structures and other things, we also have exposure to the spot market on commodities. So we are expecting commodities to ease. And then as you know, just on comparisons, of the $1.5 billion inflation that we saw in 2021, $1 billion of that came in the second half. And so if you\u2019re looking year-over-year, you got an easier lap in the second half. The other thing is we expect the pricing that we currently see to be fully in the market in the second half and then our cost savings also ramp as we go through the year. So those are the factors that drive the ramp. We are very focused on our margin recovery, recognizing what the $1.5 billion of inflation from last year and then the added inflation this year does to the margin structure. We are very focused on recovering the margins of this business to pre pandemic levels and then expanding them over time. We expect to make progress on that as we go through this year. Again, we\u2019re calling the year in a very difficult part of the cycle. So when I look here today and say, this is what our fourth quarter is going to look like, there is some volatility around that. So that said, with our current assumptions, we will make progress on the margin recovery through the year after the first quarter. And we would expect to be in a better place by the time we exit this year and moving forward. But Mike, if you\u2019ve got some comments? Mike Hsu : Well, yes, great question, Steve. Let me hit \u2013 there is really three strategic imperatives for us as a management team. I mean number one is we got to accelerate organic growth. And you can see all the work we\u2019ve been doing the last several years doing that, and I think we\u2019re making progress. And we expect our tissue businesses to improve now that we cycled a lot of the COVID demand volatility. So that\u2019s part one. Part two, we\u2019ve got to enhance margins. And so I\u2019ll come back to that in a second. And part three is I want to reduce our earnings volatility. Obviously, with this volatile environment, I\u2019m not going to talk much about that. But just you should know that we\u2019ve got smart people working on that because I recognize that\u2019s a strategic issue for the company, and we do want to reduce our earnings volatility over time. On the margins, my goal is to enhance margins over time over the long-term. And that\u2019s kind of the basis of our Elevate and Expand strategies. The reasons why we want to elevate our categories and expand our markets is to do that. That\u2019s a core component of it. I will say given the fact that we\u2019ve taken on last year I think 2x our previous all-time high in inflation, obviously, our margin has taken a substantial hit. And we\u2019re very focused on the near-term on margin recovery. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to give you specific timing, but here\u2019s what I will say is that I\u2019m targeting for us to deliver in the upper end of our range, and I expect our teams to perform that way. And if our assumptions coming into the year hold then we will have by year end delivered a substantial improvement in our gross margin performance over the course of the year. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about it. And then if we get a little reversion in the commodities, then that will accelerate that further. Steve Powers : Okay, thank you. I mean I appreciate the difficulty of trying to call the full year at this point, so thank you for that color. I guess maybe, Mike, a little bit, just if I could... Mike Hsu : I think \u2013 so just the point on that is the one point I would make is the COVID environment while I would say the demand environment has kind of stabilized, particularly in our tissue businesses, both KCP and Consumer Tissue, as Maria talks about, the supply environment is probably more volatile now than we\u2019ve seen throughout the whole COVID period, right? Because it\u2019s affecting absenteeism, whether it\u2019s in the distribution centers of the plants or our suppliers and missed deployments on pickup, so it\u2019s a very volatile environment. I think you\u2019re seeing that more broadly as you kind of look at other industries. Steve Powers : Yes, for sure. I think we will continue to hear more about that in the coming days and weeks. Just on that demand environment, Mike, if I could, just \u2013 I think you gave us some good color in the conversation with Chris about how you\u2019re thinking about volumes and reaction to the pricing this year. But I guess I\u2019m curious as to how your \u2013 the underlying elasticity assumptions compare with historical elasticity, just how you approach coming to that conclusion? And just again, sort of what the basis for your assumed the last year\u2019s and where maybe you\u2019re expecting more versus less? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes. Tough question because the trick of the elasticity modeling is we\u2019re beyond the range of estimation. So that\u2019s the difficult part of it, Steve. And so you\u2019re kind of estimating what\u2019s happened historically and the price points are higher than they have been. That said, our past experience is, in our last round of pricing, elasticities have come back. The market generally moved in a direction, and elasticities were a little less than we initially estimated, and that\u2019s been our kind of recent history. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going on. I think the important thing is we\u2019ve got a very strong growth playbook. It\u2019s working hard. We\u2019ve gotten very good commercial programming across both our professional and consumer businesses. And so there is really good underlying brand momentum. And so we expect that to continue. And we recognize that we are putting significant pricing out there. And \u2013 but I think as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re seeing the impact of the essential nature of our categories. Steve Powers : Okay. Very good. Thank you so much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Mike Hsu : Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Good morning, everyone. Hi, Mike and Maria. A question for Maria, I think, on the outlook first and then I have a follow-up, which is the guidance and how you pulled it together, Maria, how would you characterize the level of conservatism in the outlook? Or I guess said differently, just given the volatility and sort of the unprecedented cost pressure, and I\u2019m not asking you to review at all the earlier question on what\u2019s embedded around commodities and input costs, but have you built in sort of additional cushion than you typically would just given the volatility and how challenging \u201821 was and the number of downward revisions [Technical Difficulty] built in than you typically would. Investors can get some level of comfort as best as we can in this environment that this is hopefully sort of a low point? Maria Henry : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. You can imagine, we spent considerable time getting arms around our own plans for calendar 2022 and what we\u2019re going to hold ourselves accountable from an internal plan standpoint. And as we reviewed that and as we pulled together our internal plan, what I would tell you is at this point in time, here in the middle of January, it\u2019s tilted more toward risk. And for all the reasons we talked about, and I won\u2019t repeat them, it is tilted more toward risk. And so that\u2019s how we put the guidance range together. So we\u2019ve got our internal plan, which is what all of our teams are focused on either delivering or beating. And then looking at the risks and opportunities, it is tilted to risk and that\u2019s what we used to influence our guidance range, if that\u2019s helpful. Kevin Grundy : That is helpful. And just sticking with that for a moment, I guess the area which was a little bit surprising to me, I guess, like where our model was the level of OpEx inflation. I think there is been a great deal of time around modeling COGS and gross margins for all the reasons that we know. But I think the level of OpEx inflation was also a little bit surprising. So maybe just, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, and then I\u2019ll pass it on, spend a moment on that. And how much is sort of fixed versus variable sort of if need be, there is an opportunity to sort of tighten a little bit and pull on the string to offset further inflation that\u2019s not currently anticipated? Maria Henry : Yes. I think it\u2019s a very important area to talk about. So we are continuing to invest in our business. We are bullish about our long-term prospects. And we think the investments that we have been making and that we\u2019ve ramped up over the last several years since we kicked off K-C 2022 strategy are paying off. They are working. And so we talked about advertising and what we\u2019re doing to support the brands with effective marketing. But those investments go beyond just advertising. We\u2019ve talked lot about investing in our commercial capabilities. And we\u2019re going to continue to do those things because they are working and they are paying off and the ROIs are there. And it\u2019s those investments that are helping us have meaningful growth in \u2013 especially in our Personal Care segment of the business, when we look at 2022 versus 2021, we\u2019ve also talked about the benefit that we had in our between-the-line spending in 2021 due to lower variable compensation expense that normalizes for 2022. And the last area I\u2019d comment there on between the lines and investments is we\u2019re also making a few, what I would call, foundational investments. And we\u2019re very committed to those as we think that they are very meaningful to the long-term health of the company. First, we\u2019re opening our North America commercial center in Chicago this spring, which we\u2019re very excited about. And our North America team is handling that transition quite well. And early signs are very positive, but it is an investment. And the other one I would call out that I mentioned before is we are \u2013 we did start our program to upgrade SAP to S/4HANA. We began that last year. That ramps up even more in 2022. And that investment is showing up both in the P&L as well as in our capital expenditures. So we\u2019re sticking with the investments that we know are working and that are fueling the top line. We\u2019ve got some foundational investments. And then we have some expenses that were lower in \u201821, that will step up in 2022 around employee cost. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s behind it. Mike? Mike Hsu : No, just important \u2013 they are important investments. The SAP, obviously, that investment is going to fuel our cost savings for the future, too. And so we feel very good about those. And we\u2019re going to continue to be very disciplined about our spending. But we feel like we\u2019re making the right investments for the long-term health of the brands and also for the organizational health. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Thank you both. That\u2019s great color. Good luck. Maria Henry : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. So my question, Mike and, I guess, Maria, if you \u2013 if we should expect nominal pricing to be in the mid- to high-single digits when it\u2019s all said and done at the mid-positive range or pretty much whether you\u2019re expecting for sales on the three to four in nominal? And in that case, it implies that probably you\u2019re getting additional pricing in the spring with that. And I just want to confirm that because you did imply, obviously, FX being a negative and then negative volumes. And then related to that, are you seeing private label getting some \u2013 I mean some of the categories obviously had a lot of shelf space during the pandemic. But some of the other categories do not. So I was thinking, are you seeing private label, in particular, in diapers coming back as we go into that? And that is what is informing you not only about demand elasticity, but also in terms of availability of the product that you may want to embrace for some private label concessions here? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes. Just on the pricing, Andrea, I would expect over the course of the year, mid to high single-digit increases on pricing. And that could vary a little bit based on conditions. But again, that\u2019s kind of what we are marching against. And thus far, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve executed multiple actions, and they are generally on track. And so we feel good about that progress. And obviously, we\u2019re keeping a close eye on that. In terms of private label, I think \u2013 and maybe I\u2019ll talk to North America differently. I\u2019d still say private label is still down in most categories. I think it was up a little bit in bath tissue, but down in most of the other categories. It\u2019s something we\u2019re going to continue to be very focused on. But we\u2019re very pleased with our brand momentum. And I think although we\u2019re making progress in organic in North America, some of that\u2019s still muted because we\u2019re still working through supply challenges. As you recall, we had significant challenges in the first half because of the storm down here in Texas. We recovered very well from that. And so really saw our service levels improve throughout the course of the year. But I\u2019d say even in the fourth quarter, we \u2013 as Maria mentioned, we under-shipped demand because we\u2019re having difficulty getting carriers or getting supplies and all the other things that are associated with what\u2019s happening with Omicron and COVID. And so again, we\u2019re keeping a sharp eye on private label, but we\u2019re really focused on driving our business, and we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making. Andrea Teixeira : And in terms of like when you said mid-single digits on top of like low-single digit, call it, three to four you already implemented, is that the way we should be thinking? But in total, between 2021 and 2022, you are going to hit high single digit price increase? Is that the way to think? Mike Hsu : Yes, in general. Again, yes, we \u2013 again, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve made multiple rounds. And if you could go back and look at our kind of maybe what\u2019s happened in pricing in North America already, pretty significant moves. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Great. I will pass it on. Thank you so much. Mike Hsu : Alright. Thank you, Andrea. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, guys. Good morning. So just to follow-up on Andrea\u2019s question, can you give us a little more granularity on what product categories and geographies incremental pricing that\u2019s coming in 2022 will be focused on? Is it more just sort of across the board in everything? Are there specific areas where there is more aggressive pricing posture, again, in terms of the incremental increases in 2022? And then given a lot of these categories we\u2019re talking about multiple times that you take incremental pricing, can you just talk about your experience historically when you\u2019ve been in situations where there is multiple rounds and how the elasticity might be different than in situations where you\u2019ve just had one round of price increases has been necessary. Mike Hsu : Hey, Dara, yes, just as a policy, though, I\u2019ll just clarify. I\u2019ll talk about the pricing we\u2019ve implemented. I will not talk about any future pricing actions. Although I\u2019ll say, I take as an approach, I do expect pricing to offset a significant portion of inflation. So that\u2019s just kind of a principle that I\u2019ll kind of put out there. But I\u2019ll talk about what\u2019s already occurred, and I\u2019ll focus on North America as a starting point. We announced mid to high single-digit increases in March, largely in our Personal Care business in North America, but in about 60% of our consumer business last March. We took some further action primarily in tissue on count back in August, and that was effective this quarter. And then we took additional actions that were announced in Q4, generally about a mid-single-digit list increase across most of North American consumers. So that kind of should give you a sense of kind of what\u2019s been happening in the marketplace, at least in North America. I would say, in international market, similar, multiple rounds in Europe, multiple rounds, in some cases, monthly in Latin America, unfortunately and of course, in Asia as well. So it\u2019s pretty extensive. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And it sounds like it\u2019s generally broadly across the board. I don\u2019t know if you want to \u2013 it sounds like you don\u2019t want to get into too much specifics. But generally, we\u2019re expecting pretty broad increases in 2022 incrementally. Is that fair? Mike Hsu : Well, yes, I think that\u2019s the case. And we\u2019re expecting that the pricing that we have in the flow through substantively. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And then on the margin side, the comments about returning to pre pandemic levels over time, can you just be a bit more specific on the timing of that? Is that possible at some point in calendar \u201823 or is that more of a far out multiyear goal? How do you think about that? And also, does it require cost levels to come back down, or is it realistic if you are at current cost levels in terms of ability to recover fully through pricing offsets over time? Maria Henry : Yes. Dara, I am not going to give a specific timeframe. And I would say that the driver of that is really the volatility around the factors that are causing the margin to be depressed in the first place. And it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s too hard to call beyond 2022. What I can tell you though is that I am very confident that we will take \u2013 we are taking and we will take the right actions to recover the margins of the business, whatever that looks like. So, we have shared with you what our assumptions are for 2022 in terms of all of the moving pieces. And if it turns out to be different than that, if there turns out to be upside, that\u2019s great for all of us. If it turns out that the environment is rougher than what we are thinking, we will take the right action. So, if inflation continues to run, we will continue to price. We will continually look at the cost structure of the business and take the right actions. But I can\u2019t, today, give you the exact timing of when we will have the margin structure where it was in 2019 before the pandemic began. The other thing that I will comment on when we think about that and the actions and kind of managing through that, going back a bit to what Kevin was probing on in terms of the cost structure, this is probably the right time to call out. We did wrap up the Global Restructuring Program that we kicked off in 2018. And we successfully delivered that with annualized savings of $560 million, 40% of those accrue to between the lines. So, when you look at our cost structure today outside of the supply chain, we really did restructure the between-the-line spending of the company. We took almost 200 basis points out. And then we invested back in the areas where we will have competitive advantage and differentiating capabilities. So, when I look at the cost structure between the lines today, we are in good shape, and we actually benchmark in the top quartile in terms of between-the-line cost structure. So, feel good about where we are and that we are optimized and we are investing in places that have high ROI. So, I do want to call that out as the environment changes over time, that part of the P&L I feel good about. Mike Hsu : Hi Dara, the other thing I will add is the fundamentals would suggest in our core commodities, there is going to be reversion. But I do not want our teams waiting for commodities to come down to drive margin recovery. And so our plan is to work to recover margins. And then if the commodities \u2013 when they do revert, then that will affect \u2013 that will change the timing and hopefully move it up. Dara Mohsenian : That\u2019s it all for me. Thanks guys. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Dara. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Mike Hsu : Good morning Jason. Jason English : Hi. Good morning folks. Thanks for squeezing me in. And Happy New Year, I still think January, right. Mike Hsu : Chinese New Year time, so. Jason English : You got a big Chinese business too, so there we go. A quick question for clarification, in response to an earlier question, I think many people will have interpreted your comments to suggest that you expect to realize around 5% plus pricing this year. But many times throughout the call, you have suggested that you expect prices to lag inflation and have a price cost deficit. If you got 5% flowing through the P&L, that would be almost $1 billion and would eclipse your cost inflation. So, can you clarify what seem to be two conflicting comments? Maria Henry : Yes. I think that the numbers that you quoted are right. And when I look at currency, commodity price for 2022, that should be about even for 2022. The margin story is that, that was not even in 2021, given the $1.5 billion of inflation that we saw. It was, I think, it\u2019s about a 30% drag to operating profit growth in \u201821. So, while it\u2019s even for 2022, we haven\u2019t yet recovered the impact from the spike in inflation in 2021, Jason, if that\u2019s helpful. Jason English : Sure. No, it\u2019s really helpful. Because I think you said you expect to offset the majority of cost inflation next year, and you said it many times. But the reality is you expect price to offset not just all the cost inflation, but most of currency, which is I think just a different conclusion. Then to get down to your numbers, you really have to take an act to volume if you are going to get that much price. So, I guess my question is, where is the \u2013 where are you expecting volume to fall short, because you are telling us that you under-shipped this year. So, at some point, hopefully, you catch up and we replenish. We catch up on some of that, so you get a benefit. Professional, I think is still tracking down 16% to 17% biometrically to pre-COVID levels. I imagine that\u2019s going to be a pretty strong tailwind. Tell me if it\u2019s not. So, where is the big offset? Mike Hsu : Well, again, I think the key \u2013 here is a couple of things. And I think you are right, Jason. I think we are expecting improved performance and growth in both consumer tissue business and the professional business. I think on professional, though, I would not expect a snap back, right. Because I think what has done is stabilized at a lower level. We are running below, about 85% \u2013 our washroom business is running at about 85% of what they had done pre-pandemic. And that\u2019s because \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you are in your office, but we haven\u2019t seen a full scale return to offices, and I don\u2019t expect that in the near-term. We haven\u2019t seen a full-scale return to travel, especially business travel. And I don\u2019t think we are expecting that in the near-term. And so I think we are dealing with a professional business that\u2019s going to grow. And we are pretty excited about the growth plans that we have this year, the innovation and the commercial trends we have in the business this year. But it\u2019s not going to revert to pre-pandemic levels this year at least. And so that\u2019s part one. Consumer tissue, same thing. And I think there has been a lot of volatility in the last couple of years, driven by consumer stock up and then destocking and so forth. When it all shakes out, it\u2019s a very stable business, probably one of the most stable businesses in consumer. And in the last couple of years, a 2-year stack of our fourth quarter would be plus 3, right. And so we are expecting solid growth in consumer tissue. And then our personal care business globally is doing very, very well, as you can see in the fourth quarter, being up double digits. And we are expecting continued growth there. The offset really from us is we are pushing prices at a pretty high level. And so that\u2019s going to have an effect. And we hope that our elasticity assumptions prove out to be a little conservative. Jason English : Yes. I am going to try to squeeze one more real quick. Share repo, you effectively paused it back half of the year. You are guiding down free cash flow for next year. When should we expect to see you back in the market buyback stock? Maria Henry : Yes. As soon as we have got the excess cash flow that will allow us to do it, so again, we are in the tough part of the cycle here in terms of capital allocation. Nothing on capital allocation, how we think about it has changed. And those steps are invest in the business, look to grow the dividend, which I am pleased to say we will do again for the 50th consecutive year. And then beyond that, with the remaining cash flow, we are always looking at M&A. But assuming there is nothing there, then it goes to share buybacks. So, when the margins recover \u2013 let me start at the top, right. We are expecting strong top line growth in our business. We are expecting the margins to recover. And when those two things happen, we will get back to the cash generation levels that will enable us to do share repurchases. So, we are committed to shareholder-friendly capital allocation practices as we have done in the past. And we are at about \u2013 I think we finished with leverage at 2.3x, excluding restructuring. That\u2019s ahead of kind of the 2.0 that the agencies like to see for the single A rating. And we do remain committed to the single A rating. So, at this point in time, the way the numbers line up, we don\u2019t have the cash within the rating to do buybacks, but I very much look forward to being able to get back to doing so. Jason English : Understood. Thank you all. Bye. Mike Hsu : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Mike Hsu : Good morning Peter. Peter Grom : Hi, good morning everyone. Hi, good morning guys. So, just a quick follow-up on Steve\u2019s question, I know you don\u2019t want to give a specific timeframe, but I just want to get some clarification around the comment, which I think was significant gross margin progress in 4Q. Is that simply just margin expansion, or should we read that comment as a suggestion that the fourth quarter is really when you expect to see margins return closer to those pre-pandemic levels? Maria Henry : Yes. I think we do expect gross margin progress versus pre-pandemic level to happen faster than on the operating profit line for the investment reasons that we talked about before. But we are expecting to have progress. We are not expecting to be back to pre-pandemic levels. So \u2013 but the actions that we have taken for the environment that we are in and that we think we are going to be in during this year, as those materialize through the P&L during the course of the year, I think we are going to be on a good path if the environment is what we think it is today, which we know that it won\u2019t be, because it\u2019s too difficult to predict, especially with the volatility. But if it were, if I was able to hold that constant, I think we would be on a good glide path. But I say that recognizing with the volatility, I just \u2013 it\u2019s too difficult to call what the environment will look like and exactly when those margins will hit the pre-pandemic levels. But again, we are taking all the right actions in the business to do that. And we talk a lot about margin, which we are very focused on because we are focused on the overall health of the financial structure of the company. So, it\u2019s appropriate. I would call out a few things, though, that what \u2013 getting back to Jason\u2019s question, what generates the cash so that we can provide healthy returns with actual dollars. So, when we look at operating profit growth, that\u2019s very important. And I think it\u2019s worth noting a few things. First, on margin recovery, we will get there faster on consumer than we will on professional. Because professional \u2013 today, we had a cost structure that was built for a business that\u2019s larger than one it\u2019s producing today. And so there is a misalignment between the revenue of the business and the cost structure of the business. We will get that corrected, but that will take some time. So, the recovery will come faster on consumer. But then going to the profit dollars, I call out in 2021, consumer tissue, for all the reasons that we have talked about, that was 75% of the operating profit decline. So, there were very specific dynamics that caused it. It was the big driver of the profit decline. But if you look at our personal care business, which is half of our company, strong growth, strong market shares. It actually grew operating profit in the fourth quarter. It also grew in the third quarter. So the second half of the year, the Personal Care segment, which is very healthy, is actually growing operating profit and in the near-term, I will take the dollars, recognizing in the long-term I have to get the margin structure to the right place. So, I just thought I would give a little bit more color by segment there. Peter Grom : No, that\u2019s incredibly helpful. And then just completely shifting gears here, I would love to get an update on the performance in the D&E markets, which seem to perform quite nicely in the quarter. Can you maybe provide a bit more color on kind of the health of the consumer in those regions? Like what is driving the stronger growth, whether it would be category or Kimberly-Clark specific? And then I guess on pricing, how have pricing actions been received in those markets versus what you see or what you are seeing in developed markets? Mike Hsu : Yes. Thanks for the question, Peter. Yes, great performance in developed and emerging markets. Overall in the quarter, I think it was in our statement, but organic up 10 in the quarter and 8 for the full year. And that was composed of really a healthy balance of price volume and mix importantly. And so \u2013 and then we saw solid growth in all regions, high-single digit gains in Asia and Latin America and double-digit growth in EMEA. And then really strong double-digit growth in China, India, Russia, Eastern Europe and Africa, which are kind of the important future growth markets for us. So, we are really excited to see that. And I think what\u2019s driving it is, I have mentioned kind of in my prepared remarks, really, really great innovation. We are doing a really good job. Our teams around the world are doing a great job, scaling, really, what I would call breakthrough innovation across markets. We were up multiple share points in Korea in the fourth quarter. That is a version of the Chinese diaper technology that we have put out there, which is related to the diaper technology that we have in North America, which is the same technology that we put out in Australia, which was also up multiple share points. And so I think really, really good consumer-inspired innovation and then superior local market execution around digital, marketing and sales execution. So, it\u2019s kind of all the things and they are all working very hard for us. One of our business leaders, call it all oars in the water, meaning we used to be over-reliant on one thing to drive the business. We are really \u2013 part of our commercial capabilities that we are developing is we want everything out there working and working in the same direction. And when we do that, we tend to see the results that we think we are seeing now. Peter Grom : Thank you. Best of luck. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Mike Hsu : Good morning Nik. Thanks. Nik Modi : Good morning Mike. So, just two quick questions for me. Just on the upstream innovation agenda, Mike, can you just talk about what\u2019s going on there? I mean has it had to take a backseat just given all the situations that you have been dealing with, with COVID, etcetera? And then we talk a lot about labor and transportation and input costs. But we don\u2019t talk a lot about retail media, which seems to be a growing demand from your customer base. So, I was hoping you can provide a little bit of context on that and how that\u2019s hitting your P&L? Mike Hsu : Yes. Okay. Yes. Great questions, Nick. Yes. I think the flavor maybe you could have gotten from Maria\u2019s commentary earlier. I mean we are continuing to invest in the foundational things that are going to make this business healthy for now and the long-term. And we recognize we are working through some choppy waters. But we are committed to growing this business for the long-term in the right way. And so, yes, so we had not \u2013 we are not pulling back on our innovation investment and our insight and technology investments. And we are excited about it. And I think the reason you are seeing the results that we are realizing around the world is because we are just doing a better job of scaling big ideas and big innovations that are really grounded in great technologies. And so we are continuing to do that. Maria mentioned the visibility of our pipeline on cost savings is probably better than it\u2019s ever been. Well, the visibility of our pipeline of our technology innovations better than it\u2019s ever been, too. And that\u2019s one of the things as we \u2013 coming into this role, we wanted the organization to work longer term. And we are here for today and we are also here for tomorrow and to be able to balance that. And so we are really pleased with that progress. And so \u2013 which is why I would say we are confident that we are going to continue to be able to invest and grow in our businesses, both in personal care, professional and consumer tissue. So, that\u2019s one. I think with regard to retail media, yes, it is becoming a bigger topic. I will say I feel very good about our digital capability. And we are very disciplined. And we have so much data around \u2013 as Maria mentioned earlier, digital is our life. I mean we know exactly what it is. We have made significant progress on ROIs over the course of the last 3 years or 4 years, and we know what the investments are worth. And so we are very capable \u2013 have the right sort of data, as you might expect, to be able to work with our retailers and make the right investments. And frankly, some of those investments are really, really good for us, and we are really excited to do that with them. And others, we are going to need to see a little more improvement. But overall, I think it\u2019s an operational issue and capability that our organization is really well equipped to deal with. Nik Modi : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Nik. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I am showing no further questions. I will turn the call back over for closing remarks. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you. In closing, I would like to really reinforce a few key points to my opening remarks. 3 years ago, we launched our strategy to deliver balanced and sustainable growth, and that plan is anchored on our strategy to accelerate top line growth by elevating our categories and expanding our markets. Now to do this, we have invested in our brands and capabilities and our people. This growth is fueled by improvements to our cost base, delivering strong annual productivity through our FORCE and Global Restructuring programs. It\u2019s pretty clear we are executing our strategy in a very dynamic environment. And our teams have faced challenges well beyond what we or anyone else had anticipated. But that\u2019s our reality and we expect the volatility in the environment to persist this year. We are committed to our strategy and we are executing well, evidenced by our growth in personal care, strength in market share performance and the actions we have taken in a very volatile environment. We are excited about the potential of our brands and categories and our ability to develop innovative products that will enhance our portfolio and the value we provide to our consumers. We are also committed to restoring our margins and expect to make progress this year. This commodity cycle is clearly different from past cycles. And the time to recover will be elongated due to continued inflation. We are confident in the actions we are taking and in our ability to create meaningful shareholder value over time. I am especially grateful for the dedication of our talented teams and we will continue to do all we can to ensure a safe and rewarding work environment in the year ahead. Thank you all for joining our call today. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow, if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Taryn Miller. Taryn Miller : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Mike Hsu, our Chairman and CEO; Maria Henry, our CFO; and Nelson Urdaneta, our incoming CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings news release and published prepared management remarks from Mike and Maria, that summarize our first quarter results and 2022 outlook. Both documents are available in the Investors section of our website. In just a moment, Mike will share opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and the first quarter 10-Q for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We may also refer to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to comment on our CFO transition and then I'll provide a perspective on our Q1 results. First, I'd like to thank Maria Henry for seven years of outstanding leadership as CFO of Kimberly-Clark. As you saw from our news release, Maria has decided to retire effective September 1. Maria will leave quite a legacy at K-C. She played a key role in design and execution of our strategy, and our strong financial stewardship has positioned us well for the future. I'm grateful for all her contributions and very glad she'll be with us through the summer to ensure a smooth transition. I'd also like to welcome Nelson, our incoming CFO. Nelson brings strong operational and international experience to K-C and I'm looking forward to his leadership. I'm sure you'll enjoy getting to know him as he begins his new role. Now turning to our first quarter. I'm pleased that we started the year with double-digit organic sales growth and strong performance in all segments. Our teams are executing very well during a period of continued volatility and high inflation. Our strong fundamentals provide a solid basis for us to raise our sales outlook for the full year. We're driving growth by building strong commercial capabilities and deploying them with local agility. We're continuing to invest in our business, grow our categories and deliver meaningful value to our consumers. We're continuing to face a dynamic environment. We're being thoughtful with actions to offset macro headwinds, balancing price, volume and market share, while we work to improve our margins over time. 2022 marked K-C's 150th anniversary. Kimberly-Clark was founded on the core principles of quality, service and fair dealing. These principles still reflect who we are and what we stand for today. We're led by our purpose of better care for a better world and we're driven to perform, so we can continue to make a difference in people's lives with the categories we create, the products we make and the consumers we serve. Our purpose-led, performance-driven culture fuels our team every day to drive our growth and deliver long-term shareholder value. Now with that, we'd like to address your questions. Operator : At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Maria, again, congratulations. All the best. And Nelson, we look forward to working with you. I wanted to start on the guidance. A couple more tactical questions then, Mike, why don't we start with one, sort of, more strategic. I guess, just given the uncertainty and increasing concerns around the consumer and ability to cope with the higher levels of inflation, number two -- or number one, I guess, are you seeing anything in your markets that gives you any pause about taking additional pricing? Was there any concern about that? Are you seeing any trade down that made you potentially cautious even at this point to raise your organic sales growth outlook? And then I have a couple of follow-ups for Maria. Thanks. Mike Hsu : No. Well, Kevin, overall -- thanks for the question. Look, two big changes since our January update. I mean, one was, obviously, if you look at our results in the quarter, price realization is -- our execution is very effective right now, and the volume is trending better, I think, than we initially thought. So that's one part. But certainly, as you saw in our release, inflation is significantly worse. And so I would say those two big changes largely offset. I do think our strong top line, Kevin, reflects the essential nature of our categories and the strength of our brands. I mean. we have been working over the last several years to really improve our brand fundamentals with strong innovation, great commercial execution. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're really proud of our local agility. So I would say, overall, we're cautiously optimistic. Certainly, we recognize at the price levels we're putting into the market, they will create stress on the consumer. And so our approach is we're going to be very thoughtful about balancing growth, margin and share. And we'll be very responsive and agile to the needs in the marketplace. But right now, I'd say the pricing environment has been largely constructive and I think we're on track with what we thought the pricing would do. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Thanks Mike. And just to play that back. So your -- is it the expectation that the incremental pricing will largely offset the incremental cost pressure? Are you guys at a lower point within your earnings guidance where it\u2019s not going to entirely -- the additional input costs that you're coping with? Mike Hsu : Yeah. Well, just as a principal, I would say, generally, I would expect our teams to offset input cost inflation with pricing over time. It may not occur within the year, but over time. And so that's our general principle. Obviously, we'll also deploy cost savings and productivity against that problem as well. But again, that's our overall principle. We have taken further action. We announced a suite of actions at the beginning of the year. And then we've taken further actions since we talked last January. And again, I think our teams have been very responsive to what's happening in the marketplace. Kevin Grundy : Okay. I\u2019ll pass it on and hop back in the queue. Thank you very much for the time. Mike Hsu : Thanks Kevin. Operator : We'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Mike Hsu : Good morning Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. One of the things that jumped out in the results also was mix and the degree to, which makes us continuing to contribute to top line. So I'm guessing this is tied as you've mentioned like the execution. But as you're thinking about how commercial execution may or may not evolve from here, just thinking about merchandising on the shelf, what elements of your product suite are emphasized in store versus others to deal -- to try to support volume as you move to the year? How would you be thinking about how mix may evolve as the inflationary pressures mount on the consumer? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, we're very encouraged with the mix performance. And again, I think it dovetails or it's an outcome of our underlying strategy, which is to elevate our categories and expand our markets. And I think you might observe, we've been driving mix for a few years now. And the core underlying thought is, we still think there is a lot of opportunity for premiumization in our categories. Recognize that I think the circumstances of this environment may require some slight adjustments. But the long-term opportunity, I think, Alison talked about at the CAGNY conference. China, which is the largest hypermarket in the world right now, still remains the largest market. The value per baby is less than half of what it is in developed markets like the United States. And so, we still think premiumization is an opportunity. That's what's driving our growth. We were up high single digits in China for another quarter. We continue to grow there and continue to improve mix. And so, that's a core idea for us. It's also what's driving our momentum in North America, double-digit growth in diapers and across personal care, all personal care categories in the US. We're continuing to drive innovation on the premium end, but also, we brought a lot of improvements to our value tiers as well in North America and around the rest of the world. So, again, we're elevating our categories. It remains a core part of the strategy. We're not going to be niche premium though, and so we want to be able to serve all consumers. And so, we're balancing our investments and our investments in innovation across the value tiers. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it, and I'll get back in the queue later. Mike Hsu : All right. Thanks, Lauren. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Chris. Chris Carey : Hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the question around pricing, your expectations and how things have evolved. So the 4% to 6% organic sales growth now includes volumes, which are negative, which was the call before; implies pricing, probably at least a couple of hundred basis points higher than where you were before. I'm seeing pricing in the US right now in the high single-digit range. So can you perhaps help us understand how much pricing you're expecting and how that has changed relative to prior expectations? And maybe give us a sense of pricing expectations in the US versus internationally? Like, for example, is international pricing going to be as strong as the US? And then, just connected to that, on Kevin's question around elasticities, I did notice in the prepared remarks some comments around pricing impacting volume in some D&E markets. I think previously, elasticities were a bit more conceptual. And I'm just wondering if now you're actually starting to see some of that volume impact play out? Mike Hsu : Okay. Yes. Chris, maybe I'll start and then maybe Maria will provide some additional color, too. But, overall, I'll just give you a sense of -- our pricing execution overall is on track. Volumes have been solid. I would say trending a little bit better than we initially thought. But, as I mentioned earlier, we're going to be very alert in monitoring our price gaps carefully. I would say we've implemented multiple rounds of pricing. Given what's happened in the first quarter, that is additional pricing or higher than what we originally planned is a key basis for why we're taking up our sales outlook. Overall in the marketplace, obviously, trade discussions have been constructive. We have seen movement in other brands and in some cases, private label. But there is a little stickiness in some markets as well, particularly in Western Europe and parts of Latin America. So I think that's why we're going to monitor the situation closely and try to balance -- continue to balance our performance and growth with -- and our share performance. But overall, we feel good about where we are on pricing, and we feel good about our portfolio and the fact that we're strong in both the value and the premium end, and we'll be able to pivot and meet the consumer where they need us to be. Maria Henry : Yeah. And I would just add that if you look at the outlook for input costs, which did escalate and our outlook for the year, as you know from our prepared comments and news release, we did increase the number in terms of the inflation we expect for the year. A good portion of that comes outside of the United States. And so along with the intent to cover inflation with pricing, you should expect that a lot of the incremental pricing we're putting into the market comes outside of the US. Chris Carey : And if I could just ask one follow-up there on the incremental inflation that you're seeing. What are the specific baskets or cost items that are moving outside of the US to cause this incremental pricing? Thanks so much. Maria Henry : Sure. At the midpoint of our new guidance versus where we were in January, we're up about $375 million in terms of our expectation for input cost inflation this year. That increase is across all of our baskets. But as you know, with the significant volatility in oil and energy, that is clearly one of the drivers. That's well over half of the increase that we're seeing since January and the impact particularly on the energy side, weights to Western Europe, UK. And there, we have a sizable tissue business, which is a large consumer of energy. So that is kind of how the inflation basket plays out and why it's more weighted to markets outside of the US. Chris Carey : Okay. Thanks so much. Mike Hsu : Thanks Chris. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Mike Hsu : Morning Steve. Steve Powers : Good morning, good morning. And congrats to Maria, and welcome to Nelson as well for me. Picking up on the $375 million and guidance. That incremental $375 million at the midpoint headwind from higher inflation just seems to be substantially higher quantitatively than the uptick in revenue that you're calling for. So just in the components of your guidance, it just -- it reads net negative. And, obviously, you've maintained the full year range. So I'm just trying to figure out if there is something else that got better in your outlook versus the start of the year, or if we're now talking about the lower end of the range as opposed to the higher end prior? Just some help there would be helpful. Maria Henry : Sure. There clearly is a range and coming into the year, we talked about the factors that could affect where we land in that range and commodities have -- commodity inflation expectations clearly have increased. We talked about incremental pricing there. So how all of that plays out as we go through the year we'll have to see. In terms of our expectations on the other lines of the P& L, we held our outlook for our FORCE cost savings. Our other manufacturing costs are looking to be a bit better. We had talked about in January, the pressure we were seeing from the surge in Omicron. Fortunately, that has resolved itself fairly quickly in North America. And it's helped us get our supply chain into a better place than what we suspected back in January. So that's a positive on that side of the house. And in the first quarter, our G&A spending, or between-the-line spending, when you net out all of the puts and takes, was a bit favorable backing out currency and other things. And so, in this environment, it's tough, and so we're going to very closely monitor our between-the-line spend for the year and how all those factors come together, keeps us within the range of guidance that we set back in January. Exactly where we'll land, there's still a lot of volatility and moving pieces, so we'll have to see there. Mike Hsu : And, Stephen, I would agree, $375 million is a big number. And so -- but again, I think we're pleased with the team. I would say, again, as Maria mentioned, volume has been an important component for us. And we planned the year with an estimate around elasticities. Still remains to be seen how things flow from there. But I think given our first quarter, I would say, volumes are trending favorable to some of the things that we had originally thought, so. Steve Powers : Yes. Very good, very good. Is there any -- can you -- of that incremental $375 million, was any of it realized in the first quarter? Is it just the cadence of how that's to flow through? Is that, I'm assuming, more back-end loaded, but just any color there would be useful as well. Maria Henry : Sure. It did hit us in the first quarter. We saw a meaningful spike in commodity cost pricing, particularly in the month of March, as global events unfolded. So probably a-quarter of it hit in the first quarter, and the remainder of it will come in the rest of the year. Steve Powers : Okay. So it's more prorated then. Okay. Very good. And then, just one last thing, if I could? Just, is there any -- maybe -- and maybe I should know this already, but just, is there a way to quantify what the Texas storm impact was on growth in terms of the impact this year in terms of the benefit? Mike Hsu : Well, I think, in the first quarter, it was probably worth about 2 points of organic for us. So, again -- and we're primarily lapping -- I think, it was March of last year is when it really hit us. We're still going to be cycling maybe a month or two of that in this quarter as well, just so you recognize that. But -- so, yes, but that did have an impact, so. Steve Powers : Okay. Thank you very much. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Steve. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Mike Hsu : Good morning Jason. Jason English : Hey good morning folks. Thanks for slot me in. Let me echo the sentiment, congrats Maria. Well earned. I think we've had the pleasure working together for now well over a decade, and you will be missed. And Nelson, welcome on board. Looking forward to getting to know you. Dig into the business, a couple of questions, please. I guess let's first talk about D&E. We haven't seen a negative volume number in your personal care D&E business in quite some time. And I know it's only negative once, so I'm not trying to sensationalize anything, but there's obviously some sensitivity around tap those markets. So can you unpack what drove it this quarter? And then perhaps elaborate on how you're seeing concerned behavior in emerging markets change in each of your core markets as inflation pressure mounts? Mike Hsu : Yeah. Yeah, Jason, maybe I'll start here. Overall, I think we're very pleased with our D&E growth overall. Personal care growth continue to be very strong behind what I mentioned earlier under Lauren's question, strong innovation, really strong local execution. Organic was up 11% in the quarter. High single digit on price, low single digit on mix. And then yeah, as you mentioned, a 1% volume decline overall. I'd say it's mixed across markets, and maybe the one area that I'd point out is in Latin America for us, a little softer on volume and a little softer on share. The big driver of that is Jason, as you're well aware with our previous discussions, we're prioritizing margin recovery, but we want to be balanced and holistic about it. And so we're trying to balance margin recovery, organic growth and share. And I would say we're probably faster on pricing in a number of our key markets, including Latin America. And so that's probably had an impact on both volume and share. And our shares are still overall up and over 50% of are what we call cohorts or market category combination, so we feel good about that. It's a little less than what we have been doing in the last couple of years, which is about two-thirds, right? And so we'd like to be in that two-thirds range. But recognize that's a high bar. That said, we also recognize when we're moving quickly on price that we're going to have some ebbs and flows on market shares in local markets. Jason English : Yes, that makes sense. Thank you. Pivoting to the professional business. Volumes still really -- they haven't really recovered, right? If we look at pre-COVID for this quarter, 1Q 2022 versus where we were in 2019, I think your volumes are still down 17%, 18%, off of the pre-COVID levels. So two questions. What needs to happen? Like what are the conditions that we get you back to bright there? And we're far enough in that I think it's probably prudent for all us to say, you probably aren't getting back to right. Is there some rightsizing type initiatives you need to take in the organization to account for the now lower volume base? Mike Hsu : Yeah. Overall, Jason, I will say we're encouraged by the professional demand improving. Organic was up 6% in the quarter. And to your point, not back to where it was, but mid-single-digit growth in North American and high single digit in the rest of the world. Washroom demand recovering was up 30% in the quarter and now back to 90% of our pre-pandemic levels. I think we do know enough. And I agree with you, I don't think it's going to go back to where it was. I think our team is making the right plans to size the business appropriately and recognize this is the reality of where we are. And so we need to go from there. And so they've got a margin recovery plan and a cost plan and are diligently working on that. Obviously, a key component of that margin recovery plan is price, which we've executed very, very well, and we're encouraged with our start. I will point out, we do expect better volume performance. I mean we have great capability. We have great innovation in the market this year. We have this, what we're calling an ICON, a better dispenser that our end users are very excited about, and that's driving our growth. So our shares in the segment, especially North America, are up. The team's performing well. But you're right, I think we have to recognize that probably the business is going to be a little different size than it was pre-pandemic, and we're going to be ready for that. Jason English : Yes. Thanks and congrats on a good start to the year. I'll pass it on. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan Chase. Mike Hsu : Andrea, good morning. Andrea Teixeira : Hi. Good morning. How are you? First, congrats to Maria, and welcome, Nelson. Looking forward to working with you as well. So, first, a clarification that you removed the comments about SG&A and the FORCE savings. And given the higher cost pressures and from Maria's comments earlier, are you taking from marketing spending down since the consumer, particularly in the US, has been stronger than anticipated? And on the pricing commentary that, I think, it was incremental to what you had in plan. Which categories are you hoping to get additional pricing from plan before and the timing of it? And just a follow-up to Mike's commentary about China. I mean, impressive high single-digit performance there for another quarter. So how are you trending in April, given the lockdowns and what we hear about e-commerce also being impacted there? And what is your expectation for the category? Thank you. Maria Henry : All right. I'll go ahead and start on the cost side. As I mentioned, our outlook remains the same for the FORCE cost savings of $300 million to $350 million for the year. A little bit more color on the first quarter. We did see very strong savings in our productivity programs and our pipeline of opportunities remains quite healthy on the cost savings side. And so, we've got confidence in that FORCE cost savings range. We do expect that the savings will ramp through the year. As you know, our savings don't come in a straight line. They can tend to be a bit bumpy as we go through the year, based on which projects and programs we're implementing and able to execute. In the quarter, what we saw is that, the distribution cost increases were a meaningful headwind to our FORCE cost savings number. So, as I've discussed before, the $50 million of savings is a net number. There's all of the positives from the actions that our teams are taking to drive productivity across the supply chain. But you have to clear a positive number there, and there's significant headwinds on the distribution side that are putting pressure on the net course cost savings number. But I'd wrap it up by saying that, good delivery in the quarter, pipeline of opportunities remain strong. On the between the lines comment that I made, thank you for the question, because it's important to clarify, we are not reducing brand support. Our advertising plans for the year continue to be strong, and we intend to continue to support our brands. Outside of advertising when you look broadly at other -- our SG&A spend, we'll continue to be very disciplined on other spending and look to balance the profit delivery, given the current conditions that we're facing, in particular, with the escalation of input cost inflation. But advertising remains very healthy. Mike Hsu : Yeah. Andrea, maybe I'll just piggyback on that, what Maria is saying. We remain committed to delivering balanced and sustainable growth. And so our priorities are to accelerate growth and also recover the margins. But right now, I would tell you, our brands are strong, our categories are healthy, and we're going to continue to invest to build our categories, our brands and our markets. So as I mentioned earlier, we're taking a very holistic approach to balance -- to mitigate the inflationary pressure. We're going to balance price, volume and share. I think we -- to your second part of your question, I think we've taken price and recognize that our price realization has to increase. We've done that in a number of ways, either through pack counts, list price and also promotion reductions. I would -- I don't know that I would say it's uniform across markets. We're relying on our markets to be agile and to respond to what the local situation requires. But in general, as you can observe overall, the overall pricing has gone up. In some markets, our promotions have come down and in some markets, and that's been a way to deliver price. And in some markets, it's gone a little bit up. North America, I would say, has gone up slightly because we were suppressed on the promotion front for a couple of years. I'd say our promotional debt is still lower than it was years ago overall. But again, that's -- it's just an artifact of kind of what are you comparing against. But overall, I think Maria's point is the main one, which is we believe in balanced and sustainable growth and growing our brands and so we're going to continue to support the brands in an appropriate way. And then the last point, I think you asked on China. I think I'm not ready to comment on April yet. We're only ready to comment on this quarter. I would tell you that we have been affected by some of the COVID lockdowns as everyone else is, and -- but we'll update you on that on our next call. Andrea Teixeira : And one last clarification. Sorry to a fine point on the pricing and increase in inorganic. So should we interpret what you're saying mostly that initially, you were more cautious on basically the elasticity, the volume decline? I remember being a very strong volume decline that was embedded in the initial guide. And now you're having the same kind of thought about pricing, but slightly better now because it's been taking -- everyone is taking additional pricing; your competitor announced another one in Family Care the day before yesterday. So it's a mix of both, but mostly because elasticities have been coming in better than anticipated? Is that the way to interpret? Mike Hsu : Well, I'd say volume has been a little bit better overall. I think we're still working through and calibrating with -- relative to the elasticity, I would say the overall volume in the first quarter came in a little bit better than planned. I still think we're waiting to see what the full impact of elasticity is. Although, I do think the history is -- and if I go back to our last price -- set of pricing a few years ago, I think volumes did come in better than predicted in some cases and in other cases, pretty much on plan. So we're still working through it. But again, I think that the net of it is our guidance increase is certainly that we're seeing -- we expect more pricing in the marketplace and then little bit better than we originally planned. Andrea Teixeira : Perfect. Thank you so much. Thanks again. Operator : We'll take our next question from Peter Grom with UBS. Mike Hsu : Good morning Peter Peter Grom : Hey, good morning everyone. I hope you all are doing well. So I kind of wanted to follow up on that last point, just around elasticities. Can you -- just I was hoping you could just remind us what the assumptions are embedded in your guidance? Is it based on historical elasticities? And should that not occur, which seems to kind of be the case more broadly today, would that be upside, or does it kind of assume what you're seeing in the market today holds? Maria Henry : Yes. I'll make a quick comment before Mike jumps in. What I would say is that, our assumptions around the elasticities have been informed by historical performance over a long period of time and particularly looking at what happened during more challenging parts of the cycle. So that was an informed, but it's not an equal to. So it's not mathematical. We apply judgment based on what we're seeing today and where we stand today in each of the markets competitively with where the consumer is and the consumer dynamics in each of those markets. So, I'd say, we apply judgment, but it's certainly informed by what's happened historically. But, Mike, you probably have some comments. Mike Hsu : No, I don't think I have much more to add to that. Peter Grom : Okay. No, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just turning to margins, and I appreciate all the color on it, and depletion and pricing in the release in the prepared remarks. But I was just kind of hoping to drill down on just the phasing, because there's just a few comments that stood out. I think, specifically, you said in the near term, these commodity costs will offset the top line growth. And then later, you kind of mentioned improved financial delivery sequentially. So how should we think about the phasing of gross margins through the balance of the year or kind of just the balance of the commodity pressures that you've kind of outlined? And then, based on kind of where things stand today, like when should we kind of expect a return to margin expansion? Maria Henry : Yes. I'll start. Let me, first, comment on phasing. You know where we came out in the first quarter. Where I would point you to is, the second half of the year, which is where we are expecting improvement. In terms of -- my IR folks are looking at me. But in terms of the second quarter, the commodity situation that we're facing, I mentioned that commodity costs were escalating through the quarter with March prices being very high and a number of our commodities are continuing to escalate. So I think looking to the next quarter, I think we're going to still have quite a bit of commodity pressure before phasing to normalize. So how that will all play out, we'll have to see. But I would point you to the second half of the year on margin improvement. We intend to build momentum as we go through the year, when pricing is more in line with the inflation. And, as you know, we've had -- we took pricing in the first quarter. So that hasn't really played out yet in the P&L. But as that does, that will certainly help our margins, our FORCE cost savings build as we go through the year. Again, maybe not in a straight line, but I would expect the second half to be stronger that the run rate that we saw in the first quarter. And so, a number of moving pieces. I don't think we're prepared to tell you when we get back to the 2019 levels on margins, but we absolutely improve -- expect improvement this year. Mike Hsu : Yeah. Let me piggyback on that, Peter, because I think part of that is we definitely expect strong progress on price realization and you're seeing it. I'm confident we'll be able to restore our margins and eventually expand them, okay? I think the big factor that Maria says, we can't predict exactly when it's because the core assumption is what happens with inflation. And so the reality is I expect reversion in the commodities. It's going to happen. We all know well, if you've been following this company for a long time. I think most of our long-term investors have seen it revert every time, right? But the reality is, in the near-term, inflation is well beyond any historical levels. I mean in just over -- between 2021 and 2022, if you do the math at the midpoint of our guidance, we're going to take on $2.7 billion of additional inflation, and that's a 1,400 point drag on the operating margin. I will tell you we\u2019ll make our progress restoring margins. We expect pricing to largely offset inflation. It may not all be in the year, but our teams are moving fast and making progress. And again, as I started commodities are going to revert. And then when they revert, that's going to accelerate our time line of recovery. But again, it's hard to say when that is because we expect it to decline a little bit or at least we predict at a level at the beginning of the year, and obviously, we took up that inflation number by $375 million at the midpoint three months later. So again, there was not a war in our plan for -- as we put together our outlook in the beginning of the year, and that's clearly affected the energy markets. Peter Grom : Thank you for that. And Maria, congratulations and wish you the best of luck moving forward. Maria Henry : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Group. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning. Mike Hsu : Good morning Wendy. Wendy Nicholson : My first question has to do with private label because you're one of the few companies who cover that does do some private label manufacturing. So can you remind us, number one, just ballpark what percentage of your volume is for private label brands? And then second, just if there's any outlook you have, I know that you said in the past that you only do private label when it sort of to the benefit of your brands and strategic relationships. But can you give us a sense whether any of the big retailers you work with are coming to you saying, hey, we want to put more power behind private label given the pricing environment. Anything you can offer just in terms of where you're situated and whether you think private label is going to grow as a piece of your business over the next six to 12 months? Mike Hsu : Yeah. Overall, I'd say, Wendy, private label is not core to our overall growth strategy. And so it's a relatively small part of our business. And we do it selectively, as you mentioned, whether for a strategic account or a strategic proposition. But again, our capacity is expensive to build, and so we want to focus that in general, on the brands unless there is a very good strategic rationale for. I will say private label did grow a bit more in the quarter, and that's a change from prior quarters. And I think it was up or even in about six of our eight categories that we track, and that's a change from the recent quarters. And while we're paying attention to that, we're really focused on improving and making sure that we have the right value proposition on our products. And that's why even at the same time, Wendy, that we are making -- taking price increases, we are also working hard to improve the product quality and the features and benefits of our brands as well. Maria Henry : So it's less than 5% of our sales. Wendy Nicholson : Less than 5%. Okay. And can you just clarify the strength that you saw in the quarter, again, even if it's small, was it in the US or in Western Europe? Mike Hsu : I would say -- I was commenting mostly on North America. I think in North America, the eight categories we track was even or up in about six of them, so. Wendy Nicholson : Okay. Fabulous. And then just one more follow-up to an earlier question about China. Your strength, high single-digit growth in diapers and fem care is obviously terrific and great to see and a departure from what we've heard from other companies who've been struggling in China, not just with the supply chain, but lots of different things. And so, my question is, is it just a market share, well and about performance for you? Do you think there's anything different in terms of how you're distributed, or are you promoting exceptionally a lot, or anything different that's enabling you to do well in China, maybe when some other companies are struggling more? Mike Hsu : Yes. It's -- I don't think it's a distribution channel thing. And I don't think -- it's definitely not promotion because, again, we're trying to be disciplined about pricing. Here's the thing, and I will say, Wendy, it's really what Alison talked about at CAGNY, which is there is a lot of opportunity in a lot of our markets to premiumnze our category. And I know that's a little bit different because given the conditions right now with pricing and inflation, what's happening to the consumer. But over the long term, as I mentioned earlier, the China -- the value per baby sold is less than half of what it is in the US or other developed markets. And so there still remains a significant opportunity for us to premiumize our categories. And so, mix for us has been an important driver. We've doubled our super premium mix just over the past 12 months and so, that's part of it.  And then the other part of it is share. And what we're really proud that we took share leadership in China in the diaper category, I'd say, almost two years ago and we continue to expand that. And so, we're really proud of the work of our team and we're excited about that. And recognize, there are some trends that are not favorable. I mean, as you're well aware, births are down, but we still think there's an opportunity on value. Wendy Nicholson : Terrific. Thanks so much for the color. Mike Hsu : Thanks Wendy. Operator : We'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Mike Hsu : Hey Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Sorry back again. I just wanted to talk quickly about consumer tissue. It's CAGNY \u2013 in your comments, I think it was in -- comments. There was a discussion of just efforts behind the scene to execute the same playbook that you've done so successfully now in personal care in tissue, in terms of elevating the category sort of support. It may be a tough time, given just about cost inflation and managing volatility at the moment. But anything you could share on strategies in that business, I would be curious if we have the time? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes. Thank you, Lauren. Yes, I think that's right. I mean, again, elevate the categories \u2013 I think we have an opportunity to elevate all of our categories and I think that will apply. I think it's -- we -- our teams have been busy working that across the globe on tissue. I think some of that's been drowned out because \u2013 especially like in North America, the high volatility over the last couple of years related to COVID. For reference, I think that category was up 28% in 2020 and then down 20% last year. And so, there's been a lot of volatility. That said, I'd say, we still believe there's a lot of opportunity to elevate the category through better Kleen, let's say, on the tissue side. I think we have had some momentum on Kleenex and broadening out the usage. And so that's something we remain excited about and we're working hard on. I just think there's been a little more volatility in the tissue categories in North America, because I would say the extreme volatility in demand and then in other markets like Latin America, and in Western Europe, the pricing dynamic has been, I would say, a little more pressurized. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Excellent. Operator : Thank you. And Ms. Taryn Miller, I'm showing there are no more questions at this time. Taryn Miller : Great. Thank you. So thank you for joining today on our conference call, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.

It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Taryn Miller. Please go ahead. Taryn Miller : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Mike Hsu, our Chairman and CEO; and Nelson Urdaneta, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings news release and published prepared remarks from Mike and Nelson that summarize our second quarter results and 2022 outlook. Both documents are available in the Investors section of our website. In just a moment, Mike will share opening comments and then we'll take your questions.  During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K and the second quarter 10-Q for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We may also refer to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our team's execution as we closed our first half with 9% organic sales growth in the second quarter. We delivered robust gains in all segments, our growth strategy is working, and our teams are executing with excellence in what continues to be a volatile operating environment.  Clearly, our results reflect this ongoing volatility. For the year, we're now anticipating $300 million of additional input cost inflation. We remain committed to recovering and eventually expanding our margins and thus, we've taken further action to realize additional pricing and cost savings to mitigate these headwinds. We continue to expect pricing and cost savings to fully offset the effects of inflation over time.  Based on the strength of our top line, we're raising our full year organic sales outlook to increase 5% to 7%. We're maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance. However, based on current conditions, including our updated input cost outlook, we now expect to be in the lower end of that EPS range. We'll continue to manage our business with discipline as we navigate near-term headwinds. Based on the pace and breadth of our pricing actions, we anticipate some volume impact over the balance of the year. Still, we're encouraged by the overall health of our categories and our brands. Our brands remain essential.  We also know consumers are seeking greater value and we'll continue to sharpen our offering to enhance our market position. We remain committed to delivering balanced and sustainable growth. In the near term, we're taking necessary action to recover margins. We're also continuing to invest in our brands to enable us to grow sustainably now and for the long term. Now we'd like to address your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So first, just a couple of clarity questions. The increase in your full year organic sales growth guidance for 2022, is that driven by higher pricing or a higher volume assumption? And then second, with the $300 million in higher cost pressures now expected for the full year, you obviously mentioned a combination of pricing and cost savings to help offset that.  Can you just be a bit more specific if you're planning additional price increases, specifically in the back half of the year? Does that offset a good amount of the cost pressures? How should we sort of think about the pricing outlook changing in response to the cost outlook, specifically in the back half of the year? Michael Hsu : Yes. Thanks, Dara. I'll start and maybe Nelson can provide some additional color. But overall, I think the organic outlook and the increase in the outlook reflects both volume and price. Overall, we feel like our pricing execution is going very well. We are driving the realization. You can see it in the numbers.  But the second part of it is also the volume is holding up a little bit better than we originally planned. And I think that reflects, one, what we said before, which is resilience in the consumer overall but also the strength of our brands. And we feel really great about the commercial execution that we have around the world. And that includes launches of innovation, improvements in product quality, our digital marketing programs, the execution we're driving at shelf. And so overall, that's still working despite the necessity for us to price our products to recover the costs and the margins.  So overall, I'd say it's a pretty good balance of both volume and price on the organic outlook. And then on the cost front, yes, we're going to need it. We have taken additional pricing actions and that's globally. And we've taken a few actions since the beginning of the year. Actually, we announced another action in North America just last week. And so we continue to execute. And again, overall, philosophically, I've said in the past, Dara, that we expect pricing to generally offset the effects of inflation over time. It gets tougher as the increases come toward the middle or end of the year to kind of catch up to it. But again, we are expecting our teams to be able to offset inflation over the long term. Nelson, do you have something to add? Nelson Urdaneta : Absolutely. And I would add, Dara, a couple of things there as well. I mean, one, yes, as Mike said, I mean, pricing is one of the key levers as we're seeking to offset the pricing pressures that we're having. But also, we got to keep in mind our cost savings FORCE program, which will accelerate as we go into the second half. So the combination of those 2 will help us offset as we exit the year that bit. Dara Mohsenian : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe taking a step back and thinking about the broader pricing environment in general, geographically. First, just in the U.S., there's obviously been some very public margin pressures that are playing out at some of your larger retailer partners. There's worries about consumer pressure points and macros. You mentioned internally, the historical pricing has gone well. The volume elasticity has been limited.  But have you seen any change in retailers' receptivity in the U.S. to pricing, given some of the dynamics I mentioned earlier? Does that sort of require a more judicious approach to pricing on your part in the U.S. specifically? And then second, just in some of your key emerging markets, maybe you can give us an update on consumer demand elasticity there to higher pricing and what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint. Michael Hsu : Yes. Great questions, Dara. A couple of things. And you and I have talked about this in the past. I'd say that retailer behavior is -- I know there's a lot being said out there. I find it to be consistent with what it's been historically over my 30 years of working in this industry. And I think it starts with the fact that I think we've learned over time, our interests are generally aligned. I mean -- and what do I mean by that?  And one is we're both after the long-term growth of our categories, right? We jointly run these categories together. For them, it's in their store and for us, it is our business overall. But we're after kind of long-term sustainable growth. And that's one big thing. Second big thing we're after is delivering consumers a great value. And that comes in many different ways. In some ways, that comes with solid price points that reflect the value consumers are seeking. In a lot of ways, especially in our categories, it reflects -- it means the right kind of innovation on product quality that delivers to consumers the benefits that they're seeking.  And so I think with those 2 foundational points, we are sensitive to the pricing. But we also do both -- I'd say, on both sides, I understand that we need to be able to profitably grow over the long term. And so again, we're sensitive to the pressure that's out there. We read the similar news reports. We've had the discussions with our customers, and we have been taking price. But we are doing it, I would say, thoughtfully and planfully. So maybe that's part one.  And then on the D&E question, yes, I think overall price -- the pricing and volume strength really reflects the consumer resilience and the essential nature of our categories overall. I would say, Dara, that consumers appear to be somewhat more resilient in developed markets. Our performance, high single, low double-digit growth across all of our developed markets, multiple share point growth -- multi-point share growth in most of our developed markets.  I think we have seen some price lagging in D&E from competitors. And so our shares have softened a bit in D&E. And while we have been driving price, we recognize that we've advanced pricing maybe further and faster than some of the competition. So we're going to have to continue to monitor that situation closely.  The other thing that we're seeing a little bit more in D&E than we are in developed markets is a bit more trade-down. I wouldn't say significantly more but there is a difference there. And I think I've talked about this in past calls. In Latin America, we have a leading -- the leading value offering and the leading premium offering. And we're really glad we have the breadth of that scope because that allows us to pivot our business appropriately when the consumers are looking for that. So overall, we feel good about where we stand. We are watching price gaps in D&E, a little bit in North America as well and we're sensitive to that. Operator : Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : So just following actually on that thread around some sensitivity and watching for trade-down and the mention of the portfolio breadth you have in Latin America. I was curious on what, if anything, you are doing in terms of shelf sets, merchandising of the more value or mid-tier products in the portfolio versus the premium end. Are there things that you are doing proactively rather than reactively to shift the mix of what you are supporting? And if not, why not? Because your categories do, over time, tend to feature on the higher end of the list of those that can see trade-down and be more sensitive not in terms of overall consumption but rather what is being consumed. Michael Hsu : Yes. Great point, Lauren. And this point, we have discussed this in the past, and I'd say yes, particularly in D&E, you're seeing student bodies shift to the left, right? And we shifted to the right just a few years ago. And I think I talked -- a couple of years ago, we were a highly developed value business and a very small premium business. And this is maybe about 3 or 4 years ago, we were down. And there was a big shift to premiumize. At that point, I think the market was receptive to that.  So we made a lot of progress, all the things you talk about, the appropriate pack counts, the improvements in product quality, the merchandising and everything else. And so we made a huge shift in terms of our premium mix in a market like Brazil. That said, 2 years ago, when the economy started softening, we started shifting back. And we're glad we did. And that yielded us, last year, the leading position in both value and the leading position in premium. We feel great about that. And those are all the tactics that play out for us not just in developing and emerging markets, but we do that in developed markets as well. And you're absolutely right. And we think, again, our broad portfolio of premium through value offering enables us to flex with demand. And as I point out in the near term, we are prioritizing margin recovery and so our pricing has advanced. And so we are watching the price gaps, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments as we go through the year. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then on the cost savings, as Nelson, you mentioned, there's significant -- it looks like there'll be more FORCE savings in the back half of the year. And just knowing that not just for Kimberly-Clark but for many of your peers in the industry, getting at productivity has been pretty tough in this environment, whether it's asking suppliers for better pricing, whether it's getting into the plants and working on putting in place new cost savings, mechanisms or projects. So I was curious, frankly, a degree of confidence in that acceleration. What is it that you expect to change that should allow for you to see greater FORCE savings in the back half of the year? Nelson Urdaneta : Sure, Lauren. So I'd start by reminding us that FORCE isn't necessarily a straight line. I mean, it tends to build throughout the year and that's kind of our historical trend. In particular, for H1 of this year, I mean, we continued to drive solid savings from our productivity initiatives on a gross basis. But these savings were somewhat offset by some of the cost headwinds that we've been facing, particularly in North America, as we've been investing heavily over the last couple of quarters to improve overall service levels, which we're pretty pleased that we're getting back to more normal levels as we exited Q2.  So having said that, as we go into the second half, I'd say a couple of things. We're going to have some of these incremental expenses behind us or largely behind us. And then secondly, we're going to have the pipeline, which is pretty strong at this stage, come through. So overall, that gives us the confidence of seeing around a little over $200 million of delivery in FORCE as we go into the second half. Operator : Our next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : First one for Nelson. Just kind of taking a step back, I would be interested to get your early impressions and perhaps maybe your 2 to 3 biggest priorities over the course of the year to ensure a smooth transition. Maria was, of course, very well thought of, but a fresh perspective can always bring to bear some new ideas and potentially some opportunities for shareholders. So I think your early observations would be helpful. And then I'd like to pivot to the cost outlook. Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. So Kevin, I mean, overall, a few things I would highlight. I mean, I'm pretty impressed by the team and the resilience of the team and the focus and the priorities and the strategic imperatives. I've been able to see that as I've been getting out there in the field and working through all the difficulties and challenges that we've been seeing. I think it's a very resilient organization. And there's very strong capability and muscle that's been built, which has allowed us to deliver the kind of results we're delivering as of the first half of the year in Q2. Secondly, I mean, one of my key priorities working with the team is to continue to push forward on the margin recovery. I mean, this is something that is critical for us and we're very focused on it from all angles. And we're going to do it in a smart way. We will continue to invest in the business. That is something that we've done in the first half of the year, and we've got to keep doing that because that's what will allow us to drive forward a sustainable, profitable growth as we progress. So overall, I'd say those are my key priorities at this moment. In terms of capital allocation and other elements, I don't have a different opinion versus where we're at today. I believe those are the right buckets where I stand today. And as we progress over the plans and what we've got for the future years, I mean, I'll -- we will come back with what we've got. Kevin Grundy : Got it. The quick follow-up is maybe just sort of go through your commodity exposures around energy, packaging, et cetera. Walk through your updated assumptions for us. What's driving the worst outlook there from a commodity perspective? And then relatedly to that, just your view on level of conservatism in the guidance. I think it's obviously been an extraordinary environment, so it's not necessarily fatigue as much as sort of an observation just in terms of maybe a greater level of conservatism to offset what continues to be a volatile environment. So kind of two parts there on the guidance. I'll pass it on after that. Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. So first, I mean, to cover the -- to give you a walk-through of the commodity update that we've got right now. And so as we pointed out in the remarks, I mean, we are calling now for the year a range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. At the midpoint, it's $1.5 billion. This is an increase of $300 million.  And what we're seeing is really first on fiber. Fiber, we're hitting all-time highs in Yook. As we exited June, we saw sequential growth in prices for Yook through the month of June, hit historical high in June. We're also seeing, in other pulp grades, elevated prices, and that's one of the key drivers behind what we're calling. Secondly, it's energy. If we think about energy and natural gas, in particular, we've seen in Europe a 10x versus a year ago in prices. And in our Western European U.K. business, which has a sizable tissue business, it is energy-intensive and that's bearing in kind of what we're projecting at this stage.  And then the other one is distribution costs. Overall, we're seeing distribution costs also increase. And I'd say this is more largely on the international side of the house, and this is reflecting and bearing on what we're showing in terms of our expectations at the midpoint of our guidance for costs.  A green shoot or a benefit we're beginning to see is in resins. I mean, that's probably the only big element within our cost bucket that we're beginning to see prices to come down on a sequential basis. And again, this is the one I'd highlight as I look at it. Overall, I'd like to -- I think it's also important to highlight that in a 2-year stack, we're staring at a $3 billion overall incremental cost, which is north of 1,500 basis points of margin that we're taking a hit as a business in 24 months. So it's quite sizable that we're managing through.  And then that takes me to your point around conservatism on the guidance. The first thing is we -- overall, in the bottom line and the EPS, we've made our best estimate based on what we're seeing today and what's playing out in the market. We've also taken into account all of the cost-saving initiatives, as I just talked about before, FORCE, and that's embedded in what we have here. And then lastly, it's also our pricing. We were very encouraged by how our pricing came through. Our teams did pretty well in terms of executing the pricing in the second quarter, which sequentially was much better than what we had in the first quarter. And that's the other element that would bear in how we would see the second half playing out. Michael Hsu : I'll just pipe in there, Kevin. I'd say on the guide -- and it's tougher since Nelson's still brand new, he doesn't have a calibration of how we add or at what kind of relative. But I'd probably say for the rest of our outlook, we feel confident that we're in that range. It is at the lower end of the range at this point. We feel that it's more likely to be in the lower end of the range.  I would say there's two probably big puts and takes, though. On the one end, there's one wildcard, which is additional input cost volatility. And so we're calling it based on what the input cost that Nelson just kind of talked about, right? So that's one big thing. And so that could shift up or down, right? And then the other wildcard probably is the volume side. And again, I think we have said that the volumes have come in slightly better than our original expectation, given all the pricing that we've taken.  We could do a touch better in the second half but that remains to be seen. There's been a lot going on in our volumes with cycling a winter storm in North America, COVID in and out, lockdown and all that. And so it's a little bit tough to call. But again, I'd say we feel like we're calling it down the middle here and we feel confident we're in the range. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Carey : Nelson, you commented on margins being a key focus of yours going forward. In KCP, we saw some sequential deterioration there, again despite the top line. I was wondering if you can give some insights on to what you think is needed based on your early analysis of the business there to return to historically what is more of a mid- to high teens margins or whether that target even looks realistic anymore. Nelson Urdaneta : Sure, Chris. And yes, absolutely, our targets and the way I've been looking at it are mid, long-term target margins for KCP remains unchanged at the high teens. I mean, we are aiming for that and we will get back. The plans are in place. I think it's important to recall that our KCP business has been the most impacted by COVID, I mean, including the reduced travel, the shift to remote hybrid work, and that's been bearing on the business.  The business has continued to recover with high single-digit top line growth, and washroom sales are already over 90% of pre-pandemic levels. In fact, in North America, it's even at the very high end. We're almost there in full-time -- full recovery. However, margins, as you said, I mean, did slide for Q2 a bit. But this was really a combination of 2 factors : one, we had the acceleration in commodities. Lots have been impacting tissue, which hit us in Q2. And then it's the timing of the pricing. I mean, we enacted pricing in Europe. North America went into effect in May, late May.  And I think it's important to highlight that on a sequential basis within the quarter, we actually saw an acceleration in gross margins in June. So this is really pointing to as the pricing is landing, we're seeing that the margins are recovering already in the latter part of the quarter, and we expect this to continue as we head into Q3 and Q4.  Also, as we go into the second half of the year and based on our current assumptions and what we know, we do expect the impact from commodities to tone down in the second half of the year versus what we saw in the first half of the year, even with the incremental costs that we've put in place.  The other bit is also important and I talked about it in productivity. The team has been focused very much in terms of rightsizing, managing the business and doing it the right way. There is a strong pipeline of productivity that should be coming through. And again, I remain encouraged by what the team is doing and our commitment to getting the business back to the high teens and where it's been in the past. Michael Hsu : Yes. I'll just tag on there, Chris. KCP is a great business for us, and I believe it remains a great growth opportunity for us overall. We are cycling demand volatility in the near term. But that professional market globally is big, it's fragmented and it's got a lot of underserved segments.  There's been a lot of noise in our demand because we've got a couple of things going on. Washroom is recovering. But because of COVID spikes and everything else, we're lapping big increases in PPE and gloves in the year-ago period and also our other parts of our safety business and wipers, right? So there's a lot of things going on. But overall, we still think there's a great growth opportunity.  I do think, if you look at offices, where we are a little -- have a bit more exposure, that business is probably not going to come all the way back to where it is. I don't think everybody is going back to work full-time 100% in office. And so that's going to change. But our attitude is, well, that's the base and we got to grow from there. And there's still a lot of opportunities for us to innovate and to serve our end users in a better way. Christopher Carey : That's very helpful. I just have a couple of questions on Europe and I'll jump back in. Just in the personal care business, it's the first quarter in a while, maybe 5 years, excluding the Texas storms, where volumes have gone negative. But it looks to be happening all almost entirely in Eastern Europe within the overall global personal care business. Can you just comment on what's going on in that market specifically and whether you think that headwind could persist here? And then just secondly, on the cost side in Western Europe, Nelson mentioned tissue businesses being very energy-intensive. Comment well taken. Just with natural gas availability looking like it could get even worse, given some news this week, can you maybe just talk about how you're framing or preparing for potential risk of force majeure because of lack of energy or paying any surcharges to procure low availability of natural gas? Just these types of situations seem to be coming ahead, so just curious your thoughts there. Michael Hsu : Chris, maybe I'll start on the personal care and then maybe Nelson can cover a little bit on the energy and the supply side. But overall, D&E, again, very strong price execution in the quarter, 8% organic. I think we are paying a little bit closer attention to the volumes because they are a little softer in our market shares across D&E. The majority or the bulk of the volume impact in D&E was Eastern Europe. And really, Chris, it's as straightforward as it's the effects of the war and the impact on Russia and the impact on Ukraine.  And so we are still operating well under those circumstances. But as you can imagine, the circumstances are pretty challenging. We remain operational across the region, including in Ukraine and building our business back in Ukraine. Organic is down low double digits as we curtailed operations in Russia. And we're actively building the business back in Ukraine, but we are actively and proactively compliant with all the sanction activity. And that obviously takes -- it has a bit of a volume impact on the business. So I don't know if that, Chris, addresses kind of what you're asking on the volume side. Christopher Carey : Yes, that was very helpful. Nelson Urdaneta : Right. And then to address the energy question, Chris, I mean, a couple of things. I mean, one, as we all know, the energy situation in Europe is pretty dynamic. And yes, the all-natural gas situation is something we're staying on top and developing contingency plans as we speak, and the team is really working thoroughly through it. We don't have details to share today but our teams are really on it and it is a priority for us. I will highlight, I mean, in Germany, we only have one factory. So again, it's not like we have a concentrated risk just in one of the key markets where this could be one of the biggest challenges at this point. Michael Hsu : Yes. The thing I'll tack on there though, Chris, in Western Europe, again, the operating conditions remain very challenging and volatile. I would say that our pricing and the volume and the organic was up low double digits, with price up double digits and volume up high single digits. So again, that's a developed market. I think the consumer is proving to be resilient. Our teams are doing a terrific job executing in what you're -- I'm sure you're familiar with being a very challenging environment. So again, we're paying close attention and the team is doing a very good job running in a tough environment. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Sorry. Thanks, I was on mute there. So I guess, just maybe you could build a little bit on the costs just to clean it up a little bit. So given where we are in the year, natural timing lags in the supply chain, your hedge positions, I guess my inclination is to say that your line of sight to the $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion in higher cost is now fairly well locked in. Is that the case? Or is it more that you still see realistic risk that the $1.4 billion, $1.6 billion could still shift around if we saw further cost volatility? And if so, is it the energy bucket that's the biggest swing factor? Or is it equal across energy and pulp and distribution? Michael Hsu : Yes, I might say locked-in is an interesting term because some of our biggest commodities, there's not a traded market for. Yes. That's the issue. Nelson Urdaneta : Right. So yes, so the thing there is there's not -- I mean, some of our key commodities are not as liquid as we'd have in the CME. So the reality is not all of this is locked in today. I think one of the important things to highlight is right now, based on where we're at and at the $1.5 billion midpoint, our forecast would call for $875 million already hit us in the first half and then $625 million would hit us in the second half based on what we know today, Steve.  Again, there's moving pieces. I mean, we do expect fiber to remain elevated based on what's out there and what's public. You can see it in the indices. And we would expect some easing as we go into the back half, Q4 of the year on the fiber side. That's what we're projecting at this moment. But again, it's a moving situation overall. Stephen Powers : Okay, okay. And so just -- so as you -- well, I guess that means that as your contract -- my impression is your contract for the next year on things like pulp and fiber, disproportionately, there's a contracting season. So your -- at this point, you're hoping for expecting some relief into that contracting season because I'm assuming that current prices are well above where you contracted in '21. Taryn Miller : Yes, Stephen, maybe I'll jump in here. On the -- we don't -- we do -- we have shared before that we have negotiated material prices. We don't reveal the specifics or disclose the specifics of those contracts. I think what's fair to say or reasonable to assume in the cost outlook, building on what Nelson said, is that again, based on our current assumptions, the fiber prices, we expect to remain elevated in Q3 before easing somewhat in the later part of Q4. I think energy and distribution, particularly international distribution, are the 2 that we're seeing some of the more volatility and we'll look through the balance of the year. And as Nelson said... Stephen Powers : Yes, that's helpful color. If I can just pivot on a different topic, we've talked a decent amount already at the start about consumers having or being expected to have a sharper focus on value going forward. And I guess maybe you talked about how that manifests in your categories and how you're pivoting to meet the consumer intersection of enhanced value.  I guess, just to get underneath that a bit more, do you see that more in consumer tissue versus personal care? And as you're moving in that direction and theoretically, competitors are moving in that direction, how do you balance the desire to kind of go where the puck's going versus pushing so hard on the value side of things that you actually entice trade-down and kind of create a problem that you might not have had if you and the whole industry had moved in that direction? Just how you think about that balance of going where the consumer is going but not necessarily enticing them to go there. Michael Hsu : Right. Great push, Steve. I mean, that's exactly the issue. And I think if you -- and when you listen to the earnings call from some of our big customers, I mean, I think they'll say the same thing, which is there is a segment of consumers, let's say, in a developed market like the U.S. that is trading down, but it's not all consumers. There may be a few more consumers that are more price-sensitive in the developing market where there is not the government subsidy in a tough time like COVID in, let's say, in Brazil as much as there was in the U.S. So consumer is a little more affected there. But I think that's right. We do see it across personal care and tissue. Typically in the U.S., in a market like the U.S., what you'll see is maybe the trade-down means maybe not trading the brand out but moving to a smaller count pack, right, to make it more affordable in the short term. And so -- and Lauren mentioned it earlier.  So there's a host of moves that we make in partnership with our customers to kind of shift in merchandise what's appropriate for the consumer. But again, I think we also want to be very cognizant that we don't want to move the whole market that way. And there are plenty of consumers that, I'd say, despite some of the impact of the economy, the affordability in our categories remains strong. And again, they're still looking to trade up.  And we're seeing the growth. It's kind of the old barbell description. We're seeing great growth on the high end as well. And we're continuing to innovate and promote our brands and advertise our brands on the high end. And that's what's rough in driving China. I'd say, again, super strong performance on mix, double-digit organic growth in the quarter against a category that's down multiple share point growth on diapers. And that's all driven by value-added consumer benefits. We've really upgraded our line over the last couple of years and feel great about the technology that we have in all of our key markets. And I think that's reflected in the momentum that we're seeing, let's say, in diapers when you look at all developed markets. I mean, we have multi-point share gains in our biggest markets. U.S. was up -- Huggies was up 3 points in the U.S. in the quarter. China was up almost 2 points. South Korea, for us, which is our second largest market, was up 4 share points in the quarter.  So again, I think we're skating -- as you say, skating to where the puck is. We want to be able to meet the consumer where they need us to be. And some are still looking for better quality and premiumization, and others are looking for us to extend them a better value and we're doing both. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Congrats on that market share momentum that you just referenced in personal care. Michael Hsu : Jason, I did want to note though, it's a little more slug -- I mean, we're under our goal because our goal is to be growing share in more than half of our markets. And the last couple of years, we're up in 2/3 of our markets. And so we're a little bit under half, right, just a couple of points under 50%. And so we're watching it closely. Well, we're up in developed. As I mentioned, we're seeing some pricing lagging across D&E, and so our price gaps have widened a little bit. And so we're keeping a close attention to that. Jason English : I appreciate that flag. And mostly -- so you're actually net lagging a little bit on that side of the business. It certainly seems like you're lagging on the Pro business, too, which I want to come back to. I know you referenced some choppiness in terms of like COVID comps. But even comparing to 2019, I think your volume is down now in the 20s versus high teens before. So we're kind of falling away and eroding versus 2019. Can you -- I appreciate that offices are a component, but it seems like office occupancy sequentially has gotten better, not worse. Why is your volume sequentially getting worse? What's -- can you help us understand what's happening within that business? Michael Hsu : Yes. A couple of things going on. One, I would say professional demand overall is improving. And so for the quarter, and I don't know if you saw the facts, but the organic was up high single digits overall. North America was up 8% and our D&E was up 6%. The washroom is recovering. I would say, though, there's a big component of pricing in that. So washroom sales were up 30% in the quarter.  And if you add on a dollar basis at 98% of pre-pandemic level, but I would say volumetric, it's still lagging, right? And because we have significant pricing in the last couple of years in Professional, so it reflects significant pricing but the volume is still soft. And again, I think -- as I would say, I don't think all that office demand is coming back in a minute. But that said, that's where our mix has been and we've got to grow from there.  And so we have a great team. We have great innovation. We have strong momentum and our share is up across the washroom business. We have an ICON dispenser which is a home run with end users. We have an improved towel offering. And so we're seeing strong momentum on the business. But I think you're right. I think we've got to build our business back. The other thing that's amplifying maybe the numbers that you're looking at, Jason, is we are cycling strong pandemic-related volume that was in wipers and PPE. I mean -- and gloves was a very significant seller for us in 2020 and 2021, and that's gone the other way this year. And so we have other effects going on as well. Jason English : For sure, for sure, which is why I'm trying just to like look at 2019 and look at the volume of that because I appreciate the noise. And back to your comment on some areas where you've got some price gaps that you're trying to manage. Are we at a point where you would expect to start to maybe give some of the pricing back to get a little more promotional juice into the market to try to manage those price gaps? Or is it not meaningful enough to have to start to do some those activities? Michael Hsu : I wouldn't say that yet. I mean, again, overall, the way I'll say it, Jason, is I'm prioritizing and Nelson is prioritizing margin recovery in the near term. And what I will tell the teams internally, the conversation is like, I'm not after renting hollow share, right? And so I don't really want to jerk our teams back and forth. We're trying to deliver balanced and sustainable growth for the long term. We have to get pricing to improve the margins and restore our margins. That's part one. We want to grow our shares over the long term sustainably over a long term. And so we're going to monitor that. But again, I'm not ready to shift back and forth quite yet. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So first one for Mike on pricing, and I know we obviously spend a lot of time on this call on this. But can you provide the magnitude of the new pricing announced in the U.S. last week? And if you embedded also more pricing in D&E where you took a pause now, given the elasticity is higher there, or even perhaps in Western Europe where the natural gas prices have been higher?  And one for Nelson and Taryn, a clarification on the cost outlook. Are you using mostly the contracted prices that Taryn mentioned? And then what's floating is based on spot prices because I think she also spoke and Nelson spoke about potentially using some declines ahead on the forward curve. So just making sure that we have the assumptions that you're working with. Michael Hsu : Okay. I'll start on the pricing, Andrea. Yes. If you track or go with the fact that we expect pricing to offset inflation over time, obviously, we'd like to get as much of that as soon as possible. And so if you looked over the course of the year, some of the pricing or inflation impacts hit outside of the U.S. earlier this year. And then more recently, there have been more impacts in the U.S.  And so I'd say our pricing around the world has kind of followed where the inflation is around the world more directly. We did announce pricing in the U.S. last week. It was typical for what we've done in prior rounds, which is about a mid-single-digit increase. And again, we're still in the early stages of execution on that. And then we've announced similar actions at different times throughout the year in the rest of our markets. Andrea Teixeira : Of similar magnitude, I'm assuming, or a higher magnitude? I'm assuming that TAM was higher? Michael Hsu : Yes. I would say Latin America, generally, overall, we're up double digits on price and so significantly higher. That reflects what's going on in the local market there. Nelson Urdaneta : Okay. And then on the question around what prices are we reflecting in terms of our outlook. I mean, we based it off industry forecast, Andrea. I mean, that's the best view we've got for whatever we haven't covered. So that's there. I mean, and that's what we're seeing and what we will reflect in the forecast at this stage. Andrea Teixeira : And Nelson, how much does it cover now, would you say, to track these prices and contracted prices? Or how much is floating, how much is saved? What change do you see? Nelson Urdaneta : Andrea, we don't disclose that bit so we don't get into disclosing that. Andrea Teixeira : Right. And one last, if I can, on China. And I'm sorry if I missed that. How much was the drag in the quarter for D&E? And what is -- with the reopening, how much has been improving or it hasn't been that big? You continue to be able to service, given that you are more spread than the other players? Michael Hsu : I'm not sure if I'm understanding the question correctly, but I'm saying -- I would say China was not a drag, it was a star in the quarter. It was up overall double digits in the quarter, and that was based on great diaper technology, great digital execution. Our share was up a couple of points. Organic was up in the mid-teens. And that's against the backdrop of a category that's been down high single digits over the last couple of years.  And that -- what's really driving it is robust balance of volume, mix and price. And so we feel really great about our China business. The team is doing an excellent job executing in a tough market. We were not impacted as much by the COVID lockdowns. I mean, everybody was impacted, but we have a very locally agile team that developed backup options for supply. Incidentally, our manufacturing operations were not in locations that were locked down, and so that may have been a little bit different for us than others. But again, we feel great about our China performance in the quarter. Andrea Teixeira : Yes. Congrats to the team. Operator : Our next question will come from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : So yes, I just kind of wanted to understand how we should think about the phasing of margin in the back half of the year or specifically how much of that remaining $625 million should hit in 3Q versus 4Q. And then I guess I just -- I appreciate the commentary around margin improvement. But previously, there seems to be some sort of expectation that we could potentially get to margin expansion at some point in the back half of the year. And I know it will take time to fully recover the margin. But based on where things stand today, when do you expect to see kind of margin expansion? Michael Hsu : Maybe I'll start, Peter. One, I would say, right now, we're prioritizing restoring our margins. I still remain confident that we'll be able to restore our margins and eventually expand our margins over time. I think I said that in January as well, but that was before we had additional -- I don't even know, $800 million of additional inflation in our forecast. And so again -- and I think that my confidence is still high that we'll be able to expand margins over time. But I guess I think the timetable shifts a little bit because there's a bigger nut to crack on that front. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. And adding to that, I mean, Peter, a couple of things. One, we did expand gross margins in Q2 by 40 basis points. I mean, we realized significant pricing already versus Q1. So we saw that sequential improvement in Q2. And as we head into the back half, and we don't give guidance on quarterly margins, but we remain confident that based on what we know today, we will continue to expand margins.  I mean, the plans are in place. As a reminder, we will continue to realize pricing. And based on what we've got today and what we saw in Q2, that will play out in the second half. Secondly, we've got our FORCE cost savings, which will accelerate in the back half versus what we saw in the first half, and that's the second component.  And then as you said, there is a more subdued year-over-year impact of the commodities in the back half. So we'll see, as you mentioned, $625 million, which I'm not going to give the breakdown between Q3 and Q4, but we'll see that in the back half versus the $875 million that we saw in the first half. So that gives us the confidence based on what we see, that we will see progressive margin improvement in the second half. Michael Hsu : Yes. And I feel like, Peter, that our team has made great progress on pricing and margin recovery, even if it may not show up on the operating number. But for the quarter, our pricing didn't offset inflation overall, and I think that was strong progress. Now the additional work for us is, yes, the inflation forecast got bigger for the balance of the year and so we've got to solve that as well.  But overall, we feel good about our progress. We know there's more work to do. We're still confident we'll be able to expand our margins over time. And then in addition, we all know commodities are going to revert and they always do. And when we do that, we're not going to rely on reversion for our margin expansion. But when it does do, it will accelerate our time line. Peter Grom : That's super helpful. And then I guess maybe following up on that. I wanted to ask about how we should think about pricing and promotion, should we actually reach a deflationary environment. And I know historically, you've kind of held on to pricing as you don't typically price to peak inflation. But I just would be curious, just given the amount of pricing that's been taken over the past year, 1.5 years, and kind of layering in that retail pressure that Dara was alluding to earlier, I mean, what, if anything, do you think could be different this time around? Michael Hsu : Well, I think, Peter, the big thing is pricing promotion, there's a lot of things going on. But one, you're using it to support the brands. And for me, typically, that would be to support great innovation that you're launching that I find tends to grow the category a little bit more effectively. And what we're really after is overall category growth, and that's what the retailers are after as well. And so for me, pricing and promotion is a component, not an end-all. It's a component of an overall strategy or growth strategy for the business.  That said, there are fixed costs in this industry, and so volume does matter and so there's a tactical application of that. But if you look at the market, I think the input cost levels are so high. While promotion is, I would call it, at typical level, the depths are probably a little shallower than historically they've been. And I think that's reflective of the cost environment that the industry is working in. I don't know if that really addresses what you're asking. Peter Grom : No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over for closing remarks. Taryn Miller : Great. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on the call, and this will conclude our call for our second quarter earnings release.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Brian Ezzell. Please go ahead. Brian Ezzell : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Nelson Urdaneta, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we issued our earnings news release and published prepared management remarks from Mike and Nelson that summarized our third quarter results and 2022 outlook. Both documents are available in the Investors section of our website. In just a moment, Mike will share opening comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K and our latest 10-Q for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We may also refer to adjusted results and outlook, both of which exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has additional information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.  And now, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike Hsu : All right. Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Our teams around the world continue to execute strongly in what remains a dynamic and challenging environment. I'm pleased with our continued organic sales growth momentum with 5% growth in the third quarter, reflecting broad gains in all of our segments. Our third quarter results also reflect ongoing volatility in the operating environment, which continue to pressure operating margin and earnings. Throughout the year, we've taken decisive action to offset persistent inflation with pricing and cost savings. We're making progress as those initiatives enabled sequential expansion of gross and operating margins in the quarter.  As we near the close of 2022, we're maintaining our sales and earnings outlook for the year. We continue to manage our business with discipline and remain confident we'll restore our margins over time. We're executing our growth strategy to elevate our categories and expand our markets by putting the consumers front and center. We'll continue to invest in innovation and our commercial programs to continually sharpen the value proposition of our brands. We're committed to delivering balanced and sustainable growth over the long term as we work to fulfill our purpose of Better Care for a Better World. With that, we're ready to address your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I was hoping if we could just start out with an update on the input cost outlook. You've held the outlook for the year. There's one quarter to go. But just we see -- what we see, it looks like pulp is kind of flattening out in terms of market data, but there are industry participants that have sort of said otherwise. We've gotten a lot of questions in the last few weeks about European energy prices, how that impacts your business? So any color you can provide would be great. And also, I know it's early, but looking into 2023 as well. Mike Hsu : Yes. I'll start maybe and Nelson will give you his perspective. But overall, I'd say it's stabilizing but at the high level, and we're still experiencing some volatility. So I don't know if Nelson, you want to give a little more texture. Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. And Lauren, I mean, a few things there. I mean we've held our guidance for the full year in the $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. And it's important to note that through the first nine months of the year, we've seen about $1.2 billion of these costs materialize. We did see sequential improvement in terms of the impact as we lap last year's $1 billion out of the $1.5 billion that impacted us in the second half of the year. So for the quarter, you would have seen a $360 million commodity impact versus $470 million in Q1 and $405 million in Q2. So the trend that we had talked about is playing out in Q3.  Secondly, overall, we're not calling down because the reality is commodities remain elevated. The environment remains quite challenging, and we're maneuvering through it.  We've seen overall a few dynamics that I'd like to highlight. First, on the pulp and fiber components, prices remain pretty elevated. Eucalyptus is trading today at around $1,600. That's an all-time high. And we -- while the market is projecting for some easing at the end of this year, we have yet to see that play out. If we look at distribution costs, those remain challenging as well, especially on the international front. We have seen some giving up a prices on spot transportation in North America, but still, that's not offsetting the overall challenges we're seeing on a global basis. So net-net, we remain at the guidance that we had provided. And the messages I would say in terms of next year, right now, it's too early for us to provide any guidance on 2023. We'd still have the full year to play out.  But a few thoughts that I'd share. One, we remain at historical highs in the whole commodity and cost structure. As a reminder, on a two-year stack, with $3 billion at the midpoint of our guidance today. And again, we have not seen any meaningful move versus our assumptions that we gave you back in July. Secondly, ForEx markets. We have seen, and you see it in our -- in the deconstruction of our numbers. ForEx has become more volatile and challenging. And as a reminder, we have about 1/3 of our profits coming from overseas. So that is something that we are taking into account in our outlook, but we will have to carefully watch as we think about next year. The underlying business environment remains volatile. As Mike said in his opening remarks, we're managing through it, but it's something we will take into account again over the next few months as we prep up to give you guidance in January when we talk about Q4. Mike Hsu : All right, Lauren, you may have gotten more than you bargained for on that question. Lauren Lieberman : No, it's great. I'll always take it. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : A question for me, just kind of zooming out a bit, Mike, just observations on kind of the elephant in the room, right? Observations on consumer demand and then elasticities. I guess as we kind of look at the quarter, elasticities are a bit better in tissue and towel, worse in Personal Care, at least versus our model. So maybe just comment on what you're seeing from a consumer perspective, any signs of consumer weakness that are at all worrisome to you? And then maybe you could just share your own thoughts on how the elasticities in the quarter came in relative to your own expectations and thoughts as we look ahead. Mike Hsu : Okay. Yes, Kevin, you have to guide me a little bit. I've got a lot of thoughts here. So I'll give you a few things. I mean, one, I do want to emphasize, I feel very good about our strong execution of our strategy in what remains a very challenging and dynamic environment. The continued organic momentum I feel very good about. Obviously, we were a little soft on North American Personal Care, which I can come back to you, but that was -- I think consumption was fine. It was more around some inventory changes cycling some supply constraints that we had last year. But overall, I think we had excellent execution of our pricing initiatives globally and great brand support through our commercial programs. I think it was in the prepared remarks, but high single digit across all developed markets, high single to double-digit growth across all key D&E markets. And then North America, as you saw, was down too because of some of the supply changes.  On top of that, I'd say we feel very good about our share performance. We're up or even in about half of our categories, a little bit more than that in Personal Care. And we were very fast on pricing. We've been very decisive on pricing all year. And so we knew we're going to give up a little share in the near term. And it does look like our share performance is improving in the latest quarter. And so we like where the trends are going and feel good about that. And then lastly, I'd say, on the overall environment, we're navigating some shipment volatility, particularly in North America because of the Texas storm and everything that happened last year. So that's kind of the overall on us.  And then with regard to the consumer, I would say, overall, I feel like the consumer remains resilient, but we are increasingly seeing some bifurcation in demand. And I don't know if I like that word, but it's -- I'm just trying to describe that we're seeing two different patterns emerge. And it's mostly along, as you would expect, having socioeconomic lines. I mean, certainly -- hence we do the research in a developed market like in North America, there's a broad swath of consumers that their savings are still higher than they were three years ago. They're employed. And while they may be curtailing some big ticket purchases in our categories, which are essentials, we're not seeing a discernible change in behavior there. However, there's about 40% of the population in the U.S. that is more living paycheck to paycheck. I grew up in one of those households and I know what it's like. And so we are seeing some changes in the consumption patterns, whether that is buying lower count packs or trading down a bit.  But I would say the important thing for us is to recognize that we're trying to serve our consumers and meet them where they need us, and that's both sets of consumers. And so our premium business continues to grow and do well. And then we've got a -- we've got a make sure that we're addressing the right value -- having the right value proposition for the value -- more value oriented consumers. So there is some, I would say, bifurcation. We saw that happen about three years ago in a lot of markets in D&E, but we are seeing a little bit more of that in developed markets. I'll pause there, Kevin, anything\u2026? Kevin Grundy : I'm sure there's a number of other questions into queue, Mike. That's really helpful. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Christopher Carey : I just wanted to follow up on that line of questioning around volumes, specifically in Personal Care, but perhaps from a bit different angle. It's harder for us to see, but just taking what you said about commodities and what we know about pricing, it doesn't look like you've experienced much notable volume deleverage to gross margins this quarter from the weaker volumes, but certainly, the operating margin performance was different. Can you just frame how do you think weaker volumes to the extent that sustains are expected to impact your P&L as you go forward, specifically between the gross and operating margin line. And just connected to that, how you would envision addressing some of the weaker volume performance that we've seen, whether in demand building? Or is it simply that your algorithm will change between pricing and volume such that you're still achieving your overall organic sales growth objectives. Mike Hsu : Yes. Let me start and maybe Nelson can talk -- give you some more of the texture. But I'll start with -- let me unpack the volume performance, particularly, I think it's probably -- everyone's probably got a question about North American Personal Care. And I'll say our North America team is doing a great job navigating what I would call excess volatility in demand. And really I think we put this in the remarks, consumption remains stable. And so just for reference, Chris, in the third quarter, our all-outlet consumption, which I don't think you see, we were up 4 in diapers on consumption, 9 in adult care and 16 in fem care. And the real fact is, and I mentioned before, the storm that occurred in Texas last January, February, shut us down for a few weeks in early Q1 and created a lot of volatility in shipments.  I'll give you a sense of the volatility. If I go back to the fourth quarter of 2020 and then give you other quarters, just in diapers, our consumption in December of 2020 was -- or the fourth quarter was plus 6. Then we were minus 7 in the first quarter, plus 7, plus 8, plus 18, plus 14 and then plus 6 last quarter. So you could see there's been a lot of movement. And I would say, it took us a while to recover from our supply constraints. You would think that being down for a couple of weeks, there was more of the roll through it because we had material supply issues as well. And so we were on allocation for most of last year. And so what happened in this quarter is you can see our consumption was stable, but we were cycling, I would say, elevated shipments in the year ago period as retailers were rebuilding their inventories following -- being on allocation.  So overall, I feel very good about our offering across Personal Care, as you can see by the consumption numbers. I do expect some ongoing volatility in demand as we continue to work through various supply challenges and cycle some of the things that happened last year. And then in terms of the volume deleverage, yes, certainly, yes, we're -- fixed costs are a big component of our P&L. So we're close to that. Again, I would say I'm not expecting in Personal Care North American ongoing volume issue. This is, I would say, more of a one-timer. And then globally, we feel very good about our volume performance and our elasticities have held up to the model in general. D&E, our volumes were down high single digit. We think most of that was concentrated understandably in Eastern Europe, given the conditions that are happening there. And so overall, I think we're feeling good about our volume performance. But Nelson, you want to give us some more Nelson Urdaneta : No, absolutely. So a couple of things there that I would highlight, Chris. I mean, one, the pricing realization that we had in the quarter really accelerated. So that's flowing through. And you can see that in the margins, which you rightfully point out. And that is something that we were talking about back in July based on the pricing actions that we had taken midway in the latter part of Q2 and also in Q3. So that's more than helping offset some of the deleverage that you would see on the overall business. Secondly, we begin to lap some of the commodity increases from last year, not that commodities are deflating, but they begin to not be as high in terms of the impact year-on-year. And those two are playing out for us to have for the first time in several quarters, a net pricing -- favorable realization net of commodities and ForEx. That's one thing.  Secondly, if you look at our segments, the only segment where we saw a drop in margins for the quarter was really Personal Care. And that had to do with one, the one-offs that Mike's talked about, and we factored in some of those as we go into Q4, but some of those, we do expect to maintain as we go there. But then secondly was the fact that, yes, we had a little bit of a mix as well in there because North America Personal Care is our most profitable region within the segment in Personal Care. So that factored in into that one, which would have been that. Obviously, we continue to be very watchful of overall costs and fixed costs. And the teams are doing all the actions necessary to ensure we address that. Christopher Carey : If I could just on just how you would addition addressing some of the volume pressure appreciating that there were certain dynamics in the quarter, which will fade as we go forward because of the base period, but just philosophy on addressing volumes. I know there's been some debate in recent quarters just around what is the right promotional levels and requirements for demand building. So perhaps you could just contextualize how you would look at supporting volumes over a sort of more medium-term horizon? Mike Hsu : Yes. Chris, again, I feel very good about our commercial execution around the world. I mean we have we had strong innovation this year. I feel great about our line-up for next year even though we're not talking about next year yet. But -- and I think we feel very good about our advertising. Our digital investments are working very hard for us. And then our sales execution has been very, very strong around the world. And so overall, I think our commercial programs overall are working as intended. We're going to keep a close eye on the promotional environment, though.  I'll comment in terms of North America, I would say the environment at this point remains fairly typical, and that's kind of -- it's rebounded from being I would say, more suppressed during the peak years of COVID and is now, I would say, normalized in terms of promotional frequency, may be still a little lower on depth. And frankly, we're not going to drive our business by driving depth. It doesn't fit with our high road approach to building the brand. And so -- but we're prepared.  And one thing I'll add, though, too, is I think we're being prudent in developing the right kind of action plans in the case of a more environment. And so as I mentioned, we're going to -- our strategy is to elevate and premiumize our categories over time. That is exactly the right long-term strategy. And I think that's going to be our strategy for a long time to come. That said, we recognize the environment we're operating in, and we've been very good at running, I would say, more value plays when necessary. But our goal is to make those productive and profitable as well while addressing the needs that the consumers have. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : And apologies, you may have been talking a little bit about this with Chris. I got called away from the call for a brief second there. But -- just as you march from 3Q to 4Q, it implies, I think, either a lot of SG&A leverage or a really big step-up in gross margin sequentially and year-over-year. And I guess I'm just -- I guess will play that back to you and figure out kind of what the main drivers are? Because I get that the inflation gets a little bit less impactful as you go through Q4, FORCE picks up. But it just seems like you need some other variables to really move the needle as much as I think is implied in the guidance. I just want to play that back to you. Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. So Steve, I mean, a couple of things I would highlight. I think first, I'd start by reiterating what happened in Q3, and you would have seen an acceleration in overall pricing realization. And as you mentioned, our expectation, which played out in Q3 of the year-over-year impact of commodities beginning to subside even though they remain elevated. So as we look into Q4, our outlook in which there is an implied step up like what we saw in Q3, the drivers behind it would be, first, is around pricing realization. As a reminder, we've implemented additional pricing actions in the third quarter, and those will be fully realized as we go into the fourth quarter. So we do expect in the fourth quarter another step-up in terms of price realization as we look at our overall outlook. So that should be playing out in the quarter.  Secondly, would be on our FORCE productivity savings. In the third quarter, we delivered $80 million of FORCE savings, which is an acceleration of around $30 million versus the average we were delivering in Q1 and in Q2. We expect this trend to continue going into Q4.  And then last but not least, is stabilized input cost inflation. Again, this does not mean that we expect overall cost to come down. It's more of the year-over-year impact. As of today, we have a year-to-date impact of around $1.2 billion in commodities. And at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion for the full year, this would imply that for Q4, we should see another quarter of a reduction sequentially in terms of overall input cost inflation.  So when you combine those three, that's what gives us the building blocks for the continued step-up sequentially quarter-over-quarter on EPS for the fourth quarter. I think it's also important to note that for the full year at the midpoint of our cost guidance, we are at around $1.5 billion of input cost inflation. And as we exit the year, we expect to more than fully offset not just the commodity impact, but also the ForEx based on our current assumptions and what we've modeled out. So that is something that will be playing out in Q4. Steve Powers : Okay. Yes, that makes sense. That's helpful. I guess the other thing that I wanted to ask about, and I appreciate that '23 is a long way away. You're not really talking about it. But consensus estimates have the company delivering above algorithm EPS growth next year, which I think implies that the price realization that you just spoke to continues to hold even as you get some relief on costs. And I wanted to get your perspective on just your comfort level with that level of assumption as you look at it. And especially in the context of -- I appreciate what you said earlier about sort of the timing impacts in North America and how that impacted shipments. But we are watching those private label shares in Personal Care, specifically diapers pick up. Hopefully, that gets better. But as you push through more price and the consumer potentially degrades from a confidence perspective, concerns about that, those share trends not rebounding. And it just -- it speaks to if the deflationary backdrop does play out next year, do you have to roll back some of this price. So a lot in there, but just really thinking about the consumer demand trends, your pricing trends, net of commodities and just some perspective on your comfort level with consensus being above algo next year? Mike Hsu : Yes, Steve, maybe my comfort level is probably not comfortable addressing what '23 looks like yet. And I hate to do that. But I think the underlying is because of what we're seeing right now in the marketplace, which is, one, the volatility in the marketplace, which we experienced in Q3 and it's going to continue; and then the other part is we're still rolling out our plans. And so I really feel would love to comment, but I don't feel like in a place where it would be reasonable for us to comment at this point. I don't Nelson, if you have a different... Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. No, I fully agree, Mike. And as I said to Lauren in terms of her ask, one of the variables that, again, we're looking into today as we build plans and everything is where we stand today. And the reality is commodities have not subsided. They remain pretty elevated, and ForEx is becoming and has become a bit of a challenge as we look forward. We've got 3 months to go for the year, but it's a variable that we're going to have to take into account, Steve, as we look forward, too. So again, too early for us to comment, but those would be kind of my thoughts in terms of where we stand today. Mike Hsu : Yes. The thing I'll add, Steve, though, is we are continuing to manage our business with discipline, and we remain confident we'll restore our margins over time. I mean as Nelson pointed out, we've taken on over the last two years $3 billion of inflation, that's 1,500 basis points of gross margin, which is a lot. And we've taken decisive action. And the good news is, and we -- for the third quarter, our pricing fully offset inflation plus FX in the quarter. And so we do continue to expect sequential improvement. Commodities also -- as people who have been following us for a long time, commodities will eventually revert. We're not counting on that for our margin recovery. But when that does happen, that will likely accelerate our leverage. So we're taking a thoughtful holistic approach to mitigating inflation and running our business. And hopefully, you all appreciate that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English : A couple of real quick housekeeping questions here. For guidance, I appreciate you reiterated EPS, but you didn't provide an update on your EBIT outlook. Can you provide that now? Has it changed at all? Nelson Urdaneta : No, no. In general, it remains where we're at. Jason English : Excellent. And then, productivity. You have a nice uptick in the fourth quarter implied by the full year guide here on FORCE savings. What's driving the And would it be unreasonable for us to look at that and assume that, that run rate continues through next year, therefore, implying that what was under delivery this year is going to be followed by over next? Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. So a quick one there, Jason. As we've said in the past, FORCE is not necessarily a straight line. We've never seen that in the past, and I don't project that that's going to happen in the future, because it builds up over the year, and we do see ups and downs. Because remember, it is a net number. So it does build some of the -- some headwinds and costs that we might be facing. As you indicated, there is a step-up in Q4. And to me, the key to look at is what happened in Q3. In Q3, we delivered $80 million versus an average for Q1 and Q2 that was below $50 million. So the acceleration was there, and we delivered year-to-date $175 million.  We expect to see further delivery in Q4 based on the strong pipeline of productivity that our teams have across the globe. As we look into next year, yes, the teams are building up the gross productivity pipeline, and I'll stress that gross productivity pipeline. And again, we will be walking through the delivery as we go through next year. But I can't -- and I would not commit to whatever run rate we have exiting this year and Q3 being what we see in the first couple of quarters of next year. It's too early to say, Jason. Mike Hsu : The thing I'll emphasize is, yes, it is a net number. And so our gross productivity has continued to climb. I think our teams are doing really a fantastic job driving the productivity. The issue we have is the inflation isn't just in our inputs. It happens in all places of the P&L. And so some of it, unfortunately, gets nets out. So I could complain teams around their overall nativity, but that's kind of like complaining about like trucking lane rates or -- I mean, we don't like them, but some of that is not in their fully under control. And so we have to navigate that. That's why we have to drive our gross savings higher. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Just a couple of questions. Mike, can also -- if you can elaborate a little bit more on the price elasticity that are embedding in your guidance for 4Q. I understand that, obviously, it implies a huge decline in organic sales. And I do understand the comp for Personal Care. I believe it was 11% last year in the same period. So I was wondering if you can comment, it does look like your pricing at least in the Nielsen data seems a bit below peers. So I was wondering if there is anything embedded there in terms of promotions or -- and part of the also question on promo is your SG&A, is there anything that you'd call out specific in the quarter, if that's recurring into the fourth quarter? And then if there is any phasing or timing of it that you pulled from the fourth into the third? And then lastly, just a clarification on Suzano's deal. Are you getting any proceeds from the sale of Neve and the sale of the Mogi plant? So I was wondering if there is anything related to that or the royalties will pay off over time and you were going to be puts and takes on those on HSC material, so not the companies provided material for you and for Suzano? Mike Hsu : Okay. All right. That's great list of questions. And so let me try to tackle 1 between Nelson and I will team here. First of all, on the -- I think on the pricing versus peers, I think probably what you're seeing is the fact that we were out fastest generally in pricing in most markets. And so if you're seeing a lag there because we've already started cycling our pricing a year ago. I mean the reality is, I think, in general, we've priced, I would say, very early, we moved very quickly on pricing last year. And I would say we also moved at higher levels than a lot of our competitors. And so -- and the reference for that is -- I think we've had a price gap, meaning we've been ahead on price on Huggies all year until I would say recently, maybe in the last couple of weeks or so.  So overall, I think our pricing is in line with where we set it. And I think the good news, Andrea, is that in general, in most markets, we are seeing the market -- rest of market pricing kind of move generally in the direction that we've moved. That's not the case in all areas and -- but generally, that's kind of my overall take.  In terms of elasticity, I'd say in the first half, I think the volume performance really outdrove the elasticity models. And I think that's where I think the consumers are feeling confident. You remember all the unemployment reports and stimulus and all those other things that were driving consumer confidence. I have seen a change in that in some markets. And so at this point, the elasticities that we're seeing are more \"normalized\" or what we originally modeled. And so we are seeing a bit more volume come out in relation to all the pricing. That's notable. And I would -- from my earlier comments on maybe the bifurcation, it's coming out a little bit more on more of the value-oriented tiers, let's say, Snug & Dry diapers for us, which is our value tier diaper in the U.S. or Scott 1000. So those are some things that we're going to pay closer attention to and make sure that we're managing the business in the appropriate way to serve our consumers where they need us. So again, that's the overall take. I don't know if -- I know there's a couple of other questions. I think Nelson will address some. But did that answer kind of the first part? Andrea Teixeira : Yes. No, absolutely. That's super helpful. And the SG&A part, the component of that is just understanding as you try to scaffold and be more kind of conscious about that consumer that is stretched, is there anything that we should know of? Like I think the SG&A -- your GM, gross margin came in, I think, better than anticipated, but your SG&A was a bit higher. Is there anything that we should be aware of in terms of phasing of promo or marketing spend that's -- or is just inflation in general across all lines? Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. Andrea, let me address that. So first, I think the important thing to look at is spending in absolute dollars for the third quarter for between the lines, which includes our SG&A and our advertising and promotion was roughly in line with what we saw in Q1 and Q2. So there was really not a big step-up or change sequentially throughout the year. The thing that would have -- that you would have seen is an expansion in terms of percent year-over-year in terms of the between lines, and that was really driven largely because of last year's onetime adjustment to incentive compensation, which we talked about at the third quarter earnings call. So that was the lion's share of the change. It was a onetime we were lapping. Absent that, as we've been saying all year long, we are continuing to invest behind the business. It's the right thing to do.  As Mike has said, we are fully committed to sustainable and long-term balanced profitable growth. And the only way to achieve this is to continue to invest in the business. We are investing behind our brands. We're investing behind innovation. We're investing behind capabilities and our people to ensure that we're there to go forward. Those investments are there, and we've continued to make them, but there was no particular step-up in Q3 versus Q2 or Q1. Andrea Teixeira : Okay. That's fair, thank you. And on the Suzano deal? Mike Hsu : Yes. I'll let me make a couple of comments, not exactly your question, but I did want to address a couple of things related to the resulted tissue agreement. Overall, Andrea, hopefully, you'll recognize it's consistent with our overall approach that we've been talking about on portfolio management. I really believe we have a long runway of growth ahead of us in our categories and our markets. And we're going to pursue on the plus side, markets and adjacencies that are going to be accretive to our growth in margin. And I've always said for a few years now that we'll consider exits in businesses that are not accretive to our growth and/or margin profile that we expect. So this transaction specifically enables us to focus on our faster-growing, higher-margin Personal Care business in Brazil and creates a better future for both the Neve brand and the tissue business -- the Brazilian tissue business. The Neve business in combination with Suzano is really going to be better positioned to adapt to the unique dynamics of the local market. And we fully expect our partnership -- strong partnership with Suzano to continue well. I'll defer to Nelson. I don't think we're ready to comment on any specifics related to the transaction and... Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. No, absolutely. And again, the only thing I would say is overall revenue from this -- from the transaction that's being divested is just around the 1% level, and profits are immaterial. So -- but other than that, we're not going to be disclosing any terms at this stage. Operator : Our next question comes from Anna Lizzul of Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : Just regarding the consumer sensitivity to pricing at this point. I wanted to follow up on your comment on consumer bifurcation. Are you seeing premiumization holding up well in certain categories versus consumers and others? And -- are you seeing any specific products holding up well, which indicate consumers are willing to continue to pay for premium solutions despite a more challenging inflationary environment. Mike Hsu : Yes, I would say -- and it's less differences by category. I would say, in general, where we're driving premiumization is generally working across markets. And so not specific there. I think it is more typically by sub-brand or sub-line or what we might call internally our tiers, right? Like the value tiers tend to be a little bit more price sensitive in this environment because, as I was mentioning earlier, there are a significant number of households, let's say, in the U.S. that are -- have less to spend now given all the inflation that's occurred over the last couple of years or so. So I think it's more on a sub-brand basis or a tier basis in our vernacular -- and that's where I say, working to continue to drive our premiumization strategy or creating more value through our premium products. We feel great about our innovation line-up this year. As I mentioned, we've got a lot of more coming next year with great features that I think consumers are really going to like.  That said, we're also making the right adjustments as we said earlier, that to prepare for a recessionary footing if needed. And that means that emphasizing the great value that our brands offer. And in some cases, we will make some adjustments, whether that's related to pack count or sizing or something along those lines to make sure that consumers have the right pack and affordability that they need. Anna Lizzul : Great. Any specific product lines you can call out as seeing resilience in those? Mike Hsu : Well, Huggies. Again, I think we feel great about our diaper line up, our adult care line-up in North America. But if you go around diapers, China, we continue to have mid- to high single-digit growth, double-digit growth in feminine care. And so we feel good about that. Latin America, where consumers are very value-oriented because of what's happening in the economy the last few years and our organic performance was up strong double digits in the quarter. So overall, across our markets, we saw strong organic growth, and that's because we feel that we've continued to improve the products. At the same time, we are recognizing that we are taking price to offset the commodity headwinds. Operator : Our next question comes from Javier Escalante of Evercore Javier Escalante : I would like to come back to the U.S. And if you can, Mike, comment on how you see retailers approaching pricing and the profitability of their own private label operations in tissue versus diapers? And I have a follow-up. Mike Hsu : Yes. Javier, welcome to our coverage, and we appreciate it. And this is something I've talked about over the years. We have a very productive and collaborative relationship with our retail partners. And I've been doing this for 30 years and been through many cycles. And so we approach it and notably, let's say, in the U.S. I think the big change that occurred for us at over the last 10 years is we recognize we had to clean up our own house. We've been very focused on growing the categories and working with our retail partners to grow the categories the right way I mean we're really proud to note that in the survey for the first time, we were rated #1 as a customer organization and #1 across most disciplines because I think our customers' view that we've been working with them in a partner-like fashion. Funny aside, I will say, in the first quarter of last year, I think our service levels in diapers was below -- far below 50%, and somehow in other of these publications rated us #1 on logistics last year. And so I think that does reflect kind of the way we work with them.  And so when you take that, I would say, we generally approach business planning with our customers on a growth basis for both their sales growth and their profit growth, and we pay attention to their margins as much as we pay attention to ours. And so for us, we're working for win-wins. And so I wouldn't say regarding, let's say, for your question, whether it's diapers or private label, anything different that we're seeing in terms of the profit play of them trying to change distribution or emphasize different lines. But we are very cognizant that we're trying to deliver an overall category growth plan and own our part of that. And because of that, that's kind of how we manage the plan.  And so -- and then with regard to price sensitivity, yes, I mean there's been a lot of price coming at it. We have a fair number of customers that skew more toward value shoppers and that's their role to -- in their minds, serve the shopper as well, and so we understand that. And so we're willing to work with them. But we recognize also there has been a lot of price in the marketplace at a necessity. And so the important thing is we feel like we have to recover they recognize that they need to deliver margins and growth the same way that we do. And so we're going to continually work for ways to find the win-win and grow the categories the right way. Javier Escalante : That's great to know. And then basically, Mike, again, on tissue versus diapers, you feel I mean, from the outside, that Scott is very clearly positioned on the value side. Huggies has been premium and I appreciate that you mentioned that I believe a competitor just follow price increases and that we do not have an all-channel view. But if you can walk again on the drivers of your confidence that Huggies didn't take too much pricing and you are competitive on the pricing front vis-a-vis your main branded competitor and private label because in our data, we do not see private label following price increases Mike Hsu : Yes. Huggies, I wouldn't say -- again, I would -- correct, we've priced, as I said, our goal is to restore margins and eventually expand margins over time. So we've priced accordingly with the right discipline and we're very cognizant of our product offering and our line-up and our commercial programming. And one of the reasons we've priced is that -- and I think we've talked about this with our customers is we feel like it's our role to help grow the category and drive category growth, and that requires marketing. I've worked in other categories that when they pulled back the categories commoditized, and that's not a good place for brands. And so we've been very disciplined about that.  So what I did say is that we felt like we had a price gap or we advanced pricing further and faster than some of our other competitors earlier this year, and last year as well. And so there was a bit of a gap. That gap is now -- I think that's basically closed over the last few weeks. And so -- so we would probably see -- anticipate slightly better performance on Huggies. And again, we feel very good about our innovation line-up, the value we're offering to consumers. We are going to pay a little more attention to Snug & Dry, which, Javier, is our value tier in the U.S. And so make sure that, that has the right accounts and the right price points on shelf that can compete effectively. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Just for a quick follow-up. Earlier in the call, you mentioned that you thought promotional activity was back to something like normal, let's say, pre-COVID normal. And I look at -- the data providers, Nielsen IRI have this measure of merchandising that would seem to indicate across the company in the U.S. anyway that that merchandise was still several points. So it's like mid-30s, but the measure they use, and now it's like high 20s or something that it off a low of like 20% when at the peak of demand. So any comment you can give us about the likely shape of that and impact restored promotional activity might have on demand?  And secondly -- that's a follow-up. And secondly, related question maybe. Procter talked last week about household inventory. And I know different companies have different ways of measuring that. Earlier, you mentioned something about all channel consumption. I'm thinking that's still a takeaway data -- measure. But if you have any color about where you think household inventory stand U.S., globally and what impact that's having on potential future demand in '23. Appreciate it. Mike Hsu : Yes. So a couple of things in there. I mean -- and I would say, well, if you go into Nielsen and longer, but I used to be the highest user of Nielsen throughout my career. So there are so many variables that are related to promotional -- measuring promotion. And so -- so what I said earlier, Jonathan, was frequency kind of returned to normal in tissue probably in 2020, the third quarter were -- but maybe by the end of last year. And then in Personal Care, I would say, at the beginning of this year, and that's in terms of frequency. The volume -- and I would say the other key measure is depth. And I would say depth is shallower both in Personal Care and tissue than it historically had been and remains so. And I think that's an artifact of all the inflation that all the companies are seeing. And then if you look at the percent of volumes sold on promotion, it's a little bit lower, right, slightly lower, which is, I think, corresponds to what you were looking at. So overall, that's why I say I put promotion \"normalized\" but it's probably still a little bit lower than historical at this point. So that was, I think, part 1. And then any follow-up to that, Jonathan? Jonathan Feeney : No, that makes a lot of sense to me. I also confess to spending way too much time with syndicated data. So it's nice to have a\u2026 Mike Hsu : No, no. I'm proud. I feel like I invented half of these measures. So -- but... Jonathan Feeney : You probably did. Mike Hsu : The other side that you asked about was inventories. I mean there's a couple of points. Certainly, I mentioned earlier, we are cycling some retailer inventory build back. And at the same time, and I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, there was some retail inventory reductions late in the quarter. And so that was a topic that came up at the last investment conference that I was at. And so that remains out there. And I would say that it's typically the case. Every other year or maybe every year retail inventory changes, and that's part of what we get paid to manage on.  In terms of the household inventories, we think they've reverted back to normal. There was -- and really where it was really relevant was on Consumer Tissue, there was quite the build-up, I would say, self critically, I don't know that we were very good at predicting how the household inventories were going to evolve. But I think over the past years, and there was a lot of volatility in the tissue demand. I think in the second quarter of 2020, I think our tissue demand was up -- fac tissue was up 30%. And then a year later, it was down 27%. So again, fac tissue historically is very stable and goes with -- certainly, volume growth goes with highly correlated to population growth. At this point, we feel like it has reverted back to normalized levels. But it might be fair to say that there's a lot of people carrying more fac tissue than they were three years ago. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I'm back. It's okay. I can let it go to -- I'll follow up offline. Thank you. Mike Hsu : No, we\u2019re good. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Then I guess, we've come in a couple of different ways through different series of questions and so on. But I guess, how do you think about volume versus pricing versus market share? Because I think one thing that I get asked about quite a bit with regard to your business, in particular, is sort of, hey, but don't you see private label dot-dot-dot. And my read is that, yes, that's a dynamic of your categories. It always is in economic cycles. It's what you -- it's what you'd expect to happen, is it private label would gain some share there be some change in consumer behavior. So I don't know how you would -- could answer this. But as you look at how to manage through the continued high levels of inflation as you put in the incremental pricing that you mentioned this quarter, is market share the right gauge for you to judge kind of the health of the business at this point? Is it aggregate organic sales growth? What are the metrics by with you gauge if you've gone too far or not gone far enough? Mike Hsu : Lauren, such an awesome question. Lauren Lieberman : Well, then, I'm glad we waited. Mike Hsu : This is the age-old problem of management in the consumer business. And that's why it goes back to what we've been saying for years now. We remain committed to delivering balanced and sustainable growth for our shareholders. And so -- and it's been interesting as we've unpacked this for the organization because they're like, what do you mean by balance is sustainable? Well, the key things we're managing against organic growth, profit growth, market share and cash. And so those are the four things.  And I would say internally, a lot of the organization used to look to this role to decide what we're going to prioritize. But again, when I say balanced, I want all four of those metrics to go in the right direction. I think -- so we're taking what I would say are high road actions to position the company to grow for the long term sustainably. And right now, given the -- I would say, the supply shocks or the input cost shocks that we've taken on in the last three years, as I mentioned before, 1,500 -- the equivalent of 1,500 basis points of gross margin, margin improvement right now this year remains my top priority. I'm confident we'll return to pre-pandemic levels, and we're making progress as in the Q3.  But at the same time, we're not going to harvest the business to do that. And so at the same time, we're still watching shares. But we recognize that when we moved to both in terms of pace and level, we were out ahead of the rest of the market for a period of time. And so we recognized that we were going to leak a little share. But in our sense, I think that was the necessary trade-off to make sure that we can get the margin recovery. That said, at the same time, we continue to invest in innovation. We can do to support our brands with great marketing. I think our marketing has gotten better and our digital has gotten better. And so we're really proud of that. And so that's what we're trying to walk the fine line.  I mean I'm very encouraged that we're up and even insure in about half of our markets. It's a little bit lower than we experienced in 2020, 2021, where we were up in 2/3. I would say we're really proud of that, but we also recognize our competitors are pretty good, too. And so we can't expect that every year. And so if you get the sense, it's a complex trade, but it's something I feel like our organization has really stepped up to and they know what we're trying to do. And we're doing the margin recovery, but we're paying close attention of shares as well. So that was a long reply. I don't know if I answered anything that you asked. Operator : And at this time, it appears we have no further questions. I'll turn it back to management for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you all for joining. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year results with you in January. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of this morning\u2019s short remarks, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given after the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to introduce today\u2019s first presenter, Christina Cheng. Christina Cheng : Thanks, Shelby. Hello, and welcome to our 2022 Year End Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today are Mike Hsu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nelson Urdaneta, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Ezzell, our VP of Finance. We issued our press release and published supplemental materials that summarized our results and outlook this morning. You can find these resources in the Event page of our Investor Relations website. Before we begin today, a few reminders. Our statements will include forward -- our statements today will include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the latest Form 10-K or 10-Q for the list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations. Our remarks will focus on adjusted results, which will exclude certain items described in our Q4 2022 earnings news release. Please consult our press release and public filings for more information about these adjustments and a reconciliation to comparable GAAP financial measures. Mike will provide his perspective of the business, and then we will open the floor for Q&A. With that, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Christina, and welcome to K-C. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Back when we introduced our strategy in 2019, we could not have imagined the unprecedented challenges we are about to face. Over the past four years, K-Cers did what we do best, provide great care, care that our consumers, our customers, our employees and our communities needed all around the world. At the peak of the pandemic, people counted on our brands to support the health and hygiene of their families, and I\u2019m proud of what our teams were able to achieve to fulfill our purpose of Better Care for a Better World. Now as we look back at our results, there are three themes I\u2019d like to emphasize. Theme number one, our strategy to accelerate growth is working. Since 2019, we\u2019ve grown our business by about $1.5 billion in sales and delivered 4% average organic sales growth. In that time, we\u2019ve accelerated our organic growth by improving our product offering and market positions, with meaningful innovation and world-class commercial execution. In 2022, organic sales increased by 7% and over delivering on our goals at the beginning of the year. This was achieved in what turned out to be a uniquely challenging global environment. 2022 also marked Kimberly-Clark\u2019s 150th anniversary, a year in which we celebrated generations of category defining innovation. We\u2019re proud to have created many of our categories, including feminine care and facial tissue under the leadership of our Kotex and Kleenex brands. We are inventors at heart. New products created during the last three years contributed to over 60% of our organic growth in 2022. Whether it\u2019s Kotex DreamWear for ultimate overnight protection, or Kleenex Allergy Comfort, our product obsession, advantage technology and consumer-centric focus is enabling us to create meaningful value and accelerate category growth. This is perhaps most evident in China, where we continue to post double-digit organic growth in the face of a declining birth rate and challenging COVID operating conditions. With major upgrades in dryness and thinness, our products are among the best in the market, led by Huggies Super Deluxe, the softest diaper in China. Our strong portfolio supported by superior technology will continue to anchor Kimberly-Clark\u2019s leadership in the world\u2019s largest baby and child care market. Theme number two, we\u2019re making strong progress on margin recovery. Over the past two years, we faced unprecedented inflation worth over $3 billion, a roughly 1,500 basis point headwind to gross margin. Our teams have done an excellent job mitigating this impact. Our product leadership, commercial agility and cost discipline enabled us to rapidly implement broad pricing actions and generate over $700 million in cost savings. The successful implementation of revenue growth management actions drove an inflection in our profitability in the second half of the year. Gross margin stabilized in Q3 and increased year-over-year in Q4 by over 200 basis points. This was our first major improvement in the last eight quarters. Collectively, these actions enabled us to fully offset inflation and currency headwinds in 2022 on a dollar basis. Recently, market prices of some inputs have begun to ease, although they remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. While we\u2019re encouraged by this, it will take time for these benefits to work through our contracts and flow through the P&L. Nevertheless, we\u2019ll continue to leverage our scale to improve efficiency and reduce costs. At the same time, we expect our revenue management efforts will continue to positively impact this year. This will aid ongoing gross margin recovery while also enabling us to continue investing in our business. At the midpoint of our 2023 guidance range, we plan to improve operating margin by approximately 80 basis points. With incremental headwinds below the line, this translates to 2% to 6% growth in earnings per share in 2023. We also intend to increase our dividend for the 51st consecutive year. Theme number three, we will continue to invest to drive balanced and sustainable growth. We\u2019re scaling innovation that delivers better value, more benefits and better care for our consumers. We continue to see strong demand for great performing products. New Poise Ultra Thins and expanded sizing for the pants drove share gains in adult care, both from a dollar and unit standpoint this past year in North America. We\u2019ll be launching several exciting initiatives in 2023, including our GoodNites Youth Pants, which can hold the equivalent of three bottles of water! as well as exciting performance upgrades for Huggies diapers. At the same time, we\u2019ll leverage the broad range of our offering to address the growing need for value through compelling commercial programs. Now to wrap up my prepared remarks, I\u2019m very proud of K-Cers around the world. They continue to execute with excellence, standing tall in the face of countless challenges all to fulfill our purpose of Better Care for a Better World. We\u2019ve assembled an excellent management team that has tremendous experience unlocking global growth. We have a long runway of growth ahead of us, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in balanced and sustainable growth to create long-term value for our shareholders. Now Shelby, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Dara. Nelson Urdaneta : Hey, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, how are you? Mike Hsu : Good. Dara Mohsenian : So, I just wanted to go into the 2023 outlook in a little more detail. First, Mike, can you just outline what you\u2019re assuming for pulp prices as you look out to next year? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not fully using the RISI forecast, but maybe you are, just any clarity there would be helpful. And then you talked about the greater investment in growth in people by 100 basis points to margin. Can you just help us understand the motivation behind that? Are there specific areas of opportunity? Is it more you had to pull back a little bit in 2022, just given such a tough commodity environment? How are you sort of thinking about that? And also maybe just a little more detail on functionally where you are spending, is it ad spend, or is it other areas, is it headcount and maybe geographies and product categories you plan to invest? So that would be helpful. Thanks. Mike Hsu : Okay, we\u2019ll do, Dara. First of all, I feel great about where the brands are globally and where our business is, and we can talk about performance in the fourth quarter and I know we\u2019ll get to that. But overall, I\u2019d say we plan to deliver a better performance in 2023 for sure. We\u2019re going to build on our organic growth momentum. Dara, clearly in the plan for next year. There is plenty of carryover pricing, but there are new pricing actions in the plan as well. Most of those have already been announced to our customers. But in terms of the investment, I would say, I\u2019m really excited. We got a robust innovation and commercial program for 2023. In some ways, if I calibrate, I think this year will be stronger than last year, and we feel good about that. Consumer demand in our categories generally remains very resilient. And so I think from that aspect, we have good things to invest in. In terms of the overall spending, we are taking advertising back up a little bit more, just for reference, and we haven\u2019t discussed this as much. But obviously, with the challenges that we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years, we had pulled back slightly over the last couple of years. And so some of this is returning back to where we were back in -- perhaps back in 2020. But beyond that, I\u2019d say it\u2019s more based on the merits of the commercial programs that we have. And we\u2019re excited about the programs that we have and we want to invest behind them. And at this point, you\u2019re probably aware, Dara, we\u2019re pretty good at evaluating the returns of our investment and making sure that they pay out. And so we feel great about that. So from the organic momentum, we continue to see that. I will say we expect continued progress on margin recovery while we\u2019re making that investment. We\u2019ve got high single-digit operating profit growth while offsetting, I think, what we said in our release, about $600 million in inflation and FX headwinds. And so yes, we are restoring some between the lines. But obviously, as you saw, the non-operating items really kind of get us back to that mid-single-digit EPS guide, or low to mid-single-digit EPS guide. So I will say -- and before I let Nelson -- Nelson will comment on the pulp. I\u2019ll say, Dara, we are aiming for the top of our range internally, right. And I think we did the same thing last year. I\u2019m glad we did because when we came out this time last year, I think, we were calling for about $700 million of cost inflation. We ended up seeing closer to the $1.7 billion and still stayed within our original range. As I mentioned, we have very high-quality plans for this year. We\u2019re really excited about that. So we\u2019re aiming for the top end of the range. Why we call it the way we are? Well, volatility remains extraordinarily high. And so if you have a good call on interest rates, FX, the war, energy, supply chain, COVID, civil unrest, there is a lot going on. So that\u2019s a mouthful. Maybe I\u2019ll pause and let Nelson comment on pulp and then Dara if you have any follow-ups. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. And to add, Dara, in terms of pulp and the fiber complex as a whole, I think, just to give a little bit of context of where we\u2019re at. Overall, the fiber market prices have plateaued in Q3, and they actually began to turn slightly in Q4. And to your question as to do we take RISI as a reference, yes, we take it as a reference. And just reiterating where we\u2019re at today, prices have more or less remained largely in line with where we in Q3 and what we\u2019re projecting into this year is that on average, eucalyptus, as an example, would be down 10% for the full year. Now same goes for fluff, and NBSK and some of the other components of the whole fiber complex. We would see prices begin to ease throughout 2023. One thing that we need to take into account is that we don\u2019t cover at RISI. I mean we actually enter into specific contracts in all the different components of fiber. So what you see in RISI or some of these indexes does not necessarily translate one to one at that time to our P&L. So that\u2019s also what\u2019s playing out. To give you a context, out of the commodity inflation of $200 million to $300 million that we\u2019re quoting in our guidance. The pulp complex as a whole is right around half of that at the midpoint. We will see pulp as a whole, be up for us in 2023 based on what we\u2019re forecasting at this stage, albeit a very small number compared to what we\u2019ve seen before and markets are giving up on that end. Mike Hsu : I think I\u2019ll add, Dara, is also, while we\u2019ll take some of those declines that you see in RISI will take a little time to work through our system. I would say if you saw a spot in what we\u2019re paying you want to pay what we\u2019re paying. Dara Mohsenian : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just one quick follow-up. On the higher ad spend, are there specific geographies or product categories you\u2019re most focused on, Mike? And then if I can slip one additional question in, also just the FX guidance for 2023. The revenue guidance is worse than our currency models indicate based on your country exposure. So just any clarity there would be helpful, but also the flow-through to profit look pretty severe in terms of the FX impact to profit relative to revenue. So any clarity there would be helpful. Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes, the spending, Dara, I would say it\u2019s broad improvements. I mean, certainly, in our major markets like the U.S. and the diaper category, for sure, we have great news that we want to make sure that we\u2019re supporting appropriately. I think I cannot share exactly what that news is because it\u2019s coming out in the second half. But it will blow your mind when you see it. And it has to do with -- not to say this on an earnings call, but the poop side of things, and so that\u2019s kind of the business we\u2019re in. And so we\u2019ll do miraculous things with poop. And so that\u2019s one set of areas. We\u2019ve got huge momentum in China, and we feel great about that. The team is doing a fantastic job. We\u2019re going to continue to plow and invest in the brand and the advertising in our digital capabilities in China. And so those are two core areas. But obviously, we have strong traction around the world, and we feel good about our investments around the world. Nelson Urdaneta : And addressing the question on the ForEx, Dara, just to unlock that a little bit, so for next year on the top line, we\u2019ve said that for the full year, we\u2019re talking around two percentage points of a drag. And it\u2019s important to highlight that we are seeing that concentrated in the first half of the year, when we do the comps year-over-year. I mean we would not -- we would see that really ease or not be that much of a headwind as we get into the second half from a top line standpoint. So you could work that out and there. And then when we go down to the flow-through to the bottom line, a couple of things. As a reminder, we\u2019ve got about half of our revenue coming from overseas and about a third of our profit coming from overseas. But we do have a significant amount of costs that impact the P&L, either exposed to hard currencies in the foreign subs in which we operate. The other element you need to take into account as you model is that we\u2019re not covering the spot rates. I mean, we have particular risk management strategies in place that I\u2019m not going to get into details in the call, but we have to work through those risk management strategies as they flow through the P&L. As you know, that\u2019s not a one-to-one if you\u2019re engaging in hedging and doing risk management strategies that we do. Dara Mohsenian : Great, thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay, thanks Dara. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Chris. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. I just -- so one follow-up on the currency piece and then another question. But just on the currency piece, I think it\u2019s getting so much attention this morning because it\u2019s such an atypical multiplier versus what we\u2019ve seen here, right. And so -- and I appreciate there\u2019s hedging and it sounds like that\u2019s something you have good facility into. So maybe I\u2019ll just take that as a given. And what -- how should we think about an improvement in currency or a worsening in currency? So you\u2019re hedged, does this now -- is this now the outlook? Or should changes in currency imply a change in what\u2019s going to be flowing through on your model this year. So perhaps you can just help us understand that. Nelson Urdaneta : That\u2019s a fair question, Chris. And a couple of things, obviously, on top line, it will be what it will be because we don\u2019t hedge top line. So that\u2019s in essence what\u2019s going to happen, so it will translate. When you go to costs, we have models in place for risk management strategies, and there are currencies we hedge, there are currencies we don\u2019t hedge, and it depends on the amounts we do. So it\u2019s model-driven. So changes in currency, to your question, would have impacts. Now it won\u2019t apply to all the currency payers because it depends on where we\u2019re at, at any given point in time. So definitely on top line, yes, we will see that very fluid as markets move, and that\u2019s happening literally on the hour. As to profits, we will also see, to some extent, some flow as the currency changes and we update our models depending on what\u2019s hedged and what\u2019s not hedged. Chris Carey : Okay. Okay, thank you. Just given, I think one other thing this morning is that the commodity outlook relative to what we can see on even forward prices would suggest worse than expected probably on that front. Clearly, you\u2019re saying more of that\u2019s happening in international markets may be harder to track. So I think that makes sense. But nevertheless, we\u2019ll probably end the year now at a gross margin of, say, 32% still a few hundred basis points below pre-pandemic operating margins even farther below pre-pandemic. And I think conceptually, the organization does have goal to get back to that margin structure. It just feels like with commodity volatility and the non-operating inflation that you\u2019re talking about. Do you still think that\u2019s a realistic medium to long-term objective or has the inflation been such that there\u2019s probably not enough pricing and savings to get you there or at least it will take a very long time. So, any thoughts on that. Mike Hsu : Yes, Chris, I definitely feel like it\u2019s a realistic goal, and I think we\u2019ll get there. And my view is we\u2019ve turned the corner on our margin recovery program. We -- obviously, we saw in the fourth quarter continued strong organic performance. But for the -- I said this in my prepared remarks, pricing exceeded input costs and inflation for the full year. So, we fully offset inflation and FX for the full year last year. So, I think the teams did a great job there. And our operating margin, as I said, stabilized in Q3 and expanded by 200 basis points in Q4. In terms of the cost outlook, so I think we\u2019re making great progress there. And let me say this about costs. One, from my seat, I\u2019ll say there\u2019s -- I see green shoots, okay? But even though we still see cost headwinds coming into the year, there are green shoots, and we have seen selected commodities start to ease. And I\u2019ll also say, having been in this company for 10 years, reversion is around the corner. When it happens, it happens fast. We offset extraordinary headwinds over the last couple of years, as I mentioned. We see another 600 this year. Historically, though, there has been rapid reversion, and we\u2019ve seen some signs of it. I don\u2019t have a timetable for that. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to hit this year or not. But at some point, it will happen. And when that does happen, it will accelerate our margin recovery. And as I said in the past, we\u2019re not counting on reversion to deliver the margin recovery. But when it does, it will accelerate our time line, which is why I feel confident about it because we all know $3 billion over two years, it\u2019s not going to stay at that level, right? At some point, it\u2019s going to come back down. Nelson Urdaneta : Just to add a little flavor on the gross margin, too, Chris. A couple of things, we had three quarters in a row where we actually expanded gross margin. And as Mike pointed out, for the first time in Q4, we grew gross margin year-over-year versus the last time we ever did that was back in mid-2020. So, it had been a few quarters. That had not been the case. And that reinforces Mike\u2019s point that what we have been talking about since July of really remaining committed and having line of sight to recovery in the margins is going to happen. As we stare at this year, our plan calls for year-over-year margin expansion in gross margin every quarter. That\u2019s what we have in place. I think you quoted 32% of gross margin, it\u2019s actually higher what we\u2019re aiming for at the -- for the full year because we\u2019re expanding operating margins at the mid-point of our plan by 80 bps. If you look at what we put out in the release and the remarks, we\u2019re investing about 100 basis points of net sale into the brands. So we got to add that back to that 80 bps, and that gives you a sense of what at least is going to be the gross margin expansion that we have planned in here. So we definitely have -- we\u2019re building on those green shoots that Mike say in, but we\u2019re not staying sitting here. I mean we\u2019re moving on the productivity line. We\u2019re moving on the margin accretive innovation, and we\u2019re also moving on the net revenue growth management programs that we have in place. So all of that is really putting us there. And as Mike has said in the past, reversion will accelerate this. That\u2019s the only thing that would do that, so. Chris Carey : So can I just confirm, and I apologize, because I\u2019ve gotten questions on this, and I\u2019m going to get back in the queue. Do you expect gross margins up, but the 100 basis points is what you\u2019re investing into gross margins. So if you can you just maybe confirm what your expectation for gross margin is for 2023? Because I think there has been some confusion. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes, yes. I want you to add, right. So it would be like this. We have 80 basis points of operating margin. You add 100 basis points that we are reinvesting into the brands. That gives you 180 basis points by which at least gross margin would have to expand. Mike Hsu : That makes sense? Chris Carey : Okay. Yes. Thanks so much. Nelson Urdaneta : That\u2019s the math. Chris Carey : Right. Thank you, both. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Chris. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Mike Hsu : Hello, Steve. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi, Steve. Steve Powers : Hello, good morning. Good morning. Just to pick up on that math because that\u2019s sort of the math that we\u2019re working with too. But that implies, if you take the numbers literally that the 23% gross margin objective is a tick below the 4Q 2022 gross margin that you realized. So just to Nelson\u2019s point about seeing that progressive gross margin improvement sequentially, it doesn\u2019t imply a lot more movement in 2023. So maybe just talk about that in the context of, overtime, easing costs and the like. Mike Hsu : The road to margin recovery is an buffy one, Chris -- Steve. Nelson Urdaneta : So Steve, I think a few things that -- just to add a little bit of color or how we get there on the math. So I think the important thing to take into account is we\u2019re staring right now at about $250 million of commodity costs at the midpoint, as we\u2019ve guided. We have about -- in terms of currency, about $350 million at the midpoint in currency. And then in other costs, we have around $200 million. So when you add it all up, we will be for another year in a row, having a significant revenue growth management realization that we\u2019ve planned for, which, by the way, around two-thirds of that is solely carry over from 2022. So what happens at the end is, for the year, we\u2019re going to be realizing positive pricing net of commodity and ForEx, whereas last year, we were pretty much neutral. We were able to fully offset the $1.7 billion. So that\u2019s going to flow through. And exiting Q4, it\u2019s not a straight line as Mike indicated, because, again, the quarters are pretty different and the dynamics between the categories and the mix and our cost impact us differs. But the reality is that on a year-over-year basis, we continue to expand margins, and it would be quite the game because if you recall, our pre-COVID gross margins were around 35%. So we would be getting -- we would be making pretty good advance on the full year with the movement that we\u2019re planning for. Mike Hsu : Yes, Steve, and maybe I\u2019ll just add for context, I mean, I wasn\u2019t trying to sound facetious, because when I say it\u2019s a bumpy road, I\u2019m not one for hyperbole and I think I said in my prepared remarks, unprecedented a few times. And so there\u2019s been unprecedented effects kind of on the demand side and on the supply side, just in terms of demand, obviously, COVID in and out, the war, which caused demand to change in and out, then you have all the supply issues either associated with COVID, the war or just the product availability or transportation availability. So there\u2019s a lot of things moving around. Then you throw in our Texas storm, which, at this point, I\u2019m on the third order impact of the Texas storm. And so you got all that. There\u2019s a lot of volatility inherent in the numbers, and they were not consistent quarter-to-quarter and very unusual in our business, because typically, I think you all are right, this tends to be a very stable business. But because of that, both from a demand perspective and a cost perspective, things are going to move around from quarter-to-quarter a little bit. Steve Powers : Okay. That\u2019s fair. And I agree. Unprecedented has become the new precedent. So two other, I guess, follow-ups, if I could. One is on the enhanced essentially net pricing, revenue growth management. I guess, you talked about mostly carryover. That\u2019s great. That makes sense. In terms of the incremental, is -- do you anticipate incremental actual pricing actions versus just kind of other RGM actions? And you -- just some color around where those might occur and what portion of them are actually list price movements versus count reductions, that kind of thing would be helpful. And then another thing that you mentioned in the release, it\u2019s been a topic across other companies that have been reporting just in terms of retail inventory levels and some downshifting in terms of trade inventory levels, just some color around what you\u2019ve seen and how you\u2019re thinking about destocking inventory levels across the trade as you go through 2023? Thanks very much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Steve. Yes. First of all, we\u2019ve moved fast on pricing the last couple of years, right? And so I\u2019m really proud of the team and their ability to fully offset inflation on a dollar basis in 2022. But for the plan this year, I would say, the majority of our pricing is like -- is going to be carryover, but we have taken new actions, some list pricing, which is, in general, across most markets already been announced into the marketplaces. But there are additional RGM actions we\u2019ve taken as well that you might say, whether it\u2019s promotional changes or productivity around trade spending. So those are the more typical that are kind of evergreen programs that we\u2019re going to have in place. But overall, we feel very good about our RGM, our revenue growth management capability. It\u2019s executing well. If we didn\u2019t -- if we had not invested in it, over the past five years, we would not have been able to make the moves that we\u2019re making. And then in general, I think it\u2019s been working very, very well. In general, I would say, demand is holding up pretty well. I know that will be a topic people will want to double-click on. But I would say the elasticities are holding up, in general, better than we modeled originally. So that maybe, hopefully, that\u2019s it on the pricing one. Any follow-up, Steve, on the pricing? Steve Powers : No, that\u2019s great. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. And then retail inventory, it was interesting. Nelson and I were at a conference in September -- Lawrence Conference in September and almost every investor asks us about retail inventories, because it was starting to change for a couple manufacturers. It had not affected us at -- that was back in September. I would say, subsequent to that meeting, perhaps a week or two afterwards, we started getting news from retails that they were going to look at retail inventories as well in our categories. And it\u2019s happened. I would say it\u2019s been typical, generally typical to kind of what we\u2019ve experienced year-over-year. So in the fourth quarter, I\u2019d say, it came in about what we forecasted. It did affect the consumption, because if you look at North America, I think our overall organic between tissue and personal care was up 1%, which is a little soft relative to what the consumption was. And in my mind, consumption is really what the business is really performing at. And so you\u2019re going to have some other changes that affect your shipments. But over the long-term shipments must equal consumption in my book. And so consumption for the quarter was up 7% in personal care and 7% in tissue. So we feel like the business remains very healthy. But we work through some typical retailer inventory issues. Steve Powers : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Steve. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Mike Hsu : Good Morning. Anna Lizzul : Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much for the question. I was wondering if you can comment from your guidance on why most of your inflation is outside of the U.S. in 2023. Meaning what is different really in terms of the markets outside of the U.S. in terms of rising costs? And then I have a follow up. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. In general, inflation -- so a couple of things. Out of the commodity inflation, the one we\u2019re quoting, the $200 million to $300 million impact, the majority of that bucket is on the international markets. So the U.S. would be not the big -- the market largely impacted by that bucket. However, when we move down the line obviously ForEx would be mostly in -- would be the international markets as you could see. But then on the other cost, it\u2019s broad-based. So that would be broad based across the portfolio. Anna Lizzul : Okay. And then just how should we think about the phasing of your forced cost savings through the year, just given the rising input cost are more pronounced in the first half. Should we expect greater cost savings to offset that in the first half as well? Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. As we\u2019ve said in the past Anna, our FORCE savings are not linear and it all depends on movements within the quarters go live of projects. And it is very difficult for us to predict exactly how it comes into play. I would not skew FORCE into the first part of the year because typically, we\u2019ve got a lot of projects that are going live. We\u2019re still dealing and managing through some challenges, especially internationally on the supply chain bid. And that weighs into how FORCE plays throughout the year. But I can\u2019t give you a specific percentage of what you should be planning. But I hope that helps guide you as to how we\u2019re thinking about it. Anna Lizzul : Okay. Thanks very much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Anna. Nelson Urdaneta : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Mike Hsu : Hi, Andrea. Good morning. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. How are you? So I wanted to just perhaps hope to bridge the top line guidance a bit between volume and pricing. And Nelson, I understand you mentioned obviously you have some carryover impact of about two-thirds, I think you\u2019re called out from pricing. So it implies that potentially you are announcing or embedding some additional pricing. So first of all, wanted to check on that. And by my math, probably you\u2019re embedding flattish to slightly up volume for 2023. So I\u2019m hoping to figure what regions would that be? And related to that from a regional perspective, D&E it was a bit softer in the fourth quarter. I understand like you called out Southeast Asia, and I\u2019m thinking, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, Softex being an acquisition that you made towards the end of 2021. Perhaps there\u2019s some puts and takes there. Anything you can add in terms of like 2022, it seems to me was a year that D&E had a very strong year. And actually, sorry, developed markets had a very strong year. D&E was a little bit softer. Is that going to reverse, because you\u2019re obviously having tougher comps in China and in developed markets? So if you can help us with that. Mike Hsu : Okay. Maybe Andrea, I\u2019ll start with the D&E and then maybe Nelson you can come back in on the on bridging the top line. D&E, yes, it did soften. So in Q3 I think we were up about 11% Andrea, and then it was plus 2% in the fourth quarter. I would say, as you already talked about primarily due to what I would call discrete challenges in Southeast Asia. So what we\u2019re doing is, we\u2019re excited about our business in Indonesia, it\u2019s great business, great brand. I would say we\u2019re working through some business approaches that we prefer. And so that\u2019s had an effect of the year. They did things a certain way, I prefer to do them a different way. And so we\u2019re just working through that. And that had an impact on sales kind of in the quarter. Hopefully we\u2019re through that. And then beyond Indonesia, we\u2019re seeing a little increased competition in Vietnam and India. And so we\u2019re going to work through that and something that\u2019s been going off and on for a couple years now. Beyond Southeast Asia, China was up double-digits. Latin America was up in the 20s, and Middle East and Africa was up mid-single-digit for us. So, we\u2019re still, we still feel very good about our D&E performance overall, but recognize we have a little bit of work to do in Southeast Asia. I mean, the team overall is doing a great job executing bringing innovation into these markets, driving the price execution, which we\u2019ve talked about and we feel great about our commercial programming for this coming year. Does that give you enough on the D&E? Andrea Teixeira : Yes. No, I guess on the developed markets though, what is embedded in your guidance? Because I\u2019m assuming you are thinking of elasticities just kicking in stronger for this year or because it seems as if, at least in North America, I know the puts and takes from North America growth was subdued in the fourth quarter. So hoping to see if there is any puts and takes as you took more pricing and what is -- what are you embedding into 2023? Mike Hsu : Yes, well, let me just say, we had great performance across developed markets in the fourth quarter. I think generally, approaching a double-digit in developed markets outside the U.S. U.S. as I mentioned, was up, I think if you add tissue and personal care was up about 1%, mostly driven by retail inventory changes differences. We exited a private label contract that was pretty significant. We exited or changed timing on a pretty significant promotion at a big retailer. And so that affected I would say the fourth quarter overall in the U.S. But overall, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re putting out a number there specifically on each of these segments, but we are expecting continued good performance both in North America and developed markets internationally and very excited about the plans going there too. Nelson Urdaneta : It\u2019s strong innovation as well. I mean, for all the developed markets, we\u2019ve got very pretty strong innovation pipeline that\u2019ll come through. But going back to your deconstruction of the top-line I think a couple of things I\u2019d like to highlight on the year and how to think about it. As first and foremost, we -- as we go through the year, it\u2019s important to note that the first half of the year will be more muted. And when we say more muted, it\u2019s important to take into account the fact that one, we will still lap the private label exit in North America that we talked about just now. So that\u2019ll continue to impact us in the first half. And then the other bit is also we\u2019re lapping very strong comps from last year. As you remember, we grew 10% in the first half and we grew 5% in the second half. And then the third point is, we will still have a lot of pricing that on a year-over-year basis is coming through in the first half because of the carryover. So all that put together would put pressure on volumes, because of those three reasons as we think of the first half of the year, as we go into the second part of the year, then that would ease, and that\u2019s our expectation. And that\u2019s the way that I would think about it, Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : That\u2019s helpful. Just as one clarification that\u2019s missing on the, when you said two-thirds of the --correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I understood, it\u2019s like everything that you have in plan, in terms of pricing is about two-thirds carryover, so it implies that you have another one-third of pricing to come through in the plan? Mike Hsu : Yes. And I said earlier, I can\u2019t remember, maybe it was with Steve, but yes, we have a significant portion of carryover pricing that was launched last year that still carries over into this year. And then we\u2019ve taken additional pricing actions since then. And so we\u2019ve generally announced pricing actions across markets that are taking an effect this quarter. And so that\u2019s also factored in the plan. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes, they go into effect in the biggest markets at the end of Q1. Mike Hsu : Yes, and then on top of that, as I said to Steve, we have additional RGM actions or revenue growth management actions that are more typical in Evergreen [ph]. Nelson Urdaneta : Like hyperinflationary markets. So where, we have that pricing as part of the overall number. Andrea Teixeira : Super helpful. Thank you for the clarification. I pass it all. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Andrea. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Mike Hsu : Morning, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Good morning. Thanks. So want to talk a little bit about consumer behavior in North America and elasticity. So, I guess first on personal care, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not going to give us a number, but if I make some rough assumptions around the private label exit and inventory destocking, it looks like elasticity is less than kind of a one for one on the North America personal care business. So just kind of curious on your perspective on that and knowing how much of your innovation has been premium over the last few years. What you\u2019re seeing in terms of trade down behavior, because the market share data looks not great, the brand is losing shared of private labor all label overall, but your shares look a little bit softer. And then just on tissue, there obviously expect there would be significant elasticity. There always is. But what are you seeing there in terms of that a timeline to that kind of stabilizing? Should we think about it as when you start to lap the price and that the volume stabilizes? Or is the consumer under so much duress that there\u2019s space for that trade down to persist? Mike Hsu : Okay, Lauren, I knew you were going to ask this, and so Russ and I were on the phone last night working through this, and so as so anyways here\u2019s a couple things. One, let me just say in North America and I would say globally overall, we\u2019re seeing a resilient consumer. And I think that does reflect the essential nature of our categories. Generally, as you know, our POS or consumption volume where the POS Nielsen sales is in line with expectations. As I mentioned, our shipment volatility has been a little higher just because of some of these discrete items that we\u2019ve worked through. This is the thing Russ and I were looking at last night. I definitely would say observed elasticity was slightly higher or the elasticity impact on volume was a little bit higher in the second half than the first half. But remains, I would say far below what\u2019s modeled. And I think that does reflect the nature of our categories as being essential. And I\u2019ll throw a couple numbers at you. And these are category numbers, so not brand and they\u2019re public anyways, so not proprietary us. But in Q4, pricing was up 7% in diapers and Eq, right, equivalent units, the measure of volume was down three. And so I think as you point out, therefore, the implied elasticity impact is less, certainly far below one to one. The thing that I would throw in there on top of that is in the second half us and our competitors have made a lot of count changes across all these categories. And so the Eq definition includes count reductions because it\u2019s based on a standard unit, right? And so my venture to guess almost half of the volume decline is related to count and tissue sheet count changes. So that was diapers and then the bath tissue, yes, for the fourth quarter price was up 11 for the category and volume was down seven. And recognize, I might factor in, three or four points of that seven is likely to be sheet count changes. And then adult care of the outlier because, price was up eight and then volume was still up, right up to. And the delta, I think those were all fourth quarter numbers. What we -- and the reason I say the elasticities kind of seems like the impact has increased slightly in the second half. Is -- in the first half, pricing was up mid to high single digit and volume continue to be up. And so there is a difference. I think the consumer environment was different. I do think there is more pressure on the consumer, but I still think the category remains very resilient because of the essential nature of the category. So I\u2019ll pause there, Lauren. Is that answer? Lauren Lieberman : Yes, that is great. And just the one piece that you missed was the relative market share performance. Mike Hsu : Oh, yes. Lauren Lieberman : In personal care and any kind of mix dynamics [indiscernible]. Mike Hsu : Yes, again, we feel very good about overall performance. At the brands, I think, in adult care, we were up 12% in consumption of the quarter. Feminine care, we\u2019re up almost double digits. Diapers was down five. And the biggest driver behind that, private -- that private label exit was a minor one for us. But the bigger one was we have a large retailer that we knowingly shifted an event from Q4 last year, prior year into Q3 of this year. So we lost that. On top of that, they had a big private label event, which we know about and planned for. And that moved from Q3 to Q4. So there\u2019s a double whammy on the share side, and that accounted for the majority of our share impact in the quarter. And that happened in October, I think the cycle for us. And so we saw later in the quarter, certainly, better performance from Huggies and we feel great about where we stand. And as I told you, we have -- this is the Disney 100. So we\u2019ve got great commercial programs for our characters on our products. We\u2019ve got great innovation that we\u2019re really excited about. I hate to say, but -- well, when you come out and visit with us, we\u2019ll take you to our war room on poop [ph] superiority. And so, but we feel very good about our offering and what we\u2019re going to be doing there. Lauren Lieberman : I mean, I\u2019m going to put the poop superiority visit. I have my agenda for 2023. Mike Hsu : I know it sounds funny on a call. This is the business I\u2019m in. Lauren Lieberman : Yes, no, I got it. I get it. And then I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t jump in on a modeling question. But just briefly on the FX headwinds relative to what just seemed like not terribly well timed hedges unfortunately. And then the wage inflation that you called out, just any dimensional like gross margin versus OpEx, just how to treat those as we work through the pieces? Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. So, the 200 million is on the other operating costs. That\u2019s all gross margin as you model it. And the -- in terms of the Forex, a meaningful portion of it would be gross margin. There\u2019s a little bit on translation because of earnings, and there\u2019s a little bit on mark-to-market of any liabilities or assets we have in foreign currency, but the lion share of it would be in gross margin. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much. Mike Hsu : All right. Thank you, Lauren. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Evercore. Mike Hsu : Javier, good morning. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi, Javier. Javier Escalante : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I would like to come back to this elasticity question. So you mentioned that it\u2019s healthier, but yet your volumes are down 7%, and I\u2019m sure you could have itemized how much is your underlying volume growth versus market growth? So if you can give us that, so what is the underlying growth without going to this happening in incontinence or diapers, just tell us, of the 7% volume decline, how much were one-timers? Because the other branded competitor also saw volume decline of 6%. And my concern is how -- what makes you think that you can keep pricing at these levels given what this contradiction between the elasticity that you mentioned that is better, but we see this mid- to high-single-digit volume declines? Mike Hsu : Yes. I mean, Javier, I think the thing that you have to get picture is there\u2019s a difference between what\u2019s happening in consumption, right? And what\u2019s happening sold-through to consumers versus shipments, right? And so -- and I think that\u2019s what maybe the other manufacturer; I didn\u2019t listen to their call, but I\u2019m also supposing I think they probably lived through some of the same effects as us. There\u2019s a difference between what\u2019s consumed, right? And so I said for the quarter, in North America across our businesses, our Personal Care business grew in consumption by 7%. Our tissue business grew by 7%. In the long run, I think you\u2019ll have to -- hopefully, you\u2019ll agree that in the long run shipments should equal consumption, right? So you\u2019re not going to perpetually deplete the retailer inventories or eventually grow retail inventories over time, right? So generally, that\u2019s kind of what I look at as kind of the ongoing health of the business. In the quarter, we did see some discrete changes particularly as it relates to one, retailer inventory, which is probably the biggest impact for us in the quarter. But the other aspect for us is we did exit a pretty significant private label contract, which added a piece of it as well. So those are discrete items, in general, and I said on an earlier question, the retailer inventory changes for us, it\u2019s about typical for what we normally see. And so -- and it goes back and forth from year-to-year, and so it tends to build itself back up over time. And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t view retailer inventory changes as representative of what\u2019s happening to elasticity. I view what\u2019s happening to consume volume and consume dollars, right, as to what\u2019s happening with elasticity. Does that make sense? Javier Escalante : Yes, I couldn\u2019t agree more, but you have not quantified those one-timers. So what I\u2019m asking you is to tell me, what do you think is underlying category growth for you... Mike Hsu : Well... Javier Escalante : ...the branded competitor and inclusive of private label because you are talking about price increases in addition to whatever carryover comes from this year. And we wonder to what extent you are taking too much pricing and whether you can keep it? Mike Hsu : Well, all I\u2019ll say is the underlying category growth in the fourth quarter was 7% for both personal care and tissue. Javier Escalante : So what about volume, not pricing. I\u2019m referring to volume declines of 7%, Mike, if you could explain the underlying volume compliance? Mike Hsu : Yes, that\u2019s the shipment volume decline and then the consumption volume decline was low-single-digit -- low- to mid-single-digit. Javier Escalante : Go ahead. Nelson Urdaneta : Javier, going back to your question -- to answer the question that you have on the one-timers, we have about 3 points would have been the one-timers. If you think of the inventory destock, if you think of the private label contract that would have been about 3 points out of that set. Javier Escalante : Excellent. And then I have a more, a strategic question when it comes to private label. What do you see private label role in diapers, both in the U.S. and Europe? And to what extent that does it make sense to hold on to your operations in the U.K.? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes. We exited our Personal Care business primarily, especially our diaper business in the U.K. about 10 years ago. So I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re referencing there. Javier Escalante : Andrex, the tissue business as well? Mike Hsu : Yes. I mean, yes, we have -- yes, we have a great tissue business. It\u2019s the market leader in the U.K. What\u2019s the question? Javier Escalante : The question is if you can tell us how is private label pricing in the U.S. versus the U.K., which we don\u2019t have, I personally don\u2019t have access to and whether it makes sense to hold onto the tissue operations in the U.K. given the situation there? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. I got it. I understand. Hey, yes, overall, again, we feel great about our brands and where their position is. Andrex we have taken significant pricing just as we\u2019ve done in the U.S. this year. It continues to perform well and despite the price increases, it has grown share. And so it\u2019s a leading brand in the United Kingdom and much by consumers. And so it\u2019s a great business for us. Certainly, this year there\u2019s room for improvement because of all the cost pressure. And so that\u2019s the priority for us, as you\u2019ve heard all here is we\u2019ve been working to recover our margins on our branded businesses to offset the significant inflation that we\u2019ve had over the course of the year. And I think the teams have done a fantastic job of that. That said our margins are still below where they were pre-pandemic, and so we\u2019re working our way back up towards that. Javier Escalante : Thank you so very much. Very helpful. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Javier. Operator : We\u2019ll take our last question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Mike Hsu : Hey, Kevin. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Hey. Great. Good morning everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in, and Christina, congratulations, and welcome. Hey, Mike, just to maybe tie together some of the more recent questions I wanted to hit on your U.S. market share, which I think Lauren touched on a bit. And then the promotional environment, which Javier, I think was kind of getting at a little bit, but very specifically, how this plays out with the promotional environment. Some of the conversations we have with investors now is the pricing stick, is the consumer going to be able to with withstand it, particularly in some of your categories? And then obviously what\u2019s going on with commodities is not lost on retailers either there\u2019s still kind of a long way to go to get back to gross margin targets, but still more benign oil, pulp et cetera. And then, I\u2019m sure your share is not quite where you want it to be in some categories, where it\u2019s eroded tissue, diapers, wipes, et cetera. So question just around promotional environment, how you see this playing out in your categories, given the recessionary backdrop and more benign commodity cost environment, and then may maybe what you\u2019ve embedded in your outlook? And that\u2019ll do it for me. Thanks guys. Mike Hsu : Okay. Yes. Kevin, let me try to package that up. I mean one, let me start with the share. It was a bit softer than we like in Q4, but I feel confident we\u2019re moving on the right track. I mean, the softness was primarily in diapers for the reason I told Lauren, which is we had a big event come out and then a big private label event, which we happen to supply go in and so that had a big impact on market share in the quarter. For the full year we were upper, even in five of eight categories we were down in five and Q4, that\u2019s why it, I said it\u2019s softened in Q4, but we\u2019ll get it back on the right track. I do think, I feel really good about our plans for this year and feel confident in our commercial activation in North America, and then, in nearly all markets around the world when we have a few discrete items we\u2019re working across in international markets. In terms of the pricing environment, I would say the promotion environment right now remains competitive. But I would say overall constructive, given the cost environment, we\u2019ve seen kind of, obviously the broad pricing actions from most manufacturers across categories. Promotion frequency has returned to normal levels, both in tissue and personal care. And that, that happened, a while back. I would say the depth of promotion remains a bit shallower than historical. And I think that\u2019s related to the cost environment. However, on the consumer side, we can certainly, our, my comments on elasticity and the essential nature of our categories, notwithstanding, I do sense the consumers under pressure. And so, and we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve been, out talking to our top customers, and so we recognize that the consumer is working through some challenges pocketbook wise. And so, we\u2019re going to meet them where they need us and make sure that we\u2019re continuing to offer a strong value across our business. And the thing about us is, our aim is to lead our categories. And so we\u2019re not really, we\u2019re not a niche premium player. We want to play across both value and premium. And so we have a broad offering and we want to make sure we support our consumers effectively along that. But for the most part, yes we have taken significant pricing we are managing our promotions with discipline and we\u2019ll continue to do that. I don\u2019t know if that answers exactly, what you\u2019re looking for, Kevin. Kevin Grundy : I think that helps. But just to kind of tie that in with, with your intentions on the advertising and marketing, is it fair to say that should the promotional environment pick up because of a weaker consumer potentially from your position, trade down in your categories that you, it\u2019s not optimal, but you kind of view that a hundred basis points in advertising and marketing. If you have to reallocate that to trade promotion as the year progresses, then you\u2019ll cross that bridge when you get there. Is that a fair way to think about it? Mike Hsu : Yes. We\u2019ll, yes, I\u2019ll say yes, we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there. You\u2019ll have to, no, my personal bias is I\u2019m not a fan of driving the business through promotion. I don\u2019t -- I can, we can do it effectively, because we know our ROIs on trade promotion as well as we know our advertising ROIs. And so and frankly, now the returns, on both are okay. I like the advertising ones better. And so that\u2019s kind of my go-to. And I think it\u2019s better for the long-term health of the brand. And frankly, Kevin, this is related to the question you\u2019re asking. Our customers expect it. I mean, they they\u2019re concerned about value for their shoppers. And so, they\u2019re not the biggest fans of all these price increases, but part of what they\u2019re looking for from us is to make sure that we\u2019re bringing commercial programming to grow the category for the long-term. And they\u2019re so, they\u2019re excited about our innovation and they\u2019re excited about the, the commercial ideas that we\u2019re bringing this year. And so they, they want us to bring it. And so that\u2019s probably the bigger reason, why we\u2019ve ticked up the investment in our advertising. Kevin Grundy : Got it. Very good guys. Thanks for all the time. Good luck. Mike Hsu : Okay. Nelson Urdaneta : Thank you. Mike Hsu : All right. Thank you, Kevin. And Shelby, I\u2019m going to make my closing comments. Hey, I\u2019ll just say a couple things one, I\u2019m confident in the strength of our brands and our commercial capabilities to position Kimberly-Clark for the long-term. I\u2019m really proud of the focus leadership talent in this organization, and confident that we\u2019ll drive business, drive our business great long-term shareholder value and fulfill our purpose of better care for a better world. So I want to thank you all for joining us today. And with that, we\u2019ll sign off. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Mike will start the discussion with our strategic priorities and provide an overview of our performance for the quarter. Nelson will provide a detailed discussion of our Q1 results and our outlook before we open the floor for Q&A. With that, I turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Thank you, Christina. I'm encouraged by our solid start to the year. We delivered organic growth of 5%, cycling 10% growth in the year-ago quarter. Category growth remain healthy, pricing execution was strong, and costs have begun to stabilize. These primary factors enabled us to continue improving gross margin resulting in a 25% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 24% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Given our Q1 performance and increasing confidence in our underlying operating plan assumptions, we're raising our 2023 EPS outlook to 6% to 10% growth. Margin recovery continues to be a top priority, and I'm pleased with the strong progress we're making. This quarter we expanded gross margin by 340 basis points versus year ago building on our momentum from the second half of 2022. While we are encouraged with our progress, we're still operating in a challenging environment, input costs have stabilized, but continue to trade well-above 2019 levels. With adjusted gross margins nearly 200 basis points below pre-pandemic levels, we'll continue to operate the cost and financial discipline. We're leaning harder into productivity and taking aggressive action to secure supply to better meet the needs of our customers. We remain committed to returning our margins to historic levels, and eventually expanding from there. We've taken a thoughtful and holistic approach to mitigating inflationary pressures, carefully balancing price realization with our focus on offering a superior value proposition. This is to enable us to meet our enduring goal of growing market share. In Q1, we continue to gain or hold share in approximately 50% of our Personal Care cohorts. We've invested in building strong revenue growth management capability and that has been critical to our agile and effective price deployment globally. Category growth has remained healthy and broad-based as the elasticity impact on volume continues to be somewhat muted. This reflects the essential nature of the categories we read. While our categories continue to grow, we see bifurcation in consumer demand. We've observed resilience and higher-income developed markets like the U.S., but also increasing demand for value in lower-income geographies, especially within D&E markets. We're meeting our consumers where they need us. As category leaders, we have a broad offering that spans value to premium. While we're continuing to see momentum in the premium tiers of our business, we're accommodating tighter budgets and more rapidly cascading innovation and product features through our portfolio, including our value offerings. Our brands offer excellent value. For parents economizing through usage, superior products like GoodNites XL overnight diapers enable their children to get a better night sleep with 35% less leaks. GoodNites serves an important need and we're stepping up our brand communications with breakthrough campaigns that highlight the superior performance and value of our offering. Advantage product technologies are key to our brand value propositions and over the past few years concerted investment in innovation has resulted in an exciting pipeline that will help us elevate and expand our categories. I'll highlight a few that you'll see later this quarter. We're refreshing Cottonelle Ultra Comfort and Ultra Clean in North America, behind a powerful insight. Half of the users in the category are dissatisfied with their existing \"Soft & Strong bath tissue\". We're focused on delivering a superior clean and we'll launch this initiative with some fairly provocative advertising that highlights down their care and we're talking about the real down -- their issues that we all face. Our suite of products will help address these unmet needs. In China, we're launching Kotex POLAR NIGHT, our best-ever overnight feminine pads. POLAR NIGHT offer superior protection from back leaks, one of the biggest issues for overnight users. Internationally, KC Professional is debuting our new icon collection, our most advanced towel dispensing system. ICON has fully customizable panels and ultra-high reliability enabling end-users to be more productive with labor and waste. ICON has been a hit in North America and we are excited to roll it around the world. We have more innovations to launch later this year, including exciting news on Huggies. Our teams are working hard on the innovation pipeline, we're confident we'll bring more value to our consumers while elevating our categories, and expanding our markets. In closing, we are encouraged by our strong start to the year and our momentum on the top and bottom line. We serve essential categories and demand for our brands remains healthy. We have a long runway of growth ahead of us and we're committed to delivering balanced and sustainable growth to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. So now, I will turn it over to Nelson. Nelson Urdaneta : Thanks, Mike. I'm pleased to report a solid start to the year. First quarter net sales were $5.2 billion up 2% year-over-year. Organic sales increased 5% compared to last year's 10% increase. On a two-year basis, organic sales growth was consistent across all three segments, with approximately 8% average growth for the company. Strong revenue growth management delivered favorable price and mix benefits with a better-than-expected elasticity impact on volume. Organic growth for our Personal Care business, representing approximately half of the company's revenue grew 3% with a healthy contribution from price and mix and healthy underlying consumption. Growth was negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point by the exit of a private-label contract in North America. All Personal Care major geographies contributed to organic growth. After lapping a particularly strong Q1 last year, with North America setting a new quarterly sales record. Feminine care and adult care grew at healthy rates, and we continue to focus on the tremendous growth opportunities created by the aging population and ongoing innovation in women's health. In baby and child care, gains from product innovation moderated the impact of lower birth rates in China and South Korea. Operating profit for the segment improved 3% in the first quarter. We are confident in our strategy to address significant unmet needs, we'll continue to unlock a long runway of growth for our Personal Care business. Organic growth in Consumer Tissue was 7%, with broad-based growth across all geographies. We continue to improve the profitability of our Tissue business with operating profit for the segment up 40% for the quarter. Finally, our KC-Professional business posted 11% organic growth. All geographies grew, with North America and developed markets, delivering double-digit organic growth. Although volume remains below pre-pandemic levels, we remain focused on opportunities where we can deliver value and growth. Operating profit for our Professional segment grew 77% in the first quarter of the year. And we are continuing to make investments in the business to drive long-term sustainable growth. First quarter gross margin increased 340 basis points to 33.2%. Pricing, in addition to FORCE savings of approximately $105 million more than offset the impact of input costs of approximately $160 million, which represented a roughly 300 basis point impact this quarter. Between the lines spending on an adjusted basis was 18.1% of net sales, up 60 basis points versus year-ago, driven by higher investments in our business. Adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 25% and operating margin was 15.1%, an increase of 280 basis points versus last year's adjusted operating margin. Foreign currency was a 12 percentage point headwind on operating profit in the quarter of which five percentage points was due to the impact of translating our foreign subsidiary earnings into U.S. dollars, and the balance impacting input costs. We have made good progress on our margin recovery over the last few quarters. However, our gross margins are, still approximately 200 basis points below pre-pandemic levels. We remain committed, to restoring and expanding our margins over time. The effective tax rate was 24.5%, compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 21% in the year ago period. Better than expected top-line and margin performance resulted in earnings per share of $1.67 up 24%, versus adjusted results last year. This quarter also resulted in strong cash generation. Cash provided by operations was approximately $600 million driven by our healthy increase in operating profit and management of working capital. Capital spending was $201 million compared to $253 million last year. During the first quarter, we returned $425 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now, let me say a few words about our outlook. We are raising our full year earnings guidance to reflect our Q1 performance and the moderation of commodity headwinds, increasing it to a range of 6% to 10% growth, from our prior guidance of 2% to 6% growth. We've maintained a full year outlook for organic growth of 2% to 4% as we lap last year's pricing actions against a softer economic backdrop. We are committed to investing behind our brands and people, and we'll methodically assess incremental opportunities to drive near-term returns. As we scaled recent innovations to more markets and advance our commercial capabilities, we expect to step up brand investments in the second quarter and the rest of the year, as we said last quarter. We are optimistic about bringing superior value propositions that will increase household penetration and market share over time. With the success from our innovation pipeline and brand investments, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver in the top half of our guidance range for organic growth. Our input costs, assumptions for the year have improved, but remain a headwind of $100 million to $200 million. In addition to the $200 million headwind from higher wages and other manufacturing costs as stated last quarter. Most of the, impact of input costs, have been realized in the first quarter. And we expect headwinds to dissipate throughout the year. Bear in mind that, the outlook for commodities remains mixed, and cost levels continue to hover significantly above 2019 levels. Our revised input costs assumptions take into account benefits from lower transportation and energy costs. However, beyond these, we have not seen material changes in other commodities versus our prior outlook and markets remain volatile. For example, oil prices have reversed the downward trend with the recent round of supply cuts. And supply restrictions have contributed to higher prices and other raw materials. Global logistics are improving. However, the labor market remains tight. Certainly, we hope to see commodity abatement in the future. But we cannot count on it to recover the significant impact of inflation in the last three years. We are going to focus on what we can control, which is continuing to offer consumers, superior products, maintain our focus on revenue growth initiatives, accretive innovation, and sustained productivity delivery. We are raising our outlook for operating profit growth to a low double-digit percent range and for operating margin to increase by approximately 130 basis points at the midpoint of our guidance. Currency is expected to impact operating profit by $300 million to $400 million, the majority of which will impact our costs. Based on these assumptions, we have increased our outlook for earnings per share growth to a range of 6% to 10%. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, let me remind you that we are lapping tough sales comparisons and expect to have continued currency headwinds in the second quarter. As Mike said, we have a full slate of commercial programs coming off. And our teams are laser-focused on executing with excellence. I am proud of our team's execution leading to a strong start to the year, and we are committed to delivering balanced and sustainable growth that will create shareholder value. With that, we will open the floor for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Chris. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi, Chris. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. So, I just wanted to start on the gross margin line clearly your strong expectation this quarter. If anything, the debate will be like you continue to sequentially decline from here as pricing remains strong and commodities continue to deflate. So, I wonder if you have any thoughts on just the sequential cadence of gross margin development here. And perhaps any of the investments into that line item that might be, a bit more atypical relative to what seems a pretty sequential cyclical recovery in your gross margin. I have a follow-up? Mike Hsu : Okay Chris, I'll start and I'm sure Nelson will want to give you some more color and texture definitely encouraged by - what I would say, it's excellent progress on margin recovery just for reference. I'm really proud of the team, the organization we're accelerating growth and restoring margins, while still investing to drive long-term balanced and sustainable growth. So, that's kind of what our overall play is. But on the margin recovery, yes, in the margin we said on the prepared remarks, gross and operating margins were each up about 300 basis points. We had excellent price execution, and I'd say our pricing has been commensurate with what our expectations for cost net of our ramped-up productivity would deliver. And so I think teams have really done an excellent job around the world there. Input costs, has stabilized and I pick actually for the past two quarters, and this is about the most ability we've seen. I think the call is about the same as it was back in January and so for that, we've had probably seen about 16 weeks of stability, which gives us something good to aim for, and I think the teams have done a great job kind of work in the productivity. We are seeing some green shoots transportation being a current area. But our current view is that the overall cost environment, it's going to be fairly consistent what we said overall. I mean it's going to be about $0.5 billion. We're going to pick up a little bit of favorability we think. I would add though Chris, I definitely see reversion around the corner, the costs were up to now three-point. We expect to be over the last three years, $3.7 billion of inflation. I would expect the history of these categories in - our commodities that we buy it generally comes back out. I don't really see that thus far this year, but we will see maybe some moderation in the second half of this year. But Nelson, you want to give him a little more texture? Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. Just to build on what Mike was saying, Chris, a few things. So the majority of our cost headwind, and that's just the now $100 million to $200 million, would have hit us in Q1. We don't expect it to be too significant for the balance of the year. In fact, we do expect that to begin subsiding as we go into the back half of the year. And to your question specifically on are we going to see further gross margin gains as the year progresses, the answer is yes. I mean, we expect gross margin to continue to gain as we go through the year. This marks the second quarter in a row that we expand gross margins, and by not an insignificant amount versus the prior year. And as a reminder, the last time that had happened had been eight quarters ago, if you step back in time. So we are very encouraged by the progress made. A couple of things to keep in mind are the fact that we were early in terms of pricing. So we will begin to lap some of the pricing as we go into the second half of the year. Hence, why some of the increases that we've seen in last quarter and this quarter in gross margin in terms of absolutes, we don't expect that to remain. We do expect to exit Q4 at a higher gross margin than what we delivered in Q1. And that really puts us on good track to get back to our pre-pandemic level gross margin of roughly 35% that we saw in 2019. In addition to that, we continue to have a very healthy pipeline of productivity, and the team is focused on managing through all the levers to drive the margin recovery that we've committed to and then start expanding from there. ChrisCarey: Thank you so much for that perspective. Just one quick follow-up. Your gross margin historically have recovered in quite a linear fashion in the same way that they've actually gone down during times of pressure. Is there any reason why your gross margin should step up kind of each quarter through the year in context of your Q4 exit rate being higher than Q1? And I just wonder if you have that level of sequential gross margin progression. Can you just remind about your overall investment philosophies and your willingness to, or desire, to put more spending back into the system as opposed to letting this flow to the bottom line, that could be for this year or going into next year as well. So thanks so much for that. Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. So a couple of things. We have seen an acceleration in the last two quarters, and it's been fairly strong. So I don't expect that to sustain because, as I said, two things. One, costs will subside as we go into the second half, but pricing will also subside because we'll lap it. The good news is we do expect to be continuing to gain as the year progresses. So yes, it will continue to be a straight line, but the slope will change, and it will get a little bit more muted, and it's as expected. But going to the investment philosophy, I think it's important to highlight that this quarter, we increased our investment behind the brands and innovation versus prior year, 60 basis points. And as you remember, when we gave the outlook back in January, we said that for the full year, we were expecting at least about 100 basis points of investment. You would have seen in our prepared remarks that we have a very strong pipeline of innovation that's been put into market, and we are supporting it as we speak. And this is really the key. And our philosophy, even with all the headwinds that we were facing last year and the prior year has been that we're in this for the long run. We don't go for the quarter. So we go for the long run, and we've been around for 150 years and counting. And the key has been, we've been very disciplined about investing. We've been disciplined about our costs. But we do expect, Chris, as the year progresses to step up our investments. Hence, why I'm highlighting the fact that we saw 60 basis points of investment increase. But for the full year, we are expecting about 100 basis points when it's all said and done. Mike Hsu : Yes. Chris, just to tack on, we're continuing to invest in our brands to drive long-term balance and sustainable growth. We're trying to create the proverbial virtuous cycle, right? And so we definitely see that this year, in that opportunity this year. Certainly, I think the good start gives us a little more room and confidence to be able to invest further. And so even beyond kind of what we had thought during the start of the year, I think we would probably look for additional opportunity because, one, we really are excited about our innovation. I highlighted a little bit of that in our prepared remarks when we have great stuff for 2023. I think there's magic coming in poop, and kind of what we can do with poop. I talked about Cottonelle with the superior clean comfort protection on diapers. So we got great news. The other thing that we're really focused on and our retail partners, I think value, is we're really focused on expanding the categories, right? And so driving trial and penetration in these categories through advertising, and that's what some of the investment will be earmarked for. And so -- and we think there's great opportunity to expand penetration, even in the most highly developed category in the world, which is bath tissue, as I highlighted. Because a lot of consumers are still unsatisfied with what the category does. So we feel like we're improving our brand propositions. We have great news. And so putting more money behind the brands, I think, will work very hard for us, and we're excited to do that this year. ChrisCarey: Okay. All right. Thanks so much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you. Nelson Urdaneta : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is live. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congrats on the strong start to the year. I thought we'd pivot to your organic sales growth guidance. So you decided to maintain it at this juncture of the year. Nelson, you talked about cycling some of the pricing taken, although -- so the guidance does imply a deceleration relative to the strong start to the year, call it, up 1% for the balance at the low end. The high end would imply something closer to 3% to 4% for the balance of the year. Comment maybe just on how you're thinking about the cadence and how that breaks down between price and mix? And then Mike, it would be great to get your updated thoughts on how you view trade-down risk, which we've seen in some of your categories. And what's reflected in your outlook? And then I have a follow-up. Nelson Urdaneta : So let me start, Kevin, with the organic growth outlook and how we see it evolving in the course of the year. So obviously, we've seen that pricing has continued to be the big driver behind our top line growth over the last three quarters. And in this particular quarter, as we stated, our performance was better than what we had initially projected, and that had to do largely with the category dynamics. Categories were stronger than what we expected, and the impact of elasticities on volume was more muted, frankly, than what we had projected. So that helped. But despite that, pricing continued to be the big driver of top line growth. What we expect to happen as we cycle many of the pricing actions that we took, because remember, we were one -- we led in many of the markets, the pricing actions dating back to Q4 2021. So we will be -- we'll start to lap many of those as we exit Q2. So our expectation as the year progresses is that the volume impacts that we've seen, and we saw 7% in Q4, we saw a 5% drop in Q1, will begin to taper off because the impact of the pricing will go away. But by the same token, as all the carryover pricing is lapped, we will also expect pricing to subside. So it will turn into a more balanced algorithm in terms of top line growth as we progress through the back half of the year. And then yes, we did hold to our guidance of 2% to 4%. We highlighted that we're aiming for the top end of the guidance in light of the performance that we had in Q1. And also, because we're taking into account the stronger category performance that we've seen, given the resilience of our consumers and the innovation that's being put into the marketplace. So overall, we are aiming for that top end of the guidance, as I just stated. And I've just given you a little bit of flavor of how we see the evolution of volume and pricing as the year goes by. But Mike? Mike Hsu : Yes. And then, Kevin, I'll category -- I'll comment on the categories, and you mentioned the down trading risk. One, I'd say, through the first quarter, the categories remain healthy and the consumer remains resilient. The strong Q1, right, and probably stronger than we had anticipated at the start of the year, really on the back of category health. Just to give you a few numbers, in the North American consumer categories, overall, our categories were up about 9, so high single digit. Western Europe was up teens in consumption. Latin America was up double digits. And KC-Professional organic was up double digits in every market. And so again, I think the categories are performing well. As Nelson mentioned, the volume elasticity impact has been somewhat muted. And here's a few factors, just to give you a flavor for it. In the U.S. diaper this is category numbers, not brand numbers, category, price was up six, volume was down two. In U.S., bath tissue price was up 11 and volume was down one. And in U.S. adult care, price was up seven and volume was up four. So you can see the - I guess, the definition of any \u2013 relatively - if elasticity is below one, right? And so these - clearly, at least in the recent period, it's kind of in that range. And I think the notion is, Kevin that overall brand elasticities are higher than category elasticities, but our categories are generally relatively inelastic. And I said this example before. But if - the price goes up on bath tissue, generally doesn't mean you're going to use the bathroom less, right? And so, I think we do operate in essential categories that have less elasticity. There is some down tiering out there, but I'd say it's not broad-based. And if I can use this word appropriately, it's not necessarily monolithic either. We're definitely maintaining momentum in the premium business, in the premium tiers of our business. Especially and that's especially true in developed markets. In China our mix continue to be up high single-digit, and that's all shifting to - internally, we call our premium tiers, Tier 6 and 7. And so that momentum is proceeding. Similarly, in the U.S., we have strong momentum on our premium side. Even in a market like Brazil, the market is actually premiumizing, if you look at the mix and volume. There's more going into premium than there is, and - value is actually declining a little bit. There is - definitely is down tiering and we see that in U.S. I think private label shares were up in, I think, four of the category, which was a tick up from the prior quarter. In markets like Argentina and Peru, which is a big market for us, we are seeing some additional down tiering. So we're sensitive to it. And so for us, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're going to meet the consumers where they need us. And we're really focused on improving our value proposition, first by hitting the price points that consumers need us to be at, and that's through price pack changes. But also cascading, our innovation more rapidly through our portfolio, especially into the value tiers. And so, that's kind of where we are. I'll pause there and see if you have any follow-up. Kevin Grundy : Yes. Mike, a quick follow-up, and I'll try to be brief with this, because that was a lot of fantastic color from you and from Nelson. It's just on trade promotion, right? So the narrative, it's remarkable how quickly it can change. It was sort of drinking out of a fire hose with commodity costs and now things moderate a bit. And the narrative is now a lot more worried about trade down and what's the potential for trade support to ramp significantly? What's the potential for some of the competitive players, maybe who do not play nicely in the sandbox, whether this is in Europe with private label? What are your thoughts around that, that competitive intensity ramps here significantly as commodity costs moderate? And then I'll pass it on? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes. Great question you're on it, Kevin. I mean we're seeing that in spots and so in Latin America, we're seeing a little ramp up promotion from both local players, and other multinationals, similarly in parts of Africa, for us and in a few categories in North America. Childcare pull-ups is one. Periodically, there's a secondary or tertiary brands that make a distribution push and we see that from time-to-time. And so, we see a little ramp up promotion from time-to-time. Our thing is we've priced - I mean our margins are not whole yet from pre-pandemic levels. And so, we know what we need to get to. We're prioritizing margin recovery, and we're going to be disciplined about it. And we've priced commensurate to our expectations for both input costs and what our net productivity is going to be. We've got invested a lot, a lot over the last few years in building a great revenue growth management analytic capability. And so, we're going to continue to be really agile and disciplined in our spending. But maybe the color commentary I'll give you and this is philosophical, or my business philosophy is, I'm not a fan of renting share through promotion. I mean we've seen that movie. I've seen that over-and-over in a lot of categories, including in food and everything else. And I've always got out of the renting of share business. And what I mean by that is over-promoting brands to kind of pick up shares. I'd rather earn it through the base business through advertising innovation and making the products better. And so that's kind of what our high road - internally, we call our high road strategy, which is, hey, we want sustainable growth. We're going to earn our share through a better brand value proposition, and we're going to grow category penetration over time. That doesn't get done well through trade promotion. So it will be out there. Obviously, we're going to want to be competitive. But I think for us, I think investing in advertising to grow the category and innovation is our preferred path. Kevin Grundy : Okay very good. Thanks for all the time, I appreciate it. Good luck. Mike Hsu : All right thank you. Nelson Urdaneta : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Mike Hsu : Hi Andrea good morning. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, good morning everyone. So I just wanted to go back to what you both talked about in terms of pricing, having obviously rolling over or the comparison is getting tougher. But also, as we think about it, we stepped back in cycles, right two things. One is on utilization and consumers having to make tough choices in a number of diaper changes. I'm sure it's not happening as we speak now, but in some countries where, definitely it's not the only performance that drives choice, but also at the end of the day, what they can afford? So the premiumization sometimes also happens when you have to use a better diaper at night, and that's going to be the only change. And number one, so is that something that you're positioning now as we go into rougher times? And then second, when you think about like what happens to private label, which is - which has - so pulp prices obviously declining a bunch. We see local competitors in China obviously not sitting on their hands? When you think about - when you think what's going to happen to the cycle, where some of the private label contracts automatically also passes through the way down, how to think - I'm not saying it's going to happen now, but in six months from now, is that something that you embed in your guidance for margins and so, how to think of that? And in particular, I would say, diapers is not so much of a category, but perhaps even tissue as we go through for this phase. So I was wondering how to think of those? Mike Hsu : Yes. Okay yes. First of all, I think on the - yes I mean, you're exactly right on the usage front. I mean, we do see in some markets, and I'd say it tends to be more developing in emerging markets where incomes are a little - budgets are a little tighter that you see the trade down. And that's occurred - that occurred starting three years ago, four years ago now with COVID, and we saw that extensively in Latin America where people were stretching out usage. And if they were using, let's say, three diapers a day, they had gone down to two. And so - and in some cases, I think that would explain, to your point exactly, Andrea, we're trading up to a higher quality, maybe higher capacity diaper, we've seen some of that behavior. But I think in Latin America, in particular, we've seen behavior shift. We had seen in the prior two or three years ago, some shift from premium to value. As I mentioned, we're now seeing some shift from value to premium the other way, but we've seen that usage change before. A little less - I think we would observe that behavior a little less in developed markets like the U.S., but it still does occur nonetheless. So that's kind of factored into our approach, and that's why you'll see from us, and I highlighted it in the prepared remarks. I mean we're really going to emphasize our advertising, the value of our products and the performance of our products. And so, we're really - we'll address it that way, and also by cascading better features through our product line. So I think that's - maybe that's the first part. And on the private label front, I think your question is correct. And certainly, as costs come down in the category, we might expect some pricing to come down. We're still working through that. At this point, we're still operating at the peak, even though we have a little bit of relief. We're still operating at the highs and you can look at the forecast. I mean some of our costs have come down a bit, but costs remain still well above billions over what they were two or three years ago. And so, but we will plan for that. Nelson, anything to add? Nelson Urdaneta : No. I think you've said it all, Mike okay. Andrea Teixeira : Just as a quick one, Mike, and this is super helpful. When you say it's going to take a while, so we're looking at probably early next year where we might see things kind of leveling off or lapping on an inflation perspective? Mike Hsu : Well I mean, I would hope that it comes really fast, but it's not in our call right now. And so, we have - in the past, as you covered this category for a while now, and we've seen a more rapid reversion in the past. If you recall, I think 2018, we went to a record high and then on let's say, eucalyptus. And then by 2020, we're down to maybe a 10-year low. And so, it does move around quite a bit. We haven't seen that action yet in a significant way, but I would anticipate it, so right. Andrea Teixeira : Okay. Nelson Urdaneta : And just to build on that last point, Andrea. For this year, still taking into account only commodities and ForEx at the midpoint of our guidance, we're talking of another $0.5 billion. So it's not an immaterial amount, albeit if we look at the prior two years, we were talking $3.2 billion. So net-net, based on the outlook for this year, when it's all said and done, we have about $3.7 billion of headwinds that we've had to manage over the last three years when the year is done. So they remain high. Commodities remain elevated. ForEx remains volatile. Again, we're seeing green shoots, but that's the watch out. We still have disruptions in Europe. We still have items that we're maneuvering through, but we are seeing some of the items also improve in things like transportation and energy to some extent. So again, we need to take it in strides in a quarter at a time as we progress. Andrea Teixeira : Yes. But that $500 million and that's an average, but if you think about like how it's front-loaded, right? So it's the $500 million on average, I'm just making it up numbers. But let's say, it's $1 billion in the first half and then it's plus $500 million in the second half, reversing back. So what I'm saying is that, okay, retailers are smart enough to know because they own the private label and they know their contracts. So they will not immediately have to - that benefit or have to pass through that impact? But what I'm saying is that it will coincide that you're going to lap the pricing and you're going to start to see your inflation going the other way. So you're starting to see deflation, not on an annualized basis, but you're going to see on a quarterly basis. So I think what does that do with your - when you're sitting down in the fall, to talk about pricing into spring of the following - or into the beginning of next year? Mike Hsu : Yes. I mean I think you're exactly right, and we'll definitely take that into account as we plan. Obviously, I don't want to sit here and telegraph what we plan to do on pricing in the second half of next year. Andrea Teixeira : Yes, that's fair. All right thank you so much. Appreciate the time. Mike Hsu : All right thank you, Andrea. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Jason. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi Jason. Jason English : Hi, good morning folks, thanks for having me in. So perhaps I missed it, which is totally possible, lots of distractions over here. But where are you expecting gross margins to land for the year? Nelson Urdaneta : Yes, so for gross margins, Jason, at the very least, we're expecting to expand them around 230 basis points year-over-year. Because remember, we're expanding at the midpoint of our guidance, operating margin by 130 basis points. We took that up 50 bps versus our prior outlook. And we are putting in the incremental on 100 bps at least of investments into the brands. So that would put the year-on-year gain in gross margins at about 230 at the bottom. Jason English : Got it. So that suggests that you've - you're going to go kind of sideways from here. So you've reached another level, but you're plateaued up here at this level with no more sequential progression. What does it take then to like find the next level? You mentioned in your prepared remarks, you're still a couple of hundred bps below where you started. Is that - would we need commodities to come back in? Is that the enabler to get you next leg? And until that happens, sideways is the baseline expectation? Nelson Urdaneta : That's a good follow up, Jason. So the thing would be - it wouldn't be necessarily sideways. Because as I said, I mean, we do expect to see continued progression in gross margin. I wouldn't call it linear. I don't expect it to be a straight line between now and Q4, because we have a few puts and takes with how commodities and pricing and FORCE will play. But we do expect to exit the year above the average for the full year. Does that help? Jason English : Yes, or exit the full year at the rate you just delivered in the first quarter. I mean that's what that 230 implies? Mike Hsu : Well, let me just - I'll give you a little more perspective, Jason, because here's the deal. Look, we updated the outlook - I think it definitely reflects the strength of the first quarter relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year and our growing confidence in our underlying plan assumptions. I think we're off to a good start. And so the unset part of it is, I would say, Nelson and I, we probably had more muted expectations for our first quarter, closer to what you guys were all thinking and so hey, we had a very strong start. As I mentioned, the other underlying category performance has been healthy. The cost environment has been stable. But that said, but I would say also in the first quarter, the shape of the P&L has performed very well. And I'd say the cost - the quarter, I think, exceeding our own internal expectations pretty healthy in a way that I would say the primary drivers were volume, price and cost. So if you take those three factors, those are pretty good quality factors. Could it continue to get better? It could. But I think we've made our call on the outlook and generally it feels a little soon to call - revise our guidance up after the first quarter. But based on the strength of the first quarter, we felt like we should. But is there more room as we go through the year? There could be. But there's also a lot of volatility that remains, which is kind of why we call it the way we've called it. And so what are the down factors on volatility? We're all seeing the same reports about recessionary risk in the second half. We don't exactly know what's going to happen to the cost - input costs and currency. And so, there are a lot of factors on both the plus side and the negative side. And so we're - we feel like this is a good call for now. And we were - I think I will retain the right to change our mind later. Jason English : Understood makes sense. And I agree with all your comments on the first quarter. Congrats on a strong start and I'll pass it on. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Jason. Nelson Urdaneta : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is live. Mike Hsu : Hi Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Great thanks. Hi, how are you? I wanted to talk about consumer tissue innovation. I know it's a topic that we've touched on before without going back into the detailed poop conversation? Mike Hsu : Yes. Lauren Lieberman : But you guys have talked for a long time about the ability or the intention to elevate the category and bring innovation there, and this seems like the big - the first kind of like, big chunky move in that direction. I was curious your view on kind of category development, right? If I think about it, I would argue that you're probably the only player that's really focusing on innovation and premiumization in the category in this demonstrative way? How are you going to see the category evolving over time, right? Is there a higher margin profiles that's structurally more interesting? Does this kind of raise the innovation game for everyone, more bifurcation between private label and branded? I'm just - yes, curious on views on what your initial research and maybe test markets have shown you, if you've done that on them, and how the category could evolve things with this move on innovation? Mike Hsu : Yes, I mean Lauren we definitely think it's the right thing to do. I mean, this category is - I mean, we invented the category. Scott Paper invented roll bath tissue over 120 years ago, and it hasn't changed that much fundamentally since then. And we all know the category talks about the attributes of soft and strong and every bath tissue is a version of that. But the reality is as our team has done a harder digging, and the 50% of the consumers are dissatisfied what the products deliver for them. And so we think - the core of the issue is around a better clean. It turns out, and you may not be surprised to know this, but the vast majority of the consumption of bath tissue is female. And just by that, you can see the category doesn't set itself up that way. And so, we definitely think there's a lot of ways to innovate from a product perspective and a communication perspective to deliver better clean. You're going to see some of that in advertising. We have shared some of that with our customers. They're very excited. I think we're just on the - I think, at the beginning stages of this approach. But I think it's the right one for the category. Because it's a huge category, and there's a lot of different ways to build. But I think creating more value added and giving consumers a better way to clean is a good one. Lauren Lieberman : And then just from a profitability standpoint with this, right? So margins made a big step up this quarter in consumer tissue. But if I think back, the story in this category for KC for a long time has been recognizing the cyclicality of the cost environment that you'll see here. But making the -- raising the bar, right, the highs are higher and so are the lows, right, in terms of margin percentage. But as you push forward on innovation here, I mean, is there a scope for this business to have peak margins that are, I mean, call me crazy, like 19%, 20%? I think prior peak is maybe around 18%. But just not thinking this year, obviously, but over a multiyear horizon, what this means, could mean structurally for profitability in the category. Mike Hsu : Yes. Well, let me go back broader, Lauren. I mean when I came into this role back in 2019, I think I started off with saying, hey, margin expansion is a goal, right? And so we got pushed back because when I said that, I wasn't anticipating $3.7 billion of additional cost and currency headwinds. But I think the team is doing an excellent job working to offset a lot of that. And I think you saw it this quarter. And -- but right around that '20 -- I'd say, 2017, 2018, 2020 period, our tissue margins in North America did kind of hit those rates. And so our goal right now is to get back into that range. But certainly, with the strategy that I just outlined and with the overall strategy of the company, to elevate our categories and expand our markets, I think the long-term goal remains margin expansion through innovation and building up the categories. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. That's great. Thanks so much. Mike Hsu : Thanks Lauren. Nelson Urdaneta : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Javier Escalante from Evercore. Your line is live. Javier Escalante : Hi, good morning. [indiscernible]. Hello, good morning, guys. Question is, I wonder, perhaps Nelson, if you guys have an estimate on how much pricing have you taken, which is put us kind of like a one-on-one basis relative to the cost that took $3.7 billion in cost. Do you have any estimate how much in the past 18 months, how much pricing you have taken? Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. Let me -- Javier, that's a great question. And if it helps, build a bridge as to why where we're at right now and the recovery path that we've had on margins. So based on our outlook for this year and the guidance that we're providing, we would have -- we will be pricing -- we will be realizing revenue growth management of around 85% of that $3.7 billion, give or take, just to give you a sense of what we've put in place when this year is done 36 months through. So obviously, that doesn't get you there on a one-to-one basis to recover margins. And that's why our cost-saving initiatives in force come into play in addition to our accretive innovation, which is part of our design to value and the other initiatives that we have in place with the commercial team. But I hope that provides some perspective. Javier Escalante : Yes, that's absolutely, very helpful. And then I'm going to have a little follow-up. If you look at, kind of data, particularly in U.S. tissue, you see private label and Proctor, your main competitor, realizing more price mix. Is that real pricing? Or it's just basically that because you have the Scott business, you are seeing trade down within your portfolio under for - you are realizing less pricing than what so for your competitors and private label? Mike Hsu : Well, I think, Javier, I'm not exactly sure, but I suspect what you're also seeing -- you're going to see is also timing of pricing issues. I mean I think Nelson mentioned earlier, we priced relatively fast relative to other manufacturers. And so if you compare on a quarterly basis, I think you're going to see our pricing start to diminish maybe starting next quarter relative to others. But in a lot of categories, we are at least one, and in some cases, like diapers, three quarters ahead of the competition. And so I think if you line it up that way, I think it's a tough -- it's not really an apples-to-apples comparison. On Scott, we have taken significant pricing. A few rounds, including double-digit pricing over the course at the end of 2021, all the way through 2022. And including -- and I think -- well, in the first quarter as well, we took another round of pricing overall. And so I think the pricing has been extensive. I haven't looked at that specific issue, and so we may have to follow back up with you on that one. Javier Escalante : And I do have a third one, if you don't mind. And it goes back to the Professional business. I saw in the presentation that you said that the business is back to 2019 levels. I believe that probably is sales or price, so pricing -- exactly. So if you can give us similarly, do you have an estimate on a volume basis, how much are you back given all these issues about vacancies and stuff like that? And if the volume is significantly -- still significantly below 2019, does it open opportunities for optimizing the size of that business? And thank you very, very much. Mike Hsu : Great question. Yes, so revenue is now above pre-pandemic levels, mostly because of pricing volume is still below, I would say, in the '80s, right? As a percentage, if you say, hey, the comparison is versus 2019 levels. A couple of things. One is I don't -- I think I said this in a prior call, I think it was before you started covering this. But I don't expect it to come all the way back because we all can see our own workplaces that the offices are not full. And with work from home, I don't expect that in the near term. Do we expect to get that volume back over time? Yes, in a different way, though. We have to pursue other channels and class of trade to build that business back. But do I expect to get that back over time? Or not even back, to grow our volume from where it is today? Yes. In terms of structural changes, we -- there may be some tweaks for us. But the thing for us is we were using a lot of external capacity to kind of support our business during that period. And so I would say the fixed cost overhang is probably less than you might imagine. Javier Escalante : Thank you very much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Javier. Nelson Urdaneta : Thanks Javier. Operator : Thank you. And the last question is coming from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Steve. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi Steve. Steve Powers : Morning. Thanks, hi. So I might just ask one because we're short on time. But the one I want to ask first, just to clarify. So you talked about a lot of good things that I think we all see as evident in the first quarter, working in your favor and promise boding well for the year. But the guidance raise really only contemplates the $100 million relief in your commodity cost outlook. All the other levers of upside really, implicitly in the guide, are either implied to mean revert lower or, I guess, provide you allowance to invest back against them. I just wanted to play that back and make sure that -- I'm not sure it's the wrong outlook. It seems prudent, but I just wanted to make sure that, that that's sort of the right characterization. Mike Hsu : Yes, definitely a preference to invest back, especially behind strong commercial programs and stuff that we have for this year, so -- which we're all very excited about. And as I was mentioning to Jason, let's see how it goes in the second quarter and definitely reserve the right to think about it again. Steve Powers : Yes. Okay. And maybe just real quick, just your perspective on market share, you talked about it earlier. I think it's clear you're prioritizing margin recovery, probably especially so in consumer tissue. You seem pleased overall. I think you mentioned Personal Care shares on a global basis were essentially holding or gaining in about half, half year category country combinations. But we've seen, I guess, softer trends in the track data, which has created some intra-quarter controversies. So just maybe some perspective on that and where you see trends being a bit softer than you'd like or being a bit stronger, just to kind of help round us out relative to the data we all see? Mike Hsu : You're exactly on the right, a great issue for us to focus on. I mean we're pleased overall with our start. And I'm definitely very pleased with the margin recovery. We're not pleased with our market share performance. And so in Personal Care, we were up an even in about half, a little softer than we would like overall. And then if you say, hey, that was personal care. For the business overall, it was a little bit below that, right? And so we were coming off of 2020 and 2021 where we're up in over two-thirds. And so we kind of get used to that. So we're not that pleased with about half or just slightly under half. And so we know we got to get better. I would say though, Steve, it definitely comes with -- or the share softness definitely comes with moving fast on pricing. And what's happened is we've been -- other manufacturers have lagged significantly our pricing. I was just mentioning to Javier in some categories in North America diapers, for example. We didn't equalize on price until nine months after our price -- our first price move. And so I think there's been that lag effect that some competitors have used that interim period to kind of pick up a little share. That's part one. And then I'd say we're still working through a few hotspots. I mean, not everything is working perfectly within this company. And so we flagged last quarter. Hey, we've got some businesses in Southeast Asia. Certainly, you might understand with Eastern Europe and the ongoing effects of the war, we're still building our business back in Ukraine. And so there has been some softness in some markets. We're on it. But definitely, we earn the game for long-term market share gains, and that's an ongoing goal for us. And while the market share was okay in the quarter, we weren't happy with it. Steve Powers : Understood. Thank you very much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you all for taking the time to be with us today. Again, we feel very good about our solid start to the year, and we look forward to seeing you in the second quarter. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Christina Cheng, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, the floor is yours. Christina Cheng : Welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note, today's presentation will include forward-looking statements. Our results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to deviate materially from our expectations. Our remarks today refer to adjusted results, which exclude certain items described in our news release. We use non-GAAP financial measures to help investors understand our ongoing business performance. Please consult our press release for a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. We have published supplemental material, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Participating in today's call are Chairman and CEO, Michael Hsu; and our Chief Financial Officer, Nelson Urdaneta. Mike will start the discussion with our strategic priorities and provide an overview of our performance for the quarter. Nelson will provide a detailed discussion on our Q1 results and our outlook before we open the floor for Q&A. With that, I turn the call over to Mike. Michael Hsu : Thank you, Christina. We delivered another solid quarter with 5% organic growth while cycling 9% growth in the year ago quarter. Organic sales were up across all segments with personal care and consumer tissue each up 4% and professional at 13%. Our growth strategy is working and our performance in the quarter reflects strong execution by our teams around the world. We continue to make strong progress in margin recovery. Adjusted gross margin was up 380 basis points and fueled a 17% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 23% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Given the strength of our first half, we're raising our full year 2023 outlook to 3% to 5% organic growth and 10% to 14% adjusted EPS growth. Our categories remain healthy. In North America, category sales were up 8%. And we continue to see robust growth in key developed markets including the UK and South Korea, which delivered double digit and mid-single digit increases, respectively. While category growth across the NEID. 0:00:25.0,P4 been more variable, we continue to see double digit increases in Latin America. This growth reflects the essential nature of our categories. As category leaders, we've remained focused on serving all our consumers and recognize that many are facing economic challenges. With our broad portfolio, offering value to premium options, we're able to meet consumers where they need us. And we are well positioned with brands like Scott and Huggies Snug & Dry to serve the value oriented consumer. Across markets, we're strengthening our price tag offering. And that means enhancing large count packs and big box channels, and making entry prices more affordable and small format channels. More importantly, we're accelerating innovation and cascading technology through our product offerings to ensure we're delivering a superior value proposition to consumers. Growing market share continues to be a top priority. In the quarter, year-over-year market share performance was soft, reflecting the relatively early actions we took to mitigate inflation. In the last six months, price gaps have begun to normalize and we are encouraged to see sequential improvement in market share in key cohorts including North America, where we've seen improvement in five of eight categories. Volume trends have improved, and we expect that to continue as we cycle inflationary measures and execute our strategy and commercial programs. Our enhanced commercial capabilities are enabling more real time decision making the drive sales, optimize brand investment and balance value and volume. Furthermore, we expect increased brand investment and improved supply fulfillment to strengthen our market share performance over the balance of the year. Our commercial programs and innovation are core to our strategy to elevate and expand our categories. We're pleased with our launches in the first half and enthusiastic about our second half plans. Here are a few highlights. Huggies debut its newest Baby Butts campaign this summer, celebrating Huggies\u2019 unique curved design, which provides greater comfort and protection for babies on the move. Early results show excellent consumer engagement across our marketing channels. In China, we're raising the bar on skin health through a proprietary design that whisks away the baby's mess. Moving the mess away quickly from baby's skin is key to reducing diaper rash. We believe this kind of innovation will further differentiate us from the competition. And as the reason Huggies continues expand its market leadership in China. Lastly, our Kotex Intimus She Can campaign in Latin America continues to resonate. We were recently recognized with a prestigious Cannes Lion award for this initiative reducing period stigma as part of menstrual education. In China, Kotex introduced Overnight, an overnight pad with a proprietary design that prevents leakage with instant absorb technology. Overall around the world, we are seeing growth driven by the overnight segment. This a great example of superior product performance, coupled with effective brand strategy and communications to drive share gains and strong brand equity. Now I'd like to briefly address the impairment charges to intangible assets we recognize this quarter. We purchased Softex Indonesia to expand our presence in one of the world's fastest growing personal care markets. Indonesia ranks among the top three markets for new birth and we expect continued economic development will create more demand for our products over time. As a second largest diaper player in Indonesia, representing over a quarter of the market, Softex has built a strong equity with local consumers. The impairment charges we took this quarter, which Nelson will discuss shortly reflect our updated projections for the business. We have enhanced the team and taken actions to improve the business processes and our go-to-market approach. Indonesia remains an exciting growth market for Kimberly-Clark, and we're committed to this business for the long term. Now as we enter the back half, we expect continued progress in our journey to restore and eventually expand our margins. We're excited about our innovation and commercial plans and will invest more and more brands to improve our market share performance and growth trajectory. This is how we will elevate and expand our categories to deliver balanced and sustainable growth. Now I'll turn it over Nelson for more details on the second quarter. Nelson Urdaneta : Thanks Mike. Before I get into second quarter results, let me take a moment to discuss the divestiture of our Brazil tissue business and the impairment of intangible assets this quarter. We closed the sale of our Brazil tissue business in June, which enables us to focus even more on growth and personal care. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pretax gain of $74 million and $30 million of related expenses, both of which are excluded from our adjusted results this quarter. I want to thank the many KC-iers who worked hard to complete this transaction. In addition, we conducted strategic reviews forecasting and integration assessments as part of our business planning cycle. Based on updated financial projections, a pretax noncash impairment charge of $658 million was recorded, primarily related to intangible assets linked to the Softex acquisition. The charges reflect revise projections for certain brands, due to modified consumer shopping behavior, post COVID-19, inflationary pressures and increased competitive activity in the region. We are confident in the prospects of the personal care market in Indonesia, and we are committed to continue investing in this business. Let me now turn to our second quarter results. Net sales were $5.1 billion, up 1%. year-over-year, organic sales increased 5%. On a two year basis, organic sales growth was strong across all three segments, with approximately 7% average growth for the company. Effective revenue growth management delivered favorable price realization and mix benefits. While volume trends continue to improve sequentially. Net sales in the quarter were impacted by approximately 400 basis points of currency headwinds. Turning to our segments. Personal care representing approximately half of the company's revenue, grew 4% organically led by mid-teens growth in feminine care and mid-single digit growth in adult care. Infant care delivered broad based growth in the quarter with a majority of region's growing mid-single digits. Operating profit for this segment improved 1%. Organic growth in consumer tissue was 4% led by a 7% growth in North America, where volumes have turned positive, up low single digits in the quarter driven by Viva and Cottonelle. Operating profit for the segment was up 12%. Finally, our KC Professional business boasted a 13% organic growth, all geographies grew and notably, volumes turned positive in North America after six quarters of decline. Our focus on key commercial sectors, effective digital engagement and innovations in sustainability are fueling the momentum in KC Professional. Favorable product mix and cost savings drove significant operating profit improvement in the quarter. Earnings for the rest of the D&E, second quarter adjusted gross margin increased 380 basis points to 34%. Revenue growth management in addition to FORCE savings of approximately $80 million more than offset cost inflation and currency headwinds. Cost environment remains mixed. Although, energy prices have moderated in some market, they remain elevated in others. Labor costs are structurally higher now due to cost of living adjustments and a tight job market in certain key geographies. In addition, auto manufacturing costs, which cover labor were $85 million higher this quarter in line with our expectations. Between the lines spending on an adjusted basis was 19.8% of net sales, up 190 basis points versus year ago. Driven by continued investments behind our brands and our capabilities as well as the impact from inflation on our cost base. Adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 17% and operating margin improved by 190 basis points to 14.2%. Foreign currency was a 16 percentage point headwind on operating profit in the quarter of which five points were due to translation of earnings from our non-US Operations The balance was largely from transactional impacts. We have made good progress on our margin recovery over the last few quarters, and we remain committed to restoring them to pre-pandemic levels and expanding them over time. To achieve this, we are increasing our focus on productivity by building a long-term pipeline of opportunities that can generate significant end-to-end efficiencies. Lastly, the adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, compared to 22% in the year ago period. Strong overall performance, along with a lower tax rate resulted in adjusted earnings increasing by 23% to $1.65 per share. With the first half of the year, we generated $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital spending was $389 million, compared to $470 million last year. Year-to-ate, we returned $850 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now let me say a few words about our outlook. With our continued momentum this quarter, we are raising our full year guidance for organic growth of 3% to 5% and adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 14%. As a reminder, our previous guidance was 2% to 4% organic growth, and 6% to 10% adjusted EPS growth. The Brazil divestiture which was not reflected in our previous outlook is expected to impact reported sales growth by approximately 100 basis points. We continue to expect currency to impact full year top line growth by approximately 200 basis points. Based on the latest estimates for the year, we now expect input costs to be a headwind of approximately $100 million, an improvement versus the midpoint of our prior outlook of $100 million to $200 million. In addition, we continue to project approximately $200 million from higher wages and other manufacturing costs. Continued progress and gross margin recovery puts us in a great position to advance our commercial programs. We expect advertising spend to increase by approximately 100 basis points for the full year. This brings us to a projected operating profit growth in the low double digit range, and an operating margin increase of approximately 150 basis points at the midpoint of our guidance range. We remain optimistic about the future and our ability to create long-term value for our stakeholders. We are also very proud of how our teams continue to execute our exciting growth agenda across the globe. With that, we will open the floor to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Good morning. Hey, I wanted to just ask a bit about divisional margins. One thing that jumped out to me in the quarter was actually the margins in consumer tissue decelerated sequentially, they were down sequentially. And then also were up less than a year-over-year basis. So was just curious kind of what's driving that, right. As you mentioned, there was some better volume performance in North America, the pricing is coming through, costs are easing. So just some conversation around consumer tissue margins and the path to recovery would be really helpful. Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yes, no, absolutely. So a few things. I mean, we don't speak about gross margin. But just to give you a context, Lauren, year-over-year, we did have a meaningful gain in gross margins on the segment, over 200 basis points. We on a quarter-over-quarter, you're always going to see a few puts and takes depending on mix and elements that flow through. But net-net, I mean, we are seeing an upward trend, so I wouldn't get too hung up on the overall movement quarter-to-quarter for the segment. Because overall, we are seeing an upward trend and recovery on the margins. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, crystal, yes, okay, fine. Can I read into that though, when you think about reinvestment in the business and in other particular areas. I know you've talked a lot about innovation and potential for elevate and expand to apply in tissue as well as some of that exceeding these investments, or is it really just a matter of timing and mix? Nelson Urdaneta : Yes, it's a few things. I mean, one, obviously, we in North America have been doing the transition to the new artwork, and some of the upgrades that we're doing in Cottonelle. So we're a part of the thing has been, our transition on shelf is taking a little bit longer than what we had planned. So that's playing a little bit in the mix. But overall, I mean, that's progressing. And in terms of the elevate, we're also having initiatives in the UK in Andrex where we're doing some upgrades on the product line. And that's coming through. So that's progressing on that end. But Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything else on that end? Michael Hsu : Yes, Lauren. Yes, I mean, I think when we talk about elevating, that holds for all our businesses around the world, and certainly consumer tissue, personal care, professional, we're happy to invest in all those. And it's paying out as Nelson just mentioned, in the UK, organic growth was up double digits, share continues to be strong and robust on Andrex. And part of that is because along with some pricing, we have upgraded the quality over the last couple of years. And so we feel good about that, where we stand there. And really proud if you look at year-on-year, I think our between the lines investment we mentioned was up about 190 basis points over the prior year. And that reflects our commitment to the brands and our belief that we got great commercial programming to invest behind. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great, because the genesis of I guess the question also is actually like one topic that we've been getting a lot of questions of late is around pricing pressure in consumer tissues, some of the discussion, particularly in Europe and UK from retailers pushing back on pricing, or looking to roll back in consumer tissue. And we feel that a lot of questions about, a, if that would be an issue for Kimberly-Clark Clark and b, in specific to Europe and the risk of that dynamic materializing in the US. So just maybe you can add perspective there as well, I think you've said a lot in terms of reinvestment and share momentum, but any perspective on pressure to quote, give back pricing in that category in US and Europe would be helpful. Michael Hsu : Yes, I'd say overall, Lauren, pricing initiatives, our net revenue management initiatives are on track, generally, across our business, personal care, professional and consumer tissue. We're cognizant of the same discussions and similar pressure, and we will see maybe a little bit more promotional activity than we've seen in the past prior, maybe in the prior six months. But I think thus far, it's, we're not, it's not showing up in the results, or dramatically impacting our results. For the quarter, we had a very solid quarter across Western Europe. Demand was up about double digits, our organic was up about double digits, volume hanging in there pretty well. And so we feel good about where we are, but also recognize that yes, it's going to be a competitive environment. And we have to be prepared for that. The great thing is as you've heard us talk about, we've invested in enhancing our revenue growth management analytic capability. And so we feel like, we'll be able to make the right investments at the right time. That will be wise and not just overreact to things. Operator : Your next question is coming from Javier Escalante from Evercore. Javier Escalante : Hey, good morning, guys. I do would like to understand a little bit better. I think that you call between the line expanding the SG&A line which you do not break out. So if you can explain to us how much is this labor inflation versus more kind of like proactively investing in enhancing the products and the capabilities? And related to that and follow up to Lauren's question. You just did a strategic review and essentially exited Brazil, low down Indonesia. What is if you step back the main difference between Kimberly-Clark and Procter is, is that this international tissue business? Could you explain the role of the internet international tissue business and whether the margin profile is materially lower to the consumer tissue in the US. Thank you very much. Michael Hsu : Yes, maybe that's, I do want to us start with between the lines and how you're just so between the lines are big bucket for us, so it includes both the advertising and as you point out some of our general administrative costs, and so maybe Nelson comment? Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. So yes, so to give you a sense, I mean, of the increase that we're seeing in between the lines, about half of that would be on support behind the brands, the advertising and promotional activities. And it's largely advertising, because of all the products that we've been not just launching, but upgrading and some of the campaigns that are underway. The other half really relates to a couple of things. One, we've been increasing investments behind certain capabilities. And that continues revenue growth management, our digital agenda, which includes upgrades that we're doing to some of our systems, including the migration to S4 HANA, and some of the other capabilities that we're laying on a multiyear basis across the enterprise. And then last but not least, is labor inflation, which, again, hits on the overheads and some of the compensation increases, but really impact us in April, it's starting in the second quarter, so that because of the timing of our merit increase. Michael Hsu : Okay, and then maybe on the consumer tissue, or maybe it's a portfolio question, Javier, I'd say, hey, we love all our businesses, and the segments that we operate in. Certainly and as we talk about elevate and expand, we're elevating and expanding all those categories. And so we remain committed to that. That said, we are cognizant that performance of some businesses especially in consumer tissue is a little bit more variable. And so I think we've been on the record in the past, our consumer tissue in the North America is a little bit more profitable, and some our international businesses, but we have very strong profitable international businesses as well. And so the decision around exiting Brazil tissue, I think, is specific to the conditions in Brazil, what I've said in the past around portfolio is, hey, we're going to look to add businesses most more, with a greater focus on personal care, I would say, internationally, where there's a lot of growth opportunity. Indonesia is one great example where while we just reduced our medium term expectations for that business with the impairment, we still see a very long and bright future in that country for us. And we remain committed to Indonesia for long term because at some point, it's going to be in the top three of the largest type of markets in the world, and it's probably around the corner for us. And so we remain excited about that. But that said, there are other markets that are more structurally challenged. And so Brazil tissue was one of those. And that was driven by, we would say, some policies that encouraged capital investment into tissue making. And so there was a lot of capacity coming in, and we felt like the Neve business and brand would have been in better hands with Suzano, than with us. And so we made that transaction. So I think our, we're looking at, we love all the sectors that we're in, but we're going to make decisions based on local market conditions and make sure our brands can be competitive for the long term. Javier Escalante : So then, as a follow up, this is very interesting, but as a follow up, so we think that in countries where you have very large personal care businesses, and some sort of ancillary tissue businesses like Brazil, for example, that you may continue divesting, things like that, say it China or whatever, where you do have enough critical mass to run that business independently and do not need to have attach a low margin tissue business. Michael Hsu : Yes, I guess it's always possible, Javier, I wouldn't overread into it. I mean we're comfortable with our businesses and how they're performing where they are. But that said, I think if I would probably say we're going to stay close to local market conditions and make sure it's something I've talked about internally with our management, which is businesses need to perform for us. And so while we love all our businesses, they do need to perform and performance as part of the game for us. And so that's probably the bigger barometer for us. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Chris Carey : Hey, good morning, everyone. Can you perhaps just frame your expectations for price mix versus volumes for the full year or specifically for the back half of the year? And perhaps just related to that how you might be thinking about the spending to reaccelerate volumes. Mike, I heard you say promotions might take up a little bit. I don't know if that was a comment on any specific region. But some context on how you see volumes trending from here. And the types of actions that you might be taking to drive a little bit better volume performance would be helpful. Michael Hsu : Okay, Chris, let me start and Nelson maybe give me some more specifics around the volume versus price. But hey, we're pleased with our volume trends. Certainly as just to refresh your memory, Chris, we moved relatively early on pricing, we move pretty quickly. And so a lot of our pricing went in last year maybe in the front half of the year, we should start to cycle the price element of the P&L as we approach the back half. And so what we would expect to see our volume trends improve, and we are encouraged, because we have seen sequential volume improvement overall in the business, and then specifically by sector, kind of as we've gone through the year, and so, we expect to continue to see that. That said, as I said on the call our market shares a little soft, we were up or even in just below 40% of our cohorts, our market category combinations, which is a little less than we would prefer, right, we want to be over 50%. And so one is the big drivers behind that, Chris, I'd say a couple things. One is, we were quick on pricing. And so in the parlance of one of our general managers, we're seeing competition, quote, unquote, scrape us a little bit and that means kind of lagging the price to take advantage perhaps on the share momentum side. And so that's one aspect. The other aspect is we are cycling a host of one offs and supply challenges is also relevant to Lauren's question when she asked about tissue margin, there's a lot of noise in our numbers just because we're now lapping the third order effects of the Texas storm, there's still supply challenges, et cetera. But with that said, there's a bunch of one off thing related to both supply and the cycling that affect the business and then we, to be true we definitely have some competitive issues that are I would say normal across our business. And we'd like to see performance improve in a few markets. And that's why we want to continue to invest. And we're committed to investing more behind our brands, we feel great about the innovation that we have coming, generally globally, and we feel great about our commercial programs, and recognize that there's better opportunities for us to be felt that our investment to support the brands. We are, Chris, I'd say we're not really focused on driving promotion to kind of earn back that share. Maybe we would respond certainly to competitive conditions. But I'm much more focused on earning for the long term. And that means kind of driving consumers, or encouraging consumers to try our products, and then having them stay there because they liked the quality of our products. And so that's really our focus. Nelson, you want to\u2014 Nelson Urdaneta : Yes, and then to add some flavor, Chris, on the outlook, and what we've seen, in terms of volume, I mean, at some perspective, I mean, we've seen continued improvement in our volume trends. If you step back Q4 of last year volumes were down 7%, Q1 of this year, volumes were down 5%. Q2, the quarter, we just closed volumes were down 3%. Many of the actions that we have to take to deal with the inflation go back to the first half of last year, the majority of them. So as we step into the third quarter of the year and the fourth quarter, we will begin lapping some of them, and what we would expect that this point of we're projecting is the volumes to continue to improve on a sequential basis as the year progresses. And the overall revenue growth management actions should decrease in terms of the impact they're having on the top line growth. We've already seen that from a sequential quarter, Q1 to Q2, that came down. And then mix, we've been doing about a point, I would expect that to be the same as we progress. Chris Carey : That's really helpful perspective. Just one follow up from input inflation perspective. Can you talk about what specifically improved relative to your prior expectations? And if you have any comments on phasing clearly, we're getting into it seems a bit deflationary into the back half is that Q3 and Q4, is that all head to Q4, or any context on the phasing would also be helpful. So thanks so much. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes, so just to give you a context, I mean on a, we, the latest guidance that we have on costs on input cost inflation is that it would be at around $100 million. So that's about $50 million better than what we were forecasting back in April, when we last talked. Through the first half, we are at about $190 million negative. So it's an impact. So evidently, what's going to happen is we're seeing about a $90 million give or take benefit, as we go into the balance of the year. We will see some of that coming in Q3. And then the balance, obviously, in Q4, what we're seeing is versus our prior outlook, the overall fibre complex has gotten a little bit better, and distribution costs have gotten a little bit better. I will, however, just highlight that on a year-over-year basis, we're still seeing pulp and the overall fiber complex inflationary for us. Even though if you take it as a whole, the latest outlooks have fiber being year on year down in the mid-teens, if you aggregate everything. So net-net that's come down distribution is about flat now year-over-year for us. And then the only big cost bucket that's down significantly continues to be the resin complex, which again, that's down overall for the quarter 50%. So we're projecting about 40% down. Michael Hsu : Yes, I mean, Chris, the headline for me is the cost environment for us, has stabilized and that's really, really good news for us after cycling, I mean, 2021 and 2022, where we had record inflation for us while it's still modestly inflationary, we can operate very well in a stable cost environment. And so we're seeing both input costs stabilized and also the supply environment while we still have some sporadic outages in supply it's much improved. And so we're bullish on the road ahead for us on the cost environment. Operator : Your next question is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. So, I just wanted to return to share for a bit I mean, your comments seemed more glass half full here in terms of sequential improvement in share. But if we look specifically at US scanner data, some fairly pronounced year-over-year share losses in Q2 in consumer tissue and diapers. So we're just hoping you can put the US scanner data in context. And then second, plans to drive improve share trends going forward. Sounds like perhaps there might be a bit more promotion, but not necessarily big focus innovation ramps up is that sort of the plans to drive improved share from here? Or how do you think about the share trends in the back half of the years, specifically in the US? Michael Hsu : Yes, Dara, yes, definitely, I believe the shares will improve. We feel very confident in our programming and our innovation that's coming. And year-to-date, we feel really good about what that's done in the marketplace. I would say, the recent softness is, as I mentioned earlier, Dara, primarily related to the relatively faster pace of our price advances last year. And so that kind of really is the primary effect. But I would also say, in North America, specifically we are facing a fairly tough comp, just to refresh your memory, I think personal care, in personal care we were up 14%, in the year ago quarter, and across both personal care and tissue market shares were a bit elevated, that was an artifact. And I think we've talked about this time a year ago, which was, we're out of, our supply was tight in the first and second quarter of 2021. And so we had the kind of restock impact and the kind of reselling impact in the year ago quarter, and we're cycling that now. So we did see our shares were higher in the year ago quarter higher than they historically were. And I think that was related to the, I would say coming back into business in Q2 of 2022. But that said, we're not satisfied with our share performance. And definitely want to be up or even in over half. And so we are committed, we feel very good about our programming, especially in North America, I mentioned our Baby Butts advertising in our product improvements in North America on Huggies, and so we feel good about where we are, and we're going to continue to invest in the brands and make sure that we continue to touch base by consumers and encourage them to try our products and return. Dara Mohsenian : Okay, great. And then on the innovation front, you sound excited there, any thoughts on if the contribution to sales growth should pick up significantly on innovation, as we look out over the next couple years versus the last couple years? Any conceptual thoughts there will be helpful. Michael Hsu : Well, just to point out, Dara, I think I don't have the numbers for this year yet. The last year, our contribution to sales from innovation was probably among the highest in the industry. And so we do track, we do have a couple internal metrics around, net incrementality. And then percent of sales related to the innovation. And so we felt very strong last year. And so we felt good about that. But that said some of the things that I just showed on the slides in our presentation this morning, we feel good about really good about the technology, and the product innovation on the premium side that we're having in diapers, especially in China. In China, organic was up nearly double digit against the backdrop where the category is declining double digit, and so, and we've doubled our super premium mix over the last year or so. And then as I mentioned, on the slides, we've launched two really exciting products over Cottonelle six funnel that features really a two zone liner, that one that handles the urine, and one that handles the solid waste, right as a as I like to say poop, and then we have something that we're calling oxygen bar pro, which is really, really high breathability diaper, which moms in China really love and so we feel good about that. And we're bringing technologies like those around the world. Operator : Your next question is coming from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Hi, how are you? Mike, I wanted to just kind of stick on the innovation topic. I mean, I think the messaging for me has been very clear in terms of how active you're going to be later this year, probably even going into 2024. But one of the common pieces of feedback I get from the retail community is that everyone is really going to be very, very active innovation, because there was a lot of products that was not launched during the COVID timeframe. So I just wanted to kind of get your reaction to that. And thoughts on that and could we potentially see maybe some unexpected levels of spending just because you're going to have to compete with so many other active innovation pipeline and shelf space is finite? Thanks. Michael Hsu : Yes, I mean, Nik, we feel good about our investment levels. I mean, they have ramped up significantly over the last five years. And again, as I just mentioned we're up about 190 basis points year-to-date, between the lines of which Nelson you said about half is on the advertising side. And you really the model is we're investing in the advertising, primarily to support the innovation. And so we feel very good about our programming. And as I've said, on prior calls, and Alison, our Chief Growth Officer has said at CAGNY presentations what we're really focused on kind of big unmet needs, or internally, we'll call those demand spaces where we feel like, hey, there's important things that the consumers are looking for out of the category in a category like diapers, or adult care that may be around absorption or protection. I mentioned skin health earlier, which is something that hasn't been a big part of this category, where we think, is a very important part of the category, particularly as it relates to solid waste. And then comfort, fit, breathability are all big factors. And so those are kind of big areas for us to get better in where I feel like the categories can do a much better job over time. So and we shared a lot of our thinking around innovation with our customers over the long term, and they remain very excited. And we're receiving very strong customer support for innovation. So I think your point, yes, is there going to be more innovation from other manufacturers and across the category? Yes. But our focus is on driving the big innovations that we have, and making sure that we invest materially behind those to make sure that we can drive the conversion in the minds of the consumer. Operator : Your next question is coming from Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : Good morning. Thank you for the question. Just as a follow up to Chris' question, I wanted to ask on how you're viewing the health of the consumer. You've mentioned a bit of bifurcation this year between the low and higher income consumers on their ability to absorb price. And then the latest scanner data from this morning it implies, some volumes are continuing to decelerate while you're getting on price. So as a result, I was wondering if we should expect softer volumes to continue in Q3 offset by better pricing, and just how you're seeing these trends play out where the second half of the year between Q3 and Q4? Michael Hsu : Yes, Anna, I would say consumer demand remains resilient. Our categories thus far remain healthy and demand has been robust, just pick up a few numbers, I mean, North American consumer across our categories, is not just the categories of high single digit. Western Europe, which is a big developed market for us, teens in Latin America, double digits, KC Professional globally was up double digits. And so, I would say the category overall demand remains pretty robust. Are we aware of concerns around the corner regarding related to the economy and economic pressures, for sure. And we talk about that all the time, thus far it has not materialized. In the second quarter, the elasticity impact has remained muted, somewhat muted. Just to give you an example, on diapers in the category for the quarter price was up six, and volume was up one, so that would probably say the elasticity impact has not been as we typically model. And so I I'd say on that side it does reflect the essential nature of our categories. So, our volume trends as we kind of cycle our pricing from year ago we expect our volume trends to continue to improve and we think should improve in the back half, in addition, driven by the commercial programming innovation that we've been talking about. And so I think overall I'd say healthy, not seeing a whole lot of broad scale down tearing. We do see in pockets there is continued demand for premium and big development markets like the US like China, even in Brazil and Argentina, we're seeing actually the premium tiers start to grow and the value tiers contract a little bit. There are some pockets of down tearing. We're seeing that in Southeast Asia, some markets in Latin America, and but we're in to manage through that we're going to continue to sharpen our value propositions. I mean, we're very interested in serving all consumers as category leaders. We feel like we need to serve both in the consumers that are looking for premium products, but also the ones on the value side as well. And so we have a broad portfolio that spans value to premium. And we're doing things like adjusting counts to make sure our large packs remain competitive and affordable. We're sharpening our entry price points and small format stores, to make sure that consumers can afford to be in the category. And then probably most importantly, in my mind is we've talked a lot about innovation. We are doing a better job of accelerating or cascading, that innovation through our tiers from premium to value. And so that's kind of how we will manage through it. Anna Lizzul : Thank you, that's very helpful. And you also talked a bit about promotion here, I know, you're not necessarily interested in getting back to pre-COVID levels of promotion, investing a little bit more in marketing with your current levels of marketing spend versus peers, potentially spending more, do you feel that your marketing spends here is efficient versus others in the industry? Michael Hsu : Well, I'll answer the second part first, Anna, we are, I would say we're highly efficient on the marketing side. I mean, we've invested quite a bit over the last several years around revenue management analytics, marketing ROI analytics, and so we maybe to a fault, we're perhaps overly analytical in terms of how we invest. But in general, I feel very good about the returns are getting we're getting, which is why, which is also why it gives us the confidence to invest more. We recognize we're not spending fully at the levels of some of our competitors. But we've made significant progress over the last few years, I think we're up several 100, or a few 100 basis points in advertising spending over the last five years. And so we're, I would say, pleased with that progress, but not satisfied. And part of the whole reason why we're very focused on being disciplined about how we drive both revenue, volume mix, innovation is that we feel like it's important to continue and invest behind these brands. Because that's the way that we can drive category growth and serve our consumers better. Nelson Urdaneta : And, Anna, another point on the investment, keep in mind that we have three segments, and we don't invest at the same level in each segment. So what we disclose is a total number for the company. So if you take as an example, KC Professional, the level of investment behind KC Professional is not going to be anywhere near what we're doing on personal care. And if you look at consumer tissue, it will vary by market. So we look at that very closely. And as Mike said, we are very focused on return on investment and being efficient on those dollars that we spend per segment. Operator : Your next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Good morning. How are you? Just first on the pricing. I have a question for both you Mike and also of clarification for Nelson. So on the pricing side, you're getting obviously strong realization, but lapping the pricing that you mentioned like you're ahead of your competitors. So what are you embedding into the second half? Just to be clear, it seems like the guide you, the new guide at midpoint implies about 3% organic in the second half? So how much you expect and it sounds as if you're expecting an inflection in volumes at some point? I don't, I mean, you said sequentially bad of course, you had negative in the quarter. So just to clarify, what you are expecting for the third quarter and potentially the fourth. And then now so on the gross margin side, the $9 million benefit from prior outlook. My math is like about 45 basis points benefit for the year, your tax benefit from the impairment is another I think $0.05. So how should we be thinking of your EPS guidance raised? These 45 basis points benefits would go in flow through EBIT it seems I think you're flowing the whole portion. So in other words, you're not embedding additional promo pressure or marketing pressure in your Outlook. Thank you. Michael Hsu : Yes, Andrea. Yes, thanks for the question. I don't know if how well I can answer it all because we I don't think we outlook kind of the components of price mix volume. However, I would say, am I expecting an inflection on volume? For sure. At some point, I don't know when that's going to be but at some point, I want volumes to be positive. And just to give you, refresh your memory pre- COVID, I think for the three years leading up to our -- a lot of our revenue growth was primarily volume driven. And so I do expect us and this is why we're investing in innovation and commercial programs. For the business to grow healthy long term, we need the volumes to be up. And so yes, for sure I'm expecting an inflection end of point. Andrea Teixeira : During 2023, I'm sorry, to just to make sure. Michael Hsu : Again, I said our volume trends are improving. I can't give you the inflection point. And I'm not going to forecast or give guidance on an inflection point. However, I would point out the majority of our pricing initiatives were more front end loaded or front half loaded last year, and so we are starting to cycle those. And so I would expect our, the contribution of revenue from price to diminish and hopefully the contribution to revenue from volume and mix to continue to improve. Nelson Urdaneta : So, I would point you, Andrea, to the following, we've seen sequentially in the last couple of quarters, an improvement of about 200 basis points in volume. So we went from down seven to down five to down three. Now, as Mike said, we're not going to, we don't forecast or disclose the next quarter and break down, et cetera. But clearly, you're seeing that the volumes have been improving sequentially. And that has to do one with the pricing, but also with some of the innovation and the products we have been putting out in the marketplace, and the increased investments behind the brands. So yes, we are expecting volumes to improve continuously. I mean, that's our expectation. We are expecting revenue growth, management realization to be less of a driver. And again, that has played out over the last few quarters. And as I explained earlier, so that's kind of the way to think about it as the year progresses. And yes, we will get back to positive volumes. That's the plan on that end. In terms of the operating profit. Again, I'll try to address the question. So your point around, what are we flowing? How is it going? We've got a few things playing out in terms of operating profit, I mean, one, we have a slightly better performance in the first half. And we're flowing part of that flow because we know that's coming through the actuals. But also, we're having a better outlook on costs. And that's also equating into better performance on the outlook for EBIT, which I believe that's a question you had. For EPS, there are a few puts and takes in the quarter. Yes, tax rate was a bit of a driver, but we're still expecting the tax rate for the year to be in the 23% to 25%. So think of that more as a timing. We're not moving away from the guidance in terms of tax. And then between the lines, there's really not much of a bigger driver apart from that, that I would highlight at this point. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Congrats on a solid first half of the year. A couple of comments so far or answers to the questions that have been posed to around market share have focused on competitors are lagging, your price increases. As you noted, those price increases have been in place for pretty long now, it's not uncommon for competitors to lag pricing by a couple of months, but it's not uncommon to have them lag for a couple of quarters and then follow. So I imagine your assumption, and our assumption should be that they're just not going to fall. And if that's the case, do you accept these market share losses, like you just got to live with them. Or should we expect you to have to close those price gap to try to regain that market share? Michael Hsu : Yes, couple things, Jason. I think great point, thing I'll say is generally at this point I would say we've seen list prices move but when I say quote unquote, scraping or let your word lagging, I'd say we have seen a little bit higher promotion in some markets, particularly in Latin America, in Brazil, for instance. We've seen continued promotional activity. So I think that has been what we've observed more and more commonly. The list prices had lagged for a period, at this point, I'd say a lot of the brands have had moved as well. And so overall, I'd say the tactic is around the promotional side. And as I've mentioned, Jason, hey, we're going to be smart about it, it's not the way that we think is the valuable way to build the business in these categories. And so but we have invested in our GMK capability, we do know, the analytics, and we can make wise investments around promotion. That the bigger thing is, and I think to your point, yes, I'm not going to live with, we have to grow shares over the long term to sustain the business, just like we have to have volumes up. And so market shares need to grow. That's why our goal is to be upper even in more than in about half or more. And that's the goal. And so, but that's also why you've heard us talk quite a bit about our innovation and commercial programs. It's why we spent a lot of time with consumers talking about them and spent a lot of time with our customers talking about them, and we feel good about where we are. But I think you're certainly pointing to the one area that I feel like we really need to improve, and we're committed to doing that. Operator : Your next question is coming from Peter Grom from UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks operator. Hey, good morning, guys. Hope you're doing well. So I guess I've kind of wanted to get some more color on what's embedded in the outlook from a gross margin perspective. I think previously, the expectation was 230 basis points, you reiterated your outlook for an increase in ad spending of 100 bps this morning. So is the expectation for 250 basis points now? The premise of the question is that, it just seems that that would imply that gross margin improvement, would kind of taper off in the back half of the year, and just given what you're seeing in terms of cost pressures, and productivity, that would seem somewhat conservative. So just, if you could help us understand the outlook for gross margin today, and any phasing in the back half of the year, that would be helpful. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes, sure. Let me walk a little bit through the outlook and some of the components that we have. And as a reminder, Peter, what I stated at the last call was that our expectation was at least 230 basis points because it was a straight math. Obviously, we've reached a 34% gross margins in the second quarter, we're very pleased with the progress that has been made, as we seek to recover back to the pre-COVID levels of 35% and then expand from there. So we've had two quarters of very strong gains in gross margin. And obviously, as we go into the back half of the year, I'd state two things. One, we do expect the half year-over-year gain in gross margins. We do expect that gross margins, margins as a whole, gross operating profit should expand as in the second half, but not at the pace that we saw in the first half. So as you're thinking about your numbers, that's the way I would think about it. So we would exit the year definitely stronger. The implied number, yes, as you say, would be 250 on the gross margin. But that again, that's at least, that's the way I would characterize that. Because obviously, we've been expanding ahead of that year-to-date. As you think about the balance of the year, I'd also like to highlight a few things on the outlook on costs, we have not changed that the currency impact that we foresee. We only took down costs by about $50 million, we still expect the full year to be around the $300 million to $400 million of inflation in currency. And then in the other costs, we still expect around $200 million. It's been playing out in the first half right around the level we expected. So net-net, good progress on margins. We're pleased with how that's coming along. We expect to continue to make gains, but not at the same pace as what we did in the first half. Michael Hsu : Yes, maybe, Peter, I'll just add just the outlook as Nelson just teed up really does reflect the strength of our first half and our confidence in our underlying plan. As I mentioned earlier, our categories, thus far remained healthy. And demand has been robust. We've strong innovation and commercial lineup, and we feel great to be investing more than that. The cost environment has been stable. And so while it's still a headwind, I'd say we're seeing glimpses of reversion. And so that's a good thing. But the other part of it, in our outlook embedded in it, and it is we do expect ongoing volatility. And so certainly as you're well aware, there's a lot of economic uncertainty in our major markets, soft versus a hard landing and the implications for consumer spending first and foremost. We're still dealing with a lot of political uncertainty, including the effects of the war. And then as I mentioned earlier, we still have some sporadic supply challenges, while it's much improved versus where it was two years ago. We still have some outages and so there's some inherent volatility, but overall, we feel very good about where the business is and where we're going and feel very good about our outlook. Peter Grom : Thanks. That's really helpful. I guess maybe one follow up on that. I guess just given you mentioned some reversion in the cost on the horizon. I mean, I guess, based on where things stand today, how should we be thinking about cost pressures looking out to 2024? I mean should we expect that this could remain a tailwind looking ahead. And I guess the bigger question is, how does this really inform your view on when you expect to return to that 35% gross margin target that you've outlined? Michael Hsu : Well, certainly I'll start with, I don't think I'm going to give you guidance on \u201824 yet, but I think definitely very pleased with our progress on margin recovery. Certainly, as you saw our gross and operating margins expand, I think we've done a great job with the revenue realization managing the cost environment, and so we feel very good about that. Our goal is to restore our margins to where they were back in 2019, our gross margins. I think we are making that progress, but we are not going to stop there either. So when I got into this role back in 2019, I said at that time one of our goals is to expand our margins over time. And so what we're trying to do, Peter, is one, restore, and then when we get there then we need to expand and there's not two parts of the plan. There's one plan. And so we're going to continue to work that all the levers that we've talked about, both from a revenue management perspective and a cost management perspective, to drive ongoing margin expansion. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to our hosts for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Michael Hsu : Okay, thank you all for joining us for the call today. We look forward to seeing you in Q3, at the end of Q3. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time. And have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Christina Cheng. Ma'am, the floor is yours. Christina Cheng : Welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note today's presentation will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements and you should not place any undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to deviate materially from our expectations. Our remarks today refer to adjusted results which exclude certain items described in our news release. We use non-GAAP financial measures to help investors understand our ongoing business performance. Please consult our press release for a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. We have published supplemental materials which are found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Participating in today's call are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Hsu; and our Chief Financial Officer, Nelson Urdaneta. Mike will start the discussion with our strategic priorities and provide an overview of our performance for the quarter. Nelson will provide a detailed discussion on our Q3 results and our outlook before we open the floor to Q&A. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Michael Hsu : Thank you, Christina. We delivered another quarter of strong results. I'm proud of how our teams around the world are executing our growth strategy. Our innovation and commercial programs are contributing to the top line momentum with improving volume and market share trends and strong gross margin expansion. Based on the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year outlook. Third quarter and year-to-date organic sales increased 5%, with growth across all segments. Personal Care, our largest business, led the way with 7% organic growth and importantly, 2% volume growth. Further gains in price and mix were enabled by strong revenue growth management capability, while volume improved sequentially for a third consecutive quarter. We expect volume trends to continue improving as we cycle prior pricing actions and continue to invest in our brands. We also continue to make excellent progress on margin recovery. Gross margin was up 530 basis points and exceeded 2019 levels, an important milestone in our commitment to restore our gross margin. Operating profit was up 18% and adjusted earnings per share grew 24%. Given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we're raising our 2023 outlook. We now expect organic sales to grow 4% to 5% and adjusted earnings per share to increase 15% to 17%. Global demand in our categories and for our brands remains resilient. In key markets, we're seeing a healthier balance of growth in both price and volume. In North America Consumer, organic sales were up 7%, with volume up 3%. Dynamics were similar in EMEA. In China, organic sales and volume were both up double digits despite ongoing category softness. While growth across D&E continues to be mixed, consumption increased double digits in Latin America. In our largest markets, our market shares are improving. In North America, we saw a sequential improvement in 6 of 8 categories. This was enabled by strong commercial execution, marketing activation and a significant easing of year-to-date supply constraints in personal care and facial tissue. In the U.K., new performance-enhancing designs, price pack offerings and digital initiatives have resulted in over 200 basis points of year-over-year share gains for Andrex. And in China, we're continuing to see strong market share momentum with Huggies share up nearly 200 basis points in the quarter. As market leaders, we're raising the bar by elevating and expanding our categories with superior products and advantaged technology to address unmet needs. We're also committed to meeting consumers where they need us by offering a comprehensive range of products across the value spectrum. I'll highlight a few examples. In China, we introduced a breakthrough design for Huggies with innovation that whisks away both forms of babies mess to reduce the frequency of diaper rash. This is a foundational element of our global skin health platform. In North America, we launched new Poise 7-drop ultra observancy pads and 8-drop overnight. These higher-capacity designs provide better absorbency in protection than daytime pads. Also in North America tissue, Scott 1000 lasts longer and dissolve faster and this has been core to Scott's powerful proposition among value-oriented consumers and that's why Scott continues to deliver robust growth in this important daily use segment. We believe our ongoing investment in advantage technology and brand communications will attract more consumers, increase usage occasions and ultimately grow our categories. I'm proud of the progress we've made to offset the multiyear impact of inflation on our P&L. Restoring margins to pre-pandemic levels was a milestone and not our end goal. We will continue to expand margins by executing our commercial and productivity programs to deliver balanced and sustainable growth for the long term. I'll now turn it over to Nelson to provide more details on our third quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year. Nelson Urdaneta : Thanks, Mike. We delivered another quarter of strong results across the company. Net sales were $5.1 billion, up 2% versus last year. Organic sales increased 5%, led by high single-digit growth in the Personal Care segment and in North America. Volume improved sequentially for the third quarter in a row to minus 1%, while price realization was 5% and mix contributed 1 point of growth. Currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately 200 basis points. The exit of our Brazil tissue business had an additional impact of 100 basis points, primarily on Consumer Tissue and our Professional business. Let me spend a few minutes on each of our segments. First, Personal Care organic sales increased 7% this quarter. Price realization drove 4 points of growth and mix contributed 1%. Volume turned positive for the first time in 5 quarters, with an increase of 2%. North America and developing and emerging markets organic sales grew in the high single digits, with volume increases in North America. Developed markets grew low single digits. Within Personal Care, each of our subcategories grew high single digits. Operating margin for the segment improved 250 basis points versus a year ago, driven by gross margin improvement, while we continue to increase our investments in our brands. Second, organic growth in Consumer Tissue was 2%. Within Consumer Tissue, North America delivered 4% organic growth, driven by healthy demand in dry bath and towels. Outstanding results from the U.K. drove 2% growth in the developed markets on top of last year's 11% increase. Operating margin for the segment was up 320 basis points versus a year ago, driven by revenue growth management and improved service levels. Finally, our K-C Professional business posted 4% organic growth despite challenging comparisons against last year. On a 2-year average, organic sales growth was 7%. Demand for our washroom business remains healthy and new commercial programs drove share gains in North America. Strong revenue realization was partially offset by lower volumes which were partly driven by the timing of select planned price adjustments. Operating margin for Professional improved by 550 basis points which was broadly in line with the first half of 2023. Turning to the rest of the P&L. Third quarter gross margin increased 530 basis points to 35.8%. Revenue growth management, input cost tailwinds and about $90 million in FORCE savings more than offset other manufacturing costs and currency headwinds. The cost environment remains mixed. With favorability in raw materials offset by higher energy prices, currency headwinds and higher labor costs. Other manufacturing costs were $30 million higher than last year. Between the lines spending was 20.7% of net sales, up 310 basis points versus a year ago, reflecting year-on-year inflation and investments in our brands, our people and our capabilities. These results also reflect higher year-on-year incentive compensation accruals. Operating profit for the quarter increased 18% and operating margin improved by 210 basis points to 15.1%. This includes a currency headwind of $135 million or a 21 percentage point profit impact, of which 4 points were due to the translation of earnings from non-U.S. operations and the balance was largely driven by transactional costs. Lastly, the adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.5%, in line with last year's 22.3%. Our operating results, coupled with lower net interest expense and gains in equity income drove a 24% growth in adjusted earnings per share to $1.74 in the third quarter. Turning to balance sheet and cash flow highlights. Through the first 9 months of the year, we generated $2.3 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital spending was $549 million compared to $679 million last year. We expect to end the year with CapEx of approximately $800 million. Year-to-date, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now let me say a few words about our outlook. Based on our strong results, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect organic sales growth of 4% to 5% and net sales growth of 1% to 2%, reflecting the impact of unfavorable currency and divestitures. We also now expect adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%. Currency headwinds continue to worsen given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Argentina peso and other key currencies. Based on recent currency forward curves, we are projecting that currency will have a negative top line impact of approximately 300 basis points and a bottom line headwind of approximately $450 million, up from our previous assumption of $300 million to $400 million for the year. On input costs, we now expect headwinds of approximately $50 million versus the previous outlook of $100 million. Other manufacturing costs are now expected to increase by approximately $250 million compared to $200 million in our prior outlook. With gross margins returning to pre-pandemic levels in the quarter, we remain focused on driving cost discipline and productivity to create more fuel for growth. For the full year, we project FORCE to deliver $300 million to $350 million, reflecting favorable results from ongoing negotiations of our materials purchases. Continued progress in gross margin recovery puts us in a great position to advance our commercial programs and we continue to expect advertising spend to increase by approximately 100 basis points for the full year. Overall, we now expect operating margin to increase 170 basis points at the midpoint of our guidance compared to an increase of 150 basis points in our July guidance. Below the line, net interest expense is expected to decline in the high single digits. We have also updated our assumption for adjusted tax rate to 23% to 24%. These improvements result in our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%. In closing, while we continue to operate in a volatile environment, we remain focused on executing our growth strategy, including continued investments in our brands and capabilities for long-term value creation. With that, we will open the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Chris Carey : So one question just around commodities. So clearly continuing to see favorability but we have seen some firming of late. And I just wonder how you see things over kind of near- to medium-term horizon from specifically the commodity basket? So basically trying to balance the fact that you're seeing favorability this year, you have hedges and there's timing impacts that aren't really going to impact this year but just how you're watching this overall commodity environment. I'm really asking this in the context of the potential need to take pricing against volumes and how that balance is going to work over the medium term? Michael Hsu : Yes. I'll start with a quick comment and then I'll ask Nelson to kind of give you a lot more additional context and detail. But one, Chris, I'd say, we finally saw inflection in the cost environment for us. As you know, we've taken on a lot of inflation over the past couple of years. And even this year, the plan was additional, between currency and commodities, about $500 million of impact. And so in the quarter -- so our first quarter were -- the costs actually were favorable. And so that's a significant inflection point for us. I do expect input cost to be a modest tailwind going forward but don't expect necessarily that there's going to be a lot that's come behind that. The one thing is, though, we do believe and I mentioned this in the prepared remarks that it's our job to expand margins over time and we believe we have a lot of opportunity to do that on an ongoing basis between what we're doing on the revenue side and also on the cost side. But Nelson, maybe... Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. Just to elaborate a little, Chris, on what Mike was walking you through. So at this stage, what we've seen in the quarter and it's playing out the way we had forecast back in July. In general, the savings that we're seeing are driven by pulp, distribution and other commodities. And we've actually seen some increases, especially as we look forward, on resin-based materials and energy costs. We had our first quarter of a benefit, so $75 million. And as you remember, for the first half of the year, we were negative around $190 million. Based on where we stand today, we still project that we will be favorable in the fourth quarter of the year by an amount that's not that dissimilar from what we had in the fourth quarter of the year. And for the full year, we would be around $50 million in terms of commodities negatively impacted. One thing to keep in mind is we've also been driving a lot of benefits, Chris, through our FORCE program. Remember, we engage in negotiations in some of the materials where there's no clear market for us to engage in hedging. And we've been actively pursuing this over the last few quarters. So that's also been a contributor for FORCE which includes our net -- our negotiated material prices and that's flowed through. As Mike said, we don't expect tremendous tailwinds going forward but we're pleased with where the overall costs are at this stage. Chris Carey : That's very helpful. And then 1 follow-up just on Personal Care and specifically the North America part of the Personal Care division. The volume growth there, can you just talk to the durability, what year ago comps had to do with that? And then within the North America business. I wonder if you can talk about what categories are driving this? Michael Hsu : Yes, great question, Chris. I'll give you maybe a view and a couple of different components. One, I'd say overall North America consumption remains robust. And I think that really does reflect the essential nature of our category. Our consumption in North America for K-C was up mid-single digit with solid growth across all categories. And then, I think one thing I did mention in the prepared remarks is we are coming off some fairly significant supply constraints that affected most of our Personal Care businesses and our Kleenex business mostly throughout the year. And so we did have shipments that were a little higher than consumption. And I'll give you an example on Baby Care. Organic shipments were up in the teens, low-teens, while consumption was up about between 3% and 4%. And so that really reflects, I think, retailers getting their inventories back in position. We had been allocating shipments on Huggies since the beginning of the year. And we had a pretty significant supply situation with a supplier outage that has constrained our volume, is actually kind of constrained our share throughout the course of the year on a number of brands. And so we came out of that, we came off allocation across all brands at some point in mid-September. And so that's kind of why shipments probably ended up in the quarter a little bit higher. Nelson Urdaneta : And on the comp, Chris, also remember the last year in Q3 in September, we had a bit of a destock; so that's also kind of weighing in. But very pleased with where we ended up. And more importantly, the underlying consumption in North America. Operator : Your next question is coming from Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : I also had a question on the better gross margins which clearly benefited from the lower input costs. I was wondering are you seeing a reversal of that recently with the input costs like the higher oil prices? Just to follow up on Chris' question. And also, if you can elaborate on what drove the better cost savings in FORCE this quarter? Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. So a few things. As we go through the second half of the year, we still -- as I indicated, to Chris, we still expect to have, based on current assumptions, favorability on commodities heading into Q4 on a net basis. Because remember, through the first half of the year, we were around $190 million negative. We were $75 million favorable in the third quarter and we're calling for the full year an estimate of $50 million of a headwind in net. So we still expect to be favorable in the fourth quarter. Having said that, we're, of course, watchful of what's happening with the oil markets and the implications for resins. They don't immediately impact the resins but we have seen resins begin to plateau at the level of prices. And in fact, I mean, curves are starting to move a little bit upwards and we're watching that. But overall, we still expect commodities to be down over the next quarter-or-so, at least. The other bid in gross margin, as you said, was FORCE. We had a strong delivery of FORCE savings for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we're at $275 million and we've actually taken up our call for the year to $300 million to $350 million. So net-net, I mean, we are encouraged by the overall cost savings and our program in FORCE. And in terms of gross margin, keep in mind, it's not linear. We don't expect gross margins to grow linearly quarter after quarter because there are always puts and takes quarter-to-quarter. But having hit the 35.8% mark is an important milestone for us as we look forward to then expand margins down the road. Michael Hsu : And then, Anna, maybe just an additional comment. I think the maybe underlying your question and Chris before, was, hey, there appears to be some underlying volatility in cost -- input costs and they're likely is. And we've dealt with that significantly over the past several years. I would say, longer term, we believe it's our job to continue to enhance margins, so we would remain disciplined in terms of our revenue management program and capability and also our cost management capability. Nelson Urdaneta : And again, another item to add, Anna, as you think about the next few quarters is currency. Currency has gotten more volatile. I mean we've seen the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. And as you would have seen in our outlook, we did take up our expected headwinds from currency on our operating profit. And again, we're watching that carefully as we think about 2024. Anna Lizzul : Great. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, you did have the benefit from better-than-expected pricing in the quarter, while volumes were soft. So you did see a nice sequential improvement in the change of volumes from Q2 to Q3? I was wondering how we should think about the sequential improvement potentially from Q3 to Q4 in volumes? Michael Hsu : Well, we've had, I would say, 4 quarters of successive volume improvement. So I think we were down 7, down 5, down 3, whatever, down 1. And importantly, Personal Care volumes were up this quarter. So I'd say we're making solid progress. We're seeing solid volume momentum. And I think I said in the prepared remarks that we would expect continued improvement. We're not ready to call '24 yet but I think volume -- we cycled most of our big pricing actions from last year. And so we would expect volume trends to continue to improve as we drive our commercial programs and invest behind our brands. Operator : Your next question is coming from Javier Escalante from Evercore ISI. Javier Escalante : My question has to do with the pricing side, particularly in North America which is 80% of your profits and it's where we have more visibility on. The pricing seems to be constructive, right, for private label. Promotional levels are below 2019. But we did see a little bit of a pickup on year-end, at least in track channels. So if you can talk about whether what is promotionally -- is it what categories? What's the point? Is it because the some of your categories are coming out of allocation? If you can comment on that? And then I have a more strategic question after that. Michael Hsu : Yes. Well, I'd say part one, Javier, I think I said this in the past and philosophically, I think we view trade promotion as a path to drive trial, especially of new items. And so that's kind of where it fits in our marketing mix. And so I'm not a fan of using promotion to rent or borrow share for a period of time. And so I think any data that you might say -- I'd say, we are promoting still below, as you point out, 2019 levels. But I think we have participated in some promotions. I did see your note and I would say one thing that kind of skews the analysis a little bit is this whole metric the denominator is EQ, right, or equivalent units. And for all the tissue categories, the equivalent unit is 10,000 sheets and for diapers, it's 1,000 diapers. And so when you do it on that basis or on a per piece basis, what happens, especially in our consumer tissue business is Scott 1000 by definition has 1,000 sheets. And so that's about, let's say, between 4x and 6x more than any other brands. And so that tends to skew kind of the measures a little bit makes us look a little bit underpriced when you do it on an EQ basis. But overall, I think we've taken pricing, we've probably moved faster on pricing than other brands. And so I'd say to me, our normal price gaps have begun to normalize. Javier Escalante : Very helpful on the note. The other is, given the setup, right, do you think that there is the possibility of gross margins going forward to be higher than 2019 given the mix, given the -- if you add volume plus mix, year-over-year you are running flat, do you think that, that is possible that going forward, we're going to be operating at gross margins above 2019 levels or that's structural that cannot happen. Michael Hsu : I'll start and then I'll let Nelson correct me. But I would say, it's our job. And so from my chair, I would say we have to do it, right? And so -- and the back story -- and I know you came out last year or so, Javier. But when I came into this role, the 3 things that we set out to do was, one, accelerate organic growth; second, reduce our earnings volatility; and the third thing, importantly, is enhance our margins; and so that was a fundamental goal when I came into this role. The kind of the curveball that came in, in between that was COVID, the demand shock, supply shocks and everything else in the inflation shocks. And so over the last couple of years, we said, hey, we've got an interim goal of, one, we got to restore our margins which I think this quarter kind of marks a pretty significant point for us that hey, we are back pre-COVID or 2019 levels. But still, as we talk internally, it's our job to enhance margins from here. And that's what I'm saying is we have to continue to be disciplined around our commercial programming, our innovation our revenue management and also just a discipline on the cost program and I still see further opportunity for us to expand our margins. But maybe I'll give you -- I'll ask Nelson to kind of give you some more specifics around the near term. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. So Javier, just to build on what Mike said. I mean -- and we've been talking about this since we had our lowest point in gross margin at 29.8% about 5 quarters ago. And our whole point was that we were going to get back to the 35% which is a milestone and not an end state. And really, what's happened is we've made -- and we've been making and you can see significant investments behind building capabilities in the organization. So we've been building a lot of muscle around revenue growth management and this includes price-back architecture and the ability to have also the right packs and sizes and formats for the different customers that we deal with across the globe. Secondly is around productivity. We've made sure that we strengthen and buttress our overall gross margin productivity pipeline and that remains strong today. And then you can see how we've been delivering that over time and we intend to deliver ongoing productivity, gross productivity as an element to drive that. And then, the other bid is around our innovation. We've increased our focus around innovation; last year, drove 60% of our revenue growth and it's accretive innovation. And if you combine these 3, that's really the way we're staring at expanding margins over time, gross margins. And that's truly what's going to drive balanced and sustainable growth for years to come for us. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : So two questions. The first one, just Nelson, maybe you could expand a bit on the other manufacturing cost inflation and the higher call for the year that you've made today? Just maybe a little bit of further detail as to the drivers there and where we are in that cycle as we look forward? Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. So as you indicated, we took our call from $200 million to $250 million through the first 3 quarters of the year were close to $200 million, just a tad below. And what's really driving this is a few things. One, keep in mind that a lot of the service inflation and lease inflation, et cetera and some cost inflation flow through this number. And it's being weighed in by some of the hyperinflationary economies that we deal with. So we're being impacted on that end because we've seen some costs accelerate outside of the U.S., Steve. So that's part of what's driving that $250 million based on where we're at, at this stage. Steve Powers : Okay. And then, Mike, maybe bigger picture, you've been -- you talked about the higher A&P and marketing spending this year. And just in general, there's been a lot of strategic growth initiatives and commercial investments that you've been making. I guess as you think about the aggregate investment that you've made over the last couple of years in that regard, just where do you think you are versus your long-term strategic priorities? And do you see opportunity or need to kind of continue to invest at an accelerated pace as we think about next year, is that -- is it an investment year? Is it a year where you're growing investments more in line with sales? Or are you at a point where you can actually start to leverage and lever from a margin expansion standpoint, some of the investments you've been making over the past couple of years? Michael Hsu : Yes. Thanks, Steve. One, I'm really pleased with the team. We are delivering what we set out to do which is balanced and sustainable growth. As you could see, the organic momentum remains very strong. The margins are coming along as we mentioned, restored them the pre-COVID levels. And so we feel good about that. I would say we've made a lot of progress in the investment. We've made a lot of progress in building improved capability. We've made a lot of progress in improving our innovation capability and the innovation pipeline. And so I think over the last 5 years, we're probably up a couple of hundred basis points in advertising investment. I think from there, we really need to make that investment. At this point, we're approaching 6% overall sales. And so I would say that's competitive in our business. It's perhaps not as much as our primary global competitor but our plan is not to outspend them. And our plan would be to drive great innovation, great commercial programming and have a competitive spend. And so I don't expect -- Steve, I don't think, I'll go and say, \"Hey, we need to continue with increased advertising investment in a straight line infinitely\". Do I think there's some opportunity for us to continue to invest? Yes. But do I think we also have to leverage the investments we've already made better? Yes. Steve Powers : Okay. Yes. No, so I play it back, it sounds like you've -- the catch up that you might have identified 4 or 5 years ago, you feel like you've done and now it's more opportunistic spend where there's a clear ROI but you don't feel a huge need to catch up because you're underspending? Michael Hsu : Yes. Because 5 years ago, we were spending in the 3s and so that was -- I think I felt like too low for a company of the categories that we operate in. I feel competitive at this point. But we also have great opportunities to spend on and ROIs are great. And so especially as we continue to migrate more and more to digital and so there's going to be plenty of things that we're going to want to invest in. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is Shabana [ph] on for Andrea. I just wanted to ask you, can you please add color on your views regarding carryover pricing into 2024 and how to think about the possibly the need to roll back some of this pricing into 2024, especially with the retailers seeing some commodities coming in better? I mean I understand you just elaborated that pulp is lower but resin may potentially go up, especially with oil coming in higher. If you could just like, in aggregate, give us a little bit more picture? Michael Hsu : Yes. Maybe I'll start. I would say most of our pricing went in last year and so we did have some pricing this year. So there will be a little carryover. I wouldn't say it's a huge driver of -- will be a huge driver for the plan next year. Given what we just discussed on the cost environment, you can see costs this year are still up after being up significantly in '21 and '22. And so we're not seeing a ton of deflation. While there might be -- we're starting to see some modest tailwinds that may continue for a few quarters. But I'm not seeing, at least in the near term in, a huge inflation. We have rolled back some pricing because it notably in Professional in Europe, we had energy costs that really shot up and then came back down. And so we have adjusted some pricing in some markets and we'll do that where it makes sense. But in general, I think we've priced appropriately for the cost environment that we anticipate and that environment is playing out thus far as we expected. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Chief Executive Officer, Mike Hsu, for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Michael Hsu : Okay. Well, as I said, proud of the team that we're successfully developing -- delivering balanced and sustainable growth. Thank you for your interest in Kimberly-Clark and we will see you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Chris Jakubik : Hello. This is Chris Jakubik, Head of Investor Relations at Kimberly-Clark, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2023 Business Update. During our review, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. We will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during these remarks. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at investor.kimberly-clark.com. Today, our Chairman and CEO, Mike Hsu, will provide an update on our overall business performance, and Nelson Urdaneta, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide an overall financial review and our outlook for the coming year. We have also scheduled a separate live question-and-answer session with analysts. You can access our earnings release, supplemental materials and audio of our Q&A session at investor.kimberly-clark.com. A replay of the Q&A session will be available following the event through the same website. With that, I will turn it over to Mike. Mike Hsu : Great. Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results reflect a solid finish to a 2023 that was punctuated by better organic growth and a stronger recovery of costs, margins, and earnings than we anticipated at the start of the year. Our results reflect the hard work and commitment of our people to excite and delight our consumers and customers, while navigating macro-economic challenges that have persisted across our industry. Looking back at the past year, and in fact, the five years since I stepped into the role as CEO, I am incredibly proud of our team. We've made significant enhancements to our business and how we're serving our customers and our consumers. At the same time, we successfully addressed an unprecedented inflationary cycle, continuous supply chain disruptions and the need to offset new, higher cost levels. Importantly, we built advantages in key commercial areas that will benefit us for the long term. Through it all, we've learned some valuable lessons that have made us stronger. Our strong performance this year and our solid finish gives us confidence that this phase of cost recovery and supply chain stabilization is largely behind us. This is a pivotal moment for Kimberly-Clark. We're positioned to build on the consumer centricity we've established over the past several years and take another leap forward into our next chapter of growth. We do this from a much stronger financial position. From our cost structure to our cash flow to our balance sheet, we're in a better position to accelerate and enhance the performance of our business. Our growth strategies are working, and our financial performance has improved as we've strengthened our foundation. But I believe we can do even better. We're continuing to sharpen our strategic focus and I'm confident in and excited about the future of Kimberly-Clark. We look forward to hosting an Investor Day in March to share more about the strategic priorities and key initiatives that will drive this step-change in the future. We began 2023 with two main objectives : playing to win by continuing to elevate our categories and expand our markets; and driving profitable growth focused on margin recovery in a quality way, boosting our brand investments while remaining disciplined on costs. Versus our initial expectations last January, we over-delivered on both fronts. In terms of organic growth, the quality of our top-line momentum has continued to improve with a healthier balance across price, volume, and mix. I would like to highlight three key points about our organic growth since 2019. First, in 2023, we built further on the sales gains achieved in the 2020 to 2022 pandemic period. Second, the contribution from pricing to help offset unprecedented inflation is receding and our brands remain healthy and well-positioned to grow. Third, underlying growth, volume plus mix is now turning positive. Volumes have continued to improve and were flat in Q4. We've been driving consistent, positive mix the past four years, reflecting our strategy to elevate our categories. This has shown most prominently in our Personal Care business, where we strategically focused the majority of our organic investments. A key driver has been our focus on launching category-defining innovation. It's our heritage, and a focal point of our strategy to elevate our categories and expand our markets. Our approach to innovation has evolved to be more consumer-centric, driving consumer-preferred solutions, guided by consumer insights and behaviors to create and scale end-to-end advantages. We've focused on propositions that can deliver the trifecta of consumer desirability, technology advantage and margin expansion. In 2023, we prioritized innovation in two of the biggest consumer demand spaces in Personal Care, Skin Health & Wellness and Leak-Free Comfort. In Skin Health & Wellness, we leveraged advantaged technology for superior performance in products such as our Huggies Dual Zone for skin health, Huggies Newborn Zinc Enriched and Kotex Liners with a pH indicator. The team did an incredible job of scaling the Kotex launch globally within its first full year. In Leak-Free Comfort, we applied advantaged product designs to improve performance in Feminine Care with Kotex Overnight, a platform being rolled out globally. In Youth Pants where GoodNites XL drove growth into its second full year of launch, and in Diapers with a new marketing push behind our superior-performing Huggies Blowout Blocker in all of our newborn lines. These innovations were successful because of the consumer-preferred solutions they deliver as well as the strategic investments we made to improve our commercial execution over the past few years. Our commercial execution is much stronger and more integrated than at any point in the company's history. We've enhanced and scaled our innovation and product technologies. We've pivoted toward a digital-first brand paradigm, focused on building ongoing relationships with our consumers. We're enabling superior in-market execution by leveraging world-class process and tools. And we've enhanced net revenue realization through a disciplined analytical approach, helping us to systematically optimize trade decisions in real time. As a result, new product launches in the past three years represented 54% of 2023 net sales in our Consumer businesses and contributed more than 70% of our incremental organic growth in 2023. In Personal Care, we have more than doubled the rate innovation was delivering for us as recently as 2021. In addition, more than 75% of our top 25 projects are now being scaled globally. This level of innovation has helped mitigate the volume and mix impact, and in many cases helped facilitate, the revenue realization we've driven over the past two years. We're moving faster and with greater confidence because we now have leading-edge commercial tools to take more informed actions and capitalize on our innovative products. A testament to our improvement in commercial execution is the fact that for the second year in a row we've topped The Advantage Survey as the best CPG manufacturer in North America. Together, these factors have been key contributors to what has been a price/mix and productivity-driven gross margin recovery through the end of 2023. Over the past five quarters, accretive innovation, improved commercial execution and a strong ongoing stream of cost savings enabled our rapid recovery in gross margins. This is critical because our gross margins and more specifically gross profit dollars serve as our fuel for growth and investments in the future. In the second half of 2023, we recovered 2019 levels faster than originally anticipated and can now pivot our focus from cost recovery to accelerating growth and building longer-term competitive advantages. Importantly, we view our gross margin recovery to-date as a milestone, not an endpoint, and believe there remains ample opportunity for us to expand margins from here. We've made great progress, but we have a lot of opportunity yet to be realized. There's no question that pressures on our consumers and inflationary economies in some of our developing markets will remain challenging in the near term. We will continue our relentless focus on market share and our need to improve upon recent trends. The foundation we've established over the past several years has positioned us to take another leap forward into our next chapter of growth. Elevating our categories and expanding our markets is working and can be accelerated. We're in a better position to fully leverage the investments we've made. We know where we can improve even more in terms of volume, mix and efficiency to drive margins further. And we are in a much stronger financial position to undertake a step-change in the business. Which is a good place to hand off to Nelson to cover our financial results and initial outlook for 2024. Nelson Urdaneta : Thank you, Mike. The stronger financial position we now enjoy truly resides in the exceptional execution, discipline, and portfolio optimization our team has displayed these past two years. As we look back at 2023, we have many reasons to believe in our potential and our ability to drive that momentum across the enterprise. Fourth quarter organic growth was 3%, reflecting further, gradual progress in getting towards a healthier balance across price, mix and volume, with volumes flat as we begin to lap the strong pricing actions taken over the past several quarters. In fact, pricing in the second half of 2023 was predominantly driven by price increases in inflationary, developing markets, a profile we expect will continue in 2024. Gross margin increased 210 basis points to 34.9%, reflecting improved revenue realization, mix, and cost savings that more than offset other manufacturing costs and currency headwinds. Looking forward, our cost basket in the near term is likely to remain mixed, with favorability in some raw materials, contrasting with higher distribution and labor costs as well as currency headwinds. Below gross profit, adjusted operating income margin was down 80 basis points and adjusted earnings per share was $0.03 below Q4 last year. Currency headwinds, both in the form of translation as well as a negative impact from monetary losses in hyperinflationary economies, were in fact a significant factor that held back operating profit growth, operating margin and EPS in the fourth quarter. The negative impact from monetary losses in hyperinflationary economies, captured in the other income and expense line, was approximately $70 million in Q4, representing more than 100 basis points of negative impact to operating margins. At adjusted EPS, this impact was partially offset by higher interest income, resulting in a roughly $0.09 per share negative impact in the quarter. These impacts were largely driven by a significant devaluation since we last updated our guidance in late October. For the full year, we built further on the strong organic sales gains in 2022 as pricing faded, as expected, and volume plus mix gradually turned positive, adjusted gross margin for the year improved 370 basis points to 34.5%, reflecting our hard-fought return to pre-pandemic gross margin levels in the second half of the year, while adjusted operating margin grew 150 basis points and adjusted earnings per share were up 17%, mainly for the same reasons. There were two other factors driving our full year results worth highlighting. First, at operating profit and EPS, note that the full year negative impact from monetary losses in hyperinflationary economies was about $115 million, representing a roughly 50 basis point negative impact to adjusted operating margin. At EPS, we saw a roughly $0.16 impact net of interest income from our monetary positions in those hyperinflationary economies. Second, and more important, is our investments in our brands, our people, and our capabilities, investments we've continued to make despite the ups and downs in our gross margin. Our 2023 marketing, research and general expense levels, specifically, reflect advertising spending of more than 5% of net sales, up almost $200 million from last year, the successful deployment of revenue growth management capabilities. It also reflects the upgrading of our commercial talent, and technology investments that include a new system to increase procurement efficiency across the enterprise, as well as higher incentive compensation. While this has held back our operating profit margins versus 2019 levels, as we've highlighted today, those investments have been critical in recovering our baseline earnings power and driving organic growth. And as we make further progress towards a volume and mix driven organic growth profile, we're confident that we will begin to see the type of margin leverage we expect from these investments. Before I get to our 2024 outlook, I'll provide some highlights on each of our segments. In Personal Care, the momentum we saw in the second half and the quality of fourth quarter results is both encouraging and something we expect to build upon. Organic sales growth reflected a shift to a more balanced contribution from volume, mix and price in the second half, with volumes positive for the second consecutive quarter. North America Personal Care grew 5% in Q4, driven entirely by volume and mix. Outside of North America, China grew volumes in the high-single digits for the full year, while other markets saw improving volume and mix trends as the year progressed, relative to strong, but necessary, year-on-year price increases throughout the year. At a category level, it's worth noting continued momentum in Feminine Care from share gains leading to double-digit organic growth for the full year. At the operating margin, Q4 levels reflected both a typical seasonal low in the business as well as an unfavorable swing in one-off, discrete costs versus the prior year. That said, the mid-17% margins in the second half and full year represent a solid base from which we expect to build going forward. In Consumer Tissue, the organic growth trend into Q4 reflected improved volumes sequentially as we begin to lap considerable pricing taken in previous quarters. Full year organic growth was driven by North America and Developed Markets, with North America delivering flat volumes for the full year. And in the UK, momentum of our Andrex brand continued as we recover from supply chain disruptions. Specifically, we saw both sequential and year-over-year share gains in Q4 as well as double-digit consumption growth for the full year. At operating profit, margins for the segment strengthened as the year progressed, reflecting the improving volume trends as well as ongoing productivity initiatives. Finally, our K-C Professional business results reflected the success of our sharpened strategic focus on country category segments that we see as more resilient, as well as investments in innovation to create value-driven propositions and sustainable solutions for our customers. As a result, organic growth has been driven by a strong contribution from necessary pricing that was largely lapped in North America and other Developed Markets in the fourth quarter. Volumes have primarily reflected expected elasticity from pricing, while mix has been a solid contributor throughout because of the choices we've made to emphasize certain segments over others. In Q4, volumes in North America reflected the ongoing rightsizing of the business in terms of both our own focus on profitable volume as well as wholesale inventory levels. We would expect a more subdued volume picture to continue into Q1 for the same reasons, with improved trends as the year progresses. In terms of operating margin for Professional, while Q4 levels reflected typical seasonality versus the rest of the year, full year gross and operating margins in the business improved to levels that enable us to shift our full focus on investing to drive growth going forward. The last area that I want to touch upon, and speaks as much to the strengthening of our financial profile as our P&L, is our cash flow and balance sheet. In 2023, we generated $2.8 billion in free cash flow while investing roughly $770 million in CapEx spending. This reflected both the recovery in our baseline earnings power as well as better working capital discipline that we're beginning to drive throughout the organization. As a result, we've been able to rapidly reduce both net debt and our net leverage to levels consistent with our long-term, single-A credit rating target. Taken together, we now have the strong financial footing to accelerate the type of step-change in the business we know we're capable of. Our confidence in our path forward is also reflected in the dividend increase we announced today. Which brings me to our outlook for 2024. Overall, while significant exogenous headwinds like currency are likely to remain a factor in our reported results, we are cautiously optimistic that both the consumer environment and our own operating momentum will continue to lead to durable, profitable growth. On the top-line, we are expecting low-to-mid single digit organic net sales growth, a range of organic growth that we expect will include approximately 200 basis points from pricing in hyperinflationary economies. At the same time, reported net sales growth is likely to be negatively impacted by roughly 300 basis points from currency translation and another 60 basis points from divestitures. At operating profit, we currently expect high single-digit to low double-digit growth on a constant currency basis. This reflects our expectations for further improvements in revenue realization, business mix and cost savings. It also includes an assumption for costs from monetary losses in hyperinflationary economies, captured within the other income and expenses line, at roughly half the rate we experienced in 2023. Reported operating profit growth is likely to be negatively impacted by approximately 400 basis points from currency translation. We currently expect high single-digit earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis, reflecting both interest expenses and effective tax rate slightly higher versus the prior year. Here again, we expect reported EPS results to be impacted by approximately 400 basis points from currency translation. As far as pacing during the year, we expect 2024 reported net sales to be relatively balanced between the first half and second half of the year, although with a relatively lower rate of organic net sales growth in the first quarter versus the full year as our 2024 programming has a greater impact as the year unfolds. At the same time, we expect operating profit and earnings this year to be more 48% versus 52%, first half versus second half weighted, compared to what turned out to be more of 51 :49 split in 2023. This reflects a combination of the balance of sales, greater currency headwinds in the first half and our expectation for greater productivity gains as the year progresses. With that, I will turn it back to Mike for some closing thoughts. Mike Hsu : Thank you, Nelson. In closing, we are proud of our 2023 results and the solid finish to the year. We enter 2024 having advanced the company's strategic foundation, consumer-centricity and financial position. Moving forward, we will continue invest in differentiating our global brands and strengthening our capabilities. We will further leverage our cost structure and remain financially disciplined. And we'll make sure we are deploying capital in ways that benefit the enterprise and deliver value to our shareholders. On behalf of my leadership team and the more than 40,000 employees who work tirelessly to fulfill our purpose of Better Care for a Better World, thank you for your time and interest in Kimberly-Clark. Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Kimberly-Clark's fourth quarter 2023 earnings question-and-answer session. I will now hand the call over to Chris Jakubik, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Chris Jakubik : Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, Head of Investor Relations at Kimberly-Clark. And welcome to our Q&A session for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. During our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at investor.kimberly-clark.com. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our Chairman and CEO, Mike Hsu, for a few quick opening comments. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Chris. And first of all, I'd like to just welcome Chris to Kimberly-Clark. This is his first earnings call with us, but it's probably a triple-digit number in earnings calls that he has done in his career. So, welcome to K-C, Chris. Hey, I'd like to just start by sharing that we're really proud of our performance in 2023, but, of course, we're not yet satisfied. We've built a strong foundation and positioned Kimberly-Clark for our next chapter of growth. These past few years, we've consistently invested to build a consumer-centric organization while navigating unprecedented challenges. Our strategy to elevate our categories and expand our market is working, and we're on an exciting path and positioned to deliver durable growth and returns for shareholders in our next chapter. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're looking forward to detailing our strategic priorities, our long-term algorithm, and outline the key initiatives behind our plans in March. And so with that, love to open it up for questions. Operator : Certainly. Everyone, at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. I just wanted to touch on the organic sales growth guidance for next year. Low to mid single digit seems pretty robust relative to the 3% this quarter and just starting out the year lower in Q1. Obviously you mentioned the 200 basis points from the hyperinflationary markets next year in the prepared remarks, so that's part of it. Maybe, A, give us a sense of how much those markets contributed in Q4. And then, just as you look at the base business, ex those markets, maybe some commentary on pricing versus volume and what you're expecting? And if you could also just touch on market share performance in Q4. The U.S. track channels are weaker. So, just any update on how you're feeling about your market share performance and plans on that front as you look out to '24 would be helpful. Thanks. Mike Hsu : Okay. Hey, thanks, Dara. Maybe I'll start with -- maybe as you kind of tee up there, the state of the consumer, particularly in Developed Markets, I'd say, our underlying category growth across Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, and Professional remains pretty robust both in absolute terms, and I think if you look across in relative to other broader staples. Our products -- I'll remind you, our daily essentials in -- unlike some categories, substitution of our categories is fairly low. On top of that, we still have a lot of room for penetration and revenue per user gains, and so we're working on that. So, overall, I think the consumer right now still remains despite what, you might argue, is a fairly mixed kind of consumer picture, the consumer remains pretty healthy. We're confident in our ability to elevate our categories and expand the markets further. The consumer picture, I said is somewhat mixed. Employment remains strong. Wage growth is up. But I think it's also probably fair to say, from our side that, the full effects of all the rate hikes and all the economic policy impacts are not fully materialized in the consumers. So that all said, the categories were pretty robust. In North America, just to give you a reference point, North America category value was up six in the fourth quarter and up eight for the year. So that's a pretty solid number. Again, I'll chalk that up to the fact that there's low substitution in our categories. And that makes our categories a lot more resilient than other staples categories that I've worked in the past. We still also, Dara, see pretty good demand for premium products and we're seeing that in a broad array of markets, including in North America. Surprisingly, you might say in a market like Argentina is still, Brazil, China, of course. And so, we're very enthused about our approach with elevating our categories and expanding our markets and we believe that still working and still appropriate, even though we recognize we've got to be able to offer great value at all price tiers. So I'll pause there. I know that I threw a lot at you. So, I know there were multiple parts to your question. I don't know, Dara, if you wanted to go. Nelson, if you want to... Nelson Urdaneta : Yeah, there was a question on the decomposition of our top-line growth for the year and how it relates to Q4, let me address that a little bit, Dara. I think to recap, the fourth quarter was a quarter in which we attained flat volumes and pricing was only 2% of the contribution with mix being 1%. That 2% was largely hyperinflationary economies. And as you think about this year, this is going to be a year in which we see volumes beginning to pick up from Q2 on. And we expect pricing to be in that 200 basis point range, right in-line with what we saw in the last quarter of the year and that pricing is really going to be driven based on what we expect today by hyperinflationary economies. So, the profile is really on the pricing side, very similar to what we saw in Q4. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. And the volume pick up as we go through the year, is that more pricing moderates? Is it that you've seen some early signs and whatever the geographies or product categories? Or that you're seeing some volume recovery? Or is it more just sort of a natural assumption over time as pricing recovers? Thanks. Mike Hsu : We're pretty pleased, Dara. I think we've made very, very solid progress on volume and consumers responded very favorably on our categories. So, I'd say, first of all, our next chapter, which I think we're turning the page and shifting to a volume mix-driven plan, which is returning to that, which -- that was kind of our approach pre-pandemic and so we're going back to that. So, contribution pricing to help offset the record inflation that we've got, it's going to recede and has already started receding. There might be a need to address some particular higher costs in some markets or locations. But that's going to be pretty surgical, and will likely reflect if there's pricing reflect inflation at local levels. But overall, I think we're feeling very good about driving the volume on our business. We have seen our businesses start to improve, including in North America on a share perspective in the fourth quarter, and believe we have the right mix and growth drivers in our plan to drive the business going forward. Dara Mohsenian : Thanks, guys. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Dara. Nelson Urdaneta : Thank you, Dara. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is live. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. Mike Hsu : Hi, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Hi. I wanted to just shift focus maybe a little bit to talk a bit about the cost picture and FORCE savings. Both of those benefit from deflation, and FORCE savings in the fourth quarter were a bit lighter I think than expected or certainly that we'd modeled. So, it's rare to see that. So, if you could just maybe provide some perspective on why that outlook moving forward and maybe how FX plays into that, if at all? Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. So, let me start, Lauren, by saying that this phase of cost recovery and supply chain stabilization, we would think of it as largely behind us. A lot of the disruptions and the super cycle that we saw, our expectation is for that to not happen in the foreseeable future and certainly in 2024 based on what we know today. So, thinking about cost as a whole, first, our aggregate cost basket is easing in inflation, but there is no deflation, because there are several components that I'd like to unpack. We expect the '24 cost environment to be more stable. But we will still remain at higher levels of costs mostly in-line with what we've seen in this super cycle these past three years. As you know, core commodities like pulp, resin, energy in dollar terms are expected to be somewhat favorable following the trends that we saw in the back half of last year. However, if you think of other components of our cost basket like distribution, logistics, and labor inflation, that's actually going to remain a headwind in this year, in '24, and that's pretty much offsetting the tailwinds that we're seeing on the core commodities, which leaves us with currency-related inflation on imported materials, largely impacting our emerging market hyperinflationary markets, which will need to be addressed, and we've been addressing that over the past years and we intend to do that in the course of the year. Just as a perspective, the overall net cost headwind when you include all of the components is projected to be around 100 basis points for the year, which we see as much more manageable than what we've seen in the past. We've got very strong productivity plans and a little need to price outside of local inflation in these hyperinflationary markets. Turning to FORCE and our productivity targets, the outlook we provided shows that we feel very good about our ability to continue generating strong productivity. You saw that we ended last year with FORCE results of around $325 million. And it's important to highlight that over the last 20 years, FORCE has delivered a little north of $6 billion of cumulative identified productivity that has flown to the P&L. More recently, and we've been talking about it even at your conference in September, we're evolving our culture towards an end-to-end integrated cost management perspective, really focused on gross productivity. We're building a proactive multi-year pipeline of initiatives. We see our pipeline of gross productivity out to 36 months pretty strong, and that should flow to the bottom-line, and this is reflected in the outlook we are providing today. I'm excited to talk more about our transition to gross productivity and integrated margin management at our March meeting when we talk about the future a little more. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then, if I could just also follow up a bit on Argentina? So, I guess, a couple parts to this question. Path forward for Argentina? Whether the devaluation of the monetary assets is one-time in nature or do we need to build this in, or how do we think about that in the next kind of quarter or two of the year? And then, also overall, just kind of risk management around FX? Because this time last year there was also kind of a bit -- it wasn't hyperinflation, but a bit of a surprise to the Street in terms of the expected impact from transactional FX. So -- and that's the case again this year. So, path forward in Argentina, the devaluation on monetary assets piece, and then overall risk management on currency and transaction. Mike Hsu : Okay. Hey, Lauren, thanks for the question. Hey, let me start with the overall on the path forward, I will say, hey, we're staying the course, but we're, of course, going to balance potential against the inherent volatility in the business. And so, we're going to remain prudent. I do want to say, I'm really inspired, and we've got people operating in some difficult conditions in Argentina and also other markets. So, as a company, we're really inspired by the impact our employees make in these markets and really proud to shoulder that responsibility of serving our consumers in these difficult conditions. At the same time, I will say we will not just hang around where conditions become untenable. And then, of course, you would double-click and say, what's untenable. I'll let you know when we see it. But certainly, if we can't make product or if we can't convert currency at some point that becomes somewhat untenable. But right now, we're working our way through it in multiple markets like Argentina, like Ukraine. And so, again, that's the high-level answer on path forward is we're staying the course. Nelson Urdaneta : Yeah. And, Lauren, to build on what I told Dara on the pricing and hyperinflationary, so a few things. As we think of last year, the full year impact of the mark-to-market of our net monetary position in other income and expense line... Lauren Lieberman : Sorry, keep going. Nelson Urdaneta : Okay. So, the impact above the operating profit line was $115 million for the year and about $70 million for the quarter. That netted off some of the interest income that we perceive on cash balances in Argentina, led to a net impact of about $0.16 on EPS in the year and about $0.09 of EPS in the quarter. As we fast-forward to this year, we are projecting about half of that impact, both in the other income and expense line, and then on EPS. We will see a little bit of more of that impact in the first half of the year, it's reflected in part of our outlook. But that's what's projected at this stage based on what know. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. Mike Hsu : Hey, Jason. Jason English : Hey, Mike. Couple of questions. I want to bring it back to volume, and specifically I want to double-click on your Professional segment where volume was little bit weaker than we expected this quarter. If I zoom out and just look since 2019, so pre-COVID, volume is down like 23%, 24%. And I know you mentioned rightsizing in prepared remarks today. So, my question is, what's going on there? Where has all the volume gone? And how -- your margin suggest you're not getting meaningful deleverage here. How have you been able to offset the associated deleverage effects of that lost volume? Mike Hsu : As always, Jason, you're right on the issue. So, a good one. But I think if you look at the margin profile of the business, I think the team has done a great job addressing, I would say the volume softness or volume change in the environment. And a couple different things. One, we had to adjust rapidly to this work-from-home demand environment that kind of came on with the advent of COVID as you might recall. And you may recall our washroom business, which is the majority of our business in K-C Professional tends to be higher development in offices. And so, that's really where the volume has gone up. I would say right now, that volume on a category basis is running about 80% to 85% of what it was pre-pandemic. And it's not going to bounce back that quickly, the reality is. And I'm not sure you're in your office at Goldman in New York every day. And so that's the same thing. As we look around our offices, we're not fully back in, right? And so, it's partial at best. So that's, I would say, an ongoing challenge in that business. But I think our team has adjusted to that and treated as a reality. We have rightsized some of the business and some of it was from a cost perspective. The reality is we were doing a lot of volume and co-packing a lot of volume on the external market. And so I'd say, we haven't had to address fixed costs as much as you might have thought of. And so -- and I think that's reflected. So, I think the team has done a good job of recapturing margins from a -- both from a price perspective, mix perspective, and also while growing volumes at the same time behind great innovations like our ICON dispenser, which I believe is really the best dispenser in that side of the business. So, anyway, so I think the team has done a great job and I think you can see that in the margin and definitely have recovered from pre-'19 margins on that business and actually exceeding at this point. Jason English : That's helpful. I appreciate that. And I think another headwind to volume this year, that you were talking about earlier in the year, but not talking about so much of late, were supply constraints. So, can you remind us where they were? How sizable they were? I assume the lack of conversation around them suggests they're alleviated now. But can you confirm that? And I would imagine that cycling those supply constraints should prove to be a tailwind, particularly in the first half of next year. Is that right? And how large of a tailwind? Mike Hsu : One could only hope, Jason. We could only hope that. But actually, I think, first of all, a couple of things. Yeah, we did have some pretty significant supply constraints in our North American Consumer business for the majority of last year, definitely through Q3. And that had to do with some supply conditions with external suppliers, for example, on packaging that made availability difficult across Personal Care. Also some in our Kleenex business, I think we've talked about a key ingredient that we weren't able to get access to, that we developed a secondary source to during the course of the year. So, those were kind of the big factors, I would say. I think we mentioned that on the last quarter call, we didn't make the biggest deal about it. We were working through this challenge with our suppliers, with our customers, and they were fully aware of it. But it's not something that we communicated publicly that often. But I would say for the better part of the year, that did suppress our share performance. I'm not saying that was the only driver, but I think it was a fairly significant driver. We have addressed those issues. I'd say our commercial execution is going to be stronger than ever. We're really past all these constraints that I talked about. And our consumption is moving in the right direction. Our share has moved in the right direction in the fourth quarter as well in North America. Jason English : Got it. Good stuff. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on and look forward to see you in March. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Jason. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. Your line is live. Anna Lizzul : Hi, good morning, and thank you for the question. I wanted to follow up on market share in light of your exposure to private label, since in your track channels, private label share has been creeping up in some of your categories. Just wondering, how are you thinking about brand investment with marketing versus promotions in order to maintain and grow market share? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. Yeah, great question, Anna. Core to our business, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, on market share, I'm confident that our market share performance this year is going to improve from last year. Definitely, I was not happy with our performance on share last year. For perspective, on a weighted basis, which we use as an internal metric, we don't talk about as much publicly, but on a weighted basis, we are down globally about 40 bps, okay? So, not falling off a cliff, but not what we want. So, we want to be growing weighted share as well. On a cohort basis, which is the one we usually talk to you all about, we are up or even and just under 40%. And so that's below our goal of 50% or more, of which I'd say we were kind of jumping over that bar back in 2021. So, I think we are where we are today, what we're going to build from here. I'd say a couple of things. All that said, probably the biggest challenge has been for us in North America related to the supply constraints that I just talked about. I did want to note. We've had strong gains and really, really strong market positions in most of our largest markets. Just for reference, in South Korea, which is our second largest business, we're up probably about 20 share points over the last five years. And in Australia and New Zealand, we're up somewhere between 10 and 15 share points over the last five years. Andrex, in the quarter, which is our number fifth largest business, was up over 300 bps on share just in the quarter. So, we feel very good -- and one more on China. I think we're approaching almost 300 bps again on the Huggies in the quarter. So, I think we feel very good about our gains in our largest markets. The exception has been North America, where we have underperformed, but that is improving. A lot of that, I think, was just what I discussed with Jason. We had some severe supply constraints where we weren't able to run our brand plans in the way that we wanted to run last year. We saw solid improvement in Q4. We were up or even in six of eight categories and sequentially improved in five of eight. And so, we feel pretty good about our trajectory. As I said just a while ago, our commercial execution capability has never been better, and we're going to gain share by bringing the right innovations, which our customers are excited about, executing well, and bringing sustainable cost advantage to our business. You mentioned private label. On the note, I would recognize that, yeah, we have seen an uptick in private label in the past quarter or two. I think, if you look at the scanner data, I think it was up or even in seven of eight categories. I'd say, on private label, we are very, very committed to having a superior value proposition in every price tier that we're in. So, versus 2019, if you look on a longer perspective, private label is down a bit and the premium segment is up significantly. And even today, the premium segment continues to grow. So, it is clear that the value tier has picked up a bit, and our shares were impacted in the second and third quarter, although I would say, more from our supply constraints than private label trading. I mean, we compete with private label. We're cognizant of that. Our approach, Anna, is to bring the right set of innovations, which we are accelerating and have been accelerating, and our customers are very supportive of it. There are a couple of categories where we have a little more value offering. Scott 1000 is a great value brand, but I think it competes very, very well in its tier and is really, really accepted by consumers. And so, again, we're cognizant that private label is kind of out there, and that in uncertain or tough economic conditions, value becomes much more important to the consumer. And we're committed to having a great value proposition at every tier. Anna Lizzul : Great. Very helpful. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Anna. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Steve Powers : Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. Mike Hsu : Hi, Steve. Steve Powers : Hey. So, maybe to start, you talked about a lower rate of organic growth in the first quarter and also a slightly back-half weighted earnings profile for the year in the prepared remarks, and some of the comments this morning echo that. I guess maybe could you provide just a little bit more color on the drivers there and maybe a little bit more specificity on how to think about first quarter trends relative to the balance of the year? Thanks. Nelson Urdaneta : Sure, Steve. So, I'll start by reiterating that we're very encouraged by how we finished 2023, a strong foundation for us to build from and a position in which volumes have stabilized. And we had a quarter in which we're flattened volume and mix was another 100 basis points of growth. As we think about the cadence of the year, our first half, second half, balance of sales and earnings, and our quarterly pacing is reflecting a combination of three things. One, our go-to-market plans; two, our productivity initiatives; and thirdly, the current shape of currency headwinds that I talked about a little while ago. On organic sales growth, we see a relatively balanced across the year, but Q1 somewhat muted due to softer volumes on a sequential basis. We have more programming coming into play as the year progresses, especially as Q2 kicks in. And this includes incremental innovation that will be going into market at that stage. So, we should see progressively improvement in volumes and a mix-led organic growth and margins following Q1. The other bit that, again, as we think about Q1 in terms of volumes, we've built into the plan a gradual improvement across the year. And in Q1 specifically, we're expecting another relatively flat volume quarter, also because of the possibility that retail inventory softness pushes us slightly even below that level. But that's reflected in our outlook for the full year, and we expect again, volumes to pick up as the year progresses. Steve Powers : Okay. Thank you for that. I guess kind of just stepping back a little bit, there's been a lot of investment that you've highlighted over the course of time in Personal Care, not just the past year, but the past few years, product quality, marketing, commercialization, et cetera. And I think you see the results in relatively strong market share trends and organic growth. I guess on the other side, Consumer Tissue and KCP continue to lag and struggle from a volume perspective. So, I guess, as you think about '24 and both the relative balance of investment and the relative balance of contribution to growth, can you give us a little insight into how you're thinking about that, and how we should think about how those businesses are likely to trend relative to one another in the year? Mike Hsu : Yeah. I'll just -- I'll make a couple of comments and then Nelson maybe can give some additional detail. But look, see, I would say we are running our Consumer Tissue business, some might say externally, a little differently. I look at our Consumer Tissue business and see it as a premier consumer franchise and I'm proud of the strong margin recovery that we've made over a short period of time in this business. To note, I would say, on a volume basis, if you look at North America for the quarter, our organic and tissue was up 3% and the volume was up 2%. I'm very excited about the volume kind of resiliency in that business. I think it reflects the essential nature of the category. As you know, you're not moving away from the bath category, no matter what the condition is. And so, we recognize we have an important kind of responsibility for consumers. But I think the thing that changed in the past few years, first of all, the amount of inflation that's occurred on our overall business, but especially tissue, has been, not to be dramatic, but fundamentally historic, right? Two years in a row of 2x what the all-time high ever was, right? And so, our teams have done a phenomenal job, I would say, recovering the margins on the business that were necessary to keep that franchise healthy going forward. A couple other things that we've done to improve our ability to manage the business better is, better risk management tools to get us more stability from costs. And hopefully, you guys are seeing that. We're not talking a lot about that, but with Nelson coming in, we've changed some of our practices. With Tamera, our Chief Supply Officer, coming in, we've changed some of our supply chain practices. And so we're trying to reduce the volatility of the input costs. I would say if you looked at the margin recovery, the biggest driver is really, really disciplined application of, we call internally, revenue growth management tools. But if we had not made those investments over the past five years, we would not have been able to move at the pace we moved over the last two years on revenue management. And then, probably the most important thing going forward is the fact that we're driving value-added innovation. And we recognize as a consumer franchise, we have to have a great offering, a superior offering. I mentioned in the UK Andrex, I think we hit about a 33 or 34 share in the quarter. Our price gap has widened over the past three years, but our quality has improved significantly. And we've invested in new technologies in our European tissue business that's allowing us to differentiate that product. And so, we feel good about our position on tissue. There are some pockets of challenge, some markets can be very tough and we're able to operate in those. But we're really pleased with the kind of rapid recovery of margins and how our teams are managing that business right now. Nelson Urdaneta : And just to build on what Mike was saying and address the investments, over the last few years, as you would have seen, we've stepped it up both on advertising support for our brands and the capabilities that are allowing us to emerge much stronger from this super cycle of inflation that we've seen. Specifically, for 2023, our advertising budget overall increased to more than 5% in net sales, which represented roughly about 100 basis points of increase versus the prior year. And that's about $200 million in absolute terms. As you think about this year, Steve, we will still keep expanding that, but it'll be at about half the pace of what we saw in 2023. And the other bit is in terms of overheads, which would include some of the capabilities we invested in, we are projecting overheads for the year to be largely flat in dollar terms year-over-year. So that can give you a perspective of what we're seeing in terms of investments and overall spend in 2024, building on what we did in the past few years. Steve Powers : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, and I'll pass it on. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks. Chris Jakubik : If we could take maybe one more question, that'd be great. Operator : Certainly. Your next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. And welcome, Chris. So, can you -- I have one question and a clarification on your comments, Nelson, towards the end of the last question. First, can you break down a bit the 2024 guide by division? I'm assuming you're still looking at like between to get to your number, mid-single digits for Personal Care, some growth in volume there, because that's where you get most of the growth, and then, Tissue to be flattish -- Consumer Tissue to be flattish or to grow low single, and then Professionals to be negative, especially in the first quarter as you lap those contracts. The reason why I ask is that historically, for a good reason, it's a better ROI, but you're more dependent on Personal Care than the others. And you've been, to your point and to your benefit, getting market share, in particular in U.S. and China in diapers and Fem Care. So, I was wondering how you feel about the comps and how you feel about being able to meet this number in between low-single and mid-single. I mean, at least at the high end of the guide, it does imply that you have a strong volume growth in Personal Care. So, I was wondering how you feel and how you could decompose by division. And then, a clarification on the reinvestment. You said -- Nelson, you mentioned $200 million was the actual number, roughly, of the investment, and then this year would be about half of it. And I was wondering, what is the incrementality? It's more displays and shelf space, promo? What is going to be the main source? Because to be fair, you've been, to your point, investing for a while now since Mike took over five years ago? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Hey, Andrea, great set of questions. Maybe I'll start with the bottom half first, and then Nelson could kind of decomp some of the organic drivers. On the investment, again, my priority would be focused on advertising. I think we get great returns on advertising, both from -- certainly from traditional TV and stuff, but more importantly, the digital, and the returns are very, very high. And so, our focus is there. I mean, we are going to be, I would say, competitive on the promotion front -- on a trade promotion front, but that said, that's not how we're going to drive our business. We do feel like we get great value and we have great creative both on things like Huggies, on U by Kotex, across our business, on Scott 1000 lasts long, and so we got great copy and we're going to invest there. Nelson Urdaneta : Yeah. So, in terms of kind of the breakdown by segment, I mean, we expect Personal Care to be growing in the mid to high single digits. So think of mid-single digits overall at the high end. And in the other two segments, we will be growing in the low-single digits. And that kind of gets you to the algorithm that we've provided. As I stated at the beginning, our plan is a vol mix, largely lead plan. And keep in mind that pricing will be around 200 basis points of that. And that's largely related to currency-related movements in hyperinflationary economies. So that's kind of the breakdown on how you should be thinking of our segment growth next year. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I'll now hand the conference back to Chris Jakubik for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Chris Jakubik : Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. For the analysts that have follow-up questions, we'll be around all day. And beyond that, we're looking-forward to seeing everybody in March. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Chris Jakubik. Sir, the floor is yours. Chris Jakubik : Thank you and hello everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, Head of Investor Relations at Kimberly-Clark, and welcome to our Q&A session for our first quarter of 2024 business update. During our remarks today we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at investor.kimberly-clark.com. Before we begin, I am going to hand it to our Chairman and CEO, Mike Hsu, for a few quick opening comments. Mike Hsu : Okay, thank you Chris. Hey, before we get into the Q&A I would like to start by saying thank you to all my colleagues at Kimberly-Clark who worked really diligently over the past few years to build our strong foundation and to deliver these Q1 results that provide a very good start to our next chapter of growth. Our strategy to elevate our categories with breakthrough innovation and expand our markets is working. We are effectively navigating the ever changing external dynamics of today\u2019s new normal while driving our consumer centric culture. We are making the company better, stronger, and faster. I am very, very proud of our progress to date and I am confident that we are going to continue to leverage our core strengths to achieve our potential. We are on an exciting path and are well positioned to deliver durable growth and sustainable shareholder returns. So with that I would like to open it up for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Mike Hsu : Good morning Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Hi, good morning. Hope you are all well. First, I have a quick question on your guidance. You reported a better than expected Q1 so curious to hear why you didn\u2019t pass through the full Q1 beat? And then also hoping for a little more color on the better than expected volume growth you saw in the quarter, what were the key drivers behind this, and ultimately how sustainable is this moving forward and curious, was there any pull forward for instance or should we expect to see continued volume improvements as the year progresses? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yeah, Bonnie, maybe I'll start and Nelson will talk about why we decided to pass through and our logic for that. But really, I'm encouraged with our good start. I think our organization is running very, very well in what we would call internally our new normal. And I think this is like the first year in a few that we've had kind of a stable business despite a lot of the geopolitical things that are going on. So the underlying strength in the quarter was predicated on a couple of good fundamental factors. One, better volume, which you observed, and there was no pull forward. In fact, it was the opposite. We had an inventory, retail inventory reduction in the quarter, but kind of, I think the volume, the inherent strength and the consumption kind of overshot -- overcompensated for that. And so I think that was probably when also the market shares are moving kind of in the right direction. So I think we feel very good about the underlying volume momentum in the business. And then on top of that, then with a stable input cost environment, the productivity that was strong in the quarter tends to drop a little bit stronger through the bottom line. And so that's the underlying kind of driver of our strong Q1. And we feel really great about it. The team's done a great job operating. There's still a couple wars going on in the world, as you're well aware. Argentina's been very volatile and our teams are doing a great job there. So, we feel like we're really running well in a new normal environment. Nelson? Nelson Urdaneta : Yeah, and just to add a few details on what happened in Q1, Bonnie. So first, obviously very pleased with the start of the year, and Q1 was particularly strong as we saw significant benefit in China from our Chinese New Year execution. And particularly in March, I mean, the trends in the business continued. China grew volumes double-digits in the quarter. And in North America in particular, as Mike said, while the trade de-stock happened as we had projected back in January, and just for perspective total company, that was around 80 basis points of growth, that still -- we came in March and had a much better consumption in the month in March, which flowed through in the quarter. So that was the other bit on volume as we thought about what happened and reconciled the numbers for the quarter. Having said that as we look at what\u2019s been happening in the balance of the year, couple of things. One, as Mike said, we're cautiously optimistic. A few things that we're all aware of is we still have geopolitical challenges underway, and we have begun to see some of our commodities begin to uptick. Just for perspective, in the first quarter, we've seen how pulp and the fiber complex has increased in the single digits in the first quarter sequentially versus Q4. For perspective, in the full year we now expect commodities to be -- the net input cost, the total basket to be around $250 million inflationary. So we are taking that into account. That's within the range that we have provided back in January, but it's still something that we're watching. A couple of other things to keep in mind is that as we head into the back half of the year, we expect to see about an $0.08 headwind from the Personal Protective Equipment divestiture in profit that's built into our outlook, but that is something that is new news versus the outlook we provided back in January. And the other bit to keep in mind is, we will further step up investments as the year progresses. On a year-over-year basis, our advertising spend increased 50 basis points. That was largely in line with what we had in Q4. And what we said at the beginning of the year is that as our innovation pipeline builds up, and that's starting in Q2, we will further step up investments as the year progresses, and we expect it to be around another 50 basis points for the balance of the year. Bonnie Herzog : Alright, thank you. Mike Hsu : Good, thanks, Bonnie. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your next questions come from Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. Your line is live. Anna Lizzul : Hi, good morning, and thank you for the question. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Anna. Anna Lizzul : I was wondering if you can comment on market share. A competitor mentioned a misstep on their part with a lack of innovation at the lower end of the pricing ladder in toilet paper, which caused some pressure there. So I was wondering if that helped you to pick up share and if you can comment on how you're progressing in terms of market share also on a weighted category basis, that would be helpful? And then as a follow-up, volumes were clearly better than expected despite some retail inventory reductions in the quarter that you had anticipated for Q1, so I was just wondering to what extent this ended up impacting the quarter and how should we be thinking about it for the full year? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. Yes. Anna, thanks for the question. Great question. Market share I'm very encouraged. I think we've made very, very solid progress on overall market share. I expect further improvement in the year as the year progresses. Overall, in the quarter, we were up and even in just under 60% of our market category combinations. Although I would say also flat on a weighted basis, and we look at share in two ways on both metrics. Importantly, I'd say North America improving. North America was up or even in 6 of 8 categories. We were soft in 2023, as you may recall, a lot of that was predicated on severe supply constraints that we had last year. And so I think this was like maybe the second quarter that we've had in a row of unconstrained supply. And I think that kind of performance reflects our ability to ship product and kind of restore promotion. Just for reference, Kleenex in the quarter was up 400 basis points on share -- or more than 400 basis points on share. What drove it, well, we did have new social media campaign around cold, flu, and allergy season which I think has been very, very good. But the other part is we restored merchandising which we had been off from for several months. And so again, I think our merchandising, we still plan -- we're probably still under-indexed versus the overall category. But we're just kind of returning to kind of normalized merchandising behavior. So we feel good about our performance overall. And again, market share in other markets like in China, we were up a couple -- a couple of hundred basis points on how these diapers had a very, very strong Chinese New Year execution. So volumes were up double-digit against the category that was still down about 10% in China. So I think overall, we're feeling very optimistic about the performance of the business and feel good about the volume delivery of the business. Nelson Urdaneta : And just to build on Mike's point and to your question on what to expect on volumes for the balance of the year. But as we said in January, I mean, 2024 should mainly reflect the pacing of our innovation pipeline and in-market programming. We still have the innovation and a lot of the programming coming into place as we go into Q2 and the second half of the year. Hence, why, from an overall perspective and volume plans, we don't see any changes versus what we had planned back in January and we're taking into account the volume over delivery that we had in Q1. Anna Lizzul : Thank you, very helpful. Mike Hsu : Okay, thanks Anna. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is live. Mike Hsu : Hi Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Hey, good morning. Hey, guys. So first thing I wanted to ask about was the productivity in the release. In the prepared remarks you called out $120 million realized this quarter. And I was just curious how to think about that in the context of the $3 billion in productivity and also $200 million of SG&A savings that you articulated at the Investor Day? So that's just my first question. Mike Hsu : Nelson will comment. I will say a good start and we're tracking well. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. And then just to give a little bit of color on the $3 billion and the $200 million, Lauren. So overall, first, it's based on the integrated margin management process that we unveiled in our Investor Day at the end of March. This has really given us a new enterprise-wide visibility, discipline, accountability, end-to-end across the whole value chain. And really, it's about a focus on driving lower costs at a total deliver cost, which is a very different approach as what we had in the past, and we've been working on it for the last year or so. As you said, and we had a strong start to the year on gross productivity, I'll reiterate, this is non-procurement-related savings, and this is the $120 million that we talked about in the release and in our prepared remarks. And we also had additional savings that were delivered from the procurement side of the house, and that's embedded in our net input costs, which again were and net not that much of a headwind in the first quarter because of all these efforts. As we think about the cadence and what we expect to have on the $3 billion, we're off to a good start on that number. And we would expect that to be roughly about linear over the next few years as we deliver the whole $3 billion. In terms of the $200 million of SG&A savings, as a reminder, we will go live with our new operating model on October 1st of this year. So we don't expect much of that $200 million in savings in SG&A to materialize this year. That will really come into play more in 2025 and 2026. But again, really a good start to the year in productivity and procurement-related savings. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, that's awesome. So just as a follow-up, on the SG&A side of things, what was interesting to see this quarter is that you saw pretty good operating leverage there because in the prepared remarks also, you've called out a 50 basis point increase in advertising as a percentage of sales this quarter, which implies some pretty -- again, like I said, solid operating leverage on SG&A. And that's different than what we've seen, I guess, the last couple of years, frankly. So where do you stand, let's call it, on sort of reinvestments because one of the things that struck me and some of my follow-up conversations with people at the Investor Day was a lot of the things you talked about doing going forward, a lot of questions I got from people were like, well, why haven't they been doing it yet. And my thought was perhaps it's been about investing to get the capabilities to be able to do these things going forward. So is that a reasonable way of thinking about it, is that reinvestment level kind of now, I don't want to call it complete, but like where it needs to be such that we should see operating leverage on SG&A ex-advertising even before you start to get some of those -- that $200 million in savings in that 2025 and 2026? Mike Hsu : Yeah, I mean, one, I'll start, Lauren, and -- but one, we feel great about our investments in advertising and I think we're -- we've made significant progress. I think we're up 200 to 300 basis points since I became -- came into this role. However, I'd say we're probably still underspent relative to our peer set. And so do we need -- and I think I said this in Investor Day, I don't know that we have to match them right. But I would like to continue to increase our investment. I think you're exactly right on kind of, hey, well, there's two factors that kind of caused us to phase our investment. I would say, if you recall, back in 2018, 2019, I did not feel like we had all the capability we needed to spend that significantly. And I think you may recall in some sessions we had or some calls people were asking, why didn't you reset invest harder, at that point, I wasn't confident what the advertising was going to do, right. And so in the last five years, I think we've really built what I would characterize as kind of world-class capability on the commercial front through the help of Alison as you're well aware. And so we've done that. We have made progress. So that was one factor we were building the capability. And right now, our returns on investment on our advertising particularly on digital and we've migrated from not having a whole lot of digital maybe 5 or 10 years ago to almost being entirely digital and those returns are significantly higher than we're driving now. So that's one factor. The other big factor, I think, that people forget is we had two years of a super inflation cycle. We had more than offset -- more than a full year of operating profit in that cycle. And so we are busy doing trying to recover margins as well. And so there's a lot going on in addition to all the geopolitical issues that I think Lauren you are really well aware of. So there's a lot of things going on. And so we're making steps in the right direction. We're not all the way to where we want to be, but we think we can kind of manage the business in the right way to kind of deliver both a healthy top line, healthy bottom line, while continuing to invest in our business for the long term. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is coming from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live. Sunil Modi : Good morning. Just a quick clarification, if you could just provide context on the destocking in terms of where you saw it? And then the actual question is obviously, the feedback broadly speaking, has been the consumer is under pressure though your results today, obviously, you seem to have outperformed a lot of that backdrop or commentary. So just Mike, would love to get your perspective on kind of category health, consumer health, kind of what you guys are seeing, I sense part of the guide and not flowing everything through is because maybe there is some uncertainty, but I'd love your thoughts on that? Mike Hsu : Yes, thanks Nik. Great questions. Yes, we did see a retail inventory reduction in the first quarter as expected, and we were given the heads up on that. And so we planned for it, it was about an 80 basis point headwind to global and about 170 bps of North America sales. And so I'd say the behavior is typical. I don't think it's unusual. We tend to see in that December, January time frame, retailers trying to get a little more efficient with how much inventory they're carrying. We tend to be very, very efficient with retailers, and I think they like our logistics capability. And so we're kind of generally early adopters of all the new systems that retailers go on to kind of try to manage their inventories better. So we're kind of on top of it. It's been baked into our outlook for the full year, but I don't know that I expect a whole lot different going forward, but it's -- what we expected in Q1 did in fact happen. I think I said earlier, our volume was a little bit stronger than we had anticipated. So more than fully offset that. So I think that was the first part. Is that enough -- clear enough on your retail inventory part, Nik? Sunil Modi : Yes, Mike, I just -- what -- any specific categories you can call out, was it Femcare because that's T&G called that out, but I was just trying to get a category perspective on destock? Mike Hsu : No, for us across the board. And just to note, nothing unusual in our mind. So like typical for what we see every year. So I think that's part one. I think your question on the consumer, I guess I would characterize the consumer environment overall for us globally, but especially in North America, is resilient. Still bifurcating, but part of that bifurcating is actually adding to category growth as well. So the category demand overall remains very, very robust. As you could see in North America our categories, on average, overall, were up about 5% or mid-single digit. I think that -- as you well know, we make daily essentials. And so there is low substitution in our categories and so I think that's reflected in the overall category demand. Importantly to note Nick is, premium continues to grow very, very robustly, especially in developed markets like the U.S., like in China, UK, South Korea, but also premium is growing and developing in emerging markets like Brazil. And so we're continuing to see that demand there. That all said, clearly, I would say, middle to lower income households look like they are -- they're becoming more stretched based on all the economic data we're seeing. So I would say the bifurcation is I see a limited trade down in a few categories, notably adult care, some in household towels, but we have a very, very detailed tracker across every category. I think we're tracking like nine different dimensions. And I'd say -- so we're very vigilant about monitoring that. The thing about it is the trade down is limited at this point, but we really intend to be more valuable to our consumers at every rung of the good, better, best ladder. And so what that means is I think Anna was asking about private label or value to our quality. I mean we're making all of our products better across the board. And that certainly, I think the growth driver for us over the long term is by making products better, premiumizing, elevating our categories. But we want to serve the value-oriented consumer as well, too. And we have big brands like Scott, Bath and Kleenex Mainline depend main line that serves those consumers well too. Sunil Modi : Excellent, thanks Mike. Mike Hsu : Okay, thanks Nik. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Mike Hsu : Hey, Chris. Christopher Carey : Hey, good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups. Just on China and the U.S., right. So in China, clearly good numbers but I also think one of your peers delivered quite good numbers as well. And I guess the question in a way is, are we seeing the category turn in China benefits from perhaps Chinese New Year, are you both just gaining relative market share, clearly, it's a strong number, so I'm just trying to understand this like a bit deeper, I guess? And then secondly, on the U.S. it's really the same question on relative outperformance to category. And I know you've mentioned it a bit more, and I'm more interested in the China comment, but if you can just expand there because that stood out to me as well? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes. I'll start on China. Again, if you kind of saw the Investor Day presentation with Katie's leadership, our China team is doing a fantastic job there. And they've grown consistently double digits over the past five years, and it's become our best -- one of our best performing businesses in the company. I would say the -- I think the driver performance -- there's a couple of factors. Certainly, a strong Chinese New Year execution. But overall, we make a great product. I believe it's the best product in the marketplace. I think consumers are excited about the products that we offer. And then we have really, really strong digital executions that really kind of drive that relationship with consumers. And so to answer your question, I think it's more of a share pickup. The category itself based on the data I'm seeing was still down about 10% in the quarter, consistent with the birth rate trends and everything else we're seeing. So it's a share pickup. And I'll point out we're the market leader in China but that's predicated, we're only at a, I would say, a mid to high-teens shift at this point. And so we feel very good about our positions, but it's a fragmented category. And so there's a lot of opportunity for us to drive further share growth in the market. Importantly, I think for us, we're also picking up on our mainstream business. And part of the strategy, when I say, hey, we want to be great at every tier or every run of the good, better, best ladder, we want to accelerate innovation at the top end and then cascade that quickly through our line. And so we're doing that. And I think we're seeing that in the results in China for sure and similarly in the U.S. Christopher Carey : And then if I could just one follow-up would be clearly, pulps are on the move. It's a bit more on the front end of the curve than in the back half of the year 2025, but this is going to be perhaps the first moment to really kind of show the ability to work through this this cycle. Just any thoughts on the moves that you're seeing and the types of actions that you might defer to if these moves prove durable and even accelerate between pricing, productivity, and whether you see any potential kind of margin issues on the horizon or if this feels very much manageable at this point? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Well, I'm going to start with -- Nelson could disagree with me if you want, Nelson. I would say, manageable at this point because here's. I said, hey, new normal. I think this is what I'd characterize as a more normal year for CPG for the first time in the last three or four years for us, which is, hey, a stable input cost environment. It's still not deflationary. At some point, one would hope that it becomes deflationary. But I'd say, hey, it's slightly inflationary, but relatively stable. That's different than the past three or four years for us. And so I think for us, we have very good productivity plans. And so if the cost -- input costs remain stable, we can operate very, very well in a stable cost environment and let that productivity drop through. So that's one part. And then the other part of the normal is, I think with -- there's been a lot of volatility in demand with COVID and everything else over the past few years. I think we're starting to see demand stabilize. And so with those two factors, I think we can operate well. We're very cognizant and Nelson will talk about it, that we're there are some demand signals around different pulp environmental changes, but we're well aware of that, and we think we have that accounted for in our current call. But Nelson. Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. So just to build on what Mike was saying, Chris. So a few things. I'll start with -- we've built significant capabilities over the last five years in order for us to be able to maneuver through the ups and downs. Obviously, if we have a shock like what we saw two to three years ago, that's a different situation that we'd have to maneuver through. But as Mike said, and as we've said back in January, we see the situation as manageable. To reiterate, I mean, when we talked in January, we talked about $200 million to $250 million of net input costs all in. That included currency, other costs, as well as commodities, which we still see deflationary for the full year for us. Now on that range, we're now staring at the high end of that range, which again, we see as manageable, as Mike said. A couple of things to keep in the back of your mind as you look at the numbers, core commodities like bulk resin-based materials, energy in dollar terms, while they're a little bit more unfavorable today versus what we were seeing back in January because we're seeing some upticks still for the full year, they would remain a tailwind. We continue to see distribution, logistics and labor costs as inflationary for the year. And then obviously, for non-U.S. operations, currency will be a headwind in costs because they're buying pulp and many of the inputs that they use to manufacture the products in hard currency. So on a net basis, that's how we get there. The thing to also keep in mind is that we expect the phasing of our input cost inflation to be more muted in the first half of the year. And this follows the trend that we saw in Q3 and Q4 of 2023 that would carry over pretty much through Q2. And we'll see an uptick of this as we go into the back half of the year. But again, it's all factored into our outlook. And the only difference is really we're more at the high end than the range that we had given before. Mike Hsu : Yes, Chris, just to calibrate you. I think, Nelson when we're looking at a couple of hundred million of inflationary impact, just to calibrate you in 2021 and 2022, we took on $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. So I would say that's kind of why we feel like it's -- that's one reason why we feel like it's more manageable. The scale is totally different. And then the other thing is as Nelson points out, we've changed how we manage the business in some ways to try to become a little more predictable. And we have better tools than we had maybe five years ago and so. Nelson Urdaneta : Totally. And just to build on Mike's point on the tools, as a reminder, I mean, we have a very strong pipeline of productivity initiatives. We're looking out three years and I've been chatting about this for the last few quarters. That pipeline remains strong. You would have seen that non-procurement-related productivity was very strong getting out of the year, and the team is very confident in our ability to continue to deliver, not just in this year, but in the following two to three years, which builds on our ability to deliver on the $3 billion commitment of overall gross productivity in the next five years or so. So that's built into how we're looking into cost and inflation for the next few quarters. Christopher Carey : Thank you very much. Very helpful. Mike Hsu : Okay, thanks Chris. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Stephen Powers : Good morning, good morning, thank you. Hey, two questions if I could. The first one builds on the conversation just having with Chris around commodities and managing it through the cycle. I guess I'm curious as to the steps you've taken to better maneuver through input cost cycles and essentially better protect this year. Does that include different ways of sourcing and contracting and hedging but in effect, pushes out the cost curve as we would typically know it for Kimberly-Clark. I guess what I'm thinking about is that in the past, if we saw reinflation like we have year-to-date, we'd be thinking about that kind of flowing through and impacting the latter third, about a quarter of the current fiscal year, kind of a six-month, maybe six to nine month lag. It sounds now like you've got better visibility. I'm wondering how much of that has just pushed out that reinflation into 2025? Mike Hsu : Hey, maybe I'll say a couple of things. One, Steve, is I think the analyst community and the investor committee, I think, made very clear to me when I came into this role that one of the issues they had with KMB is the earnings volatility. And so I've been very cognizant of that fact. And so we've over the past five years, kind of worked significant -- worked pretty hard to kind of reduce some of the underlying volatility in our business. Nelson, with an outside perspective has really worked hard to bring some different kinds of tools into our thinking. And so we've been applying that over the last couple of years and we feel very good about that. Certainly, there is inherent volatility in our business certainly in pulp. One would think at some point with the super cycle of inflation that we have on pulp, it's still elevated and at some point, it needs to come back in our history would say it's going to come back down further. That said, I think we've built the right tools. And Nelson, you may comment about what we're doing there. Nelson Urdaneta : Sure, thing. And just to build, I mean, the integrated margin management approach, Steve, that we've been working on for the last year or so really addresses part of this volatility. It is end-to-end as we chatted on March 27th, and it looks at all the elements that drive total delivery cost as well as margins. And it starts with we've been building muscle around revenue growth management, and that's very important. Price backed architectures, what kind of price backs do we have for the different channels, and how do we tackle that, including promo activity, etcetera, which is very important across all the geographies we work in. Secondly, are the tools that Mike was talking about on how do we handle costs. We don't reveal what are the contract structures that we have in place or the hedging activities, but we obviously have gotten into much more proactive risk management to be able to have visibility into costs and give us time to react. And what do we react with? We react with productivity initiatives and elements of revenue growth management. That's the -- that's a big difference on how we were approaching it five years ago and we've been building that muscle over time, and that then drives into this visibility into the productivity element, which right now we've split it, and we're being very clear of this as the productivity within the four walls. That's the $120 million that we talked about. And then we have productivity and procurement, which is embedded in our net input costs. And that clearly gives accountability across the supply chain on how to drive lower total delivery costs or at least manage through the margins. So yes, I'd say it's muscle we've been building over the last five years, as Mike said. And obviously, we're not going to be immune to move in commodities, but the visibility we have today, the ability to react is different than what we had in the past. Stephen Powers : Yes, okay. That's very helpful. And this answer -- the next question may be short, if you've already addressed it, you can tell me to just go read the transcript afterwards. I joined late. I apologize. But in the\u2026 Mike Hsu : We would never be that rude Steve. Stephen Powers : In the prepared remarks, you mentioned private -- your plans to exit some private label businesses. I know those plans are still kind of under construction, but you did make mention of it with some impacts on 2025. If you could -- if anything further you can say on that today, that would be great. Mike Hsu : Okay. Just to be clear, Steve, that question was not asked. So it's a great question. Just on that, yes, I did want to flag that, we are -- strategically, let me just tell you we're focusing on differentiating our brands with proprietary science-based innovation. That was kind of the big theme that we shared with you all at our Investor Day. Just to give you some context, today, our last year private label production represented about 4% of our global sales. And so what we announced today will likely cut that in half by the end of 2025. The thing I'll say is -- and it takes two parties to make a decision, so I won't get into any specifics, but I would say RM as you think about what we say as science is our competitive advantage, the investments we're making in our new personal care core technology that resides in our diapers and our feminine care pads and our adult care also to get to natural forest free, all that development, that's all going to take some pretty chunky capital. And so we are making significant technology and capacity investments and so we really want to be more choiceful as we go forward about where we spend that capital. And so that's really kind of underlying some of that decision-making. These decisions are going to enable us to focus our tech investment on what we see as our greater strategic priorities. And I might note, our exposure to private label could decrease further over time. Nelson Urdaneta : And just to add further color on what we would expect from a bottom line standpoint, Steve, it should be consistent with what you're seeing in the top line. And then, obviously, we're working through supply chain transition, repurposing, and related cost opportunities within the context of our whole network optimization initiative, which is one of our three strategies in the supply chain strategy that we unveiled at Investor Day. We will have more to say as we go into 2025 guidance period. Stephen Powers : Okay, that is good color. Thank you. Thank you both. Mike Hsu : Thanks. If you could take maybe one more question, that would be great. Operator : Certainly. Your next question is coming from Javier Escalante from Evercore. Your line is live. Mike Hsu : Javier, how are you? Javier Escalante : Hello Mike, good morning everyone. I do have kind of like a quick clarification to Lauren's questions first because it's in the context of guidance versus what is incremental in terms of the restructuring and whether it's sensitive to me from the outside is kind of like coming through earlier. So basically, the $120 million in savings that you flagged, are they part of the $3 billion that you spoke of a month ago or not, and then we can address the other piece, if you don't mind? Nelson Urdaneta : Yes, the short answer, Javier, is yes, it is part. We said that our new chapter started in Q1 of this year, and that's part of the five years commitment to deliver that. The 120 is part of that and then there's an element of procurement savings that we're not disclosing today. We are committed to disclosing the entire savings, including procurement, annually, so that you get a perspective of how we're tracking against the $3 billion that we committed to. Javier Escalante : So congratulations on the very early start because I also see that the October -- the new organization is starting in October, I thought that it would be something of 2025. So is that all true, right, if savings are coming through earlier, why is it that the guidance and this is the other thing that I get from your transcript, prepared remarks is that revenue realization faster. So you have faster revenue realizations from FOREX, you have faster savings coming from and they're sizable, $3 billion coming from the restructuring, so I understand that you want to be conservative, but if we take you literally, the numbers for the balance of the year needs to come down. Is that what you want in terms of consensus to look like, very simple? Mike Hsu : Well, I'll just start. Javier, I'd say, hey, we're still early in the year, and we feel really good about our start. We feel very confident in our performance this year. But that said, there's -- as Nelson pointed out in his remarks and in our prepared remarks, there's still a lot of uncertainty out in the world right now, both in terms of the geopolitical situation and the effects that could have on global demand. But also, as you've heard just on the last few questions on the input cost environment. So I probably would say, yes, we're taking a prudent approach to make on our call. But certainly, encouraged by our start to the year and would love to drive to a very strong result this year. Nelson? Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. And just to build on Mike's point, Javier, I mean a couple of things. We're focused, obviously, on margin trajectory over time. And margins will move quarter-to-quarter. And they have to do with country and category mix, timing of our innovation pipeline, as well as changes in absolute productivity delivery. Productivity delivery is not linear. I mean the timing of when projects come online and how quickly we can realize the benefits, we have an estimate, but again, you got to get them through. We have a full outlook for the year, and that's embedded there, and we're very encouraged by how the whole year started, but we have a lot of activities still coming our way, including a very strong innovation pipeline for which we're going to be putting back money into the business. We're going to be stepping up investments at least 50 basis points for the balance of the year. And if we see opportunities to invest more in the business and more in our transformation to accelerate it, we will. So we're taking all of that into account and also take into consideration the sale of our PPE business, which we've built into the forecast, which is about a headwind of $0.08 for the balance of the second half of the year. Javier Escalante : Well, I will take that as a conservative guidance. Thank you very much, okay. Mike Hsu : Thank you Javier. Nelson Urdaneta : Thanks Javier. Chris Jakubik : Great. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. For those of you who have follow-up questions, Aishwarya and myself will certainly be available for follow-ups. So thanks again, and we look forward to seeing you going forward. Operator : Thank you. Everyone, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day.

I'll now hand the conference over to Chris Jakubik, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Chris Jakubik : Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations at Kimberly-Clark, and welcome to our Q&A session for our second quarter 2024 business update. During our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release in our filings with the SEC. We will also make some non-GAAP financial measures today or discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today. And these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at investor.kimberly-clark.com. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it to our Chairman and CEO, Mike Hsu, to for a few quick opening comments. Mike Hsu : Thank you, Chris. Before we jump into the Q&A, I would like to start by saying thank you to my colleagues at Kimberly-Clark, who are working diligently on the augmentation of our comprehensive innovation like growth strategy and delivered strong results for the first half. We're excited about the opportunity to accelerate investments to build our powerhouse categories and brands and our pipeline of innovation. We are effectively navigating external dynamics, while driving our consumer centric culture. We're making the company better, stronger and faster, and we are turbo charging our ability to provide better care to consumers around the globe. I'm very proud of our progress to date. It bolsters our confidence in delivering our outlook for the year, and our ability to ramp-up our investments to further leverage our core strengths and achieve our potential. We are on an exciting path, and I'm -- and are well-positioned to deliver durable growth and sustainable shareholder returns. So with that, I'd be happy to open it up to questions. Operator : Certainly. Everyone, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is live. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. So first, I wanted to check in and talk a little bit, Mike, about market share trends and -- because the organic sales growth this quarter was really solid. Volumes were up. You had this unexpected headwind from inventory de-stock. But I wanted to also check in a bit on market share trends, where you stand versus not just competition, but also what you're seeing from private label of weight? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. Good morning, Lauren. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah. Overall, I feel good about the progress we're making on market share. And I do expect further improvement as we progress through the year. We were overall globally even on a weighted basis and up or even in about half of our cohorts around the world. And that's progress versus the past couple of years where, if you recall this time last year, I think we were up or even in about 40% of our cohorts. So, I think we've made solid progress, but there still remains plenty of work for us to do. As you may recall, Lauren, North America was a bit soft last year. That is improving. That softness last year was primarily due to supply constraints. The first half in North America on a weighted basis was flat and then up or even in about six of eight categories, and that continued in the second quarter. And I expect further improvement in North America as we cycle some of those constraints last year. We also had pretty solid gains on market share in certain brands across our -- what we're calling focus markets -- or our other big five markets beyond North America. In China, Huggies was up 180 basis points in share, in the UK, Andrex, which is the leading brand, that was up 350 basis points, in South Korea, Huggies has been up over 800 basis points since 2019 and was up over 300 basis points in the quarter. And in Brazil, I think that that we're working to improve the brand proposition. And so we were up about a 100 basis points in Brazil. So we're making progress, but as I pointed out, we\u2019re about flat on a weighted basis and so they're that signals that there's plenty of work for us to do. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. I'm just curious, I know you mentioned a couple of market share, a bunch of market share positions outside of North America and China that have been very strong. But when do we start to see that translate into growth? Because I think one of the interesting parts of this strategy you've laid out in this sort of shifting the focus a bit, so that we can get more visibility into other areas of your business. But when should we start to see growth become more material in a matter more moves the needle more in markets outside of the US and China? Mike Hsu : Yes, I mean, you know, Lauren, I'd say we have a very proven playbook that we're really proud of and we're implementing that more systematically behind this. You know, wiring for growth initiative that we have. We're going to \u2013 we're going to implement those playbooks more systematically around the world. You know, one, we got great technology that the world you all haven't seen yet, which we're rolling out and we're excited about our launch that I mentioned in our in our opening comments in the script on skin essentials in the US. So we've got great a great technology portfolio. We got the right. We've been investing in the past five years to build the right commercial and supply capabilities to accelerate performance. You're going to see a sharper focus on what we're calling our focus markets, right? Those are the US plus the next five markets for us and so that said, I would say, local conditions remain dynamic. And so, there's plenty of opportunity to tighten up our brand propositions on a market specific basis for reference, I'll just tell you. So Huggies, as I mentioned was up in share in China. Kotex was flat. And you know, again, it grew high single-digits in the quarter on Kotex. But we'd love to get more share growing in China on femcare. In Brazil, Huggies was up. Kotex is the leading brand or we call it Intimus in Brazil, the leading brand in Brazil. But, share was a little soft and down about just a little bit less than 100 basis points. So we got some work there. South Korea, I said Huggies was up over 300 basis points, but bath tissue was down a little bit. And so we have work to do around the world. And so part of our strong start it's going to afford us the ability to make surgical investments to get our good, better, best, where we think they need to be in the local markets. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning, guys. Mike Hsu : Hey, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So a pretty sizable margin and EPS beat in Q2, but it does sound like investments are going to increase in the back half of the year. So, Nelson can you just discuss a bit the cadence of margins and EPS in the back half, how we should think about Q3, Q4, margin performance, particularly as the divestiture impact should ramp-up in the back half of the year? Nelson Urdaneta : Sure, Dara. So let me let me start by echoing what Mike said. I mean, we're very proud of our teams have executed in the first half of the year than we've gained momentum on a number of fronts. Relative to our power and great care strategy. As a reminder, I mean, as we think about margins, our main focus is on driving profit dollar growth margins for us, as we've stated, our milestones, and we're moving on that progression. Growth in the first -- in the second quarter on the first half, reflected solid volume mix-driven gains and on the third quarter -- it\u2019s a third quarter in a row that we drive positive volume mix. Importantly, in some of our largest, most profitable geographies like the U.S., China, and the U.K., we saw solid volume mix growth, which is something we've been folks focusing on. And as Mike said, I mean, it is the key for our long-term algorithm. We delivered more than half of our profit objectives for the year in the first half and this actually gives us flexibility for the second half to further invest in strengthening our brands and our innovation pipeline, especially as we manage through some of the challenges in the macro environment and some of the increased and consumer pressure that we're all seeing. As we think of cadence of first half second half on the top line, we would expect the second half to grow at a similar pace of what we saw in the second quarter with again volume and mix key drivers of growth, while pricing will continue to play a lesser role sequentially. At the profits, four things to keep in mind, first one, productivity delivery. It's been solid in the first half and ahead of our original plans, given timing of some of the projects. So, we do expect a lower absolute dollar productive delivering in the second half, but still very strong on the year. Secondly, pricing net of costs, it's been strong and favorable in the first half due to timing of pricing actions relative to costs and you've got to take into account Argentina, which again, a lot of the hits that we took on the currency were in the second half of last year. So, we're going to be lapping that as we head into the second half of it this year. For the balance of the year, we expect pricing at a cost benefits to taper off. However, it's important to reiterate that on a full year basis, we expect to be at least pricing net of cost neutral. The third aspect is timing of investments. In the back half of the year, we expect to step up investments behind our brands, given timing of some of innovation programs that we have. As a reminder, on the first half of the year, our spend on our brands was approximately 6% of sales. Heading into the second half, this number is going to be closer to 7%. As we take advantage of our strong first half and we strengthened the overall our investment profile setting up the time for us to continue growing sustainably in years to come. And then last, but not least, is the divestiture of our personal protective equipment. We expected to be a headwind in terms of profits of around 180 basis points in the second half of the year. We didn't have that in the first half of the year. Two more things that you think of EPS, equity method investment income, while it grew in the first half of the year, some of it had to do not just with the underlying performance of our equity method investments, it also had to do with the strength of the Mexican peso in the first half year on year. That's going to revert in the second half of the year and we expect the net equity investment to be largely flat in the second half of the year. And the other item on EPS is the effective -- the adjusted effective tax rate. For the full year, we're now projecting 23% to 24% adjusted effective tax rate. And for the first half, our adjusted effective tax rate was 22.3%. So, when you combine all those factors, that gives you the cadence of how we're looking at the first half and second half. Dara Mohsenian : Great. That's very detailed and helpful. And if I could slip in one more question. You talked about the price in regards to the second half outlook. Can you give us an update on the North American pricing environment in both personal care and consumer tissue? A, is there ability to drive mix to a greater extent in the back half of the year. How do you think about that? B, the promotional environment? And how we should think about pricing realization from here in North America in a more normalized environment? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Hey, yes, thanks, Dara. Yes. And overall on the pricing environment, particularly in North America, I'd say it remains stable. And as you may recall, since COVID, in the COVID environment, or the pandemic related environment, we did see a reduction in promotional activity in our categories. I'd say, over the past two years, that has kind of return and normalized post pandemic. And I'd say, it's remained at that level. We are seeing a touch of promotion in some categories and in some retailers. But overall, again, our strategy is to remain focused on volume and mix driven growth. And we're maintaining what we're calling PNOC, or pricing net of input cost discipline. And so overall, as you're well aware, pricing to offset cost inflation is receiving for us as expected. We really want to be more valuable at every rung of the good, better, best ladder. I think one of the things that's great about our portfolio is that we do serve all consumers from value to up to premium, even though premium is really the big growth driver for us. And so we're really focused on working to ensure that our value propositions all along the value spectrum are going to remain strong. And so our focus on building brands with advertising, great storytelling, pioneering innovation. But again, we also recognize in some categories, promotion is very important, and we're going to be competitive where we need to be. But again, we're focused on driving the category's growth through advertising. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Dara. Operator : Thank you. And your next question is coming from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live. Nik Modi : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Nik. Nelson Urdaneta : Good morning, Nik. Nik Modi : Good morning. Good morning. So two questions, just one on the organizational design changes that are going to take place in a few months' time. Like I remember, when Procter & Gamble did a similar type of thing, not the exact structure, but they had like a transitionary kind of era or moment between kind of old structure and the new structure. And I'm just curious if that is something that is going on right now within Kimberly, which will make that transition much smoother when we get October, that's the first question. And then I was hoping you can just kind of give us your thoughts, since the analyst day, you've hired two new people, one from Chief Growth Officer that has a consumer healthcare background. And then obviously a new head of R&D that just was announced, just was hoping you can give us some words on kind of how they fit into the new strategy. Mike Hsu : Yes, great. Nik, okay, you're all over it. I think that's a great question. As I mentioned, I think in the prepared script, we made an interim move on effective July 1 that changed some of the reporting in our global supply chain in North America and then Brazil moving into International Personal Care on an interim basis. And so I'd say, your observation around an interim structure, we've done some significant shifts there already. And again, it goes back to you know, I had some experience with another corporate transition where Nelson and Chris and I worked and so having that interim model working before you officially make those moves, helps a lot. And I think the organization is making tons of progress in the new ways of working very, very excited about the progress the teams are making and very appreciative of all the hard work that they're putting in to make this happen. So I again, I feel I feel great thus far about our wider for growth initiative or the organizational change. And we're making strong progress there. With regard to Patricia and Craig, I'm excited to have him onboard Allison Lewis, who is our Chief Growth Officer, and Robert Long, our Chief Innovation Officer, R&D Officer. They did great work for us and really advanced. The agenda has been both those areas very, very strongly, but I knew I intercepted them at a point in their career where they want to go on at some point and do other things. And so I think I think we have an excellent transition period between the four of these leaders on and as Patricia and Craig come aboard, I think they both bring great skills to Kimberly-Clark. Patricia has worked at companies like Kraft and Unilever and Heineken before Bayer. And so and knows a lot about the consumer health space, a really, really focused on marketing and advertising, which is a great thing for us. And then Craig has a real great transformational leader with Unilever and some products further in his background as well as a great run at Campbell's. And so I think they'll bring a lot both in terms of organizational development, but also our expertise in their fields that will advance the things that we're working on with power and care. Nik Modi : Helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Nik. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Javier Escalante from Evercore. Your line is live. Javier Escalante : Hi, good morning, everyone. I would like to see whether I can get more color on the savings, because at least I see three buckets, so basically you're announcing something in North America. My understanding is that the supply chain. So if you can talk about the benefits of what you're trying to do there, you are exiting two small markets. But when you look at the P&L it feels as if, the SG&A is where we get better numbers went to consensus. So if you can expand that and then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Thank you. Maybe I'll just start and I think Nelson will kind of give you more color on the savings. I would say on the small market exits, my overall on that would be we are taking steps to make our categories and all our markets more robust and predictable contributors to growth and return. And we like our positions in most markets. But that said, in places where we don't really feel heavier that we have a long-term right to win, or the market conditions in that market are not conducive to winning. We're going to be disciplined and methodical. And so we made the difficult decision to announce our plan and exits in Nigeria and Bolivia, and recognize the downside. It does in fact, our employees there. But I think there's a wrong -- the right move long-term for Kimberly-Clark. I don't think those will contribute to be a huge source of savings, but I think it does take some risk out of the owned by ongoing performance of the business, but nothing and comment on the other sources, Javier. Nelson Urdaneta : Yeah. In terms of, Javier, the sources of the savings, there are two poles. I mean, first and foremost, and the lion's share of the savings will derive from our supply chain transformation. And as a reminder, they encompass three strategies. The first one is our value stream simplification. And as I've explained and Tamera has explained, this has to do with product specifications and a few other items that will drive significant savings over time. Second one is optimizing our network. And it's the footprint. It's our four walls. And you're seeing some actions that are being taken today. And they'll be taken over the next few years. And then the third bucket is scalable automation, and that encompasses two areas. One is actual automation of supply chain processes in our factories and our warehouses, and the second one is digital automation, where we're deploying tools to optimize our procurement capabilities as well as our supply and demand capabilities. We are on the early stages of our transformation journey, especially in the supply chain, and we're pleased with where we're at in the first half of the year. Productivity delivery is ahead of what we had planned. We are at about $255 million a year-to-date on the supply chain productivity, and that does not include procurement. We will update annually on the procurement savings, but well on track as we seek to deliver the $3 billion over the next five years, as we said. Specifically on actions that have been taken and what's driving this. One, we're seeing conversion and waste reduction. That's a big bucket that's helping us drive, and that, again, is within the value stream. It's product material specification standardization. That's starting to happen, and we've been working to get that going in the last year and a half or so. And then lastly, it's transportation and warehousing cost reductions. So that's in a nutshell what's driving the savings on the supply chain. The other bid is on the overheads. On the overheads, we said that our target is to deliver about $200 million of savings over the next two, three years. The lion's share of those savings is really going to kick in once the full organizational model is in place. And that goes into effect in the latter part of the year. So we will see not a lot of savings this year on the overheads line coming from that item. What you're seeing on the overheads, which I think you're alluding to, is we're seeing absolute dollars largely flat sequentially, is that the discipline that we've had on overall spend is still in place. I mean, we're driving a lot of discipline in terms of spending and costs, and that's flowing through, and you're seeing it in the P&L at this stage. Javier Escalante : That's great color, okay. I do have a question because we got scanner data today and includes Costco, which is an important retailer, and Amazon. And we saw, I mean, what the data shows is volume accelerating at the end of the quarter. I mean, we have around 2%, which is two to three points better than what you reported. So your commentary when it comes to inventory reduction and uncertainty there. So in light that volumes accelerated in the last four weeks ending July 7th. Should we expect kind of like a more consistent retail sales in North America versus where you are when I report going forward? Thank you very much. Mike Hsu : Yeah. Maybe I'll start with that Javier. I think my adage is in the end, shipments must track with consumption. And so I tend to focus more on the consumption numbers. We feel great about the progression we're making on volume and mix. And I think in the quarter, I think if you add volume and mix, it was up about 2 combined. And so that's the progress we're making. I think it's great to cycle. We're very glad to have cycled a lot of pricing moves that we had to take to offset inflation. But you know, we think the underlying momentum in our categories remained solid. These are essentials and daily use categories and so we're encouraged to see that volume progression. There's going to be some noise because of retail inventory changes in North America, you had two effects because there were some -- I would say there were some -- we're comping a soft quarter last year because of supply issues. And so probably a little more inventory going in on personal care. And then we are -- on the tissue side, we saw consumption stronger than organic and so that implies we saw some inventory to come out of tissue. And so I think that's I would say, generally typical and so that stuff is going to move around from quarter-to-quarter, but overall, we're very encouraged with our volume trends. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. Your line is live. Anna Lizzul : Hi, good morning. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi Anna. Anna Lizzul : Morning. Thank you so much for the question. I was wondering if you could just elaborate more on the volume improvement that we found the quarter, just where you're seeing gains across the categories more specifically? And also in the back half, there is an expectation on additional cost inflation, which you mentioned. Was wondering if you can touch on the balance on pricing and investing and innovation to help offset this? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. Yes, overall on I'll start with a hey, we're seeing resilience in demand across our categories overall globally. The underlying growth in our categories remains healthy. I just mentioned, we provide daily essentials and therefore, as you're probably well aware, category substitution remains low and we still believe there's a lot of room for us to expand penetration and also revenue per user across our markets. And we are mindful of the consumer environment. And as I said, we're working to sharpen up our positioning across the good, better, best value of the spectrum. A little bit more specifically in North America, demand remains resilient, although AMC and some value sensitivity more broadly across Staples, I'm well aware of that. Our categories in the quarter were up mid-single-digit with the categories having positive volume. And again, I think that reflects the essential nature of our categories and products. We are closely monitoring the consumer health, see insensitivity in mid to lower income households in a few of our categories. But overall, we feel like we're very well-positioned and we have a robust offering. As I mentioned earlier, we're proud to serve all consumer offers and have a robust offering across the value spectrum. And we're proactively working with our customers to better serve consumers and ensure that our propositions remains strong as we go forward. And maybe just to add it to build a little bit on -- address your question on expectations of volume and expectation of what to expect on inflation in the year? We've seen the progression in volume in the second quarter. We expect the back half, as we stated to be volume mix driven and the impact of pricing to continue to subside in the back half. This especially has to do with the timing of pricing actions in Argentina. We already saw a step down of the contribution of Argentina from the first quarter to the second quarter and we expect that based on what we are seeing today to continue to be the case in the back half. That takes us to pricing net of costs. In principle, we're holding the enterprise minimally to a pricing net of cost neutral standard on an annual basis. We have good visibility today for that to happen this year, absent a market dislocation shock like what we saw in 2021, 2022. As we think of the pacing, and I stated that in a prior question, pricing net of cost has been rather strong and favorable in the first half of the year, and that had to do with both timing of pricing realization, largely Argentina and then some of the timing on the cost inflation. Overall, we still expect to be at least neutral, if not positive, on the year and pricing net of costs. And from an overall cost inflation standpoint, we're not seeing a material change versus what we've discussed in the last call. Anna Lizzul : Great. Very helpful. Thank you so much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good morning, everyone. So I wanted to go back to \u2013 and thank you, go back to the North American tissue discussion. Understand volumes were down 3% and then there was about 250 basis points due to retail destocking. But on the other hand, you're probably shipping more Kleenex. So I was wondering, looking ahead, with the lap of the supply chain issue, should we expect the underlying to be still negative? And on the personal care side, if I can squeeze that in, what was the exit rate on the quarter in North America and globally? Mike Hsu : Yes. Well, let me start with the tissue in North America. Overall, again, as I said, there was a bit of a retail inventory change. And so our organic numbers are different than kind of what the consumption was. Consumption was up three in the quarter, which is just a little bit under what the category did overall. And so again, I think the tissue categories in North America remain robust or healthy, resilient depending on what adjective you want to use. I'd say overall share, we've made strong progress on Kleenex. I think Kleenex was up almost 500 basis points on share in the quarter. That does reflect an improved supply condition that I said we're cycling versus last year. On bad tissue, I think our share was a little -- was a bit soft, a little bit under 1 point in share down. And that reflects a couple of things, a hard -- what we call a hard rollover a packaging change and shelving reset on Cotton And then Scott 1000 has still been somewhat supply constrained year-to-date. And so we cut back on our normal merchandising calendar. And so therefore, because of that, we are seeing a little bit more increased promotional availability for private label, and that's kind of had a bit of an effect on Scott 1000. And I think the brand remains very, very healthy, and it's a power brand, especially for value consumers in this environment, and we feel great about that. But overall, I think we feel great about the progress. I think the inventory change was a little bit different than what we were expecting coming into the quarter. But I think I would hope that we're mostly through that. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. And on Personal Care, your question of what we grew, Andrea, I mean, we grew mid-single digits solidly in North America, and it was volume and mix driven. So the impact, as Mike said on the trade destocking in the quarter was largely contained to tissue -- Consumer Tissue in North America. Andrea Teixeira : And the -- this is super helpful, the exit rate of personal care. Do you think even with the merchandise, I'm assuming that you shifted merchandising dollars from Consumer Tissue into Personal Care, or you just on basically kind of flow through? And then now you can kind of as you regularly in the supply chain improves into Consumer Tissue, you're going to merchandise more into the second half? Or just as an exit rate, just an idea of how Personal Care continues to do well into the remaining of the month right into June? Mike Hsu : Yes. I mean, Andrea, I'm not sure I know how to answer that question on exit rate. It's not how I think about it. I would say, kind of what we're doing is, we're very encouraged with our start to the year through the first half. I think the volume and mix are proceeding and moving in the right direction for us. We feel great about that. There's going to be some inventory noise here and there. In personal care, I would say, it's going to be a positive in the category, because we had some supply constraints last year that we're cycling. As I just mentioned, there was some inventory changes on the other direction on Consumer Tissue. But overall, I feel very good about where the brands are recognize, we have more work to do. But also I feel good that we have the opportunity to make some additional investments to make sure that our value propositions are robust. But that doesn't mean we're going to ride it through promotion. As you may be well aware, I said in the past, I'm not a fan of over promoting our categories. And so really we're our focus on investment is to grow the category through advertising and bringing out the right kind of innovation to drive the categories. Just like I talked about with Skin Essentials that we just launched in North America in the second quarter. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Thank you both. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks a lot. Nelson Urdaneta : Thank you. Mike Hsu : We'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. The next question is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Bonnie. Nelson Urdaneta : Good morning, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Good morning. I just had maybe a quick follow-up question on your tissue business. As you just mentioned, promos really have started to step up there. So, I guess, I'm trying to get a sense for how much you may need to or be willing to increase promos in an effort to essentially drive volumes in the back half of the year, possibly resulting in a net negative price contribution similar to what we saw in Q2. And do you expect continued retail inventory destock impact in the back half as well? Mike Hsu : Yes, maybe I'll start with the last part, Bonnie. I again, I tend to focus a little bit more on the consumption and the consumption trends remain. I would say, healthy. I think there's going to be some shifting here and there. I don't expect ongoing retail inventory contractions, but there could be some moves here and there, we don't control those, right? But we are -- we do work with these are big categories. And so our customers do work with us very closely to plan these out over time. And so I feel good about the inventory positions that we have right now, but can't exactly predict what will go forward on it -- what will happen on a go-forward basis. On the promotional environment, I do think, hey, I recognize broadly across Staples that there is increased consumer price sensitivity. And so making sure that we have the right value proposition is going to be important. The thing I'll point you to is what's fundamentally changed in these categories over the past 10 years, five years is the analytics that we have available to drive the right decision making. And so and I know of it gets a lot of play about the promotional environment. But you know, in the last five years, we've invested a lot in the predictive modeling tools that make -- enable us to make the right choices on promotion. And so again, I tend to focus this more on profitable growth and promotion is a -- trade promotion as a tool to drive the overall brand strategy. But it is not a strategy in my mind itself. And so again, I think will work to make sure that our products are affordable and competitive. But again, we're focused on growing the categories. Bonnie Herzog : That's helpful. Just maybe one final clarification. I mean, is it fair to assume, or maybe ask this way. Is it your expectation that volumes will inflect in the second half in tissue just based on everything you said, and how you expect things to play out? Mike Hsu : Yeah. Well, I'd say, yeah. I mean, we've shifted our emphasis to volume and mix-driven growth. And so, yeah, over time, we're expecting all of our businesses to drive positive volumes, and that's kind of the model on how we want to grow. So I think that includes North America tissue. Bonnie Herzog : Perfect. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Bonnie. Nelson Urdaneta : Thank you. Mike Hsu : All right. Well, thanks to everybody for joining us. And if anybody has any follow-up calls, we'll be available to take them today. So thanks very much for your time. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Jakubik, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Christopher Jakubik : Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations at Kimberly-Clark and welcome to our Q&A session for our third quarter 2024 business update. During our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release in our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at investor.kimberly-clark.com. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it to our Chairman and CEO, Mike Hsu, for a few quick opening comments. Mike Hsu : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I want to let you know our team has made great strides advancing our Powering Care strategy, bolstering our confidence to deliver above our long-term growth algorithm in 2024. To be global category leaders, we must lead growth in our categories. We're executing and making steady progress on our strategy to achieve this. We're driving consumption and growing our share across categories and markets driven by our acceleration in innovation and enhanced commercial execution. Our productivity is fueling our investments in innovation to support our growth initiatives while delivering our bottom line growth aspiration. We've achieved key milestones and our transformation is on track with no disruptions. And notably, on October 1st, we successfully completed our new organizational structure to become a better, faster and stronger organization. We're rapidly transforming Kimberly-Clark to thrive in an increasingly complex and competitive global environment. However, there are some discrete headwinds that we are that are creating pressures on growth in the near-term. And these include retail inventory reductions as our service levels improve, lower demand in private label businesses that we're exiting and weaker than anticipated demand in North American professional channels and some pockets of deceleration in Asia and Latin America. And the actions that we're taking as part of our transformation strategy are positioning us to navigate a dynamic consumer and retail environment, accelerate investments across the enterprise so that we can lead market growth and enhance the value of Kimberly-Clark for all of our stakeholders. So with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator : Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Mike Hsu : Hey, good morning, Lauren. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Hey, good morning. So I wanted to just touch first on retail inventory because you had talked about before the quarter some expectation, you were lapping some rebuild last year. But this has really been, I guess, a source of volatility. So I was curious if you could talk about kind of how you think about it, where service levels stand today. And also, is there anything going on from a shelf space standpoint because, again, the disconnect between shipments and consumption has been such a source of volatility? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, no disconnect from a shelving. I mean, we feel very good about our distribution growth, and SKU count, I think, remains robust. And we have a great innovation pipeline that we're bringing in that will continue to support that. So I would say the retail inventory reductions, they may be a little localized to us and do reflect, as you point out, Lauren, reflect the supply challenges we had last year. Just to give you a little, just to remind you, we had a packaging supplier that was down for a couple of months last year that impacted most of our Personal Care brands in North America. So and as we got back into supply, I think, we got fully back in the supply third quarter of last year. And so you could see in that chart that we had in our presentation kind of a spike in inventories in the third quarter last year, and we're cycling that this quarter. So I think that's really the overall driver. So between restocking last year, reductions this year and the hurricane, we've seen about an 80 basis point overall headwind to global net sales year-to-date, primarily in North America. And as I said, that reflects, I'd say, an improving service environment from our side and potentially impact from higher financing costs for inventory. At the end of the quarter, I'd say retail inventories look consistent to us with historical levels. So hopefully, I think we're -- we should be mostly through it. But we would say, hey, you are working through some dynamism in the environment. And so we could still see some further reductions through the retailer fiscal year-end, which happened in Q3 of next year. So if that persists at similar levels in Q4, we could be closer to a 3% organic growth for the full year. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. And a few things just to add on, as we think about the inventory, the hurricane impacts and what we had in Q3, Lauren, the quarter, consumer offtake in North America is pretty strong, both in Personal Care, Consumer Tissue combined, it grew 3.2%, so ahead of the category. And the disconnect, if you will, is really with the shipments, and that was impacted by a couple of factors. One, transitory factors, and that's the retail inventory changes, which, again, we lapped a bill last year. We had a slight reduction in inventories again in Q3 of this year. Then we had the impact of the hurricane at the end of the quarter with shipments out of the Southeast. And then lastly, some drops in private label volumes on both businesses we're exiting as well as some business we'll exit next year. The other bit to take into account is there was some underlying demand weakness in professional and some international markets that Mike referred to. But the key is the shortfall in Q3, about two-thirds is attributable to the transitory factors that I just referred to. And if you think about the North America business in particular, the combination of these two led to about a 280 basis point headwind in North America Personal Care, whereas in Consumer Tissue, that was around 350 basis points in Consumer Tissue in North America. So overall, that's how you would be able to bridge the two numbers. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. And I was just curious, just in the Nielsen data, for what it's worth, we've seen a surge in some of your categories in and around Port Strike. There's been questions around consumer takeaway ahead of the hurricanes. So did you see that anything to just consider in terms of shipment dynamics and any things to think about for 4Q that will be helpful? Mike Hsu : Yes, Lauren, I would say we're not really expecting any benefit from any stock up behavior by consumers. I'd say, yes, we did see a little bit of it related to both the hurricane and potentially the Port Strike. I'd say, not meaningful at an enterprise level. And we would expect we'll kind of work through that in the quarter. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, perfect. Thanks so much. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Lauren. Nelson Urdaneta : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Nik. Nelson Urdaneta : Hey, Nik. Nik Modi : Good morning. Good morning, guys. So Mike, maybe you can just talk about market shares. In the release you suggested things looked pretty good from that standpoint. So I wanted to kind of get your thoughts on that and just the competitive environment in general. But just kind of tagging on to that on innovation. I mean, some of the data we've seen out of numerator on some of your innovation like Skin Essentials will suggests there's a very high cannibalization rate. And so I just wanted to get your thoughts on kind of how you think about innovation and the role it's going to play. Is this really about market share gains or is this about kind of expanding the value pool as you've been suggesting with some of the price tier opportunities that you have in the US and other markets? Mike Hsu : Okay. I'll try to answer all of that, Nik. You may have to steer me depending on how I answer. But I think the short answer is, hey, we're after growing our market shares overall, and we're off to expanding the category. So it's both of those. I'd say I feel very good about the progress overall that we're making on market share. And for the quarter, I think overall, I think we are globally, overall, about flat on a weighted basis. And on a cohort basis, I'd say we're slightly more than half which is an improvement versus this time a year ago, pretty significant improvement. Importantly, I think in the US where we're making strong progress and so where we have at discrepancy in consumption. Consumption is very solid and we were up or even in seven of eight categories versus a year ago in the quarter and eight of eight sequentially. So I think we're making good progress on the market share front. And that's really driven by the strategy that we've been talking to you all about, Nik, which is, hey, we're investing to make better products in pioneering innovation. We're investing to improve our advertising and driving strong commercial activation and we're pulling all those levers together. So I think your question on innovation is overall, as we look to premiumize or drive trade-up in our categories, obviously, our preferred path is to do that in a margin-accretive way, right? And so if you're driving premium innovation, that should be at a higher margin. I'd say the overall goal is to delight the consumer in whatever way that we need to. And so in a lot of ways, like Skin Essentials, I feel great about the product that delivers really great benefits from a skin care perspective. That's kind of a new feature in the category and I'm excited that consumers see that worth investing in, right? And so that's a great thing. But we also are focused on every tier on the good, better, best spectrum, right? And so we're going to bring cascading our innovation throughout all of our tiers to make all of our products better. And so the short answer which maybe frustrate some of my organization sometimes when they ask me, well, do you want us to trade up or do you want the value, and I say yes, right? Because our job is to deliver across all tiers of that good, better, best spectrum. Nik Modi : Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Nik. Operator : Your next question for today is from Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Anna. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi, Anna. Anna Lizzul : Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk about the private label businesses. You did exit certain private label businesses, which impacted this quarter. So can you give us more detail on where you are now in that process? Maybe what we should be expecting moving forward and just how is this overall helping you get to your longer-term gross margin goal of at least 40% by 2030? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes. Thanks, Anna. Yes, I think the overall kind of underlying strategy behind the private label shift for us is we're really focused on proprietary science-based innovation in right-to-win spaces, and that's really behind our brands. So we really want to focus our capacity and technology investment in the brands to drive further differentiation. And so we've been moving out of some private label business for the past 18 months. That has enabled us to step up our growth in our branded business, for example, Kleenex, which was up almost 500 basis points in share this quarter or last quarter. That part of that is because we've been able to expand some of the capacity that we've had behind the brand. So I think that's been an important move. I think the last quarter in Q3, it's the first time that the exit combined with maybe some weaker private label sales that some customers was material enough for us to call out. And I think we noted that in our presentation. I did highlight last quarter that in 2025, we'll cease production for a large club private label diaper business in the US, and that's going to create a headwind of about 2% for us next year. And so as a result, our private label mix will shrink from about 4% in 2023 to about 2% next year and I expect that to decline further over time. Anna Lizzul : Great. Thank you so much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Anna. Operator : Your next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Bonnie. Nelson Urdaneta : Good morning, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Good morning. I wanted to ask about your gross margin, which it's expanded pretty meaningfully year-to-date and tracking ahead of pre-COVID levels. So just wondering how we should think about the sustainability of these margin levels, especially given the soft organic sales and probably the possibility that promos need to step up given pressures on the consumer and to limit down training. I guess what's the right level of support you see from a benign input cost environment and considering also your ongoing productivity savings. Thank you. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. So a few things, Bonnie. Overall, we're pretty pleased with the trajectory of our gross margins, operating profit margins and more importantly, gross margin dollars. I mean that's our focus at the end of the day because that's what really funds our ability to invest in the business, invest behind the brands and drive the sustainable innovation that we've been putting in the marketplace, which Mike was just talking about. For the year, what we've seen is we're right around an average of 37% gross margin, which is a pretty healthy gain. And we've been doing consistently for the last eight quarters or so, gains on gross margin quarter-after-quarter, year-over-year. And we still expect, as we exit the year to continue to have gains on gross margin on a year-over-year basis. A few things have played out in terms of what's driving the gross margin and why we still have strong confidence in our ability to get to our long-term stated goal of at least 40% gross margin or operating margin in the range of 18% to 20% before the end of the decade. And what's playing out is the following. One is, first and foremost, our focus on driving meaningful innovation and focus on making it accretive to overall margins. Secondly is our shift to really managing our cost basket in a different way than what we did, say, three, four years ago. We're much more proactive around risk management strategies, how we look at the cost basket overall, and that allows us to have more visibility into what's coming our way so that we can react appropriately. The third element, and it's been playing out very well this year, and it's part of our Powering Care strategy is our transformation in the supply chain. We've delivered very strong productivity through the first three quarters of the year. We're, this past quarter, $130 million, and that's just in our gross productivity from manufacturing and supply chain, not including procurement and we have a very strong pipeline going forward as part of our Powering Care strategy over the next few years as we really get underway to deliver that $3 billion. So we see that as very sustainable over time. A key point to take into account is margin progression is not linear. So there will be ups and downs quarter-to-quarter. The important thing is what's happening from a year-to-year basis and over time. So overall very pleased where we stand right now. We obviously, from a cost basket, that was part of your question. Right now, we are still staring at about the same number that we had provided as an outlook at the beginning of the year. We've seen a bit of an uptick on cost in Q3, but that's exactly in line with what we had projected. And we expect Q4 to kind of have the same trajectory that we have seen in Q3. So no change at this stage versus what we're seeing. Mike Hsu : Yes. And Bonnie, maybe you touched on pricing or the promotion environment. I'll just say the overall, we're really focused right now on volume and mix-driven organic growth. And to do that, I think we're also very focused on driving what we call PNOC or price net of commodity discipline, right? And so and the magic of that is if we had that discipline on PNOC then the productivity kind of drives the margin expansion on its own. But I would say, overall, pricing to offset cost inflation is proceeding as we had planned throughout the year. We really want to be, as I had just mentioned earlier, better value at every rung of the good, better, best ladder. And so our focus on building the brands with innovation, world-class advertising or storytelling in our vernacular and then really, really strong commercial execution. That's kind of how we want to play it. I would say we do use promotion and but primarily as a trial driver with our pioneering innovation is how we think about it. Bonnie Herzog : Okay, very helpful. Thanks for the color. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Bonnie. Operator : The next question is from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Hsu : Hey, Chris. Nelson Urdaneta : Hey, Chris. Christopher Carey : Hey, everyone. So I just have a question about the new organizational structure and category growth. And then I'm going to sneak one in on just the Q4 operating profit expectation. So regarding the new organizational structure that you have in place as of October 1st, you also have an expectation for category growth to decelerate or at least to be the lower end of your long-term range. I think I saw that in the prepared remarks. And so how do these two things fit together, right? So the outlook for Q4 is, I think, similar to Q3, so maybe even a bit below that global category growth rate and yet you have the new organization in place. How long before this organization is really driving the outcomes that you're looking for? And specifically with an eye on 2025 where perhaps you'll have a little bit less pricing than you've had this year and where that organizational, those organizational changes are going to be an important part of driving organic sales growth next year. And I just wonder how you see that kind of top line trajectory coming together. And if I could just sneak in on Q4, is the operating profit being muted in Q4? Is that really a discretionary decision behind investment? Should we be expecting some narrowing of gross margin performance? How would you characterize just the relative differences between Q4 gross margin and just the sort of things that you're being a bit more offensive about from an investment standpoint? So thanks so much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Chris, you're up earlier. There's a lot of questions to unpack in there. So just steer us around if we forget to address something. But one, I will say, I'm really pleased with the progress that our organization is making in implementing our wire for growth organization. And we've been operating that, as we said in October 1, officially. The little, the truth behind that is we've been doing that on an informal basis earlier. So I think it's gone off very, very well and we're starting to see the benefits of kind of moving in that structure. I'll hit on the categories. I'd say, hey, the overall categories remain resilient. Underlying category growth, I think, Chris, remains very healthy. Consumer interest in better-performing products remains healthy, especially in developed markets, but in developing and emerging markets as well. We're still very mindful about affordability and our need to strengthen our brand value propositions. So I'd say overall, the categories are growing in dollars and units. The underlying demand drivers remain healthy, and that includes penetration, which I think overall is stable, and long-term for us remains a big opportunity. We are seeing in some markets like lower births as you're well aware like in South Korea and China. But that has tempered and slowed down. The declines in the birth rate have slowed down. I'd say they actually have troughed. And so and our businesses are still performing well in that kind of environment. We have a lot of markets with categories that still remain at the very early stages of development across developing and emerging markets. And then, of course, this aging population is a strong tailwind for our Adult Care business across developed markets. And so I think penetration, I think, it's a good story. Trade-up remains a big driver of the category, especially in developed markets, but even including the developing and emerging markets, and we're still seeing the demand for premium products continue to grow, both in the US and developed and emerging markets. I think frequency is where we see typically some softness right now. Typically, in a tougher economic environment, consumers in some markets notably like in Latin America and Southeast Asia tend to try to stretch out their money a little bit by using the products for a little bit longer duration. And so we are seeing a little bit of softness in Latin America and Southeast Asia. And in addition, I think, we mentioned in our presentation, we're seeing some traffic slowdown in our North American professional business. So as a result, I think our full year weighted category growth is likely to be closer to 2% versus the 2% to 3% range that we had highlighted previously. That said, I'd say, we remain on algorithm. Of course, our goal is to lead category growth, which we will continue to do, we think. And then as we're flat to slightly up on share across our businesses globally this year. Nelson Urdaneta : And let me unpack a little bit the top line trajectory and then we can get into the Q4 margins, Chris. So a few things as we look at the top line trajectory. So absent the transitory factors, a key thing is, one, pricing. We are lapping the pricing actions that have been taken across category, all players and ourselves. And as you can see from Q1 to Q3, what's happened is, and as we had projected at the beginning of the year, the impact of pricing in our overall organic growth has come down as expected. For the quarter, we were only 1% pricing. But if you go back to Q1, that was 4%. So it's been coming down and we expect that pretty much be the case as the year closes also because pricing in hyperinflationary economies has been coming down. The other bit is that it's also having an incidence on the category growth. While DQ has remained healthy, et cetera, we're seeing that pricing and you're seeing it in Nielsen data is also coming down, and that's having an impact on what you see in overall category growth rates. So that's something we expect to have. But overall, the key element is, as we said at our Investor Day, this new phase is really about volume mix-led growth and that's what we expect for Q4. If you look at our outlook for Q4, the implication of what we're stating is that we do expect our top line for Q4 to be actually stronger than what we saw in Q3 once we normalize for the transitory factors that we saw. And again, there could be one-offs. We can't predict what we don't control. But based on what we know, we'd expect that to happen on the top line. In terms of the gross margin for Q4, a few things. One, we are stepping up investments behind our brands and our platforms. We saw that play out in Q3 as we had signaled in July. We stepped up advertising spend by 60 basis points. We expect to step up advertising and brand support by at least that amount in Q4. So the combination of the two should be north of 7%. So that's one element to be taken into account. Secondly, there are some discretionary costs that we expect to hit our P&L in Q4. And last but not least is we had a little, I mean as we had indicated back in January, out of our bucket of input cost inflation, including currency because of the timing of some of the pricing actions in hyperinflationary economies last year and how these costs would slow in, we would be more back half loaded. That played out in Q3. That will play out in Q4. But overall, the key thing is we are making year-on-year strong progress on margins and we expect to continue to do that over time. Mike Hsu : What did we miss, Chris? Christopher Carey : That was -- I think that was as comprehensive as I could have hoped for. So thank you for entertaining all that. All right. Good luck. Mike Hsu : All right. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question for today is from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Mike Hsu : Hey, Kevin. Nelson Urdaneta : Hey, Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Hey, good morning, guys. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Nelson. Question for you on, as a follow-up on Chris' question, a bit of a different angle, though. Just as it pertains to visibility on results, sort of the mix, Mike, all this organizational change that you've kind of been pushing through in what is still a pretty dynamic environment. So I asked that in the context, the quarter fell a bit short of your own internal expectations in The Street. Some of these factors evolved throughout the quarter. There's something like the inventory build was known. When you're speaking with The Street as recently, it's like early September, it did sound some of these factors were really being amplified such that The Street was kind of braced for the magnitude of it. So I can appreciate the volatility of the environment. Nelson, your point on what the organization has done around productivity and visibility there further down the P&L certainly well taken. But my question for both of you really kind of speaks to the visibility you have as you're sort of contending with all this organizational change and why investors should not be concerned that this is really kind of a setback quarter in terms of the visibility that you're conveying and the guidance to The Street. So thanks for all that. Mike Hsu : Yes. I think I'll start, Kevin, with one, I'm really, really pleased with the strong execution globally that we have from the team around the world. Overall, I'd say, I'm really pleased that we are managing the controllables very, very well. I think what happened in the quarter, I would say, certainly, I think you understand on the retail inventory, it's very certainly to be a transitory impact. I do think part of it is, we'll react to evolving market conditions. And so we've started to see a little softness in Southeast Asia and in Latin America and, as we noted, in our professional business. I think for us, the opportunity is we have good visibility on it. I think the organizational change has gone very, very well. We've been operating, I would say, in our words, internally a soft reorg condition for the past six months. And so I think we have pretty good visibility operationally. And importantly, management in the markets that are running the businesses has not changed significantly. So I think that should give us our investors' comfort there. I think what we are calling out is there is some softness in some markets that we're all aware of. Some of that is certainly category conditions are the things that we could be doing better from a product perspective or a marketing perspective? Sure. And so I think the thing I like about our rewiring for growth is it's creating more visibility into the big markets that make the biggest impact and that's international or Personal Care for us, North America and some of our big Consumer Tissue markets. And so we're able, I would say, to diagnose what's going on and respond much quicker. And some of the areas that we have opportunity to work on harder are Kotex in China, even though it was up slightly on share in the quarter, it softened a little bit. Our fem care business in Brazil, similarly. Bath tissue in South Korea was a little soft in the quarter. One of the things that the reasons why we saw a little bit of a slowdown in Korea in the quarter was we have been growing multiple share points that offset some of the category conditions. And now that we're only growing a little bit of share or, let's say, 100 basis points of share rather than 300 that slowdown in the category growth hits home a little bit harder. So I think we have some opportunity there. And then lastly, Huggies in parts of Latin America, I think we do have some product improvement opportunities, which we're all over. And so again, I feel good about the visibility and I feel good about where we are in the reorganization. But Nelson, I don't know if you wanted to add anything? Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. So just to add, Kevin, a few things. One, we will remain and we've been instilling a lot of discipline in the business around our approach to volume consumption and how we manage on that end. So we will remain steadfast on the role that promotions play and we're not going to be chasing volume. We're going to be chasing consumption and that's what we're doing. We're pleased with the fact that in North America, consumption remains strong. Again, there's a disconnect between shipments and consumption. And there are elements there that we can't predict on a month-to-month basis because they just happen. Our focus and our discipline has also remained around how we manage bottom line, overall profitability of the business to be able to generate the fuel to invest back in the business. Our performance has been strong on that end. And again, we're getting better by the day as we execute. Our teams have been going through a lot of change over the next, over the last few months, and we're very proud of what they've accomplished and how they're looking at what we're going to be doing over the next few years as we carry out our Powering Care transformation. So overall, we'll manage through the next few quarters and there'll be market dynamics. But ultimately, our objective is to lead category growth in a profitable and sustainable manner, and that's what we're setting the organization to do. Kevin Grundy : Right. Very good. Christopher Jakubik : I think we have one more question. Mike Hsu : Okay. Operator : Your final question is from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Javier. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi, Javier. Javier Escalante : Hi. Hello, guys. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to revisit some of the items discussed in a way that, I think, that it may be simpler because there is a lot of moving pieces. So stay kind of like external issues versus internal factors. So the external one, the bigger one is this inventory destocking is not just you. We have been talking about this with other -- with some of your peers. If you can talk about what's driving it. Is it just mechanics of COVID? Is it shift to e-commerce that they are using the stores differently? And if you can basically say, I think that I heard that it was 80 basis points on a year-to-date basis. If you can just simply tell us what was the impact on Q3. So that's the externality. I'll wait, but I would like to go more into the internal piece, which to me is more interesting. So if you can address that and then give me a minute for the internal piece question. Nelson Urdaneta : So Javier, let me reconcile the numbers for you just to give the sense of what's that 80 basis point on Q3. And you can get to that and see. But, as you stated, I mean, there are externalities, inventory movements. We had a bill last year, especially, particularly in Q3 as our supply chain normalized in the US. And then we had a bit of more destock in Q3 following what had happened in Q1 and Q2 of this year. We also had the hurricane impact at the very end of the quarter, the last three, four days of shipments. And then the other element was the private label shipments. I mean we exited some contracts. And then on top of that, we had softer demand in other private label that materialized at the end of September. Those three elements that we've called, that I've referred to as transitory factors added to slightly north of one point of growth in the quarter. So roughly 1.3 points, if you want me to round it to be exact. That's what that drove for the enterprise overall in growth. That's the 80 bps give or take that Mike referred to for the year, if you add all that. Javier Escalante : Thank you. Yes. So basically, the real question is the following, right? So you basically, you are doing a lot. This is a highly decentralized company, but at the same time, the categories are roughly the same. So basically, you are moving away from private label. So if you can tell us how you are in that process again. So what was your, at the beginning of the year, your -- what percentage of global sales were in private label? Where they are now? What is the plan for next year because there is the impending exit of private label business that is two points coming into 2025? So if you can explain that as an item alone. So then if you -- there is the implementation of S/4 HANA. To what extent that had an impact or give you more visibility so you can guide better going into next year? And there is another item that came out, a news item, in terms of you guys being evaluating strategic options for the international tissue and professional businesses, which, in my math is about 7% of the profit. So you seem to be doing a lot very at the same time. So tell us how the organization is responding. Do you have the system to manage this so you can control the volatility going forward? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes. I think I'll start maybe. And as I said, I think we've been very pleased with the organization's response to the reorganization. And Javier, as I mentioned, we start -- we flipped the switch on the new operating model or a new operating structure on October 1, but the reality is we have been running in a kind of a soft mode for several months leading up to it. And the reality is what's happening in each of the markets, we haven't changed management significantly in any of the local markets that kind of deliver the P&L. And so our expectation would there be little disruption. And in my mind, there hasn't been very much disruption at all. So again, I think we feel very good about how the organization is proceeding and our visibility into kind of looking at the business remains very, very good. I'd say on the private label, again, I think I'd mentioned earlier, it's -- this year, it will be about 4% of our overall sales of the company. Next year, after the exit, it will be -- we'll be about 2% private label. And then our plans would be it will probably work our way down from there. So that's that part. I forgot what the -- what else did you want? Nelson Urdaneta : You had a question on S/4, Javier. So we -- Javier Escalante : Go ahead. Actually, the question is more about whether S/4 HANA will give you the capacity to basically better foresee this volatility because there is this news item about you guys looking for strategic options for divest, I don't know what that is. But international tissue and pro-business which is about 7% of profit. Mike Hsu : First of all, Javier, since you opened the door, my DTS, my Digital Technology Service organization will be really miffed of me, if I don't complement them, but we did flip the switch on our North American S/4 HANA implementation at the end of July, actually the weekend before the earnings call last quarter. And contrary to what most experiences are, nobody noticed other than it was easier to run. And so I think our organization has done a great job. I think, actually, the vendor who provides the software wants to meet with us to see how did you -- how do we pull that off without any slippage. So I think we've done a very good job there, and so from that perspective, I think, again the organization, I think, continues to perform extremely, extremely well. With regard to your questions on international family care and professional, I'd say, we're taking important steps to make that a more robust and predictable contributor to growth and returns for us. And for me, obviously, as a matter of practice, I'm not going to comment news articles or rumors. And I'll let you know when I think there's something that you need to know. But we like the categories that we're in. We believe we can add a lot more value to our categories, our consumers and our customers. That said, Javier, I think you'll also recognize that in places where we don't feel like we have a right-to-win in the long-term, we'll look to optimize our participation in those assets. And the example that I think you and I have discussed is in Brazil, where we saw some structural factors that made it difficult for us to compete. On the Consumer Tissue side of the business, due to some, I would say, some government incentives that we couldn't access that made the category more difficult to compete in, we made a different decision that I think was a very good one for the company. And so I think we'll continue to make those tough decisions. But again, I think we'll let you know if there's anything to think about regarding the tissue business. Javier Escalante : Thank you very much guys. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you Javier. Nelson Urdaneta : Thank you. Mike Hsu : Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. And for anybody who has follow-up questions, Investor Relations will be around to take your calls. So thanks very much and have a great day.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Jakubik, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Christopher Jakubik : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I just want to remind everyone that during our comments today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during these remarks. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at investor.kimberly-clark.com. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike for a few opening comments. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thank you, Chris. 2024 was an outstanding year for our team and the future of Kimberly-Clark as we launched our multi-year Powering Care transformation strategy. Last year, we built the foundation to accelerate our growth in the years to come. We rewired our organization into three powerhouse segments to become a better, faster and stronger organization. We pivoted to volume plus mix-driven growth and established strong market share momentum. And we made the successful transition from margin recovery in 2023 to establishing a new phase of margin expansion in 2024. Our progress enabled us to deliver full-year results that exceeded our long-term algorithm even as we absorbed discrete headwinds. Now we enter 2025 with good visibility on the key drivers of our growth and profit potential. We're confident in our plans to deliver innovation led growth ahead of the categories in which we compete. We're continuing to invest in product quality, brand support and capability building and we're bullish on our ability to continue powering investment and bottom-line growth with industry leading productivity and SG&A savings through wiring for growth. This year, we'll continue to transform while performing, scaling our playbook and capabilities across the globe and shaping our portfolio for stronger, more profitable growth over the long-term. Through Powering Care, we're taking actions that are enabling us to navigate a dynamic environment and provide better care for a better world. Now with that, we'd like to open the lines for your questions. Operator : Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Dara. Nelson Urdaneta : Hey, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, good morning. So just hoping to spend some time on the top-line, maybe we can split it into the long-term versus the short-term. Maybe, Mike, you can just take a step back now that we're at year end, give us a review of where you think you stand on the organizational front with the rewiring plans you announced at Analyst Day, both in terms of reorganizing the way you approach the business, but also some of the tangible benefits from that. You talked about greater, more impactful innovation, more effective marketing, etc. So are you pleased with where you stand today? Maybe give us an update? And as you think about 2025, is it more of a step function in yielding some of those benefits from all those changes or do you see those benefits building more overtime? Mike Hsu : Okay. All right. Thanks for the question. There's a lot in that. I'll try to get to all of it and Nelson and Chris may keep me honest here. Overall, Dara, I'd say, I feel very good about our setup for 2025 and also for the long-term. Maybe the one external piece I'd say is, our categories continue to exhibit very durable growth. The underlying demand is healthy. Our categories continue to expand in both dollars and units or value and units. And that's because -- I think we've talked about this before, Dara, we see really three durable drivers of growth over the long-term. Number one is penetration, which remains an opportunity. I'd say, the good news is, growth rate declines are leveling-off and in some markets, notably Korea, we saw a positive growth rate in the third quarter, which continued in the fourth and that was the first time in eight years. And in China was positive in growth rate as well. So I'd say one, on penetration, growth rate declines kind of inflecting a bit at least early signs. Aging population for adult care categories remains a big tailwind, especially in developed markets like South Korea and China, US. And then there remains in much of the developing world an expanding middle-class that remains a big driver for us. Second big thing, frequency remains strong. There is some pockets of softness, notably, I'd say in pockets of Latin-America and Southeast Asia, but frequency remains robust for us. And then maybe one of our bigger opportunities remains trade-up. Consumers remain very interested in better performing products and so we're seeing the premium end of our categories continue to grow. So with all that said, I'd say in the short-term, we're seeing, and I think it was in our prepared remarks, 2% category growth this year, which is on the lower-end of what we said, but I'd still say fairly robust, durable for our categories. The big thing is, our categories are daily essentials. And so they don't move around that much from day-to-day and year-to-year. So I'd say maybe that would be on the shorter-term. And then over the long-term, I think we're positioned well to deliver consistent volume and mix growth over the long-term. I think -- we believe our growth profile will continue to improve overtime, and that's, as I just mentioned, a function of demographics and income and all the investment we're doing to make our categories and our products and brands better. I think what we said last March at Investor Day, we expected weighted average category growth to revert to a historical range of 2% to 3%. And last year through the first-half, we were a little ahead of that. And then after lapping some price moves from the prior year, I'd say we've seen some lower frequency in some markets and a little bit of a slowdown in North-America professional consumption. But overall, I think the categories have globally performed pretty well. So I don't -- for this -- for the -- going forward for this year, I don't really expect a whole lot of new pricing that will -- that drive that up. And I think as I mentioned, the category we have at two -- around 2% this year and expect longer term 2% to 3% volume mix-driven, I think is a reasonable aspiration for us or for what the category is going to do and then we want to grow faster than that. So I'll pause there. I know there's a lot to your question. I just gave you a lot. Which other things did I miss? Dara Mohsenian : That was very comprehensive. I think you got it all, but maybe I'll just follow-up on 2025 specifically, it didn't sound like you expect a lot of pricing. Maybe just take me through your decision process on pricing, particularly given some FX pressure and how you think about the balance between price and volume as you look out to 2025 and just level of visibility you can do at two-plus or better than category growth, presuming it stays in that 2% range. Just given if we strip out hyperinflation, you've been a bit below that the last few quarters. I know some of that's probably inventory, but just how you think about the level of visibility also specifically [Multiple Speakers] Mike Hsu : I'll ask Nelson to give our thoughts on that. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes, Dara. So let me give you -- unpack a little bit the top-line expectations for 2025 and also walk through the pricing trajectory that we've seen in 2024, because it builds into what we're expecting for 2025. So a few things. As Mike said, 2025 overall, we expect pricing to be pretty much muted on an enterprise level, aggregate, so largely flat. We're coming off a year as we put in our prepared remarks. And as you would have seen in the earnings release where the full-year pricing realization was more around 200 basis points for the enterprise, of which hyperinflationary and Argentina specifically contributed on the year about 300 basis points. Across 2024, that number came down every quarter. So from a 450 basis point contribution in Q1, that came down to 160 basis point contribution in Q4. That coincides with inflation tapering off in Argentina as the macroeconomic situation has been stabilizing, driven by the government actions that were taken about a year-ago. In fact, as we go into this year, whereas Argentina contributed on the full-year about 300 basis-points to [top line] (ph) growth and pricing in 2024, we only expect around 30 basis points tops in or less in 2025. So in essence, pricing is now going to be a driver of growth in 2025. It's really going to be a volume and mix-led growth. It builds on the transition that occurred in 2024. 2024 was a year in which volume and mix contributed 1.2 points of growth, volume being 0.8 points or 80 bps. And as we had -- and in Q4, that actually accelerated to 1.5% of growth. So it will be a volume mix led growth accompanied by continued gain in market share. For 2024, our weighted average market share was -- gain was 10 basis points and we expect that to be at least that or higher as we head into 2025. Dara Mohsenian : Great. That's very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question is from Robert Moscow with TD Cowen. Mike Hsu : Hey, Rob. Nelson Urdaneta : Hey, Rob. Robert Moskow : Hi, good morning. The productivity savings are really outstanding at 5.9% and it sounds like you're guiding to that again in 2025. And I wanted to know, in 2024 did any of that productivity savings help you on pulp costs? Because it would appear that pulp costs are going higher in 2025, do you have productivity baked-in in your procurement estimates for that and any other commodities? And then secondly, you're confident in your PNOC outlook for 2025. Maybe give a little more color on that and how it compares to how you did in 2024? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Yes. So a few things, Robert. Yes, we're very pleased with the first year of delivery towards our $3 billion five year target of productivity, solid start. We stood up our global supply-chain organization on July 1 of 2024 and last year constituted the first year of our transformation of the global supply-chain. We did deliver historical high productivity and the lion share of the productivity was on what we call our integrated margin management productivity, which is what we're doing on our manufacturing facilities, largely networked optimization, automation, as well as value stream. In terms as it relates to pulp and any -- and any productivity related savings, that's really not the case. I mean we -- we've been managing commodity -- the commodity basket in a much more proactive manner and not in a reactive manner. As we've been explaining over the last couple of years, we've been engaging in strategic relationships with our suppliers that have allowed us to manage through the volatility that we would have seen in prior years. So on that end, as we go into 2025, our expectation is to be in the 5% range of productivity, a tad lower than the 5.9%, but solidly within what we consider to be best-in-class levels for 2025. We have significant -- significantly improved cost visibility in the next couple of years or so, and that's part of our integrated margin management approach and the strategies on risk management that we've deployed. We are confident in our ability to continue to drive in the mid, long-term of pricing net of cost that it's at least neutral. We've seen that play out. In fact, it was favorable in 2024. And as we go into 2025, we will continue to hone in our skills for our teams to manage towards a pricing net of cost at least neutral strategy. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes, maybe, Rob, I'll just add, from my view, I'd say our Powering Care strategy is powering what we want to be on algorithm performance. And I think we feel very good about how our plans line-up for this year based on what we're seeing in the current environment. And I think one of the most important things is, we know we're lapping some discrete factors like this big private label exit and the PPE exit and some of the other things. But we do have very strong visibility into productivity and we feel great about that. And that's been the key driver for us to fuel our investment in the business and fuel our bottom-line growth. And then commensurately in last year and this year in this plan, we will continue to invest in pioneering innovation, strong commercial activation to drive volume and mix. And then on top of that, we're expecting to see some SG&A leverage through our wiring for growth initiative this year. So again, we're feeling very good about overall the productivity and our visibility into it. Robert Moscow : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Mike Hsu : Hey, Steve. Steve Powers : Hey guys, great. Thank you. Good morning. Just to put a -- I don't really want to ask about SG&A, but just to put a little fine point on what Rob was asking about. So it sounds like the -- on PNOC specifically, just given that it's going to be a volume driven year on the top-line and I'm assuming there's some cost inflation, it seems like you're going to have to overcome some net negative PNOC on the year. But tell me if that's the wrong read from what you said there [indiscernible] Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. Probably that's not -- probably not what we meant to convey, but maybe -- yes. So maybe just to unpack on costs, because I think it's important to give kind of our view on cost for the year. So we -- in December, we shared that for 2025, we'd expected costs to remain relatively muted and manageable. And our expectation for 2025 is that, costs will be still elevated and on an aggregate basis, including currency, we expect to be at around a $200 million level, which is largely in-line with what we saw in 2024. So it is within the levels that we would consider manageable and what we've got. In terms of pricing net of cost, to your specific question, we still expect our teams to manage pricing net of cost neutral. At times, we will make strategic decisions around price back architectures or competitive elements where we'll make some tactical investments. But it is our expectations that teams will drive overtime lower total delivered costs. That's one of the key premises of Powering Care and why we've re-segmented the company the way we did it, so that we can drive the lowest possible cost in each of our products globally, while we drive the best performing products in each of our categories. But that\u2019s just to clarify on the PNOC, Steve. Mike Hsu : Yes. And then maybe Steve, to start, I'll just pile on. And just to give you some context on how we're thinking about it. I mean, and I think we've kind of moved through this period of what we internally call an inflation super-cycle, right, where the company took on record inflation over a couple of years. I think we've moved past that. And so, starting last year and definitely this year, we're very, very focused on volume plus mix-driven growth. And then while maintaining PNOC discipline. So that's kind of the thing, which is, hey, we definitely see that pricing to offset inflation or the inflation super-cycle has kind of receded as we all expected. But we think going-forward, this is what Nelson is trying to communicate, which is, maintaining that discipline in PNOC going-forward, it's going to remain important. And right now, again, as I just said earlier, we feel like we have good visibility on our costs, but we definitely believe that pricing net of commodity and costing to be positive or in the -- over the long-term. And then -- so I think we have good visibility in costs and then we have a very good commercial toolkit. We've invested a lot in the analytical tools to support our revenue growth management capability. And so, we feel confident in that. But really, really the near-term focus is on driving volume and mix through the pioneering innovation and great commercial activation. Nelson Urdaneta : And just to add there, Steve, keep in mind the productivity plan that we've -- that we're running right now. So we expect productivity to also be a contributor and an offset as an integrated part of integrated margin management for this year, at least in the 5% range, which will be another strong year of productivity in 2025. Steve Powers : Yes. And actually that segues into my main question because it feels like this year, a lot of the overall productivity savings that will enable underlying profit growth to hit that high-single digit run-rate on a constant currency basis, seems like a lot of that's going to come from SG&A. So could you give us a bit more detail on the sources and timing of that productivity, your line-of-sight to achieving it cleanly and your confidence to be able to kind of get there without having to walk back some of the value-added investments that you made in 2024. Thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay, Steve. Maybe I'll start with an overall perspective on marketing and then ask Nelson to comment specifically on the SG&A program. But I'd say overall, we're very comfortable with our current investment level in marketing. We're comfortable investing more to support faster, more profitable growth also, right? And to give you a little more perspective, our advertising spend has more than doubled since 2018, and we feel like we've gotten very strong returns on those investments. We closed last year 2024 at what I would say is a healthy 6.5% and Patricia Corsy, our new Chief Growth Officer, she's really, really here focused on helping us become world-class brand storytellers. And so, under her direction, we're doing a lot of things to improve our creative. One of an important one is, we're consolidating our agency partners both behind creative and the media side and that's going to both improve the content that we have and also the efficiency in spending. So with that set-up, I'd say, we're expecting to spend at a similar level in 2025, and we feel good about that. And as we drive additional productivity, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to spend more. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes. And as it relates to the overhead savings in particular. When we were at our Investor Day on March 27, we said that our plan was to deliver as we went through our Powering Care program around $200 million of SG&A savings. And they kick-in once we were fully operational under our new segment structure. And that happened in Q4 of 2024. So we went live with the three new segments on October 1 and our organizational changes are pretty much in-place as we speak. So we expect those SG&A savings, to your point, to begin to kick-in a material manner in 2025 and that's built into our outlook. So, we said it will take us around two years for that to materialize. So this would be the first of the two years where we would begin to see those savings flowing through. And of course, we will make investments as we create space on the P&L, but we expect that to be part of the rationale of why we expect operating margins in 2025 to grow at a faster pace than gross margins. Steve Powers : Yes. Okay. Very clear, very comprehensive. Thank you both. Appreciate it. Mike Hsu : All right. Thanks, Steve. Nelson Urdaneta : All right. Operator : Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Mike Hsu : Hey, Lauren. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Hey, how are you guys? Good morning. Mike Hsu : [Multiple Speakers] long-winded today. So\u2026 Lauren Lieberman : It's going to do a lot to say. It's all good. So I wanted to just talk a little bit about sources of growth. So a lot of talk so far on the call about pricing, but one thing that stood out to me this quarter was the volume growth. And China numbers on Personal Care specifically cited in the release. You also had good volume growth in North America and in personal care in particular. But I was curious sort of when we can expect to start to see volume growth coming through from other markets because we're very US and China weighted at the moment. Share gains have continued versus Procter seemingly in those categories just based on what they've had to say about those businesses. And so, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about broadening out sources of volume growth in terms of other geographies and just any kind of signs of changes in competitive dynamics that you may or may not be seeing? Thanks. Mike Hsu : Okay. Yes Thanks for pointing that out. And I'll try to answer it. I would say it goes back to maybe a Board meeting we had probably about five years ago where our discussion internally in the Board meeting was, hey, if there are markets we have to win, it is the US and it's China. And those are our largest markets and are the biggest categories in the world. And so, I'd say the good news is, I think we've put our strategic focus there and it's working, right? And so, we're really proud of that progress that the organization is making. I'd say though, maybe I'll point out, Lauren, I do think it's a little bit broader than what you're seeing in the US and China. Maybe I'll just give you some facts. On the share front, we're making progress. And I am pleased with our progress, but not satisfied. Our focus continues to be building superior propositions at every rung of the good, better, best ladder and I think that's a unique kind of positioning for us that I think we're really happy to be in that space. As you may have seen, our 2024 weighted share was up about 10 basis-points and up and even in about half of our cohorts, but we had a very strong improvement in North America with the trend improving as the year went on, especially in diapers, adult and facial tissue. In North-America, personal care was up 80 basis points in weighted share. Consumer overall was up about 10%. And so -- and importantly, in North America, we were up in seven out of eight -- upper even in seven of eight categories. And then in our focus markets, we felt like there are some pretty solid gains beyond just China. Of course, leading off with China, Huggies was up 200 basis points in the quarter. But in the UK, another -- for our third consecutive year, Andrex, which is the [big bath] (ph) tissue brand in the UK, was up another 100 basis points. Kleenex in the UK was up almost 400 basis points in share. In the US, Kleenex was up almost 400 basis points as well. And then we had share growth in Australia and Indonesia, Feminine Care and then importantly in diapers in South Korea, which is a big business for us, we were up almost 400 basis points as well. So I think we're seeing pockets of growth. The thing that maybe you're pointing to, Lauren, is and it does kind of -- it's why we're doing the reorganization that we're doing. I mean the whole point of our new operating model is, we want to move faster to implement our global growth playbook. And we think this rewiring is going to better leverage our scale, brings the best of KC faster and better than any of the individual markets can do on their own. We -- as I mentioned in our Investor Day, we have great technology in our portfolio that most of the world hasn't seen yet. And so, that's kind of why we're doing this organization. And from my chair and I can see what all the teams are doing around the world, I'm seeing the benefits of these focus segments and I'm seeing like us move kind of great ideas faster into different markets. It's also why we're seeing the productivity spike up because we're bringing kind of the big supply-chain ideas faster around different parts of the organization. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Your next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Bonnie. Nelson Urdaneta : Good morning, Bonnie. Nelson Urdaneta : Good morning. I was hoping to get some color on phasing this year. There are several moving parts, including the impact from potential retailer destocking, FX, your private label exit, etc. So\u2026 Mike Hsu : I think we just lost you. I don't know we just left. Holly are we still on. Operator : Yes, Bonnie, your line is live. Mike Hsu : Maybe, Nelson, you want to answer [indiscernible] and then we can follow-up when she is back. Nelson Urdaneta : Okay. So let me let me unpack 2024 and the phasing that we saw because, clearly in 2024 we did see a series of one-time factors that led to sales, not necessarily tracking what you would have seen on the consumer offtake, which by the way, for the year in North America was higher than our sell-in. And it also had an impact on the phasing of earnings across the year. I do think that it is -- we need to recognize what our teams did across the year to manage through all these factors and still manage to deliver a solid full-year that was ahead of our algorithm that we had set-out back at the beginning of the year. The -- by far the most notable item that we faced last year was the retail inventory reductions, largely in the US. And as a reminder, the impact from changes in inventory on organic growth in any given period is really a change on change. And it's a function of shipments versus consumption in the prior year versus what's transcended this year. In 2024, between the restocking that we saw in 2023, and as a reminder, in Q3 of 2023 is when our supply chain largely normalized in the US and got back to full supply. And the trade destocks that we saw throughout 2024 as our service levels came up to the necessary levels where we needed to be operated, that led to a total enterprise impact on the year of around 60 basis points to full-year sales. And it was largely concentrated in the first three quarters of the year, but it caused some hiccups at least on the reported organic growth that you would have seen, not on the consumption. If we think about 2025, which is the phasing you were asking, Bonnie, a few things to keep in mind. Assuming that shipments are in-line with our consumption for the year, we should see less than a 40 basis point tailwind in 2025 versus 2024. In light of the changes in the trade stocks that we lap. So that would be built-in into our outlook. And the important thing to highlight is that our growth is going to be volume and mix-driven all across the year. So that's one of the bits to keep in mind as you look at the phasing. We are planning to build on share momentum, which we saw in 2024. And again, as a reminder, that was a 10 basis point share gain movement gain that we saw in 2024, and we expect that to be at least at that level, if not to accelerate in our outlook. In terms of overall P&L, we expect revenue sales to be largely evenly distributed first-half, second-half and our view on profits is more or less the same as well. We expect that to be more evenly distributed in 2025 than what you would have seen in 2024. Bonnie Herzog : All right. I don't know if you can hear me, but thank you. Mike Hsu : Okay. We got you back. Thank you, Bonnie. [Multiple Speakers] anything else. So\u2026 Bonnie Herzog : No, I think that covers that. I appreciate it. Thank you. Mike Hsu : All right. Operator : Your next question for today is from Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Mike Hsu : Good morning. Anna Lizzul : Hi, good morning. Nelson Urdaneta : Hi, Anna. Anna Lizzul : Thank you so much for the question. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned that in international Personal Care, you're going to continue to be choiceful about the markets where you invest. You had exited markets like Nigeria. Just as you look at the business now, are there any other markets or regions where this might also be the case? And then separately in professional, this picked-up nicely in Q4. Just wondering if you can talk more about the momentum that you're seeing there and any other color on volume expectations here for 2025? Thank you. Mike Hsu : Yes. I'd say overall, we did have a number of business exits, some are business lines like the private-label contract that we talked about, some were the PPE business that we talked about, but some -- we had a couple of markets, Nigeria, was one of them, Bolivia, another. And so, I'd say, overall, we feel very good about our portfolio. We feel good about all the categories we're in, but we are taking steps to make sure that all of our categories can continue to be robust and predictable contributors to growth in our returns. So that said, where we don't see a right to win, I think you'll see with our Brazilian tissue business, we did make a different kind of choice to optimize our participation. We'll continue to be very disciplined about that. Overall, though, we're going to be very disciplined and methodical about how we approach that. And then with regard to professional, yes, we feel very good about the overall position that we're in on professional globally. And I think I did mention there was a little bit of softness in the washroom business in North America. I think our team has put the right plans in-place for this year, and we expect that to continue to improve. And then internationally, I think we've -- we feel like we're making the right steps, growing the volume, growing the share and driving that business in the right direction. Anna Lizzul : All right. Thank you so much. Mike Hsu : Okay. Operator : Your next question is from Peter Grom with UBS. Mike Hsu : Hey, Peter. Nelson Urdaneta : Peter. Peter Grom : Hey guys, good morning. How are you? So I guess I was just -- I was hoping to get some more color on just kind of something you outlined in the prepared remarks, just the lower frequency of product use and due to consumer pressures in Latin-America and parts of Asia. Can you just unpack that a bit? I mean, is that like a broad-based comment? Is that something you're seeing across all CPG categories? Or is that a dynamic that's more specific to the categories where you compete. Mike Hsu : I will -- I'm not looking at the categories in which we don't compete that closely anymore. So I'll confine my remarks to kind of what I'm seeing within our walls. But I would say it's an ongoing kind of, I would say, dynamic in our categories globally. And it happens more in countries that have what we would characterize as informal economies where people, let's say in a market like Peru, people are paid on -- I think it's something like -- 80% of the population is paid on a daily basis, right? And so when you have that, so what happens -- and this happened during COVID and we're seeing it now when economic conditions toughen and some people are working less, right, or earning less, the spending -- the spending moves in that direction because there's no other choice. And so what we -- what happens -- and the reason why it's probably a little bit more unique to our categories is because, let's say, on average, people use four to five diapers a day. If they don't have the money, they still want to be in the category. So they don't just exit the category, but they'll -- instead of using five, they'll go to three, something along those lines. And so we see that when -- in informal economies where economic conditions toughen a little bit and notably that's been in pockets of Latin America and pockets of Southeast Asia more recently, we see that type of behavior. And it happens year-to-year, but I kind of mentioned it because it's happening now and our teams are working through it. Peter Grom : No, that's really helpful. And then just maybe a follow-up just on Bonnie's question on the phasing. So totally hear you, just 50-50 just in terms of profitability earnings. But in terms of growth, it's a pretty different trajectory first-half versus second-half. So maybe just walk-through that a little bit. And I guess maybe what's the degree of confidence or maybe said another way, what's the cushion you've embedded in the back-half outlook? Should some of these external variables like inflation or demand move against you? Thanks. Nelson Urdaneta : Yes, Peter. So let me provide a little bit more color. So a few things. For -- as I said and we put in our prepared remarks, we expect the year to be around 50-50 first half, second half. In terms of growth year-on-year, I mean, it's really against the base and we will be lapping a stronger base, especially particularly in Q1, which is our strongest quarter of the year last year. So that's something that again, as you think about it, that will be having an impact on what you see as the growth. So that will play a factor into it. In terms of the pricing, as I stated before, pricing has been subsided -- subsiding over the course of last year and this year is really going to be all about volume and mix. Pricing as a whole is largely expected to be flat. That's what we've projected as of late with only max at this moment modeled 30 basis-point of contribution from hype inflationary economies to the enterprise. So that's what would play-out in terms of what we're projecting at this stage. Peter Grom : Great. Thanks so much. Mike Hsu : Thanks, Peter. Christopher Jakubik : Maybe we'll take one more question. Operator : Your final question for today is from Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. Mike Hsu : Good morning, Korinne. Korinne Wolfmeyer : Hey, good morning. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could maybe walk us through in a little bit more detail the nuances around the gross margin expectations for 2025 and how we should be thinking about the expansion over the course of the year? And what are the different dynamics to be thinking about in 2025 versus 2024? And then as we -- as that flows down to the operating margin line, how should we thinking about the cadence of marketing and ad spend over the course of the year. Thanks. Nelson Urdaneta : Sure. So a few things on gross margin. Over the last two years, we were very pleased with the job our teams have done in expanding margins. As a reminder, gross margin expanded in 2023 by roughly 300 basis points, 310 basis points and last year 200 basis points. On operating profit margin, in each of the last two years, we expanded the margin by around 150 basis points. Obviously, at a slower pace than gross margin because we accelerated investments, particularly behind the brands. In between 2023, 2024, we stepped up investments by around $250 million in advertising and support of our brands, which is what's supporting our innovation that's helped us turn into a volume mix growth led year in 2024 and what we expect for the year. Going into 2025, we still project gross margins to expand, albeit at a slower pace than what we saw in 2023 and 2024, driven by, one, we still expect to drive productivity. As we said, we -- it's the second year of our program and it will be in the 5% range, a bit lower than what we had in 2024, but still solid delivery of productivity. The contribution from pricing is largely going to be muted as we stated. So that's playing into it, but still we expect gross margin to expand. And then as we -- and we will be also making investments in our supply-chain. 2025 will mark an acceleration in the transformation of the supply-chain with stepped-up projects on-network optimization and in automation in particular. So we'll be reinvesting a significant amount of the productivity into our operations and hence why we expect the gross margins to still expand, but not at the pace of what we saw in the prior two years. Then as we go into operating margin, it's really about the leverage that we'll have because the SG&A savings, the $200 million that we've planned for as part of our Powering Care program will start to kick-in, in a meaningful manner in 2025 and 2026 as our new organizational structure is already in-place as we exited the year. So that's why at this stage we expect operating profit margins to grow ahead of gross margins, which we still expect them to expand, but at a slower pace. Korinne Wolfmeyer : Very helpful. Thank you.
