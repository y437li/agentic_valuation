Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Erin Lampert : Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to McKesson's Fiscal 2014 First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO. John will first provide a business update, and I will return to provide a review of the financial results for the quarter. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. Consistent with the guidance we provided on May 7, we have updated our definition of adjusted earnings to exclude LIFO-related adjustments. We will discuss this update to the presentation of our adjusted earnings in more detail later in the call. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2014 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today, we reported an excellent start to fiscal 2014, with total company revenues of $32.2 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.07. Based on the strong results in the first quarter, we are raising our full year guidance and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $8.05 to $8.35. Before I begin my comments on our business performance for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on 2 items in the presentation of our financial statements. First in the March quarter, we talked about a number of actions to better position the company going forward, including our intention to exit our minority investment in Nadro and our intention to sell our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses. I'm pleased to report that we are making good progress on the planned divestitures, and you will now see these results reported in discontinued operations. And second, as Erin mentioned, we have updated our definition of adjusted earnings to exclude LIFO-related adjustments. We believe this update to our definition of adjusted earnings will better represent the core operating performance of our business. Erin will provide additional background and context for our view of LIFO-related adjustments in her remarks. Moving on to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions had a great start to the year with revenue growth of 5% and adjusted operating profit growth of 27%. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business once again led the way with outstanding results for the quarter. Direct distribution and services revenues increased 8% for the quarter, in line with our expectations for strong growth for the year. We also experienced strong growth across our portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals, driven in part by favorable pricing in the first quarter. As you know, we have a strong and proven track record with our various generics programs. Our management team has done a great job of not only growing our generics footprint but also building our relationships with our manufacturing partners across the globe. McKesson remains well positioned with our customer-focused proprietary programs and the value that we provide across our extensive generic offering. There's no better evidence of the value we provide through our generic programs than the voice of our customer, and our customers continue to purchase more and more of their generics through McKesson. You've heard me mention on a number of occasions how proud I am of the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Our team consistently finds new ways to improve the service and value we provide to all of our customers. A great example of how we connect with our customers is our annual conference, which brings together thousands of independent pharmacy owners and pharmacists from across the country. The conference provides a forum for our customers to exchange best practices that can help them achieve better overall pharmacy health. This year's event focused on helping our customers connect with their patients and other health care stakeholders in entirely new ways through clinical and medication adherence solutions, mobile technologies and enhanced marketing tools. The conference featured continuing education courses, public policy forums and live demonstrations designed to help independent pharmacy owners achieve better business health, better results for patients and create a better future for the community pharmacy. A significant number of Health Mart pharmacy owners were in attendance and we were excited to debut a number of solutions designed to continue to differentiate and drive value for our members, including a new store design, an enhanced physician outreach program and a variety of medication adherence tools. Health Mart owners were able to view new local marketing solutions and mobile applications, both of which are designed to help attract more consumers into Health Mart pharmacies. With more than 3,100 pharmacies across the country, Health Mart has become the franchise model of choice for independent pharmacy owners looking to augment their local relationships with the backing of a strong national brand. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in the first quarter and the great start it had to the fiscal year. Moving now to our Specialty business. We had solid results in the first quarter, and we expect nice revenue and profit growth in this business for the full year. We continue to expand the value we bring to our manufacturing and physician partners through our unique view of the business's specialty providers. At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted the value we bring to our physician and manufacturing partners in an evolving and complex environment. When we help our physician partners, regardless of the setting of care, not only do we have the strongest and most comprehensive offering to community cancer care through our U.S. Oncology Network, but often we continue to manage the outpatient cancer care when physicians affiliate with hospitals. I'm excited about the progress we continue to make in our Specialty business and believe we are well positioned to continue to grow and innovate in this dynamic market. Our Canadian business had a solid start to the year, with results that were in line with our expectations for the first quarter. We continue to expect strong growth in Canada for the full year, driven by new customers signed in the previous fiscal year and a recent customer transition. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. I am pleased with the results in our first full quarter as a combined organization with PSS. We are making strong progress on all of the objectives in our acquisition case, and perhaps most important, our people are excited and engaged about our opportunities to serve our customers going forward. In fact, I just came back from the National Sales Meeting where I met with the newly combined 1,400-person Medical-Surgical sales force, and I have to say, their enthusiasm and spirit for the value we bring to our customers was truly impressive. This was an acquisition anchored in bringing together the best of 2 great organizations, and I'm delighted with the progress and the early results of the combined business and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. Based on the strong performance in Distribution Solutions driven primarily by favorable generic performance in the first quarter, we now expect that adjusted operating margin for Distribution Solutions to approach the midpoint of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points. In summary, we're off to a terrific start to the year in Distribution Solutions. We are extremely well positioned across all of our distribution businesses and we are confident in our improved outlook for the rest of the year. Technology Solutions had a strong first quarter result, with revenues up 9% and adjusted operating profit up 33%. Our adjusted operating margin improved 308 basis points to 17.02%. As you may recall, last quarter I talked about a number of actions we took in Technology Solutions and across the entire enterprise, frankly, to better position the company for fiscal 2014. And I'm encouraged by the early positive results we have seen thus far. For the first quarter, we continued to make steady progress across all of our businesses within Technology Solutions. Our first quarter results benefited from the steady growth profile of our RelayHealth, McKesson Health Solutions and Enterprise and Medical Imaging businesses. Our first quarter results also benefited from achieving some important GA milestones in our Paragon solution. We remain pleased with the progress we continue to make in helping our Horizon customers transition to Paragon. Paragon continues to enjoy high ratings in terms of customer satisfaction and performance across a broad range of customers from the local community hospital setting to large hospital systems. And finally, in our Physician Services and Software businesses, we turned in solid results for the first quarter, aided by our recent acquisition of Med3000. As a result of this solid performance and the removal of the operating results of our International Technology business and Hospital Automation businesses, which we are now reporting as part of discontinued operations, we now expect the adjusting -- adjusted operating margin for the Technology Solutions segment to be at the high end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of mid-teens for the full year. I want to make a few comments about how we are working hard to innovate for our Technology Solutions customers. When I speak to our technology customers, the level of change and complexity they face driven by evolving regulatory and economic realities is simply astonishing. They seek partners like McKesson who can offer a broad view of the changing environment and understand the convergence of the perspectives from hospitals and health systems, payers, providers, pharmacies and, of course, the patient, and they are eager for industry leaders to increasingly deliver solutions that will make the promise of a more connected health care system a reality. We live in exciting times within the health care services and technology industry, and McKesson is well positioned to help our customers succeed. We are proud to be a leader in our industry through our innovative partnerships, particularly the CommonWell Health Alliance. Just to remind everyone, CommonWell Health Alliance is a significant initiative with other leaders in the health care IT industry, who have a common vision and mission to allow patients and their caregivers access to information in a secure and private way anywhere care is offered. The initial goal of the alliance is to develop solutions for patient identity, consent and access management and a common approach to record storage and retrieval, regardless of the core system where the data resides. As you may have seen in a press release issued yesterday, additional leaders in our industry have joined CommonWell Alliance, including Computer Programs and Systems or CPSI and Sunquest Information Systems. They join the founding members of Allscripts, athenahealth, Cerner, Greenway Medical Technologies and McKesson and service provider RelayHealth in the Alliance's work. We're off to a solid start to the year in Technology Solutions, and I'm pleased to see the progress we are making in our core businesses and the investments we are making for the future. In summary, I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our improved outlook for the year. In addition to the strength of our operating performance, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. For the first quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $716 million. And our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $2 billion for fiscal 2014 remains unchanged from our original guidance. I'm happy to report that our Board of Directors has authorized a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting ongoing confidence in the cash flow strength of our business. And we are extremely well positioned to execute on our portfolio approach to capital deployment, to continue to deliver value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Erin, and I will return to address your questions when she finishes. Erin? Erin Lampert : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I will walk you through our first quarter financial results and provide an update on our fiscal 2014 outlook. McKesson reported strong first quarter results and has laid a good foundation for the remainder of fiscal 2014. I will begin with a review of our consolidated results and then provide additional context as I walk through each of the segments in more detail. Let me briefly mention one item that, while it did not impact our adjusted earnings, did impact our GAAP results for the quarter. We continue to work through the remaining AWP cases. As a result of the progress made toward resolving these remaining claims, the litigation reserve has been increased by a pretax charge of $15 million. This charge was recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment and it equates to $0.04 per diluted share. Before I move on, let me also remind you about one other item that impacts the presentation of our financial statements. As previously announced on our May 7 earnings call, we took a number of strategic business realignment actions in our fiscal 2013 fourth quarter. As part of these actions, we are exiting our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses and the results of these businesses are now reported as discontinued operations. My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.07, which excludes 4 items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2. Consolidated revenues increased 5% for the quarter to $32.2 billion. I would remind you of our assumptions for the full year, which call for strong revenue growth in both segments. These assumptions still apply. On this 5% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 23% to $1.9 billion. Recent acquisitions completed in both segments contributed to this result, with both segments achieving healthy adjusted gross profit margins and expansion. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.2 billion were up 18% for the quarter, driven by the impact of acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013. For the full year, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, we continue to expect total company adjusted operating expenses to increase approximately 3% for fiscal 2014. Other income was relatively flat for the quarter at $6 million. Interest expense increased 5% versus the prior year to $59 million, driven primarily by new notes of $1.8 billion issued in late fiscal 2013 and partially offset by the repayment of $500 million in long-term debt in March 2013. For the full year, despite our higher levels of debt, we continue to expect our fiscal 2014 interest expense to be fairly flat versus the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 30.6% is in line with our full year estimate of 31% for the adjusted tax rate for fiscal 2014. I would remind you, however, that this adjusted tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $481 million and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.07. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 232 million. This year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases and our full year assumption of 231 million diluted weighted average shares for fiscal 2014 remains unchanged. Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions' total revenues increased 5% for the quarter to $31.4 billion. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 8% for the quarter to $23 billion, driven by market growth and our mix of business. For the full year fiscal 2014, we continue to anticipate direct revenue growth will rebound strongly from prior year levels, driven by the slowing of brand-to-generic conversions and aided by above-market growth from a handful of our largest customers. Warehouse revenues declined 17% for the quarter, partially driven by a shift to Direct Store Delivery. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis increased 3% for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to anticipate strong growth in this business as we expect to benefit from recent customer wins and a recent customer transition. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 71% for the quarter to $1.4 billion, driven by the impact of the PSS acquisition. Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 25% for the quarter on 5% revenue growth, resulting in a 78-basis-point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. In addition to the PSS acquisition, our first quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from favorable generic performance. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 24% for the quarter, driven by the business acquisitions we made in fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating margin rates for the quarter were 223 basis points, an improvement of 38 basis points versus the prior year. As you've heard us say many times before, given the quarterly variability in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, based on the first quarter performance and our updated outlook for the full year, we now expect adjusted operating margins for Distribution Solutions to approach the midpoint of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were up 9% for the quarter to $805 million. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment increased 9% for the quarter. And here again, you see the impact of the acquisitions we made in the prior year. Technology Solutions' gross R&D spending for the quarter was $113 million, up 10% compared to $103 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 8% versus 7% a year ago. Our first quarter adjusted operating profit was up 33% to $137 million and our first quarter adjusted operating margin rate was 17.02%, an increase of 308 basis points versus the prior year. Before I move on, let me remind you again that the results of our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses are reported as discontinued operations. And we now expect to be within the high end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of mid-teens for fiscal 2014. Said differently, our full year fiscal 2014 outlook for Technology Solutions' operational performance remains unchanged from what we discussed on our May 7 earnings call. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard us discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be impacted by timing, including the timing of payments or what day of the week marks the close of any given quarter. So for receivables, our days sales outstanding remain unchanged at 24 days. Our days sales in inventories of 31 days was flat versus a year ago, and our days sales in payables increased by 3 days to 50 days. These working capital metrics, along with our continued focus on cash generation, resulted in cash flow from operations of $716 million for the quarter. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flows from operation will be approximately $2 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.9 billion and we remain confident in our ability to create shareholder value through the continued use of our portfolio approach to capital deployment. In line with our capital deployment philosophy, as you saw in today's press release, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase to the quarterly dividend. Internal capital spending was $100 million for the quarter, and we continue to expect full year internal capital spending between $400 million and $450 million. Now, I'll turn to our outlook. As John mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2014 guidance on adjusted earnings from continuing operations from our original range of $7.90 to $8.20, to a new range of $8.05 to $8.35. In addition, we now expect $0.75 amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.22 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. And due to the AWP litigation charge we recorded this quarter, we are now assuming $0.04 for litigation reserve adjustments. Now let me take a few moments to provide context for the LIFO-related adjustments that we expect in fiscal 2014. To give you a bit of history, McKesson elected to use the LIFO method of accounting for a majority of its inventory for accounting purposes more than 30 years ago under a tax conformity rule. While our actual LIFO adjustment is calculated at the end of our fiscal year, for interim reporting purposes, we will allocate that adjustment to the quarters. These quarterly estimates can vary significantly based on net product price trends, including brand-to-generic conversions and inventory levels. A LIFO charge is recognized during inflationary periods when the net effect of price increases on products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines. So what does that mean for fiscal 2014? Taking a step back, if you think about the trends we've experienced over the past several years, for our fiscal years 2005 through 2011 our inventories were in a net price deflation period. This net price deflation was driven primarily by the large number of brand-to-generic conversions that occurred and the overall brand and generic pricing trends. During this time period, we also established a lower of cost or market, or LCM reserve, in order to properly value our inventory on our balance sheet at the lower of cost or market. Then in fiscal 2012, we began to see these trends shift, particularly on brand and generic pricing, and our inventories experienced net price inflation. We continue to expect net inflation in our inventories in fiscal 2014 and are also now at a point where our LCM reserves are anticipated to be depleted in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. As a result, we will begin to record quarterly charges based on our estimate of the LIFO inventory charge for the full year. Sitting here today, we expect to record a total net LIFO-related charge between approximately $0.24 to $0.29 by the end of fiscal 2014. As an aside, for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we did not record any LIFO-related charges. Consistent with how we discussed LIFO-related charges on our May 7 earnings call, and again at Investor Day in June, our fiscal 2014 guidance excludes the impact of all LIFO-related adjustments. Additionally, we have now updated our definition of non-GAAP measures to exclude LIFO-related adjustments. We believe that excluding LIFO-related adjustments from our definition of adjusted earnings is a better reflection of the company's core operating performance, consistent with how we internally manage the business, and will provide useful information when comparing our past financial performance to our future financial results. We will, of course, continue to provide all of the GAAP information we have historically provided as noted in Schedules 7 through 9. In thinking about our fiscal 2014 guidance and beyond, it is important to note that regardless of what EPS measure is used, our ability to consistently grow our earnings over the long term remains unchanged. Turning back now to the quarter. To summarize, McKesson delivered another outstanding financial performance, and our first quarter results position us well for the remainder of the fiscal year. The strength of our balance sheet and tremendous cash flow provides us with opportunities to deploy capital to advance our long-term strategic objectives and we are optimistic about our fiscal 2014 outlook. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Lisa, I'll turn it back to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets. Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division : I guess, first question, just on the margins in the distribution space, clearly you beat the street by a lot. I was curious, how much did you beat your own internal budgets by, for the quarter itself, and what were the key drivers there? John H. Hammergren: Well, we state our assumptions with you guys every year, annually, about our expectations for the year. And I think that most of the businesses performed in line with where we thought they were going to be. Clearly, U.S. pharma had a very strong quarter and a nice start to the year. And as we both mentioned, I think that performance was primarily driven by the performance of generics. It helped carry us above what we had expected originally and it helped us deliver a nice solid quarter. Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division : And by that, you're talking about pricing, I guess, John? John H. Hammergren: Well, it was really across the board. Clearly pricing played a role. But we also, I think, executed some very nice growth on our one-stop generics programs and we had some customers that were buying off of our portfolio in a more aggressive way than even we would've anticipated. So I think all in all, it was the overall generic offering that we have and benefited by some price inflation from our suppliers. Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division : Okay. Can you offer an update on the CFO role? John H. Hammergren: We're continuing to make good progress on our search for a replacement for our CFO. I have to once again thank Nigel Rees for the great work he's doing as Interim CFO. He's been a long-tenured executive, 12 years with us, and we have just a terrific financial organization. As you noticed, here, we've got Erin really stepping into Jeff's shoes as it relates to this conference call and the preparation for this call. And the depth of the financial organization is really showing as we go through this period of transition. I'm hopeful that we will make quick progress on the selection of a replacement, and we'll be able to move on with the kind of quality which you've expected from us. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I was wondering if maybe you could just talk about, John, in the quarter, or Erin, what -- you talked about it being unusually strong, but how much of this was pull-forward from other quarters versus what we've seen historically? And what is your outlook around drug distribution as we move forward, just given what we've seen in this first quarter? John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly it was a very strong start to the quarter and -- or for the quarter and the year, and we're really pleased with our results. You can see in that we've taken our guidance up for the year that we do believe that this outperformance in the quarter is not an entire pull-forward of future quarters. Having said all of that, there are 9 months left in this year and we have a significant dependence, as you know, on brand price inflation. And much of that, we anticipate, will come in the latter half of the year. So it's really too early to call success, but I think the ability for us to take the guidance up at least early in the year like we have this quarter is some indication of our view of the strength of the business. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then, John, I guess, my follow-up question would be that in the past, we've talked about international expansion, and clearly, things are going pretty well in Canada, but you've exited Mexico. Can you just give us an updated thought on global purchasing and where McKesson stands on thoughts around getting into other areas of the world from a distribution perspective? John H. Hammergren: Well, there's really 2 questions there. One is the question of Global Sourcing and our -- the scale and buying power and the ability for the team to execute. I think, once again, the strength of our performance in generics where most of the scale -- or I should say, the scale matters most, is evidenced by the fact that we continue to execute very well there. And it really is a combination of not only important scale but the ability to be adroit in terms of opportunities and take advantage of our relationships and to build value both for our customers and our suppliers. And we've been doing the Global Sourcing thing now for a long time and have built a significant amount of expertise in it. As it relates to distribution in other markets, clearly we have done a nice job in Canada. Our position there has continued to perform well over many years. And we show evidence of our ability to manage beyond the borders of the United States. Having said that, our disciplined approach to capital deployment remains and we've built a strong track record of doing smart things with our shareholders' money. And the first thing is that things have to make financial sense and strategic sense before we move forward and we have to be able to, obviously, feel we can execute against the opportunities that are in front of us. So we think scale is important, but executable scale and a simplicity to the approach, I think, is very important. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : My first question is on the IT side. Obviously, it looks that now with the new geographic concentration the fact that you've exited, discontinued some of the International Technology business is helping to improve the margin. So as we think just longer term, should we think of this as kind of like a new level of profitability for the IT segment? John H. Hammergren: Erin. maybe you can take that one. Erin Lampert : Sure. Well, Ricky, as we've tried to highlight on today's call, our operational assumptions for the Technology Solutions segment for the full year really remains unchanged. And what you see in the way that we've guided to our expectation to be at the upper end of our long-term margin range is a reflection of some of that change in mix that you see in the business. John H. Hammergren: So just to further that, I think the -- clearly, the mix change we've experienced is an important aspect here. The business also performed very well in the first quarter, and we're pleased with the operational condition of the business, albeit it's early in the year. And then lastly, I think Erin provided pretty specific guidance related to -- that the expectation for the year is to be at the high end. So I think that the quarter's result, I wouldn't call it as a baseline, but we're clearly going to be well above where we were in prior years as a result of the transition out of these 2 businesses and the continued strength of the business. So I think we've taken it from low to mid-teens to a new range, and I think you should assume that that's the new baseline. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then just to clarify, the $7.90 to $8.20 guidance, did that include the LIFO charge that you specified? Erin Lampert : Thanks, Ricky. This is Erin. So, no, when we gave guidance back on May 7, we tried to be very clear and transparent that, that original guidance range did not, in fact, include assumptions related to LIFO. So what you see in terms of the comparison of the original range, and then, of course, our updated range is an apples-to-apples comparison. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I've been dialing back and forth here on a few different calls, but was there any update on the level of accretion that you expect in this fiscal year from the PSSI transaction? John H. Hammergren: Steven, we did not provide an update, but I can provide an update. I think the level of accretion we expect this year is in line with what we said at the time we did the transaction in that $0.20 to $0.25 range. Clearly, we believe there are some long-term synergies that will be available to us as we get to the outer years of these integrations. But we do believe the business is performing at or above the expectations that we had coming into this. And I also mentioned how pleased I am with the energy level in the business and how well they're performing thus far. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I wanted to just touch on Medical. I know you mentioned that the integration sounds like it's going well with PSS, but I was wondering what you're seeing on the core medical business. On the acute care side, there's been some negative data points throughout earnings here. I was wondering if there was any spillover into the physician space or are you still seeing pretty healthy growth there? John H. Hammergren: Well, as you know, we sold our acute care business, Robert, some time ago and so we don't have a lot of exposure to acute care or inpatient growth rates. We increasingly have a footprint in organizations that have acute care as part of their mix, these large IDNs that are buying physicians and we're doing extremely well in maintaining and growing our physician business as those acquisitions take place by these large hospital systems. We still see growth in our alternate site markets in that 5% plus or minus kind of range. Remember, we are very well positioned in both the physician market, as well as long-term care. And I'd say exceptionally well positioned also in our Homecare businesses. And so I think we're in the right part of the market from a Medical-Surgical perspective and those businesses continue to perform in line with our expectations. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. I understood the current footprint. I was just wondering, given some of the negative data points in the acute side, if you had seen any in the ambulatory side. It doesn't sound like you have. On the share shifts within the retail independents, since it's something that's come up a little bit, with us at least, have you guys noticed any significant market share changes amongst that client base? John H. Hammergren: Well, these -- the market base is extremely diverse, so you don't see a lot of trends in these businesses very easily because it takes a long time for independent customers to make enough -- enough of them to make any decisions one way or the other to affect sort of the underlying share statistics. Having said all of that, we continue to evolve our programs and focus on adding a significant amount of value to our existing relationships and to provide a platform that really is attractive to our customers where they know they can have a long-term partner that's focused to work alongside them to improve their performance on many different dimensions, not just the cost of distribution but the profitability of their stores. So I think we're very well positioned to continue to grow nicely in the independent space, and obviously, a lot of that is just continuing to earn the privilege of serving our customers in a broader context. Operator : We'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : John, I apologize, but I need to ask one more question on the margins and distribution. When you guys hosted your Analyst Day last month, I think you talked about the manufacture economics on both branded and generics were better than what you thought. And you thought it was a little bit premature at that point to determine if it was just a timing shift or really a trend change in terms of what's going on with the manufacturers. Maybe you could give us a little bit more details as to what you're seeing at the manufacturer level that's maybe translating into such decent margins for you guys? John H. Hammergren: Well, I think the branded portion of our profit has remained relatively in line with where we expected it to be, slightly -- maybe slightly ahead. But clearly, we've a lot of year left as it relates to those branded relationships and how we're paid in this. I might remind those of you that are sort of new to this, those relationships are kind of predetermined and so the issue is really around the timing associated with those value-creating events of prices with branded manufacturers. On the generics side, we did have very strong performance in our portfolio in the quarter. And to your point, I think it's a little bit premature to call any of the things that we saw from an upside perspective on -- as a trend change. Clearly, our business operations, I think, you can count on continuing to be there and then hopefully we'll continue to have momentum in the way we execute on our generic opportunities. However, on the brand side, we are a little dependent on how those -- excuse me, on the price side, we're a little bit dependent on how those generic manufacturers behave over time, and I think it's really too early to make an industry call relative to trends. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. If I -- maybe if I could just follow up on your Specialty business. It seems to be that everything is going well there from both the revenue and margin perspective. Obviously, one of your competitors has called out some issues in that business, and I understand the businesses are not apples-to-apples to be compared. But if you think about some of the things going on there, whether it be a little bit more restrictive labeling or transition of the point of care or sequestration having an impact on the community, oncologists, I mean, I'm just surprised that you're not seeing any of that impact to your business or maybe you are? John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly we see the same stresses on our customer base as exhibited in the entire industry. We are very concerned about the reimbursement pressure that our oncologists are facing and, clearly, we are heavily engaged to make sure that we speak on their behalf and on our behalf to make sure that the reimbursement that goes on in that marketplace stays where it needs to stay and that they're adequately paid for the services they provide. We believe community oncology still provides the lowest cost and best quality alternative in the marketplace. As to our business, I can't really speak for the whole industry. Clearly, the minor variations that may exist relative to reimbursement are really covered in the guidance range that we provided. So we don't think that we will experience something driven by reimbursement alone that will cause us to fall outside of the guidance that we've provided, and so relatively nominal effects, as it relates to what we're trying to do overall. And last I would say that our business model is quite different than our competitors in this marketplace. And you'll notice a pattern here in all of our discussions in our attempt to add value to our relationships in a way that's difficult to price-compete against. And when we're thinking about the total value we can deliver to oncologists in this country, it really is unmatched in that we can help them on almost every dimension of their practice. Including expanding into radiology and other types of service offerings, clearly helping them with getting on the contracts with the payors, helping to become more productive and efficient. All of those things really allow us to have a conversation with a customers that's in significant stress about how they might partner with McKesson to improve their performance. So I do think the market trend may be slightly stressed as a result of reimbursement changes. Clearly, our customers are feeling it. But if we do this properly, McKesson will provide a great vehicle to help them out of the challenge that they face and that we face together. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just a quick one for Erin. Is this the D&A run rate that we should see for the rest of the year? And then maybe for John, just a bit more direct. I can't believe the ongoing debate on Celesio that we're seeing in the media. Is that good for your stock? Is there anything that you could say more directly to that business model, why it might fit, why it would not fit your model? John H. Hammergren: Well, let me take the Celesio part of that question, then Erin can address the first part of your question. I think that you never know what goes on in the media, particularly in Europe. I'm not that familiar with how these bankers get engaged, and what they might say or might not say and why they would say them or not say them. We've seen noise in these markets before and speculation before, and you just don't know what the motives might be and what's real and what's not real. Clearly, the concern as a shareholder at McKesson, people should have is does that company have the proper scale to compete, do we have the proven track record to use that scale in a way that gives us the best value of delivery to our customers and to the manufacturers we partner with and are we doing it in a way that is intelligent use of the capital that's been entrusted to us by our shareholders? So I think that international expansion clearly can provide scale on some dimensions. The question is it scale that's actionable, can you do something with that buying power? Is it really truly in the control of the distributor and what capital do you have to deploy to do it, and what is it -- how does it translate into a synergy that's worth buying when you add additional complexity. So what you should take away from this, frankly, is we're not closed to any ideas. Our job is to evaluate ideas, including M&A ideas, in a very aggressive and intelligent way. At the same time, you should take away from this, we're not going to be chasing something that somebody else has done or thinks is a good idea, or chasing investment bankers and media on opportunities that we have not clearly determined are in our best interest. So I would dismiss what's in the media just from a standpoint of you just never know where it's headed and why. Erin Lampert : And, Bob, to address your question on D&A, on the materials that we provided today. Obviously, we've provided updated assumptions on amortization based on the acquisitions that are closed at this time. And I also provided some update, or actually talked about our full year capital spending, which is in line with our original expectations. So I think on the depreciation side, what you see our first quarter run rate is a reasonable approximation of the full year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ross Muken with ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : John, you mentioned some progress in the IT business on the GA front, maybe elaborate a bit there. And in general, it seems like a pretty stable environment on the software side but you continue to do well in most of the transaction businesses. Obviously, you're much happier with the performance there. Do you feel like getting rid some of those underperforming pieces will help remove some of the distraction there as well? John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, I think the business is able to focus more in the new portfolio and the way the portfolio has been organized. And clearly, the financial condition of the business is -- and its improvement is more apparent as it relates to what we reported in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress at Paragon with the general availability of several of their new modules and that did allow us to, frankly, recognize some revenue that may be slightly pulled forward from the rest of the year's expectation. But I think that we're really -- we're pleased with the progress. And probably as important, as you know, Paragon had commitments to customers related to future delivery and in many ways, evidence of the ability to us -- for us to develop our way to a complete offering that can compete in the marketplace. And this is additional evidence of the development teams' expertise at Paragon and our ability to hit those requirements. So I am pleased with the condition of the business. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And maybe just quickly on Canada. We saw some consolidation up there in terms of 2 of the dispensers. I mean, if that's a trend that continues, I mean, what's your thought about what that means for your business and positioning up there? John H. Hammergren: We have a very strong long-term relationship with one of the consolidators that was talked about in the quarter, and that's Loblaws. We are the distributor partner for them. And so watching our partners grow is a positive thing for us. Consolidation carries an opportunity and also carries a threat. The threat is that you've got to continue to be refined in your approach and cost effective and add tremendous value as your customers get more and more scale. But on the other hand, it also provides an opportunity for us to bring expertise in a wider-ranging array of abilities across a stronger, or bigger footprint that our customers may be accumulating or amassing. So I think we've done well in worlds that are consolidating in both the U.S. and Canada. Operator : Our last question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Swann. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Can you just comment, please, on your hospital IT customers' conversion process from Horizon over to Paragon? Our data is coming back pretty positive in terms of your retention of those Horizon clients. I mean, I imagine these Paragon GA items have -- are associated with that? John H. Hammergren: Thank you for the question. Yes, our data would also indicate that our transition of Horizon customers to Paragon is ahead of the expectations that we had. And the customers that have made these early decisions to make that transition I think have done so with a view that Paragon is the platform of choice, both in terms of its features and function, but also in its total cost of ownership. And as you point out, the further development of the product line and the GAs that we've announced helped solidify the customer's view that this is the product of choice going forward. So we are pleased with the progress. That's not to say that we don't have more work to do and that there aren't existing Horizon customers that are still asking themselves the question of whether or not they should invest in somebody else's platform or if they should take advantage of this unique opportunity to convert to Paragon. So we're hopeful that we will continue to make that progress. I want to thank you, operator, and I want to also thank all of you on the call for your time today. I'm extremely pleased with our strong first quarter performance and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. And I also want to recognize the outstanding performance of all of our employees and their contribution to these great results. And I'll hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin? Erin Lampert : Thank you, John. I have a preview of an upcoming event. On November 12, we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Care Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. We will release second quarter earnings in late October. Thank you for your attention today and goodbye. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded, and if you have any objections, you may now disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Erin Lampert : Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2014 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and I'm delighted to welcome James Beer, McKesson's recently appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will provide the business update, who will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 9 :30 a.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results : acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2014 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren: Thank you, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Late last night in the West Coast and early this morning for those of you on the East Coast, McKesson announced our agreement to acquire Celesio for a total consideration of approximately $8.3 billion. McKesson and Celesio will unite to form a global leader in healthcare services. Many of you are quite familiar with Celesio, but for those of you that are not, I want to take a moment to introduce you to this great company. Celesio is a leader in pharmaceutical wholesaling with a presence in key markets across Europe and Brazil and an extensive network of retail pharmacies that are either owned or a part of a strong collaboration model throughout Europe. This transaction brings together the strengths and expertise of 2 leaders in global healthcare with complementary geographic footprints, shared values and a history as a trusted partner to customers dating back approximately 180 years. The United States, Canadian and European healthcare services markets have been experiencing a number of forces driving change across healthcare delivery. Demographics are driving increased utilization. Governments and other payers are demanding more efficient and effective delivery of care, and consumers are more engaged in all aspects of the care continuum driven by access to information. In response to some of the larger forces for change in healthcare, the industry has evolved rapidly, marked by convergence between segments and increased globalization. The combination of McKesson and Celesio will be well positioned to meet the increasing global nature of the pharmaceutical supply chain and continue to enhance our customers' ability to deliver better and more efficient healthcare services. We are very excited about this transaction and the value it will bring to our customers, our supply chain partners, the employees of both organizations and our shareholders. Customers will benefit from increased supply chain efficiency, enhanced global sourcing and a broad array of innovative technology and business services. Our manufacturing partners and suppliers will benefit from access to new markets and the efficiency of a global distribution partner. And the employees of McKesson and Celesio will benefit from being part of an even stronger and larger global company. So let me take a moment to walk through some of the important elements of the agreements we have announced today. McKesson will acquire the Haniel Group's entire stake in Celesio, representing approximately 50.01% of the outstanding shares of the company for EUR 23 per share in cash. McKesson has also agreed to launch parallel voluntary public tender offers for the remaining publicly traded shares and outstanding convertible bonds of Celesio. This transaction has been approved by McKesson's Board of Directors, the Haniel Group's Supervisory Board and Celesio's Supervisory Board. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and certain closing conditions, including the acquisition by McKesson of a minimum of 75% of the shares of Celesio on a fully diluted basis. James will provide more color on some of the financial elements of the transaction in his remarks, but I would highlight a couple of things. First, the value and synergy in this transaction will happen over time. By the fourth year, following the completion of the required steps to obtain operating control of Celesio, we expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. To give you a sense of the strength and scale of the business, the combined company is expected to have annual revenues in excess of $150 billion and more than 81,500 employees worldwide, along with operations in over 20 countries. The business will report to Paul Julian, Executive Vice President and Group President of McKesson Distribution Solutions. Paul has skillfully led the Distribution Solutions segment of McKesson for the past 13 years, where he has overseen a period of tremendous revenue growth and profit expansion in our distribution businesses. These businesses have risen to become leaders in their markets, driven by Paul's focus on operational excellence and building the best leadership team in the industry. In summary, we have a great track record of deploying capital wisely, and the acquisition of Celesio continues this trend. The acquisition creates a strong platform for growth, driving benefits for our customers, our manufacturing partners, our employees and our shareholders. Before I move on to our business results for the quarter, I want to take a moment to welcome James Beer to his first quarterly earnings conference call with McKesson. It has certainly been an exciting few weeks since James joined the company earlier this month, and I'm delighted to have an executive of his caliber and experience to lead our finance organization. James has enjoyed a successful CFO tenure at 2 prominent organizations, American Airlines and Symantec. And I know his experience and perspective will add tremendous value, as we complete the acquisition of Celesio over the coming year. Turning now to our results for the quarter. Today, we reported strong second quarter results with total company revenues of $33 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.27. Based on our performance for the first half of the fiscal year and our improved outlook for the year, we are raising our full year guidance and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $8.40 to $8.70. Now I will turn our -- turn to our operations and provide some brief highlights from both segments of our business. Distribution Solutions revenue grew 11% for the quarter, and adjusted operating profit grew 18%. Within our Distribution Solutions segment, our U.S. pharmaceutical business had another quarter of outstanding results. Direct distribution and services revenues increased 13% for the quarter, consistent with our expectations for strong growth for the year. The quarter benefited from growth across our portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals, where we are extremely well positioned with our customer-focused proprietary programs and the value we provide across our extensive generic offering. We continue to benefit from more of our customers choosing to buy more of their generics from McKesson, strong compliance to our generic programs and services, and strong growth in our OneStop Generics program. In the second quarter, we continue to experience favorable pricing on certain products in our generics portfolio, principally driven by a few products where there has been supply disruption. While we are confident in the continued strong performance of our total portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products and programs and the value we provide to our customers, it is difficult to predict larger environmental factors such as supply disruptions and manufacture behavior. That being said, in the updated guidance we provided to you today, we have assumed generic performance continues ahead of our original expectations for the second half of our fiscal year but at a moderated pace compared to the first half of the fiscal year. In summary, I'm proud of the performance of our U.S. pharmaceutical business, which continues to benefit from the excellence of our global sourcing capabilities and our relentless focus on operational excellence. Our specialty business had solid results in the second quarter, and we continue to strengthen our position with our customers and our physician partners. We also saw strong growth in our Canadian business where revenues grew 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued growth in our core business and growth from new customers. Our team in Canada has done a tremendous job of growing the business and expanding the value we provide to our customers. We have grown steadily and profitably in Canada over many years, even though the nature of the market and the role of government in healthcare are different from what we experienced here in the United States. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of the Canadian business in the first half of the fiscal year. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. We continue to make good progress with the acquisition of PSS, and I'm pleased with the solid results in the first half of our fiscal year. I recently joined the Medical-Surgical team at the Health Industry Distributors Association Annual Meeting. At the meeting, I had a chance to speak with some of our suppliers and hear directly about the expanded opportunities and efficiencies they experienced working with the combined Med-Surg and PSS teams. We remain on track to deliver the value we had envisioned in the business case, and I'm very pleased with our team in the way they have executed against this plan, always remaining focused on taking care of our customers as the top priority. In summary, we've had strong results in Distribution Solutions in the first half of the year. We are excited about the opportunities in front of us and confident in our outlook for the rest of the year. Turning now to our Technology Solutions segment. We had solid results in the second quarter with revenues up 8% and adjusted operating profit up 23% over the prior year. Our adjusted operating margin improved 214 basis points to 16.82%. We continue to benefit from a number of actions we took in the Technology Solutions segment and across the entire enterprise to better position the company for fiscal 2014. Second quarter results in Technology Solutions also benefit from a number of acquisitions we completed in fiscal 2013. The acquisitions we completed last year, along with some of the internal changes to our organization, were all designed to better focus our efforts on our customers' most important priorities : empowering strategic and point of care decisions through business intelligence solutions; preparing for new risk-based payment models, better known as population health; providing tools and services to support value-based reimbursement; and enabling connectivity across the care continuum through interoperability. We continue to make good progress on all of these investments and initiatives, and I'm pleased with the results of our Technology Solutions business in the first half of the fiscal year. Our core businesses are performing well against our plan for the fiscal year, and we continue to invest in the solutions our customers will need to thrive going forward. In summary, it's an exciting time to be at McKesson. Our businesses are performing very well. And today's announcement of our agreement to acquire Celesio makes us very well positioned to continue our leadership in healthcare, in the supply chain and in increasing global markets in which we serve. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James Beer : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John mentioned, McKesson's second quarter results represent another strong quarter of operating performance across the business. Based on this performance and our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2014, we have updated our full year guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations from our previous range of $8.05 to $8.35 to a new range of $8.40 to $8.70 per diluted share. The Celesio acquisition represents an exciting step for McKesson, and we are confident this acquisition will only further compliment the value we bring to our customers, manufacturing partners and shareholders. Today, I will walk you through our second quarter consolidated financial results and provide an update on our fiscal 2014 outlook. And at the end of my remarks, I will review the key financial aspects of the transaction we announced today with Celesio. My remarks will focus on our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.27, which excludes 4 items : the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Before I begin, let me provide a brief update on our divestiture activity. As previously announced on our May 7 earnings call, we discussed our intention to exit our International Technology business, our Hospital Automation business and our minority interest in Nadro. This quarter, we completed the transaction to sell our minority interest in Nadro, and subsequent to the close of the quarter, we executed a definitive agreement to sell our Hospital Automation business. We continue to make good progress on the sale of our International Technology business and expect to provide an update later in the fiscal year. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues increased 11% for the quarter to $33 billion. On this 11% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 22% to $2.1 billion. Solid operating performance in the current year and results from acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013 contributed to both segments achieving healthy adjusted gross profit margins. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.2 billion were up 23% for the quarter, driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013. For the full year, excluding the impact of these acquisitions, we expect total company adjusted operating expenses to increase approximately 4%. Other income was relatively flat for the quarter at $9 million. Interest expense increased 7% versus the prior year to $59 million, driven primarily by $1.8 billion in notes issued in late fiscal 2013 and partially offset by the repayment of $500 million in long-term debt in March 2013. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 33% is up from the prior year due to a number of discrete items and a slightly less favorable mix of income. I would remind you that adjusted tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. While our mix of domestic to foreign income has become less favorable this quarter, we are expecting a number of favorable discrete tax items during the balance of our fiscal year. We continue to expect a full year estimate of 31% for our fiscal 2014 adjusted tax rate. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $529 million, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.27. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 233 million. This year's earnings per share number was also aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases. Given the planned acquisition of Celesio, we expect our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2014 to be 233 million, as we now expect to not repurchase shares during the second half of our fiscal year. Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Distribution Solutions total revenues increased 11% for the quarter to $32.2 billion. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 13% for the quarter to $23.7 billion. Warehouse revenues decreased 10% for the quarter, primarily driven by a shift to direct store delivery. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis increased 14% this quarter from the prior year, mainly driven by market growth and recent customer wins. Turning now to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 68% for the quarter to $1.5 billion, driven by the PSS acquisition and market growth. As John mentioned earlier, the combined business continues to perform very well. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 24% for the quarter on 11% revenue growth, resulting in a 56-basis-point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. In addition to the PSS acquisition, our second quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from favorable performance in our generics pharmaceutical portfolio. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 31% for the quarter, primarily driven by the acquisitions we made in fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating margin rates for the quarter were 257 basis points, an improvement of 15 basis points versus the prior year. Given the quarterly variability in the segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, based on the first half performance and our updated outlook for the full year, we expect the adjusted operating margin for Distribution Solutions to be above the midpoint of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were up 8% for the quarter to $785 million. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment increased 7% for the quarter, mainly due to the impact of the acquisitions we made in the prior year. Technology Solutions gross R&D spending for the quarter was $110 million, up 3% versus the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 6% versus 9% a year ago. Second quarter adjusted operating profit was up 23% to $132 million, and the second quarter adjusted operating margin was 16.82%, an increase of 214 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the contribution from acquisitions completed during fiscal 2013 and favorable performance across the segment. For the year, we continue to expect to be within the high end of our mid-teens long-term adjusted operating margin goal. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard us discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be impacted by timing, including the timing of payments or what day of the week marks the close of any given quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our days sales outstanding was 24 days versus 26 days a year ago. Our days sales in inventories of 31 days is down from 32 days a year ago, and our days sales in payables decreased by 2 days to 48 days. We generated cash flow from operations of $813 million. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect the cash flow from operations will be approximately $2 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3 billion with $1.6 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $197 million for the first half of fiscal 2014, and we continue to expect full year internal capital spending between $400 million and $450 million. Now let's turn to our outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2014 guidance from our prior range of $8.05 to $8.35 to a new range of $8.40 to $8.70 per diluted share from continuing operations. In addition, based on acquisitions closed to date, we expect to exclude from GAAP earnings $0.76 in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.23 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude $0.18 for litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments of $0.37 to $0.43. Now let me take a few moments to talk about the acquisition of Celesio. As John mentioned in his remarks, the process to complete the acquisition is different from acquisitions McKesson has done in the past. There are a few key steps in the process that are important to understand. McKesson has entered into a stock purchase agreement with the Haniel Group, the majority shareholder in Celesio. McKesson has agreed to acquire the Haniel Group's stake in Celesio, currently representing 50.01% of the total outstanding shares of the company. McKesson has also entered into a business combination agreement with Celesio. Pursuant to these agreements, McKesson will launch parallel public tender offers for the remaining publicly traded shares of Celesio for EUR 23 per share and for Celesio's outstanding convertible bonds due in 2014 and 2018 at the price corresponding to the value of the underlying shares implied by a EUR 23 per share offer price. The offer price per bonds due in 2014 equates to EUR 53,117.78 per bond on a maturity value of EUR 50,000. The offer price per bonds due in 2018 equates to EUR 120,798.32 per bond on a maturity value of EUR 100,000. We expect these tender offers to commence during our fiscal third quarter and conclude during our fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2014. Both the stock purchase from the Haniel Group and the tender offers are subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the acquisition by McKesson of a minimum of $0.75 of outstanding shares of Celesio on a fully diluted basis. Upon the successful conclusion of the tender offers, we will consolidate the financial results of Celesio, and our earnings will reflect our proportionate share of Celesio's earnings. We estimate this transaction to be $1 to $1.20 accretive in the first 12 months following the successful completion of the tender offers. This estimated range of accretion assumes we achieve 100% ownership of the shares of Celesio at the conclusion of the tender offers. Of course, the final range of accretion will depend on the actual results of the tender offers, the permanent financing structure selected and the estimated operating results of Celesio. Also, to be clear, we have not included any earnings from Celesio in our updated fiscal 2014 outlook. As I said before, we will begin to consolidate the results of Celesio in proportion to the actual shares tendered when the tender offer process concludes. Subsequent to the conclusion of the tender process, there are a number of required steps we are obligated to follow to obtain operating control of Celesio. We expect to complete these steps during fiscal 2015. Synergies will be achieved over time. By the fourth year following completion of the required steps to obtain operating control, we expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. Now let's discuss the transaction's financing. We expect to use our existing offshore cash to fund a portion of the transaction. We also expect to use a bridge facility to fund the balance of the tendered securities. The permanent financing structure will be determined by the timing and the number of Celesio shares and convertible bonds tendered. Additionally, McKesson is committed to maintaining its status as an investment-grade-rated company in considering the permanent financing structure. At this time, we intend to enter into financial instruments to partially hedge the foreign currency risk associated with Celesio's enterprise value. In the transaction announcement you have seen today, we have assumed a euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of $1.35. To give you a simple way to think about this, every 1% change in the U.S. dollar euro exchange rate represents approximately $80 million in Celesio's total enterprise value. We consider many financial metrics when evaluating acquisition opportunities. And we believe this acquisition will provide a strong return on capital for McKesson's shareholders. In summary, this is a very exciting time to be at McKesson. The core businesses are performing exceptionally well as demonstrated by our results in the first half and our confidence in the improved outlook for the full year. In addition, we expect the acquisition of Celesio to drive value for our customers, our manufacturing partners and of course, our shareholders. Thank you, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : James, welcome. Nice way to start off your tenure. John, understanding that there's lot of changes in the global healthcare distribution landscape right now, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit or share with us your thoughts around the timing and why this transaction was right for McKesson to pursue right now. John H. Hammergren: Well, thank you for the question, Robert. Clearly, these things have to be somewhat opportunistic, and when the opportunities arise, you have to be prepared to feel confident in your ability to execute. And so we have been traveling to Europe for my -- almost my entire tenure, and we've built our global sourcing businesses around the globe. And we've known the people who have been competing in Europe for quite some time. I think our success, both here in the United States as well as in Canada, relative to building relationships with our manufacturing partners, helping to deliver better supply chain efficiency and better sourcing power with relative to McKesson, has given us confidence that we can continue to take these skills and assist Celesio's tremendous management team and focus in the countries with a global platform. So as you mentioned in the beginning of your question, the world is more rapidly globalizing and consolidating, and clearly, McKesson needs to continue to have a leadership role around the world. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. I guess, just my follow-up would be around the synergies. I'm sure there's a lot of work that went into assessing the potential synergy opportunities of these 2 combined companies. And specifically as it relates to generic procurement, I was hoping you'd give us a little bit of detail around the process you undertook in assessing the potential generic purchasing synergies. And then, I guess, just on the back of that more immediately, just so we understand, will McKesson and Celesio be purchasing generics as a single entity right away? John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, as James highlighted in his discussions, that we have to get to operational control of the company before we can begin to combine our operations on a global basis. That doesn't mean that we can't begin to lay the groundwork today to be prepared for what we believe will be a successful transaction as we move forward. We have, I think, demonstrated not only this quarter but also in previous quarters and years our continued growing ability to manage the supply chain in a way that's effective for the partners that we've worked with over decades to grow the value we deliver to them in return. And I think that the sourcing capability that we have, both in generics as well as our relationships with the branded manufacturers and clearly, our strength with Northstar, are all proven capabilities. And we've, over the years, been able to transition that capability beyond the U.S. into our Canadian business to where, frankly, the markets are probably more European in their style and in their makeup than they are even here in the U.S. And we are able to take that supply chain expertise into a market that has a different regulatory and reimbursement regimen. So as we evaluated the opportunity in Celesio, clearly, we needed to look at individual markets. It's not a company that is operating the same way in each market, and we looked at the tremendous tenure and the track record of a company. It's nearly 180 years old. We met with the country managers and talked about how they're executing in their markets and got very confident -- comfortable and confident that this is not necessarily an operational turnaround that's going to require us to go in and fix the current business day to day in these markets. The Lloyds brand continues to grow in presence. They've had a European pharmacy network strategy that's building out nicely, and clearly, they've had an operational excellence program that is working well. It's not to say that we can't provide some things that will help. But I want to be clear on the fact that we have tremendous confidence in the Celesio management team's ability to continue to manage in the business. So what we're primarily we're focused on, as you point out, is the global supply chain synergies that we've outlined in this announcement, and we believe that based on our previous experience doing this and where we see the markets evolving and what others are doing in the marketplace, we're very comfortable and confident that we can reach these numbers. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Tom Gallucci with FBR. Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : I guess, just sort of piggybacking on that last synergy question, are all the synergies anticipated or primarily anticipated to be coming from purchasing? Or are there any other buckets that we should be thinking about as well as what is the synergy target that you sort of got implied in that initial $1 to $1.20 of accretion in the first 12 months? John H. Hammergren: Well, the principal and primary driver of our synergies is going to be the supply chain and sourcing activity that we outlined. I think it's probably fair to say, James, that the accretion number comes faster than the synergy numbers. So James, maybe you can talk about that. James Beer : Yes, that's right. So the accretion range that I spoke about, the $1 to $1.20, that begins upon the completion of the successful tender. And we're looking for that to occur in Q4 of fiscal '14. Now based upon the process that we abide by under German law, it will be several months or so before we would actually be able to take operation control. So we'd be of the order of halfway through fiscal '15 before we were to able to exercise that operating control and have any access to synergies. And then I think it would be a case of synergies building gradually over that 4-year period that I spoke about such that in year 4, we'd be up of that $275 million to $325 million annual range, so quite a gradual ramp, a modest impact on fiscal '15. Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : And then on the follow-up, John, I think during your prepared remarks, you mentioned that some customers were buying more generics through you. Can you expand on that comment and what you're seeing out there today? Do you anticipate there's the potential that some of the very big customers may be doing more and more through you or that there's even the opportunity to do something sort of like Walgreens and with ABC and take over the distribution entirely for some of the big customers, sort of the way this landscape is evolving? John H. Hammergren: Well, you're clearly -- it's difficult to project what customers are going to do and what behavior they might have and what might be attractive to them. I would say that there's tremendous evidence in our track record that we've been able to move upstream with our customers, and ever larger customers are beginning to count on McKesson from a logistics perspective and a sourcing perspective. I'm carefully selecting my words here that logistics is certainly a part of the value that we can deliver to a customer. So even the very largest customers would probably benefit from our logistics expertise, and we can provide efficiency through that capability. The sourcing activity is actually the power we bring to a discussion with a customer relative to our scale and size and our ability to attract great manufacturing partners and help them gain market acceptance through their partnership with McKesson. That's a little bit different activity than truly the logistics. The key in our strategy is to marry the 2 together and bring that combined value to our customers. And having said all of that, clearly, the more scale we have, the larger our presence, the easier we are to do business with from a supply chain perspective and the more efficient we become globally and we can become a sort of a one-stop shop for people to create global partnerships, those partners can grow with us through those relationships, which makes it easier for them. So as we gain scale, I think our value proposition to more sophisticated and larger customers continues to improve, and we remain optimistic that we will continue to grow our generics franchise in this way. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : John, should we assume further international deals now and drug retail and distribution are now part of the equation? And then just the other question, would be just -- with $8 billion going out the door, you cite some synergies, but how do you protect that investment from some of the macro pressures that made some of these international distribution models distasteful to you in the past? John H. Hammergren: That's a good question. Now clearly, I think one of the things that also gave us confidence in our ability to deploy capital in this fashion was our track record of doing so in an intelligent and responsible way. And we have a very disciplined process in making acquisitions, and the financial parameters that James discussed in his remarks are the first hurdle we have to go through. It's not just accretion. In fact, accretion is the last thing we look at. We look at our discounted cash flow analysis, our ability to get a return and our ability to maintain our return on invested capital over time, albeit sometimes it takes a bit of a depression as we bring a big acquisition like this on. So those parameters are very important to us. We do think there's an opportunity for us to continue to deploy capital in Europe and in Latin America as an example. We think the expertise of Celesio brings in these markets will be extremely helpful to us as we deploy that capital. I mentioned their European pharmacy network activity, clearly, which is a source of opportunity for us as we build out Lloyds and continue to take that banner into a franchise kind of a model in other markets. So that is all an opportunity. But in the early phases of this, our objective will be to delever the company. We're going take on some significant debt here as we go forward, and I think it's important for us to, first, make sure that our financial condition and our balance sheet is in shape before we begin thinking about at least significant capital deployment in any additional markets. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Well, how do you feel comfortable, John, with the government's kind of dictating reimbursement in some of the markets now that you're going into? I mean, how do you protect yourself from cuts, either on dispensing fees or generic reimbursement? John H. Hammergren: Well, that was the second part of your question. I think you said the European wholesalers have had some challenges. If you actually look at Celesio's history, many of its challenges were self inflicted related to deployment of capital. They have now sold DocMorris, which was a channel conflict for them. They made some other acquisitions that, frankly, that I think in retrospect probably didn't work as they had been -- they had anticipated. So I think we -- the first decision is to make share you don't make mistakes in those markets from a capital deployment perspective and you don't compete with your customers. And I'd say the second thing is we go into this with our eyes wide open. We only have the ability to help customers and supply chain when the supply chain is an opportunity for us to affect. And in some markets, as you pointed out, the choice of product may be made by governments or other health plans or payers that really takes that decision out of our control. And our synergies, as we've outlined them here, reflect the fact that some of these markets will not be available opportunities for us, at least in the early phases. So we don't think we're going to change healthcare financing in these markets. And we've been dealing with a market like Canada, which is very European-esque in its approach to drug reimbursement and the way prices are determined. And we've been able to grow nicely in a market like that because we come with a full and complete solution. And frankly, some of these payers, I think, will be encouraged by our approach to pharmaceutical use and how, in fact, it actually, if it's properly done, can reduce the cost of healthcare in those markets as opposed to being a target for continued, as you refer to it, cuts and slashes in reimbursement. But we're not going into this with a myopic view that somehow we're going to change the way the pharmaceuticals are purchased by governments around the globe. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : John, just thinking about co-op purchasing and thinking about generics, is this something like you'll set up now with your Celesio partner something similar to what we see with AB and Walgreens and then allow some of your larger retailers to buy generics on that way? Not so much disturbing them but actually a purchasing cooperative, is that something that you're thinking about as you move forward with this? John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, we are always open to creative ways to bring value to our partners and our customers. And I think that what's nice about this transaction with Celesio is we get global scale immediately without having to deal with some of the challenges associated with the venture structure and some of the management issues that may come along with it. However, we do think that there are ways for us to take that scale and strategy and bring it to our customers in a way that will benefit them. I don't know that it necessarily has to take on a venture format, but clearly, we can find ways to make sure that our customers benefit along with us, both the supply customers, as well -- the manufacturing customers as well as the retail customers and hospital customers. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, great. And then think my follow-up question, I mean, clearly, great results again this quarter. On the core distribution side, can you talk about where you're taking market share to see the direct business up, growing 13% well above the market? Can just give us an idea of, again, where you're taking market share from today and how you see that going forward? John H. Hammergren: Well, we've been heavily focused on working with our existing customers to get an ever-increasing share of their business. So a portion of that direct distribution business growth is actually coming out of our existing warehousing line or out of our customer base where they've been sourcing a portion of their product in a direct basis and are now increasingly using McKesson to assist them in their transactions in generics and in brand for that matter. So I think that our objective is to continue to grow with our customers. We are focused on expanding our margins through the services and the value add that we deliver, and that's been our priority. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And where would you say we are, though, in that process? You've been talking about this for a while. Are we still in the fairly early innings of that? Or do you think that we're in the latter part of pulling that incremental business into McKesson? John H. Hammergren: Well, I think it's an ongoing process. I think you won't find a year -- I don't -- I shouldn't give you a forecast, but I think this has been an unusual year. As you know, there have been fewer generic launches, so that helps our revenues grow in a marketplace where the generics aren't taking the price of the brand down so much. And I also would say that we had some significant transitions with customers this year where we had a favorable move in mix with those customers, from warehousing to direct purchases. And that probably -- that delta probably don't won't continue like it has this year. And of course, we had PSS in our business, which is also an increment in both revenue and in margin expansion as well as the overall year-on-year comparison. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Maybe just stepping over to the IT business for a second here, the revenue, a little bit light versus what we had expected but the margins, obviously, looking much better. But as you expand internationally and you have a lot of growth opportunities there, can you talk about the strategic value of holding on to this IT business? I mean, its contribution to total revenue and operating profit is slowly shrinking here. Maybe you can give us your thoughts around that, John. John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, we're very happy with the performance of our Technology Solutions business this year. It really marks the turnaround, I think, both strategically and financially for that business. We've done a great job, I believe, of organizing it in a way that will be effective going forward, and I think our customers have benefited from what we've been doing. Our responsibility as an executive team is to always review the portfolio of businesses that we manage, and as you have noted, this year, we have made a decision to exit some of the businesses that we believe didn't stand up to either the strategic value or the business performance value that we expect from these assets. So I wouldn't say that we're married to any strategy relative to what assets we have other than success. I think that our recent results in technology have been successful. So there are no plans for us to change the mix. However, our responsibility is to constantly come back and revisit that decision. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And just sort of follow-up, James, I think if I heard you right, you're saying that you expect for the -- for fiscal '14 to be above your target 200 to 250 basis points for operating margin. Is that -- should we think about that as a sustainable level? And does that mean our long-term target changes? Or how should we think about that beyond fiscal '14? James Beer : Well, for the Distribution Solutions segment, we're expecting the full year fiscal '14 operating margin to be above the midpoint of that 200- to 250-basis-point range. So I think that's important to clarify. And we'll update that as we go along in the coming years. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : John, just a couple of quick questions. I'm kind of curious to get your perspective on some of the differences between the European wholesale model and what you have domestically. And with that, I'm kind of curious, could you comment a little bit more on traditional generic versus brand economics given the regulated pricing environment? Is it structured similarly? Or how do -- can you give us some more color? John H. Hammergren: Well, Glen, I think that the wholesale model in terms of the logistics operations are similar to ours. However, the delivery model in some of the markets is different. The frequency with which they deliver the stores, the frequency of the order pattern of the customers are slightly different. But essentially, wholesaling in Europe is wholesaling in our North American operations. We buy from the same manufacturers, both generic and brand. We have similar kinds of relationships, and there's a process by which we can improve the efficiency with our retail customers through the systems we deploy and the information we provide and the way we help those either owned or banner stores be more productive and more involved in the clinical care process. And I think, increasingly, what we're finding in the global markets, including the U.S., frankly, is that pharmacy is becoming more and more of a care provider beyond just the dispensing of medication. It is a lower-cost alternative than going to the emergency rooms or going to someplace else. You've seen the emergence of things like MinuteClinic, with CVS, et cetera, that have been quite successful. And I think types of models are also permeating the European landscape. Now clearly, the buying process of generics in the U.S. is fragmented. Some of it's wholesaling -- wholesalers that are purchasing the generics, and sometimes it's the large retailers that are purchasing the generics. And if you move into Europe, you probably have a similar model there. And in terms of the reimbursement in some of the markets, the wholesaler and the retailers are making the decision on the selection of the generic. And in other markets, other payers or governments are making the decision on selecting the generics. So I think there are nuancial [ph] changes or differences in the way that the markets work that have an implication on how you prepare yourself in the marketplace. But if you actually look under the covers of the various countries in which Celesio competes, the operating margin structure and the way they approach the market is very similar to what we do in our Canadian or our U.S. operations. So there's not a lot of dissimilarities. And when I talked about the synergies earlier from a supply chain perspective, those synergies are really crafted around models where McKesson has more of an influence over the relationship between, particularly the generic, a manufacture choice and the customer's ability to sell it through. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : John, maybe if I can just follow up on that, I mean, you commented on some of the regulatory issues that impact that European wholesaling business. But if you look at the recent brand-to-generic conversion, it kind of looks like those companies haven't gotten the same lift that sort of domestic players have had. And then if you read some of the regulatory filings from Celesio, they talk about incremental competition in discounting, and while you reap the benefits of an oligopoly here in the United States, it feels like there was more incremental pricing pressure over there. So could you comment on the competitive environment and how you think about the profit outlook for those businesses? John H. Hammergren: Well, there are 2 different streams of thought there. Clearly, the penetration of generics in Europe is below that, that we experienced in the U.S. And therefore, there's a significant opportunity for us to expand the utilization of generics and therefore, improve the profitability of the operations as generics are more widely consumed. So we see that, clearly, as an opportunity. Once again, that's not really built into our synergy assumptions. The view we have relative to our ability to manage the generics selection process, et cetera, is really country by country. And we -- I think each one operates in a different way, and I think our analysis has been pretty thorough in terms of where we think the countries are going to manage generics in a way that works for the model that we've deployed. And on the competition front, if you actually look inside, I think what Celesio has said publicly, the competitive dynamic has been most difficult for them in Germany. I think the rest of the markets appear to be relatively stable, and the companies that are competing in those markets seem to be doing so in a rational basis. And clearly, we have our eyes wide open on the results that have been achieved over there as well. I think our going in position is that we have to manage this business carefully, that the Celesio management team has a good grip on what they're doing, and the country presidents have tremendous experience in their markets and understand those markets and are doing what they need to do to manage effectively. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So just if you can help us provide some context along the supply chain synergies targets for the next 4 years, can you give us some sense as to what is the combined generic sourcing power for the 2 companies? John H. Hammergren: Well, I think that it's fair to say that we have been able to look carefully at the generic purchasing patterns and as I said earlier, look at it on a country-by-country basis. And we've compared what's going on with Celesio to what we've got with United States and Canada, and we believe there's a significant opportunity. The quantification of generics is one that is difficult to make on a comparative basis because everybody looks at it in a different way, what goes through distribution, what's controlled spend, what goes through retail, et cetera. So I think it's probably fair to say that those comparisons are not as relevant as really getting inside the business model, and that's really the magic on how we've been able to continue to grow our program, as evidenced in the results this quarter. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then in the prepared remark, you mentioned the convergence between the segments and the globalization. So is Celesio's retail business core to your strategy? John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, retail is core to our strategy, and retail for Celesio in the markets in which they own the stores has been a very successful strategy, and the Lloyds brand has performed quite well for them. In the markets where Celesio owns retail, other wholesalers own retail as well, and that dynamic has been in place for a long, long time. We do not plan to enter the retail space in the U.S. or Canada on a direct basis, and in the markets in Europe, most of them are regulated from a retail perspective where independence have a great deal of power in those markets and deliver most of the medications from a retail perspective. And Celesio has done a terrific job in those countries in building relationships with these independent pharmacies to allow them to continue to be very successful on both the financial and clinical dimensions in which they're working. And those partnerships and relationships with independent pharmacies remain critical to McKesson and Celesio going forward globally. And part of the value that we bring is the continued scale and influence that we have, as well as our operating expertise that is enhanced, I think, by the Lloyds experience that when independent retailers are looking for a partner, that Lloyds experience helps us help them manage their stores in a more complete way. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So congratulations on this deal. Boy, certainly nobody saw this coming. I mentioned that as kind of jokingly here. So I think you've done some detailed work on the generic synergies, and I guess, preliminarily, just trying to think about some of the flow here, do you see more of the potential McKesson U.S. generic procurement and that supply flowing to Europe? Or would more flow from the Celesio European generic procurement into the U.S? So which side right now may have the larger synergy potential? And also, do you actually even think about it that way? John H. Hammergren: Well, I think we probably don't think about it that way necessarily. As you think about the people we partner with in generics, they're global companies, and we source on a global basis. I think that the synergy number we provided you is a McKesson-Celesio combined synergy number. And I think that we haven't thought about necessarily giving you any data on a discrete market-by-market basis relative to where those generics would go. But we have -- we clearly believe that it's a global business, and our global relationships will benefit both our supply chain partners as well as our customers. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Eric Coldwell with Robert Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I -- most of mine have been covered at this point, and I think you -- John, you've loosely referred to my next question a few times, but I'll ask it more succinctly. I know you mentioned it was an opportunistic deal here, and maybe there weren't other options available to you. But something you could give more specific color on your thought process with an outright buy versus other options that have been rumored in the press, such as perhaps only buying the distribution piece or partnering with a large U.S. pharmacy on the deal either jointly or splitting it up. Was outright buy really the only thing you were looking to do? Or were there perhaps other options that you would have considered? John H. Hammergren: Clearly, this transaction was speculated upon, has been for a long time. And you could even go back 10 years ago, the speculation existed. At some point, McKesson and perhaps others would take a more global perspective on distribution. I think our perspective is that the entire transaction made the most sense for us. The combined retail and wholesale operation that's principally operated in the U.K. for Celesio has worked extremely well, and we saw no reason to separating those 2 operations just because of a change in ownership. And I would say that we believe that the ability for McKesson to execute against the synergies is enhanced through a complete ownership model as opposed to some type of a venture or the additional complexity of trying to buy an asset with multiple companies involved and then changing the strategies of those companies after we acquire them to change the course that they were currently on. This is not an operational turnaround execution issue for Celesio and McKesson to deal with. If you actually think about the challenges that Celesio has had, it's principally a challenge with pricing in existing market and the acquisition and capital deployment strategies that they've been about fixing over the last 12 to 18 months. So I think adding additional operating complexity by trying to do it differently just didn't make any sense, and we're focused on executing going forward, and we think we can do so on a combined basis very well. I would end with saying that I do believe there are additional opportunities for us to work with others that will provide value, and we're certainly open to various models as we complete this transaction that will afford our customers and our supply chain partners with additional value. I certainly want to thank the operator today, and I want to thank all of you on the call for your time. I'm certainly pleased with our strong second quarter performance, and I'm very excited about the future of the business and our acquisition of Celesio. I look forward to welcoming the management team and employees of Celesio and, together, creating a global platform to grow and support the success of our customers. I'll now hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events and for the financial community. Erin? Erin Lampert : Thank you, John. I have a preview of an upcoming event for the financial community. On November 12, we will present at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Health Care Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. We will release third quarter earnings late in January. Thank you, and goodbye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results : acquisition expenses and related adjustments, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2014 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren: Thank you, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. As you've seen in the press release we issued this afternoon announcing our third quarter financial results, we incurred charges related to 2 items which had a negative impact on our reported results for the quarter. I'll come back to these items in just a moment. I'd like to begin with 2 big headlines for the quarter. First, we had exceptional growth in our Distribution Solutions business where operating profits grew by 37% over the prior year. And we're also very excited to have secured the acquisition of Celesio through the agreements we announced last week. First, I'll begin with a few comments about Celesio. Last week, we announced that we reached an agreement with the Haniel Group to purchase their entire holding of Celesio common shares. In a separate and subsequent transaction, we also reached an agreement with an affiliate of Elliott management to purchase Celesio convertible bonds. The agreements with the Haniel Group and Elliott will result in McKesson achieving over 75% ownership of Celesio on a fully diluted basis. We expect to close these transactions on February 6, 2014. We are extremely pleased to move forward with the acquisition of Celesio, and we look forward to bringing together the strengths of the McKesson and Celesio organizations to provide our customers with even more efficient delivery of health care products and services around the world. While the path to securing this acquisition was certainly not what we had originally expected, it would seem that the interested parties to this transaction continued to see the compelling strategic benefit of McKesson and Celesio uniting to form a global leader in health care services. I never lost sight of the value this transaction will bring to our customers, our supply chain partners, the employees of both organizations and our shareholders. That being said, we made it clear from the time we originally announced the transaction on our second quarter earnings call that we would need to achieve the 75% ownership threshold in order to fully realize the value and synergies we had outlined. We also made it clear that we would be disciplined stewards of our shareholders' capital, and I'm pleased we were able to accomplish both of these important objectives. James will update the key financial elements of the transaction and provide additional information on the immediate next steps, but let me take a moment here to make a few things clear. First, our strategic rationale and key financial assumptions remain intact. Second, the combination of McKesson and Celesio will become the world's largest pharmaceutical supply chain company, and we'll be well-positioned to meet the increasing global nature of our industry. I'm extremely proud of the global sourcing capability McKesson has built over many years. We've been able to deliver tremendous value through our strong manufacturer relationships and our knowledge of the health care supply chain. This acquisition keeps McKesson's expertise at the center of our strategy and deepens our relationships directly with our manufacturing partners. And finally, McKesson has a great track record of deploying capital wisely, and the acquisition of Celesio continues this trend, creating a strong platform for growth, driving benefits for our customers, our manufacturing partners, our employees and our shareholders. Turning now to our results for the quarter. As I mentioned, Distribution Solutions continues to deliver exceptional results, and our view of the full year operating performance of the business has improved from our previous expectations. In our Technology Solutions segment, we continued to take actions to align our development efforts and resources to our customers' most important priorities and the realities of our marketplace. Our third quarter results include charges resulting from the restructuring actions related to the timing of our Horizon Clinicals software platform requirement to meet Meaningful Use 3. Our third quarter results are also impacted by a significant increase in our tax reserves. As disclosed in our recent quarterly and annual SEC filings, we've been engaged in a tax dispute in Canada regarding the transfer pricing matter for the years 2003 through 2008. McKesson has been in litigation regarding the assessments received for the tax year 2003. In late December, the Canadian Tax Court ruled against McKesson, and in January, we filed an appeal of this decision. While we believe the structure of our transfer pricing agreements were appropriate, we think it is prudent to record an increase in our current reserves for all Canadian open tax periods. So overall, for the full year, our outlook for Distribution Solutions has improved. However, we have updated our guidance for the fiscal year and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share of $8.05 to $8.20 for our fiscal 2014, which include the restructuring charges in our Technology business and an increase in our tax reserves, which combined total $0.70. Before I turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results, I'll provide some highlights from both segments of our business. As I mentioned, Distribution Solutions continues to deliver strong operating performance. In the third quarter, revenue grew 10%, and adjusted operating profit grew 37%. Within our Distribution Solutions segment, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business had another quarter of outstanding results. Direct distribution and services revenues increased 11% for the quarter. In the third quarter, we continued to experience price inflation in a relatively small subset of our generics portfolio. Consistent with the expectations we outlined in the second quarter, inflation in our fiscal third quarter moderated from what we had experienced in the second quarter. In addition, we continue to benefit from more of our customers choosing to buy more of their generics from McKesson and strong compliance to our generics programs and services, including strong growth in our OneStop and generic -- OneStop Generics program. In summary, we had another quarter of great performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Revenues in Canada increased 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued growth in our core business and growth from new customers. Our Specialty business had another solid quarter of performance, and I'm pleased with the collaboration and innovation that's being driven between our physician partners and our specialty team. Our Medical-Surgical business had solid results for the third quarter. As we approach the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of PSS World Medical, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of the employees of the combined McKesson Medical-Surgical and PSS teams for the outstanding progress they have made in the integration of these 2 great businesses. While we still have significant work ahead of us in the coming years to optimize our distribution network, I'm proud of the way our teams have come together to implement our strategy, all while remaining focused on taking care of our customers. In summary, I'm pleased with the exceptional performance in our Distribution Solutions segment for the third quarter. We have leadership positions across all of our North American distribution businesses, including U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution, Canadian pharmaceutical distribution, community oncology distribution and services, and Medical-Surgical distribution, including physician office, home care and long-term care. And we're pleased to add a great new platform for growth on a more global scale through our acquisition of Celesio. Turning now to our Technology Solutions segment. In the third quarter, revenues grew by 6% to $784 million, and adjusted operating margins were 8.55%. While we are disappointed in the reported results in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter, it is important that we take action in response to the changes in the anticipated timeline for Meaningful Use 3 and to size our organization in Horizon Clinicals appropriately. I would point out, as the timelines for Meaningful Use 3 are delayed, we must maintain a certain level of resources to support our customers as they prepare for this important implementation. Another item which had an impact on our third quarter results and our outlook for the full year is that we had expected a recovery in demand, in particular in our Medical Imaging business. This recovery in demand has not yet materialized. You should expect to see us continue to take actions to align our organization and development efforts to our customers' most important priorities. Our customers are going through a significant change in the way they think about their business models going forward. McKesson will continue to focus on delivering solutions that help our customers drive better decisions through analytics and business intelligence, enabled connectivity and provide tools and services to support new risk-based and value-based reimbursement business models. In summary, it's an exciting time to be at McKesson. The performance in our Distribution Solutions business is strong, and our outlook for the full year operating performance has improved from our previous expectations. And our acquisition of Celesio positions us for leadership on a global scale. The combination of McKesson and Celesio is expected to have revenues in excess of $150 billion, approximately 81,000 employees worldwide and operations in more than 20 countries. We will deliver to approximately 120,000 pharmacy and hospital locations on a daily basis in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Brazil, including more than 11,000 pharmacies that are either owned or part of a strategic banner or franchise network of community pharmacies. With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James A. Beer: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, we are pleased by the continued strength in our operating results. We're also very pleased to be moving forward with Celesio and expect that this acquisition will build upon the value we bring to our customers, manufacturing partners and shareholders. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter consolidated financial results, provide an update on our fiscal 2014 outlook and outline the key financial aspects of our acquisition of Celesio. As I review the third quarter, there are 3 aspects of our financial results that I would like to particularly bring to your attention. First and perhaps most important in thinking about our business going forward is the continued performance and strength within our Distribution Solutions segment. Second is a $122 million charge we recorded relating to a dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency, which we have described in our previous SEC filings. I will come back to this later in my remarks. And third, our $42 million in restructuring charges taken in our Technology Solutions segment, primarily related to our Horizon Clinicals software platform. My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.45, which exclude 4 items : the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues increased to 10% for the quarter to $34.3 billion. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased to 21% to $2 billion, primarily driven by the continued strength in our distribution business. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.2 billion were up 13% for the quarter, driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013. For the full year, excluding the impact of these acquisitions, we expect total company adjusted operating expenses to increase approximately 3%. Other income year-over-year was slightly lower for the quarter at $5 million. Interest expense was approximately in line with the prior year at $59 million. Now moving to taxes. As outlined in our recent filings, we have been engaged in a legal dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency regarding a transfer pricing matter that impacts the tax years 2003 through 2008. The tax court released its decision on this matter late in our third quarter. And earlier this month, we filed an appeal of that decision to the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada. During our review of the court's decision, we reevaluated our existing tax reserves for all open tax years and recorded adjustments increasing these reserves by $122 million. We now expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be 36.5%, an increase from our previous estimate of 31%, driven by the current quarter Canadian tax reserve adjustment and a change in our mix of foreign and domestic income. Excluding the current quarter tax reserve adjustment, the adjusted full year tax rate would be 32.5%. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $339 million, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations totaled $1.45. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter were negatively impacted by $0.52 from the reserve adjustments related to the Canadian tax matter and by an additional $0.18 from the restructuring charges recorded at our Technology Solutions segment. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 234 million. This year's earnings per share number was also aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases. We expect our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2014 to be 234 million. Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Distribution Solutions' total revenues increased 10% for the quarter to $33.5 billion, primarily driven by market growth and more business from our existing customer base. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 11% for the quarter to $24.9 billion. Warehouse revenues decreased 1% for the quarter, primarily driven by a shift to direct store delivery. Canadian revenues on a constant-currency basis increased 12% this quarter from the prior year, mainly driven by market growth and recent customer wins. Turning now to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 67% for the quarter to $1.5 billion, driven by the PSS acquisition and market growth. The combined business continues to perform very well, as we made progress on important integration activities. Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 27% for the quarter on 10% revenue growth, resulting in a 65-basis-point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. In addition to the PSS acquisition, our third quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from continued favorable performance within our generics pharmaceutical business. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 19% for the quarter, primarily driven by the acquisitions we made in fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 234 basis points, an improvement of 46 basis points versus the prior year. Based on our performance fiscal year-to-date, we now expect the adjusted operating margin for Distribution Solutions to be at the high end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were up 6% for the quarter to $784 million, primarily driven by our acquisitions. Now as I mentioned earlier, the third quarter results in Technology Solutions reflect certain business realignment and restructuring charges. Our businesses are continuously reviewing their outlook and strategic plans and allocating their resources to drive the best outcomes for our customers and our business. However, we do, on occasion, make decisions that have a more meaningful impact on our results. And therefore, we bring these to your attention. This quarter, our results in Technology Solutions were impacted by $42 million in business realignment and restructuring charges, driven by delays in the Meaningful Use 3 timeline and the realignment of our development efforts primarily related to the Horizon Clinicals software platform. $31 million of these charges reduced segment adjusted gross profit, while a further $11 million increased the segment's operating expenses this quarter. As a result, Technology Solutions' adjusted gross profit decreased 4%, representing a 453-basis-point decline in our adjusted gross profit margin. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment increased 12%, driven primarily by the acquisitions we made in the prior year, but also as a result of the impact of the current quarter restructuring charges. Technology Solutions' gross R&D spending for the quarter was $127 million, up 12% versus the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 6% versus 10% a year ago. Overall, third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment was down 39% to $67 million, and the third quarter adjusted operating margin rate was 8.55%, a decrease of 636 basis points versus the prior year, driven largely by the charges I discussed earlier. Based on the current quarter restructuring charges and the rationale for these charges that John reviewed earlier, we now expect to be at the lower end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of the mid-teens. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our days sales outstanding was 24 days versus 25 days a year ago. Our days sales in inventories of 32 days was flat year-over-year, and our days sales in payables remained at 46 days. We generated cash flow from operations of $472 million. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect that cash flow from operations will total approximately $2 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion, with $1.5 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $296 million for the first 9 months of fiscal 2014. We now expect full year internal capital spending to be approximately $400 million. Now I'll turn to our outlook. Let me once again remind you that our earnings this quarter were specifically impacted by 3 items that also affect our full year outlook. First, the dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency had a negative impact of approximately $0.52 per diluted share for the quarter and the full year. Second, the current quarter adjustments to our tax reserves and our change in income mix also drove an increase in our updated full year adjusted tax rate to 36.5% from our prior estimate of 31%. And third, the Technology Solutions charges lowered our adjusted earnings by approximately $0.18 per diluted share this quarter. As a result of these 3 items, we are updating our adjusted earnings guidance to a range of between $8.05 and $8.20. Also, to be clear, we have not included any earnings from Celesio in our updated fiscal 2014 outlook. We expect that the results from our acquisition of Celesio will not have a meaningful impact on our Q4 results. In addition, we expect to exclude from GAAP earnings $0.76 in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.55 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude $0.23 for litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments of $0.71 to $0.77. Now let me take a few moments to talk about the acquisition of Celesio. McKesson expects to fund a portion of the transaction with offshore cash and has a bridge financing facility in place to fund the balance of the purchase price. As we consider our permanent financing plans, we remain committed to maintaining our status as an investment grade-rated company. We will begin to consolidate the financial results of Celesio during our fourth quarter, ending March 31, 2014, and our earnings will reflect [indiscernible] share of Celesio's earnings, although as I mentioned, we do not expect the acquisition will have a meaningful impact on our Q4 results. After the expected close of our agreements with the Haniel family and Elliott on February 6, 2014, we will exceed 75% ownership of Celesio's shares on a fully diluted basis. We plan to launch a tender offer for the remaining outstanding common shares of Celesio in our fiscal fourth quarter, and we continue to expect that we will have operational control of Celesio late in the first half of our fiscal 2015. Just to remind you, getting to operating control of Celesio, also known as a domination in Germany, is the point in time when we expect to begin executing on our synergy business case. By the fourth year, following the completion of the required steps to obtain operating control, we expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. We estimate this transaction to be $1 to $1.20 accretive on an adjusted earnings basis in the first 12 months following the completion of the transactions with the Haniel family and Elliott. This range, however, assumes 100% ownership of the outstanding common shares of Celesio and thus will have to be adjusted in line with our actual ownership stake in Celesio at different points in time over the coming months. Overall, our assumptions for accretion and synergies from this acquisition remain unchanged. In summary, we recorded 3 very strong quarters this year, and we are excited to move forward with our acquisition of Celesio and expect the transaction to deliver tremendous value to our customers, manufacturing partners and shareholders in the years ahead. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : John, I just want to follow up on some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks. It seems you suggested that maybe the generic inflation moderated a little bit in fiscal 3Q versus 2Q, but yet the magnitude of the beats out of the pharmaceutical segment continue to get bigger. And so I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more, give us a little bit more color, about maybe what in the business maybe did much better than you would have thought given that moderating inflation -- generic inflation? John H. Hammergren: Well, we were really pleased with the performance of the Distribution Solutions segment in the quarter, and we continue to have strength, really, across the board. You saw nice revenue growth in the business. Clearly, the PSS integration is going well for us, which has been additive to the performance in that business, but the real strength is really coming still out of our generics business. Our OneStop revenues were up nicely. The share of wallet we're getting from our customers who are relying more and more on our generic capabilities and now depending on us to source the right products at the right price for them has been very helpful. And clearly, the position we have with those manufacturers continues to improve. I think we've really built very positive, trusting relationships. And inflation continues to be an important part. So it's too early to call it trend change in generic inflation, but clearly, some moderation has occurred and it's been helpful. And it's still positive relative to our original expectations. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And maybe just one quick follow-up. If I look at sort of what you're implying now for the fourth quarter based on your updated guidance, it looks like about $2.26 to $2.41 in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is lower than consensus. And the reason I bring it up is because on one of your competitors' conference calls, they seem to suggest that there were some price inflation that was maybe moved from the March quarter into the December quarter, and so I'm kind of wondering, was there anything that might have been -- that you might have recognized a little bit earlier than you otherwise would have? Is there any difference in the typical seasonality of these 2 quarters? John H. Hammergren: I don't think we saw a lot of changes in the way that branded manufacturers behaved in our portfolio, the way we've established our agreements. Having said that, there may have been some slight move into our third quarter and out of our fourth quarter. I think that our -- we clearly believe that the inflation moderation is going to continue as we look into our fourth quarter, and we also have some follow-on expense in our MTS segment, as I talked about in our -- in my prepared comments. This Meaningful Use 3 thing for us is -- it was a real critical change. It pushed out our customers' implementation and we were able to, through the charge, reduce a significant amount of the investment we had sitting there, waiting to do these service implementations with our customers. But there is still remaining investment built in services and in R&D as we try to prepare ourselves for whenever the MU3 thing gets put in place for us. So I think it's a combination of sort of that moderation on the generics side to some degree in the fourth quarter, as well as the MTS business will have this kind of follow-on expense associated with MU3 and some other things that we've got going on there. James A. Beer: The other thing I would just add to that is, of course, tax rate that I mentioned for the full year. We are looking at that 36.5% tax rate. So you have to bear that in mind as well. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Can you share with us kind of like what has been the feedback from your customers in the acquisition of Celesio? And I know, John, you talk about increasing generic wallet of customers. But are you seeing increased appetite from customers to historically source the bulk of their generics directly from manufacturers to strategically do more with McKesson? John H. Hammergren: Well, we've been actively working for almost a decade on helping our customers realize the value, both from our sourcing, as well as our logistics efforts, and we believe that we are sourcing as well now as almost any one, and Celesio is going to help us improve even more, as we add that volume. And in particular, the retail footprint that, that brings along with it. I think the dynamic with our customers is also a focus on how to get supply chain efficiency. And [Audio Gap] wholesale channel is not -- has not proven to be the most logistically favorable way to do it. There's added costs on not only the buying and procurement side, but you could also certainly envision the increment of cost when it goes into our customers' warehouses, and then they have to handle the product and get it back out, when we're already in those stores every day, anyway, with the delivery of the other product that we have been selling them. So I think there's an increased appreciation at the executive level within our customers to look at those costs and to look also at the changing global world of generic sourcing and increased interest in focusing on McKesson. And I think what's great about the relationship that we've created here with the acquisition of Celesio, is it allows us to continue to have tremendous transparency into the supply chain. It gives us really total control of our own destiny, and it allows us to maintain those close partnerships with our manufacturing partners so that we can continue to have visibility to the opportunity, bring those opportunities to our customers and present them in a way that is compelling relative to them moving their internal sourcing of generics over to McKesson. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then the one follow-up is regarding the Ranbaxy plant import ban. How do you view the ban? How does it impact your view of generic price inflation? I know that you talked about some moderation, but does that -- could that change the trends? John H. Hammergren: I guess, Ricky, I would remind you that McKesson has a very large generics portfolio consisting of thousands of products. And to put this inflation thing into context, the inflation is really coming from a very small subset of our total portfolio of products and a small subset of the manufacturers. With regards to Ranbaxy, I believe the industry is well aware of the work the FDA has been doing. They've increased their funding and their staffing to do critical inspections, and although I certainly feel bad for the Ranbaxy folks relative to this, I think McKesson is aware of this increased scrutiny and trying to make sure that we are availing ourselves of a wide enough supply chain so that we have access to the products. And I do not expect any of the recent situation with one of the Ranbaxy plants in India to have an impact on our delivery to our customers, nor an impact on our view of inflation going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with FBR. Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Just curious, we get a lot of questions on the generics and the price inflation and the impact and sort of how it flows through. Can you help us understand a little bit the extent to which you're seeing benefits from more -- by whole type pricing? Or is it that the same percentage spread on a bigger dollar amount gives you some more earnings? And I guess where I'm going with it is, to what extent, when price inflation moderates -- is it just sort of lack of upside? Or do you actually have to -- a negative that you have to overcome year-over-year because the earnings actually get lower in dollars? John H. Hammergren: Well, we've seen a trend over time with generic pricing. It used to be a deflationary headwind we had to deal with year-on-year. And as that began to moderate, it clearly made the year-on-year effect easier. With an inflation environment like we experienced this year, clearly, it was a surprise to us that this would occur to the magnitude that it has. And as you think about our thinking going forward, it could provide a headwind for us, depending on what your view of ongoing generic inflation might be. Clearly, the offsets to that will be to get more and more folks buying off of our generic portfolio. Additional offsets will be the power of what we're doing with Northstar and our sourcing there. And clearly, our global sourcing initiatives are going to get additional fuel or accelerant as we put the Celesio teams together with the McKesson teams to approach the market on a global basis. And also, as you think about FY '13, we have a brand-to-generic trend that moves in our favor again. This was really the lull year for generic conversions, and I think, as you think about next year, we'll see that pick back up again. Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Right. Right. And I have a follow-up to that actually. I think you started to mention it. You've said for a few quarters now that you're seeing more generics business from your existing customers. Can you frame that potential in terms of what's left on the table there, in any way, for us to get an understanding of where you've been and maybe how much more there is to go if more and more customers were, in fact, to move more of their business to you? John H. Hammergren: Well, we have a great book of business, and we have been able, over the years, to take a great deal of the responsibility for delivering generics to our independents on -- is one of our key requirements. As you know, Tom, you've been following us for some time, we've been moving up the food chain with bigger and bigger customers testing us from a generic perspective and coming to the conclusion that we do in fact do the best job for them relative to generic pricing and generic service and generic availability. I think that, that movement is continuing. Our very largest customers still purchase generics on their own. And clearly, that would be a very large opportunity for us as we continue to build a compelling vision for what that might mean for them. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Yes. I was curious just in terms of the cash flow and sort of where we are. It seems like it's pretty back half -- 4Q weighted for the year. How did that sort impact how you're thinking about the financing mix for Celesio? Obviously, we saw you raise the bridge, but we're -- I'm just curious in terms of -- in the new or old, I guess, guidance assumption, what is the sort of backbone behind that just in terms of percent from new debt versus cash on hand? Because, obviously, you have a portion in Europe. James A. Beer: Yes. Certainly, the fourth quarter is traditionally a strong operating cash flow quarter for us, in part as a result of the timing of a lot of the brand price increases that we traditionally see. So in terms of the financing for Celesio, we have the view that we would have at least $1 billion or so of cash available offshore, and then we would obviously draw on the bridge for the balance of our needs, those needs, of course, are dependent upon the timing of the remaining 25% or so of the Celesio shares that we acquire. So we'll see how we play out in terms of that remaining 1/4 or so of the shares. That will help us define the eventual amount of permanent debt that we would put in place once we pay off the bridge. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And maybe, John, you touched upon obviously over time, as these generic relationships develop, the potential to touch more of your large customers. But I'm curious, with all the new relationships in industry, what are you seeing from the independents, which has obviously been a core strength of yours for years? And how are they sort of reacting to all of these new arrangements and sort of the potential for them to possibly participate in new services? I guess this is now going to be true for you both here and in Europe. John H. Hammergren: The independents in both Europe and here in the United States have been very positive about the announced Celesio acquisition, and now they're even more positive on the view that it's going to close here in a few weeks. And I think they believe that not only will they be able to enjoy continued great service and price on generics, but there are obviously tremendous retail experience that comes with Celesio, through the management of Lloyds Pharmacies, as well as the many banner stores that they support throughout Europe to continue to find ways to bundle our capabilities effectively for our independent customers. I'd also point out that none of our customers in Europe or here see the merger of McKesson and Celesio as a conflict of interest on their side. They don't feel threatened by it. They don't see it as something that's against their ultimate goals, and they don't see it as a competitive action in any way. So I think from a discussion perspective, we don't have any conflict of interest relative to what our motives are. And I think they continue to look at this in a favorable way, Ross. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : A lot of talk today about generic inflation. Can you maybe just give us any color as far as brand price inflation you saw in the quarter and expectations for the March quarter? We've heard some talk about the fact that some things may have been pulled into the December quarter. Did you see something similar? And how should we think about it in the March quarter? John H. Hammergren: I would say that our view in the quarter was pretty consistent with our going-in thoughts as we developed our plans for the year. So I -- given that it hasn't been brought to my attention and when I asked the question to our team, there might have been some nominal changes in behavior. But as a portfolio, the price really came in close to what our expectations were. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, great. And then secondly, in Canada, obviously you called it out, it was up 12%. You talked about customer, as well as market growth. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that came from market growth? Are you seeing substantially more market growth there than we're seeing in the U.S.? And if so, what are the key drivers to that? John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, we have picked up a bunch of new customers in Canada, and we've been very selective on those new relationships. One of our competitors exited Canada through the sale of their business to another competitor in Canada, and some of the customers that were serviced by that competitor were open to a conversation with McKesson. And as a result, we've been able to grow our business. I might also say that our specialty business in Canada, which we believe is market-leading, continues to grow very nicely. And so we've been encouraged by that continued penetration in that part of our book. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Is there a way to look at the 12%, how much came from the new customers versus the overall market in Canada? John H. Hammergren: It's probably difficult to parse out, Lisa. There are public numbers on market growth rates in Canada, but I think, clearly, we believe that we've had a significant increase in revenue as a result of our customer wins in the Canadian marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I just have a quick question on the March quarter as well. If I'm doing the math right, I think the implied fourth quarter guidance is $2.26 to $2.41 and straight to $2.46 right now. But again, with all the details in the press release and the commentary on the call, is there anything that's sort of one-time-ish in nature that you're including in the upcoming March quarter that's kind of baked within that quarterly guidance in particular? Or is that sort of more of a clean range the way things stand right now, just in relation to taxes or IT charges or even charges tied to Celesio as well? James A. Beer: No. There's nothing that we're implying as to the fourth quarter or one-time nature or anything like that. Really, the 3 drivers I would ask you to really focus are obviously the Canada tax, $0.52; the technology charges of $0.18; and then the impact of the tax run rate, which is both partly driven by that Canada tax item, but also as a result of a change in our income mix with distribution business representing a greater proportion of the total profitability of McKesson. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : John, obviously we've talked a bit about your generics program here. And when you look at sort of the partnerships that have formed, yours is obviously a little different because you're basically owning Celesio. But as you think in the future and serving [ph] your large customers, do you envision more that they'll just join your -- they'll just become a customer of your OneStop program? Or could it end up being where you're partnering more in a JV format? Like how do you envision -- what would be your preferred route, and how would you kind of see it? Or do you even see the need to do that? John H. Hammergren: Charles, that's a good question. I think the way I think about it is that the -- first of all, you see through these combinations that scale really matters and that wholesalers really matter. We are an integral part, even in the largest customer set, of the value proposition and the service offering that's brought to the marketplace. So I think the industry overall and wholesaling has done a very good job of continuing to add significant value. And changing our model over time so we remain vibrant and viable and in the middle of a very important industry and earn our position every day. I would say, relative to structures, we have not had great success at McKesson creating joint ventures that are sustainable, that -- where interests are always combined and unified. And usually, we end up with a situation where they collapse under their own complexity or they have some problem with one venture partner trying to optimize against another. So we're not really inclined to enter joint ventures, although I'd say that -- with the caveat of clearly, we'll listen to the opportunity and make a decision. I would say that with respect to our largest customers, we hope to continue to evolve our value proposition so that the economics that are afforded to them through our OneStop program or through custom-developed programs, that they'll buy off of our portfolio and that, that transaction will make sense for us and for them without the complexity of some type of a venture structure which could be difficult to manage. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : And if I can just follow up, your largest customers that do buy direct -- I mean, we generally assume that they buy all the generics direct. Is that really the case? Or is that they're buying sort of high-value generics directly and maybe low-value generics through you? John H. Hammergren: I can only speak for McKesson's large customers. I would say that without exception, they all buy some generics from us. Given the frequency with which we deliver to the stores, our position has always been to help our customers from a service perspective. Clearly, many of them have their own warehouses and do their own buying as well for certain sets of products. And how they reach a decision as to which they buy for themselves and which they buy through us may not be totally transparent to us. I would assume it would usually be from an economic perspective, they would make that decision. Our job is to wrap the value proposition of our complete relationship with the customer, which should include brand, generic, our service offering, our automation systems, our warehousing capabilities, to make it compelling for them to discontinue their own purchasing. And we've been effective at doing that all the way up to our largest customers. And I think that it's our responsibility to continue to evolve our programs so we can earn the privilege of serving their needs from a generic perspective in a more holistic way. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : John, first one for you is can you detail for us, with the generic inflation that's been going on, how is Northstar leveraged to that? So has that been an excess margin opportunity for Northstar? And maybe the opportunities for Northstar in Europe? John H. Hammergren: Thanks, George, for the question. Northstar clearly is around the globe looking at opportunities to bring product into our supply chain. And I think that the visibility we get through Northstar enhances our view of the opportunities that exist globally for us, as well as some of the challenges that may exist, whether it's plant closures, limited supply of raw materials or other issues that may come along. And I think that Northstar experience helps inform all of McKesson from a sourcing perspective in a very positive way. We have launched a variant of Northstar into Canada with success, and that product continues to build its position in Canada, that product line. And I believe, and so do our new partners at Celesio, that there are opportunities to explore with our generic portfolio in Europe. And clearly, Northstar will be a part of that. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And, James, maybe just 2 quick housekeeping questions. I want to make sure I heard things right. With the 36.5% tax rate you mentioned, was that for the fourth quarter? Or is that what we expected the full year rate to be? James A. Beer: Yes, that's the rate for the full year, and that includes the impact of the Canadian tax matter that I talked about. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just -- as you guys launch the tender process for the remainder of Celesio, how long does that tender process go on for? And then maybe just a very simple explanation of next steps? James A. Beer: Yes. The tender process we're doing -- envisage taking about 4 weeks, and then you'd have an additional 2-week period, very similar to actually the structure of the original tender, whereby additional people could tender their shares during that extra 2-week period. And then we have already issued our intent to go through a domination hearing. That will take some time. There are a few steps that we have to go through to be able to get to that hearing. First of all, we have to go through a valuation process. And then we also have to give 6 weeks' notice to call an annual general meeting at which the domination process would be heard. So that will take a few months, but we would still expect to be on track to reach domination towards the end of the first half of our fiscal 2015. And of course, it's at that point in time where we can really start work on the synergy case. That's the point of time in which we have operating control of Celesio. Operator : Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Swann. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : John, can you touch on how simple or perhaps complex it might be for the combined buying power of both McKesson and Celesio to operate across borders? Will that be a fairly simple process? And then can you also touch on the pricing environment in Germany? John H. Hammergren: Thank you, David, for the questions. I think that it's probably difficult to characterize the 14 countries in Celesio's book in one way. I would say it really matters which country you're thinking about relative to the way generics are purchased today, how they're contracted for, whether the payers are involved or the government is involved. I would say that we've carefully mapped out the positions by country, by manufacturers. We understand where we think these synergies might fall for us. And clearly, our guidance to synergies and how we talked about it when we first announced the deal, all of those factors remain in place. So I think that -- we believe there are places where we can go across the borders with a more unified approach. And I'm sorry, David, I forgot the second question you asked. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : And then just in Germany, the pricing environment in Germany. Any challenge there? Any headwinds? John H. Hammergren: That's another good question. Our German operation or the German operation under Celesio in that market has -- there has been public discussion about the wholesaling pricing in that market, just to be clear about what pricing -- at least I think I'm talking about. The wholesalers in that market have been in a competitive battle with each other for some time. I think that the Celesio people, on their last public conference call, characterized it as stabilizing but not improving. I don't think I want to make any additional comment other than that. But clearly, that's what their view was the last time they spoke publicly about it. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : And then I saw you had a press release on a relationship with RedBrick. Can you maybe just comment on what that will provide to McKesson's clients? John H. Hammergren: Well, it's in our Technology business, and I have to say, it's a relatively small part of our portfolio. We do think it's important. We've been impressed with what the Redbrick people have to provide, but it won't really be anything material for McKesson at our scale. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes. Just understanding that we'll get formal guidance next quarter, I was wondering, John, maybe if you could share a little bit how you're thinking about the operating margin range, considering this year sounds like we'll be towards the upper end of the 200- to 250-basis-point range. Just trying to get a sense of how much of the drivers of the performance or outperformance this year do you think directionally are sustainable as we think about next fiscal year. And this is x Celesio, of course? John H. Hammergren: Sure, Robert. Thank you for the question. We have not contemplated our guidance for next year yet. As you know, we'll do that when we report our fourth quarter results in April. I believe that -- our view, however, as a company is that margin expansion is a priority. And clearly, as you see the P&L flow this quarter, we like to grow revenues in line with the market, or maybe faster if we can get a bigger share of our customer's spend, which is what we've been focused on with our generics. We like to get a very positive drop to our gross profit lines by managing our pricing carefully in the marketplace. So we are not giving it all away. And then clearly, we want to manage our expenses very carefully as well so that we can drop it to the bottom line. And that's what delivers a great business and a great business model. I see no reason to believe that we can't continue to focus on gross margin as a top priority. I don't see any negative mix change occurring in our business, and I think generics continue to be a propellant across the board if you think about our sourcing. And if you think about next year, we have another brand-to-conversion cycle, which will be helpful to us from a margin expansion perspective. It remains a priority. And as we -- hopefully, as I keep telling Paul Julian, when you get past the 250, we'll come up with a new goal for you, which he's always excited to discuss. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's fair. I guess just if I could flip one in on Medical, not to be lost, obviously, good results there as well this quarter. Understanding PSS has been a big part of the contribution of growth this fiscal year, we start to lap that next quarter. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what you're seeing on underlying growth within the medical business and what your expectations might be in that segment going forward? John H. Hammergren: I'm glad you brought up PSS. We have just a terrific franchise -- or I should say Med-Surg. We just have a terrific franchise and completing the PSS acquisition was an important step to market leadership in almost all -- in fact, all of the segments that we serve now in Medical. That integration is going very well. You saw the strength in the revenue, but I believe that those businesses' underlying growth, setting aside the acquisition, are all growing at or above the marketplace. And those are places where our value proposition really stands unique, and I think we have the ability to continue to grow share in home care, long-term care and our physician office business. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : John, how quickly can you proceed with an acquisition strategy for Celesio to really expand that platform? Do you have to wait a couple of years? Or is it something instantaneously you can put in place? John H. Hammergren: An acquisition on top of Celesio, is that what you were asking? Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Yes, building out the European or Latin American markets, wherever you might choose to go. John H. Hammergren: Well, it's probably a little premature for me to speculate on it, given that -- I think we need to do a close diagnostic on what position we are in, in each one of these markets and how well we're positioned to take on additional work in those markets. Celesio is a composite of 14 countries that are all managed in a very discreet way, and I would think each one of these countries should provide additional opportunities. So we have both an execution challenge we'd have to understand if we were to bring on additional acquisitions. And clearly, we have a balance sheet constraint that we've put in place that says we're not going to lose our investment grade, and we're going to manage our cash flow very carefully. So with those 2 caveats, I think we're open to acquisitions, into doing things, but we're not going to do it in a way that disturbs our integration plans at Celesio, and we're not going to do it in a way that would integrate -- or risk our investment grade rating. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. John H. Hammergren: Great. Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you for being on the call today. I'm really pleased with the operating performance of our business and excited about the future and our acquisition of Celesio. We're bringing on a great management team, a great group of employees and a great asset that will help us really build our company as we go forward. And I look forward to welcoming those teams as I travel throughout Europe in the next several months. This platform is important to us, and it's important to our customers. I'm now going to hand the call off to Erin for her upcoming review of upcoming events. Erin Lampert : Thank you, John. I have a preview of an upcoming event for the financial community. On February 25, we will present at the Citi Global Healthcare Conference in New York. We will release our fourth quarter earnings results in early May. Thank you, and goodbye. Operator : And that concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.",

(Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Erin Lampert :  Thank you, Talarie. Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2014 fourth quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6.00 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the Company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing fourth quarter fiscal 2014 results available on our Web site for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren:  Thanks, Erin, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call today. We reported results for the fourth quarter and full year that reflect strong operating results across all of our businesses. For the full year, revenues were up 13% to $137.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased by 31% over the prior year to $8.35. Fiscal 2014 was a year of exceptional execution across McKesson. There are many areas to highlight, but to name just a few we saw tremendous performance in our generics business, including strong growth in our proprietary OneStop Generics program. We delivered solid results from the first full year of the PSS World Medical acquisition and met or exceeded all of our year one integration priorities. We expanded our long-standing distribution agreement with Rite Aid to include the sourcing and distribution of all of Rite Aid's brands and generic pharmaceutical requirements. And we secured the acquisition of Celesio in a disciplined manner and established a platform for McKesson as a global leader in pharmaceutical distribution. In addition to these terrific accomplishments, we've generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow for the year another outstanding result. We successfully funded the acquisition of Celesio while maintaining a solid investment grade rating, and we invested $415 million in capital to support the growth of our businesses. I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in fiscal 2014, and would like to take this opportunity to thank the employees of McKesson for their dedication to our customers and their constant focus on delivering exceptional value in all they do. Today, we also provided fiscal 2015 guidance of $10.40 to $10.80 per diluted share and expected year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share of 25% to 29%, reflecting strong growth across our broad portfolio of businesses and the expected full year results of our acquisition of Celesio. We are at an exciting time in the 181 year history of our company. We have a solid portfolio of growing businesses that are performing very well. We have the financial strength and discipline to continue to invest in the growth that we expect across our businesses and we've positioned McKesson as a leader in the global healthcare supply chain by expanding our success of leading global sourcing capabilities and direct relationships with our manufacturing partners to deliver value to our customers. Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment. As we entered this election year healthcare topics remained in the spotlight both at Federal and State level. The long anticipated implementation of the key provisions of the Affordable Care Act were launched in recent months and I believe we are only at the beginning of the evolution we should expect to see in healthcare in the United States for years to come. With full suite of capabilities to help our diverse customer base navigate change we are actively engaged in supporting them as they evolve their business. Pharmacies are increasingly positioning themselves as convenient alternative sites for primary care and offering services to patients to assist them in managing their health. Payers and providers are collaborating in innovative ways to design effective value based reimbursement programs that will slowly shift our fee for service based approach to a care delivery to our payment for value approach tied to outcomes delivered by providers. And consumers are more engaged in understanding the cost and quality of healthcare than ever before. We see more health plans and employers offering effective incentives for preventive care as well as wellness programs to help people with chronic conditions manage their own health. Our customers continue to seek solutions to help them thrive in this dynamic environment. This includes solutions for reducing their costs, navigating evolving payment models, meeting increasing regulatory requirements and improving the quality and the customer experience. McKesson stands unique in the industry for the depth of our knowledge and the insight and the challenges and opportunities our customers face. It is our comprehensive and solution-oriented approach that sets us apart as we focus on providing value for our customers and in return creating customers for life. Moving now to some of the business results for our fourth quarter and full year. Distribution Solutions had another excellent year driven by strong execution in all of our businesses. In fiscal 2014, Distribution Solutions' revenue increased 13% and operating margins increased by 31 basis points over the prior year to 2.39%. North American distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada delivered strong results for the year led by outstanding performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. U.S. Pharmaceutical delivered tremendous growth in fiscal 2014 and led the strong expansion of our generics business. Our OneStop proprietary Generics program continues to deliver great value to our customers and we were pleased to see excellent growth during the year. More of our customers are buying more of their generics from McKesson, which also helped fuel the growth in our generic business in fiscal 2014. And as I mentioned earlier, we are extremely pleased with the trust and confidence that Rite Aid placed in McKesson by making the decision to expand their relationship with us to include the sourcing and distribution of all generic and brand pharmaceuticals, and I'm confident this agreement will deliver excellent value to both companies as we complete the transition over the coming months. In fiscal 2014, we've also continued to perform well for our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners and maintain steady levels of compensation in return. McKesson's global sourcing team continues to drive significant value for our Company and for our customers. Our team has developed innovative programs that help expand and foster strong partnerships with the best manufacturers across the globe. We are excited about the opportunities to continue to leverage this global sourcing capability as we expand our relationships going forward. And finally, I'd like to mention Health Mart. Health Mart continued its strong track record of growth during our fiscal 2014, ending the year with nearly 3,300 stores. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver innovative programs and services to our community pharmacy customers, and we are proud of our growing and thriving Health Mart community of pharmacists. In summary, the U.S. Pharmaceutical team had an excellent year and I believe the business remains extremely well positioned for continued success. Our Canadian distribution business delivered solid revenue growth in fiscal 2014. We expanded our business in Canada by winning new customers and growing our business with existing customers. And even in a tough generic pricing environment, we continued to see solid contributions from our Canadian business through efficient management of our distribution network, growth and investment in our Canadian specialty business and a constant focus on our customers' success. Finally, our specialty business delivered solid financial results through growth across our broad portfolio of specialty solutions. We made steady progress in the growth of the number of physicians who are part of the U.S. oncology network, and we also grew our core oncology distribution and services business. We experienced solid growth in services for other multispecialty areas and strong adoption of our proprietary technologies for these specialist physicians. Last year at this time, we were talking about the impact sequestration cuts were expected to have on medical oncology reimbursement. U.S. oncology continues to grow despite this headwind. One of the great advantages of our model is our ability to work with our physician partners to drive productivity and clinical advances across our network and that makes U.S. oncology a great place for physicians and an excellent care setting for patients. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services; upon achieving over 75% ownership of Celesio in February, we've begun to consolidate the financial results of Celesio into McKesson's financial results. Today, if you've seen our new reporting format, and going forward, the revenue results for Celesio reported and represented in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services line. I will remind you that while we've begun to consolidate the financial results of Celesio, we are still working through the domination process, which upon completion will allow us to begin to exercise operating control over the Company. We continue to believe that we will complete the steps required to register the domination agreement by the end of the first half of fiscal 2015. Upon achieving operating control of the Company, we can begin to work collaboratively with Celesio to implement our synergy plan. In the meantime, we've established a jointly staffed coordination office to begin important planning efforts in a number of functional areas. We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead with Celesio and at the same time, we are mindful of the hard work that is in front of us. In fiscal 2014, reported results include two months of revenue for Celesio and therefore our reported year-over-year growth in international pharmaceutical distribution and services will increase significantly throughout the year. That being said, for McKesson's fiscal 2015, we expect to underline full-year revenue growth of this business to be in the low single digits. Our medical-surgical business delivered strong results with 57% growth in revenues in fiscal 2014. The acquisition of PSS World Medical growth in our markets and terrific execution all contributed to this result. As I've mentioned all year, I've been extremely impressed with our team and the results they've delivered through the first year of the integration of this great business. Now as we look ahead, the team has begun an important phase of the integration which includes combining the distribution and IT infrastructure of the companies. We have ambitious plans that we think are very achievable for this phase of the integration and we have the best team in the business to carry it through to success. What has been most notable to me in this integration effort is our team's steadfast focus on ensuring we are providing the best value and most comprehensive set of solutions to our customers. For fiscal 2015, we expect revenue growth in the medical-surgical business to be in the mid-single-digits now that we have fully lapped the PSS acquisition. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our full year operating performance in Distribution Solutions, and I'm confident this business is very well positioned for the future. As we look ahead to fiscal 2015, we expect that revenue in Distribution Solutions will increase significantly driven by the acquisition of Celesio, and we expect operating margins to expand toward the upper end of our long-term margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points. Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the year, Technology Solutions revenues were up 5% to $3.2 billion. Full year adjusted operating profit was up 25% to $467 million. I'm pleased to report that we made progress in a number of key areas, including delivering solutions for value-based reimbursement, helping customers optimize performance and analytics and business intelligence, and we're making advances now in our connectivity and data interoperability initiatives. During fiscal 2014 we saw a solid growth in of our connectivity and payer-facing businesses, which serve as the foundation for the investment areas I mentioned earlier. And we continue to work with our customers as they deal with delays and the expected implementation of ICD-10 and meaningful use standards. Looking forward to fiscal 2015, we expect Technology Solutions revenue will decline modestly year-over-year, as growth in our connectivity and payer-facing businesses will be offset by an expected revenue decline in other areas. We expect that operating margins in Technology Solutions will expand in fiscal 2015 to the upper end of our long-term margin goal of mid-teens. In summary, we remain committed to helping our customers use information technology strategically to better enable business, better care, and better connectivity. To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a strong plan as we enter fiscal 2015 to reflex growth across our broad portfolio of businesses, and capabilities of propelled McKesson, as a global leader in healthcare services. We're in the business that continues to generate strong cash flow from operations. We expect that our cash flow from operations will be approximately $3 billion in fiscal 2015. I'm confident in our team's ability to continue to deliver value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders. We expect fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.40 to $10.80. With that I will turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results. James? James A. Beer:  Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. As you've just heard, we are very pleased by the strength of our results this quarter and for the full year. We've had a great year of operating performance including strong growth in adjusted earnings per share, record operating cash flow, and the acquisition of Celesio. Looking forward, we believe our strategic and operational execution during fiscal 2014 will set the foundation for continued adjusted EPS growth. Today, I will cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. I will also present guidance for fiscal 2015. As a reminder, we provide our guidance on an annual basis due to the seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter variability inherent in many of our businesses. Before I begin, there are three aspects of our financial results for our fourth quarter and full year that I would like to bring to your attention. First, our fourth quarter and full year results reflect the consolidation of Celesio\u2019s results for the two-month period ended March 31, 2014. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, McKesson's share of Celesio\u2019s net income for the two-months ended March 31 was offset by a charge to cost of sales associated with a reversal of a step-up to fair value of Celesio\u2019s inventory at the date of acquisition. Therefore McKesson's share of Celesio's results had no material impact on adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year. Second, as detailed on Schedules 3A and 3B, we have revised our revenue presentation for the Distribution Solutions segment. Celesio's revenues are presented within a new caption called international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Additionally, the results from our Canadian and U.S. pharmaceutical distribution businesses are now both included within a broader North America pharmaceutical distribution and services caption. This line also includes the revenues of our specialty business. Medical-surgical distribution and services business continues to be reported separately. Lastly, it is also important to note that Schedules 3A and 3B provide segment financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, but reflect 100% of the results of Celesio for the two months ended March 31 in accordance with U.S. GAAP. You'll recall that the non-controlling interest in Celesio is presented below our net income line as outlined on Schedule 1. Now let's move to our results. My comments today will focus on our full year fiscal 2014 adjusted EPS of $8.35, which excludes four items, the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. Now turning to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2A and 2B, consolidated revenues increased 25% for the quarter and 13% for the full year to $137.6 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 35% for the quarter and 26% for the full year to $8.6 billion, primarily driven by strong execution in our distribution businesses, market growth and our acquisitions of Celesio and PSS. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were up 50% for the quarter, driven mainly by our acquisition of Celesio. For the full year, excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions, total company adjusted operating expenses increased 5%. For fiscal 2015, we expect operating expenses will increase year-over-year driven by the acquisition of Celesio. Other income for the full year of $46 million was 35% higher than the prior year, primarily due to non-recurring gains in the fourth quarter. Full year adjusted interest expense increased to $28 million versus the prior year to $257 million. This increase was driven primarily by our acquisition of Celesio, including interest associated with our fiscal fourth quarter bond issuance of $4.1 billion, interest on debt used to initially finance the acquisition and interest on the debt acquired from Celesio. For fiscal 2015, we expect our year-over-year interest expense to be higher based on the new level of combined McKesson and Celesio debt. Now moving to taxes, for the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 35.2%. Excluding the impact of the Canadian revenue agency third quarter charge of $122 million, we ended the year with an adjusted tax rate of 31.2%. Our full year adjusted tax rate was lower than our expectations driven by favorable discrete tax items recognized during the fourth quarter that contributed approximately $0.11 to our adjusted EPS. Our share of Celesio's results during the quarter did not significantly impact our full year tax expense. Looking forward our fiscal 2015 outlook assumes an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31.5%. However this rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted net income for the full year totaled $1.9 billion and our adjusted earnings by diluted share totaled $8.35. Overall, this year's earnings per share benefited significantly from the strong performance in our U.S. pharmaceutical business specifically the favorable performance across our entire portfolio of generic pharmaceutical offerings. In addition, we realized a full year of contribution from our acquisition of PSS within our medical-surgical business. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to $233 million. This reduction was predominantly driven by $800 million in share repurchases completed late in our fiscal 2013. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2015 is $236 million. We have not planned for share buybacks in our FY 2015 plan. Particular FY 2015 capital allocation priorities include acquiring additional Celesio shares that may be put to us during our domination process and reducing our current degree of leverage, including planning for fiscal 2016 debt maturities. That being said, it is important to note that there has been no change to our historical portfolio approach to capital deployment, which includes a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. Distribution Solutions total revenues increased 26% for the quarter and increased 13% for the full year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by acquisitions completed during fiscal 2013 and 2014 and from market growth. During fiscal 2015, we anticipate Distribution Solutions revenue growth will increase significantly driven by Celesio. North America Pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue for the full year increased 7%, driven primarily by market growth and our mix of business. For fiscal 2015, we expect North America pharmaceutical distribution and services to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth compared to fiscal 2014. During the fourth quarter and full year, we recognized $4.8 billion of Celesio revenue in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services line. This line includes 100% of Celesio's revenues for the two months ended March 31, 2014. For fiscal 2015, on a constant currency basis, we expect low single-digit growth in the underlying annual revenues of Celesio. Medical-surgical revenues were up 28% for the quarter and up 57% for the full year, driven by the acquisition of PSS. We continue to perform well against our three-year synergy business case. During fiscal 2015, we will continue our integration efforts while delivering mid single-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 30% for the full year on a 13% increase in segment revenues, resulting in a 31 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin year-over-year. As we look ahead to fiscal 2015, we expect continued adjusted operating profit growth for the segment driven by our acquisition of Celesio, further progress on PSS synergies and the contribution from our generic drug distribution and services businesses. Specifically, our generics businesses will benefit from increased generic launches, expanded one-stop sales and the breadth and depth of our global sourcing efforts. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 39% for the full year, driven mainly by our acquisitions of Celesio and PSS. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our full-year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expense was up approximately 6% versus the prior year. Distribution Solutions full-year adjusted operating profit increased 30% to $3.2 billion and we ended the year with an adjusted operating profit margin of 239 basis points. In fiscal year 2015, we expect high single-digit basis point growth in the Distribution Solutions operating margin. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 1% for the quarter and up 5% for the full year to $3.2 billion as noted on Schedules 3A and 3B. Adjusted operating profit increased 138% for the quarter, primarily due to growth in higher margin revenues and the effect of $36 million in asset impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. For the full year, adjusted operating profit increased 25% to $467 million. Our full-year adjusted operating margin was 14.67% increasing 227 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a favorable shift in our mix of income. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased to 10% for the quarter, primarily driven by impairment charges incurred in the prior year and increased 3% for the full year. Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, we expect Technology Solutions revenues to decline modestly year-over-year as growth in our payor facing and connectivity businesses will be offset by a revenue decline in our Horizon hospital software business along with the impact of eliminating a low-margin product line. During the coming year, we expect to achieve a mid-teens adjusted operating margin, in line with the high-end of the range for this previously articulated long-term goal. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. Since only two months of Celesio\u2019s results were included in the quarter and year, I\u2019ll discuss our working capital metrics excluding Celesio. However, these metrics include the full year of results from our acquisition of PSS. For receivables, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 25 days. Our days sales in inventories decreased one day from the prior year to 32 days. Our days sales in payables increased to 53 from 51 days in the prior year. Our working capital metrics, along with our continued focus on cash generation, resulted in record cash flow from operations of $3.1 billion during our fiscal year. We ended the year with a cash balance of $4.1 billion, with $2.4 billion held offshore. Looking ahead, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2015. Internal capital spending totaled $415 million for the full year, which includes Celesio spending of $15 million for the two months ended March 31. For fiscal 2015, internal capital spending should be between $575 million and $625 million, with the increase being primarily driven by Celesio. Before concluding my remarks, I would like to briefly review some of the important aspects of our acquisition of Celesio. As discussed during our third quarter earnings call, we launched a tender offer for the remaining outstanding common shares of Celesio during our fiscal fourth quarter. This tender offer closed subsequent to the end of our fiscal year and consistent with our expectations only nominally increased our ownership in Celesio to approximately 76% on a fully diluted basis. With greater than 75% ownership in Celesio, we continue to expect that we will secure operational control late in the first half of our fiscal 2015. The current fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS guidance contemplates the anticipated transaction accretion and the modest synergies that we expect to derive from Celesio in the coming year. It is important to note that in our fiscal 2015 guidance, we have assumed that we own 76% of Celesio. We have also assumed an exchange rate of $1.36 per euro. Now, before I conclude, I would point out that in today\u2019s earnings press release, we detailed the key assumptions for fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.40 to $10.80. As always, our plan includes certain risks, but overall, we are very pleased with our outlook for the coming year. Our plan provides strong adjusted EPS growth from our continued operational and strategic execution, and allows us to create significant value for our customers, manufacturing partners, and shareholders. Thank you. and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Talarie? Operator : (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Steven Valiquette, UBS. Steven J. Valiquette \u2013 UBS Securities LLC :  Thanks, good afternoon. Just a question on the generic price trends. You had that \u2013 there was a bullet in the slide deck or in the press release about price trends on generics outside the exclusivity periods expected to be in the high single-digits, and you\u2019re saying that\u2019s a decline from the trend in fiscal 2014. So I just want to make sure; firstly, you\u2019re talking about growth there sort of declines, but also I think both of them I think are probably a lot higher than what I thought they were as far as the trend lines for fiscal 2014 and 2015. So I guess any additional color on what\u2019s going on there would be definitely helpful? Thanks. James A. Beer:  Well, as you say, the guidance that we have there in the press release talks about growth in FY 2015. It\u2019s between the high-single-digit realm. Yes, that is lower than the percentage growth that we saw for generics that are past that exclusivity period that we saw in fiscal 2014. So, it is a relative headwind year-over-year, but still growth for fiscal 2015 year-over-year. John H. Hammergren:  Steven, these are price trends, not the growth of the market overall. This is just the trend of price inflation on generics. So we do expect this year to be a good launch year for generics. Steven J. Valiquette \u2013 UBS Securities LLC :  Okay. For the quarter just reported though, was there pretty consistent trends in the March quarter versus what you saw back in the December quarter sequentially or was there a little bit of tapering off on some of the economics tied to that? Just curious on the sequential quarterly trend. John H. Hammergren:  Well, at the beginning of the year, we talked about the strength in the first half of the year and we expected that to moderate in the back half and that\u2019s exactly what we saw in our third and fourth quarters. Steven J. Valiquette \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Okay, perfect. Thanks. Operator :  We\u2019ll move on to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Thanks very much and good afternoon. John, I just want to make sure that I understood this correctly. Operational control late in the first half of 2015, but, just being conservative as far as the guidance goes on Celesio? John H. Hammergren:  Well, the operational control is a technical accomplishment that has to be reached after a shareholder meeting and a bunch of other things that we have to do from a European perspective or German perspective. So that is proceeding as we have planned. There is no change in our forecast when we expected to achieve operational control. As you recall, we wanted to have the 75% threshold, which we thought would enable this to happen in the timeframe that we\u2019ve outlined. We did pick up another percent in ownership from 75% to 76%, which is really also what we had expected. Our guidance that we talked about \u2013 we said in our guidance that Celesio was going to grow moderately this year including our first year modest synergies. So, I\u2019m not quite sure what portion of our guidance you\u2019re asking the question about. Is it the operational control, the ownership percentage or talk about the\u2026 Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Yes. Maybe just trying to understand that a little more clearly. So, you are talking about the operational control first half of 2015, but you are saying that ownership is at 76%. At 76%, you don\u2019t have operational control, isn\u2019t that correct? John H. Hammergren:  That\u2019s correct. We have to go through a couple of more steps. We don\u2019t believe there is any risk in us not obtaining operational control, but we don\u2019t have it automatically just from ownership. We don\u2019t need 100% to get operational control. So what will happen is, we\u2019ll get this operational control, which will allow us to be more interactive with the company than we can today, because we still have a responsibility with regard to operational control to manage the business independent of McKesson and that will change when we achieve operational control. The difference between 76% and 100% ownership is just how much of the earnings we actually consolidated in the end and that\u2019s what James was trying to describe. So we have 100% of the revenue in, we take out the minority ownership from an earnings perspective on that full schedule. Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. James A. Beer:  And I\u2019d just add to that if I could, the attainment of operational control towards the end of the first half of fiscal 2015 that allows us to really get going on the synergy business case. Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  And then just so I understand when you look at for example Celesio reported today and may talk about the German market reimbursement economics getting better. Are those trends that you are going to talk to us about John or James going forward and what are your overall thoughts on those markets right now? John H. Hammergren:  Well, it\u2019s difficult for us to talk about their view of their markets until we get operational controls. So I think you should expect us to be more open and perhaps, discuss more freely what\u2019s going on in the various businesses inside of Celesio and various markets inside of Celesio. Our view, I have spent a lot of time in Europe now with the country managers and I think Paul, and I both would share a point of view that business is run by professional managers we respect and admire what they are doing in many of their markets. And in their press release this morning, they did talk about the strength in their European pharmacy network activities and the strength in particular, Lloyds out of the U.K. and we certainly have seen some of that in our travels. I think it\u2019s probably difficult for us to speculate at this point what will happen with the German discounting in the outside our end of our fiscal year, which is really what they are referring to. Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you for the clarification. John H. Hammergren: Yes. Operator :  And next, we\u2019ll move to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Yes, hi, good afternoon. Some questions around the Rite Aid contribution, so how should we think of the ramp up for the Rite Aid distribution agreements throughout the year? Also, does guidance factor in improved economics to OneStop from your enhanced scale that comes with the Rite Aid contract? John H. Hammergren:  Thanks for the question, Ricky. The guidance we\u2019ve provided includes our entire outlook for the year. so it does include our view of the ramp-up of our relationship with Rite Aid. What\u2019s great about the Rite Aid relationship for both Rite Aid and McKesson is that we don\u2019t have any structural impediments to our speed to market and we were able to move very rapidly once that agreement was complete to work with our manufacturing partners to begin building momentum against the opportunity that lies ahead for all of us. I would say to you that I think we\u2019re substantially complete now with the work that we need to do with manufacturers. As to the rollout of the service offering to Rite Aid related to distribution of generics, we\u2019re very, very early in that process. We have only just begun the process of serving the Rite Aid stores or some of the Rite Aid stores with their generic requirements. Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Is that something that will take your full fiscal year to achieve? John H. Hammergren:  I think it will ramp up over the next half of the year. Next two to three months, we should be well into it. Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. John H. Hammergren: Yes. Operator :  Next, we\u2019ll move on to Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  Hey John, I just want to follow up on the generic question. Essentially, given that the Celesio revenues are now sort of being consolidated and you\u2019ve pulled Rite Aid into the fold, and I guess you answered this by suggesting that substantially you\u2019ve completed all the work with the manufacturers. I guess what I\u2019m kind of curious is, have you been able to take that incremental volume amount to the manufactures and start to renegotiate the terms of those agreements? And if you\u2019re not, are you starting to see some benefits today and if not, how long will that ultimately take? John H. Hammergren:  When I spoke about the Rite Aid implementation, the first step really was to bring the combined volumes of our corporations together and go to the marketplace to make sure that we are providing the best opportunity to the manufacturers to gain access to that share position. We are now in the process of implementing the generics actually into \u2013 the distribution business into Rite Aid, but the value for McKesson relative to the renegotiation should begin to be realized basically effective right now at the beginning of this fiscal year. I might note however that none of the Celesio synergies or volumes or generic purchases, et cetera have been included in any of this upfront work with the manufacturers. It\u2019s simply been McKesson\u2019s business that has continued to grow and thrive, including the incremental Health Mart stores we\u2019ve added, as well as the increment of Rite Aid generic bind that we were able to put together and complete \u2013 as I said, substantially complete the negotiations with manufacturers as we sit here today. And clearly, as we get into the late summer months, we should be reworking those relationships to include the Celesio volume as well. Glen J. Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  So James, and if I could just follow up on that Celesio accretion analysis. Essentially, when you guys first announced the deal, I think you suggested it\u2019d be a $1 to $1.20 accretive and that was with very modest synergies. Now that you have76% ownership, should we think about that year one accretion being in the $0.75 to $0.80 range with only moderate synergies because based on John\u2019s comments, it kind of sounds like the Company hasn\u2019t been able to bring those volumes into the fold and start to really exercise some of that synergy potential at this point. James A. Beer:  Well, we stand by the $1 to $1.20 of accretion for 100% of the ownership. Of course, as you say, we\u2019re only at 76% and that was for the first 12 months of operations, after beginning of February. So in essence, we got the first two months of that in the Q4, just finished and then the balance of the 10 months, we\u2019d be receiving in fiscal 2015. Now, the reason that we ended up net neutral in fiscal 2014 was because we had this one-time inventory write-up consistent with the acquisition accounting and so forth. Glen J. Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Okay, okay. Thank you. Operator :  Next, we\u2019ll move to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  Hey. Good afternoon, John and James. Thanks for taking the question, John; I don\u2019t know if I missed \u2013 if I didn\u2019t hear this properly. I didn\u2019t hear NorthStar mentioned in the prepared comments. I guess, can you provide any color on how Northstar\u2019s doing and when you\u2019ll have the chance to provide NorthStar products to Rite Aid and Celesio? John H. Hammergren:  We continue to make great progress with NorthStar and in fact, have launched a version of NorthStar that\u2019s called, Savant in Canada. And so both of those product lines are continuing to gain momentum. Now, clearly, we\u2019re working closely with the manufacturing community to make sure we\u2019ve got the best choice of product and the best choice of partners and the Rite Aid agreement does include NorthStar as one of the value offerings to both companies. As it relates to Celesio, which is probably premature to talk about, what we might be able to do with NorthStar or with the NorthStar model as it relates to many of the markets in Europe, but we clearly will have that as part of our evaluation as we get into that next phase. George R. Hill \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  Maybe a quick follow-up. A couple of your competitors are using JV or GPO type structures for the procurement of generic drugs. Is that something that makes sense to do with the inclusion of Celesio, or is the straight integration just McKesson buying the drugs directly from manufacturers and selling through the \u2013 I guess, through the supply chain, is that the right way? I guess, I\u2019m just trying to think about industry structure going forward? Thank you. John H. Hammergren:  No problem, George. We don\u2019t plan to have any JVs or any type of unusual structure to get access to the synergy we believe are possible, and there was no JV structure as it relates to Rite Aid, will not be one related to Celesio. It will be McKesson\u2019s sourcing operation that does all of the work. George R. Hill \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. John H. Hammergren: Yes. Operator :  We\u2019ll move on next to Steve Halper with FBR & Company. John H. Hammergren: Steve, are you on mute? Operator : Mr. Halper, your line is now open. Erin Lampert : Talarie, maybe, we\u2019ll move to the next question. Operator : Certainly, and we\u2019ll move on to the next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Charles Rhyee \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC:  Yes, thanks. Can you guys hear me? John H. Hammergren: Yes. Charles Rhyee \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, just going back to Celesio real quick. Obviously, you\u2019re going to the core process. You talked about a jointly staffed coordination office. Can you talk about specifically what then \u2013 is this more focused on the integration itself, or is this, as other people have kind of asked, more towards how you approach manufacturers? John H. Hammergren:  Well, it\u2019s a little bit of both. A part of that coordination activity is to make sure we\u2019re getting after the synergies that we think exist in the primary synergies we\u2019ve outlined in our conversations regarding Celesio is around product sourcing. so clearly, that\u2019s a top priority and those teams are already beginning to do some work. But as I said it really can\u2019t accelerate until we get pass this operational control phase. With the other part of the project management or coordination office role is to make sure that we understand what Celesio is working on today and what they might need our assistance with, things like IT or other kinds of projects that we might be able to lend a helping hand to. So, I would say that it\u2019s basically a process of understanding more completely Celesio\u2019s operations and corporate functions, so that work is under way. Charles Rhyee \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC:  Great. And as a follow-up James. I don\u2019t know if I saw it in the assumptions you gave on the guidance. Can you give us an estimate of, what sort of interest expense are you expecting for fiscal 2015? Thank you. James A. Beer:  Yes. We would expect interest expense to be rising year-over-year, consistent with the new debt that we took on to finance Celesio. So that is all publicly available and so I\u2019ll just leave at there at the moment. Charles Rhyee \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator :  We\u2019ll move on to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the question. Just wanted to go back, John, if I could to the generic inflation assumption in guidance. I know this has been a tailwind if you will for the last several years. It seems like Distribution Solutions, I was just curious, how much visibility do you have into this variable and given that your expectations are for it to moderate a bit into fiscal 2015. Just wondering what the main drivers of that in your view could be? John H. Hammergren:  Well, the inflation \u2013 just to remind the listeners, generics has been driven by a relatively small subset of the overall generic portfolio and a relative small subset of manufacturers. Like any other estimate that we have to make, whether it\u2019s brand inflation or generic inflation or generic launches, et cetera, what we attempt to do is use the best resources we have internal to the company and whatever resources are available externally to create those views. I think we were correct on our assumption that it was going to moderate in the back half of this year, of fiscal 2014 which it did, and we believe the assumption we\u2019ve given relative to FY 2015 is our best thinking as it stands today for what inflation will be. It certainly could be wrong, and the manufacturers don\u2019t typically tell us what they\u2019re going to do. One of the reasons we state our assumptions so clearly in our press release is, so those of you on the phone can create your own view of our assumptions, and provide that input into your own models as you reflect on what we\u2019ve done. But we still think it\u2019s going to be an important part of our 2015 performance. We expect it to still be very solid, and it just will be slightly less than we experienced in 2014. Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up within specialty. John, you continue to sound very pleased with the performance of U.S. oncology. I was wondering if you\u2019ve seen a shift at all in the site of care within oncology treatment? Any pressure in the marketplace for oncology treatment to be done more in the acute care setting? John H. Hammergren:  We do see that pressure. It ebbs and flows depending on the markets and where our physicians are based. I would say that the pressure is not coming from payers and it\u2019s not coming from patients. The pressure is usually driven by the purchase of a practice where a local hospital or hospital system decides to buy a group of oncologists that were customers of McKesson. And many times if the hospital is a customer of McKesson, we\u2019ll retain all of that business, clearly if it just go through standard distribution. But I think the beauty of the U.S. Oncology model is that, many times we\u2019re able to follow those physicians into the hospital setting and begin to manage the practices on behalf of the hospital, maybe you pick up net new physicians that are part of the network as the hospital relies on our expertise to continue to work with those doctors to optimize the quality of care and the cost of that care. So, although it continues to be something we have to pay attention to, and on occasion we\u2019ll lose a practice if a customer that goes into a hospital and we don\u2019t have any affiliation with the hospital afterwards and obviously, that\u2019s a net loss for us. But I would say the team has been very good at working with our customers in these transitions and retaining our position. Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks. John H. Hammergren: Yes. Operator :  We\u2019ll move on next to Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee. Greg T. Bolan \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.:  Thanks for taking the question. So just a few technical questions, James. Celesio, was it fair to say that it added about 700 basis points to total revenue growth in the fiscal fourth quarter? James A. Beer:  Yes. It added about $8 billion in revenue in fiscal fourth quarter. Greg T. Bolan \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.:  Okay, got it. James A. Beer: Yes. Greg T. Bolan \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, and then, I know obviously annual guidance is being given here and that\u2019s historically been the case, but just as you think about how the first half of the fiscal year will gate into the second half, obviously you\u2019ve got Celesio that will be coming on board from an earnings contribution perspective in the back half, as well as \u2013 well, I guess that was somewhat offset kind of a slight headwind from a little bit lower generic pricing increases. So, is it kind of fair to say, first half 45% of earnings and back half 55% of earnings, if we kind of think about the midpoint of guidance? James A. Beer:  Well, just one thing I misspoke on the Celesio revenue that was $4.8 billion in Q4, not $8 billion. Greg T. Bolan \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Got it, thank you. James A. Beer: So in terms of the mix of earnings during the year, what I would point to is that last year, we had particularly strong earnings in the first half of the year, year-over-year and that was driven by somewhat unusually high generic price increase activity. So returning in our fiscal 2015 plan to more the profile that we saw in fiscal 2013 back through fiscal 2011 that type of picture in some quarterly seasonality. Greg T. Bolan \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator :  We will move next to David Larsen, Leerink Partners. David M. Larsen \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC :  Hi, congratulations on a good quarter. For the $1 to $1.20 in Celesio synergies, can you just describe what the nature of that is and would that be expected to be achieved after domination is realized? Thanks. John H. Hammergren:  So that\u2019s an accretion number, not a synergy number. The synergy number was $275 million to $325 million realized over four years, with a modest impact this fiscal year. James A. Beer:  Yes. So the $1 to $1.20 of accretion is very largely just our share of Celesio\u2019s earnings. Now again, that always assumed 100% ownership and we only own 76% of the shares at this point. So it\u2019s important to factor that into account. David M. Larsen \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC :  And then the driver of the synergies $275 million to $325 million, can you just talk about the nature of those please? James A. Beer:  By far the most significant driver there are the purchasing synergies that we would look to be able to attain over time. As John said, we\u2019d look to get to $275 million to $325 million per year by year four. So, it will really be that procurement synergy effort that drives that to some modest amount of tank savings that we believe will be available as well. David M. Larsen \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC :  Great. Thanks a lot. John H. Hammergren:  So operator, I don\u2019t think there are any other questions on the phone. So, I think that we\u2019ll wrap this up. I want to thank all of you on the call today for your time. We certainly have a strong plan in place for fiscal 2015 and we\u2019re excited about the tremendous growth opportunities that are available to us across McKesson. I\u2019m certainly once again; proud of our track record in our delivery to our customers and the tremendous financial returns we\u2019ve delivered to our shareholders this year and for many years, and I also want to thank all of our tremendous employees for their effort this last year on driving that success for us. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Erin for a view of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin Lampert :  Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. We will participate in the UBS Global Healthcare Conference in New York on May 20th and the Goldman Sachs Healthcare Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes on June 11th. We will release first quarter earnings results in late July. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you and good-bye. Operator :  And everyone, that does conclude our conference call for today. Thank you all for your participation.",

Beer - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Analysts : George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. And now, your host for today's call, Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Lampert, please go ahead, ma'am. Erin Lampert : Thank you, Rufus. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2015 First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 9 :30 a.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2015 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks. And here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today we reported a strong start to fiscal 2015 with total company revenues of $44.1 billion with adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.49. Based on the strength of our Distribution Solutions results in the first quarter and our confidence in the full year, we are raising our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015. Before I begin my comments on our business performance for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on 2 items. First, I'm pleased with the outcome of the Celesio Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, which was held on July 15 in Stuttgart, Germany. As part of the standard German legal process, at that meeting, shareholders voted to approve the domination agreement between McKesson and Celesio. The domination agreement must be registered with the German courts in order to become effective. Before that registration can take place, minority shareholders may assert challenges, which may be based on substance or technical grounds. Anticipate that at least 1 challenge will be filed. Under German law, there is a limited period of time for such disputes to be heard. Based on our current assessment, we now expect that the domination agreement will be registered with the German courts and therefore, McKesson will be allowed to exercise operating control over Celesio at the end of the current calendar year. This time line represents a modest delay from our previous expectation that we would achieve operating control late in the first half of fiscal 2015. The second item I want to highlight is related to the sale of our International Technology business. Approximately 1 year ago, we talked about a number of actions to better position the company going forward, including our intention to sell our International Technology business. This business consisted of 2 main divisions : clinical and financial solutions, and workforce solutions. In July, we completed the sale of the clinical and financial systems portion of McKesson International Technology's business -- our McKesson International Technology business. The workforce solution division, which provides workforce and payroll solutions to the U.K. National Health Service, was not included as part of the sale. As a result, it was determined that this business would need to be reclassified from discontinued operations, where we reported the results in fiscal 2014, back into continuing operations for fiscal 2015. As part of the reclassification of this business, from discontinued operations to continuing operations, we recognized a pretax charge of $34 million or $0.11 per diluted share in our first quarter adjusted earnings results. It's important to note that our sole contract in the U.K.-based workforce solutions business with the NHS expires in late calendar 2015. We do not intend to rebid this contract going forward. And therefore, we'll continue to operate the business only to the end of the existing contract. Moving on to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions had a strong start to the year with revenue of $43.3 billion in the quarter, up 38%, adjusted operating profit of $1 billion, up 44%, and both are reported on constant currency basis.  North America distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, delivered strong results for the quarter aided by higher-than-expected revenue growth. Within North America, revenue growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business exceeded our expectations in the first quarter, driven primarily by strong demand for 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as well as solid growth across our independent national retail and mail order customers. Based on this revenue strength in the first quarter, we are now -- we now believe revenue growth in North America will be modestly ahead of our original expectations for the year. Within our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, we also experienced solid growth across our portfolio of generic and brand pharmaceuticals, driven in part by the timing of certain generic and brand price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally planned. It is important to note, however, our full year expectations for both brand and generic inflation remained unchanged. We continue to make solid progress in executing our new agreement with Rite Aid. And as you saw in our recent press release, I am delighted with the extension of our long-standing distribution relationship with CVS Caremark through June of 2019. As you know, we have a tremendous track record of delivering comprehensive supply chain solutions to CVS. We are proud to continue this valued relationship. Last week, we hosted our annual conference for retail independent customers, which brought together thousands of community pharmacy owners and pharmacists from across the country. This year's conference helped attendees understand the transformation in the market driven by an emphasis on patient -- positive patient outcomes, continued growth of preferred networks and a focus on the pharmacy's ability to impact important quality and patient satisfaction ratings. Our conference attracts a significant number of our Health Mart customers and we are extremely proud to have reached a milestone of more than 3,400 Health Mart pharmacy members. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in the first quarter and the great start to this fiscal year. Moving now to our specialty business. We had solid results in the first quarter with nice growth across the business. At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted the diversity of our specialty portfolio, where we are a leading service and technology provider across multiple specialty areas. It is this diversity of our broad portfolio that sets us apart. In particular, our model through U.S. Oncology provides comprehensive services across the spectrum of the cancer care. We're excited about the progress we continue to make in our specialty business and believe we are well positioned to continue to grow and innovate in this dynamic market. And our Canadian business had a solid start to the year with results that were in line with our expectations for the first quarter. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of 3% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we continue to move through the required steps to achieve operating control of the company. We now expect to achieve this milestone by the end of our current calendar year. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were $1.4 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 2% over the prior year. We're off to a solid start to the year in our Medical-Surgical business and we continue to make good progress optimizing our distribution network and technology platforms related to the acquisition of PSS World Medical. In summary, we are off to a strong start to the year in Distribution Solutions. We are extremely well positioned across all of our distribution businesses and we are confident in our improved outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology Solutions revenues were down 8% for the first quarter, driven primarily by anticipated revenue softness in our Horizon Clinical software platform and the disposition of our product line as we discussed on our last earnings call. Adjusted operating margins in this segment were 10.4%, which includes the $34 million pretax charge associated with the reclassification of a portion of our International Technology business from discontinued operations to continuing operations. Excluding this charge, adjusted operating margins for this segment would have been 15%. More broadly, we continued to made steady progress across our Technology Solutions businesses. Our first quarter results benefited from the steady growth profile of our RelayHealth Connectivity business, along with positive results in our physician services and medical imaging businesses. I also want to highlight the recent success of the CommonWell Health Alliance. Over a year ago, McKesson collaborated with several other organizations to demonstrate our leadership in finding solutions to address the issue of data interoperability in our industry. These companies recognized early on that pervasive connectivity cannot be accomplished by any one vendor. It must be implemented in a way that all vendors and systems can effectively participate. The CommonWell Health Alliance began with 5 founding members, all with a common goal, to change the standards of interoperability for the nation. And today, the alliance has grown to include a total of 11 members. Recently, the CommonWell members were able to demonstrate success through the launch of foundational services across 4 geographies, and in select pilot locations. The goal of the pilots was to validate the proof of concept and understand from the providers the ways in which we can continue to bring added value. We have been encouraged by the success of the pilots. And now CommonWell members, including McKesson, are gearing up for expansion and commercialization of the program with the foundational services provided by RelayHealth and a plan to continue to add members to the alliance. We are very pleased with the success to date and are looking forward, along with our partners, to the next growth phase for CommonWell. In summary, we continue to make solid progress in our key strategic priorities for McKesson Technology Solutions, including helping our customers reduce cost, operate more efficiently, providing our customers with solutions to drive improved analytics and supporting our customers' transformation to a world of value-based care. Now to wrap up my comments for our fiscal first quarter. The strength of our operating performance is reflected in our strong financial results for the quarter, which, I'll remind you, include the charge of $0.11 per diluted share as a result of the reclassification of a portion of our International Technology business to continuing operations. This was not contemplated in our original plan. In light of the strong operating performance, we are pleased with our improved outlook for the full year. And as I noted at the beginning of my remarks, we are raising our guidance by a range of $0.10, to $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015. In addition to the strength of our operating performance, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. In the first quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $182 million. And our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2015 remains unchanged from our original guidance. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment to continue to deliver value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to James. And we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James A. Beer: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a strong start to fiscal 2015. And as John discussed earlier, we are raising our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $10.50 to $10.90. Today, I will walk you through our first quarter financial results and provide an update on our acquisition of Celesio. Before I move on, let me remind you that in this quarter, both GAAP and adjusted earnings reflect the reclassification of a portion of our International Technology business, referred to as our workforce business, from discontinued operations back to continuing operations. Releases to the workforce business reclassification, we recorded a pretax charge of $34 million or $0.11 per share, largely representing a onetime catch-up of depreciation and amortization on the underlying assets as we move the business from discontinued to continuing operations. It is also important to note that fiscal '14 was recast to include the results of the workforce business. Schedule 9 provides a recast fiscal '14 consolidated and technology segment revenues. Revenues for the workforce business were $31 million during the first quarter of fiscal '14 and $147 million for the full year. Fiscal '14, as recast for the addition of the workforce business, includes $0.04 and $0.21 in contribution to adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter and full year, respectively, as outlined on Schedules 7 and 8. Now let's move to our results for the quarter. My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.49, which excludes 3 items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2. Consolidated revenues increased 37% for the quarter to $44.1 billion. On this 37% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 50% to $2.9 billion, driven by Celesio and the strong performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.9 billion were up 64% for the quarter, mainly driven by Celesio. Excluding the impact of Celesio, operating expenses increased 3% for the quarter. Other income was $21 million for the quarter. Interest expense increased 71% versus the prior year to $101 million, driven by debt issued and assumed related to our acquisition of Celesio. Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31.2%. As usual, I would expect this tax rate to fluctuate somewhat from quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted income for the quarter was $585 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.49. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1% year-over-year to 235 million. Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues increased for the quarter to $43.3 billion, up 38% on a reported and constant currency basis. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 14% to $34.3 billion, primarily reflecting market growth, including sales of 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of Hepatitis C, the delay of certain generic launches to later in the fiscal year and growth in our Canadian and specialty businesses. In addition, as John mentioned, in this quarter, we recorded solid growth across our portfolio of generic and branded pharmaceuticals, driven in part by the timing of certain generic and brand price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally planned. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 15%. Based on the growth we have seen, primarily from the sales of 2 hepatitis C drugs, we now expect that North America will be modestly ahead of our previous full year expectations of mid-single-digit revenue growth. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $7.6 billion for the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 3% on the underlying revenues of Celesio. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 2% for the quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 68% for the quarter on 38% revenue growth, resulting in 106 basis points improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. In addition to the Celesio acquisition, our first quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from favorable performance in our pharmaceutical portfolio, including earlier-than-expected generic and brand price increases that occurred late in the quarter. Our full year assumption for generic and brand price inflation remains unchanged. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 90% for the quarter, driven by our acquisition of Celesio. Excluding Celesio, operating expenses for the segment increased 4% year-over-year. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 232 basis points, an improvement of 9 basis points versus the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect revenue growth for our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business to be modestly ahead of expectations. Based on the anticipated mix of revenue in our North American business, we now expect operating margins to increase mid-single-digit basis points year-over-year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 8% for the quarter to $768 million. This decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform and the planned elimination of a product line, offset by growth in our other technology businesses. It is important to note that relative to fiscal '14's recast revenues, the workforce business revenues are expected to be down year-over-year. And as a result, we now expect segment revenues for the full year to decline by low single-digits year-over-year. As I discussed earlier, first quarter GAAP and adjusted results for Technology Solutions reflect a pretax charge of $34 million or $0.11 per share. $32 million of these charges reduced segment adjusted gross profit, while a further $2 million increased the segment's operating expenses this quarter. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 4%, driven primarily by restructuring actions taken in the prior year. First quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment was down 45% to $80 million, and the adjusted operating margin rate was 10.42%, representing a decrease of 692 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the workforce business charge, the adjusted operating margin rate was 15%. Based on the reclassification of the workforce business, we now expect the full year adjusted operating margin for the segment to be at the mid-teens level. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. In addition, this quarter's working capital metrics also include Celesio. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 2 days versus the prior year. Excluding Celesio, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 24 days. Our days sales in inventories were flat year-over-year at 31 days. Our days sales in payables were flat year-over-year at 50 days. Excluding Celesio, our days sales in payables increased 2 days to 52 days. We generated $182 million in cash flow from operations for the quarter. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.1 billion with $1.9 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $119 million for the quarter. Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2015 guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share from our original range of $10.40 to $10.80 to a new range of $10.50 to $10.90. In addition, we now expect $1.32 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.50 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude between $0.95 and $1.05 per share in LIFO-related adjustments. Before concluding my remarks, I would like to briefly review some important aspects of the next steps in our acquisition of Celesio. As John mentioned earlier, we now expect to secure operating control by the end of the calendar year. We continue to believe we can achieve the previously stated accretion range of $1 to $1.20 on an adjusted earnings basis during the 12-month period beginning February 2014. You will recall, however, that this range assumes 100% ownership. Our current ownership stake in Celesio remains at 76%. By the fourth year following completion of the required steps to obtain operating control, we continue to expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. In summary, McKesson delivered strong financial results during the first quarter and we are well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Rufus? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I guess, James, maybe I'll just ask a couple of questions about the guidance for back half of the year. Net of the IT charge, is it right to think about that you guys are actually kind of taking the guidance up by $0.20 considering the $0.11 -- or call it $0.21, given the IT charge kind of taken in the quarter? James A. Beer: Well, certainly, obviously, we do include that IOG charge, workforce business charge, in our adjusted earnings. So absent that, yes, we are upping the formal guide by $0.10. But in the first quarter, yes, you're right. We did absorb an $0.11 charge associated with that workforce business. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. I wanted to make sure I understood that quickly. And then maybe just a quick follow-up either for James or John. Generic drug price inflation has obviously been very strong in helping the performance of the IT business. I guess, can you talk about expectations for the back half of the year, given the strength that you saw in the front half of the year? John H. Hammergren: Well, we did think -- we do think there was some pull-forward, George, of our generic price inflation models for the full fiscal year, but we really don't change -- we haven't changed our outlook if you think about it on a full year basis. So I think right now it's early for our fiscal year, but we believe that the guidance we gave you at the beginning of the year is still reasonable. Operator : And for our next question, we go to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I was wondering if maybe if we look at the overall drug distribution revenue, and then, John, I think you talked about the Hep C drug. But if you back out Hep C in the quarter, can you maybe give us an idea of what you're seeing for underlying utilization and any early signs of ACA? We see Rite Aid just reported this morning again strong results on the pharma side. So I'm just wondering what you're seeing in your model. John H. Hammergren: Well, it's difficult to account for what the Affordable Care Act effect is in our business. We came into the year believing there would be some modest effect from it and we still believe that's the case. We really had strength across the entire segment of Rx revenues, Canada and Specialty, in particular, came in very strong for us. So I think we're pleased with the momentum that we have. And as you mentioned, the Hep C drugs were also a surprise to us, of how quickly they've been taken up, and the volumes that we received there. So I think, overall, we're pleased with the performance of the revenues in that business. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then, John, just as a follow up, you mentioned the extension of your relationship with CVS. Are there any changes of note to that new relationship that goes through 2019? John H. Hammergren: It's basically the same form that we've had with them in the past in terms of the service and the relationship. So we're pleased to have renewed it, and we think it continues to show the quality of the service and the relationships we have with our customers. Operator : And we go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : A couple of questions here. First of all, I think, I heard the comment on the operating margin now expected to grow at mid-single due to mix. So can you guys just give us some more color on the underlying kind of like revenue mix and kind of like what you've seen that was different in your expectations? James A. Beer: Yes, the driver of my comments around the Distribution Solutions' operating margin is really the impact of the Hep C drugs that we saw really having a very strong rollout in this last quarter, and that is what's driving the margin effect. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then just kind of like a quick follow-up. On kind of like just the Rite Aid generic contract, I know -- I think you said that you expect to see the benefits flowing through in the September quarter, so is this still kind of like -- is timing still consistent with your earlier expectations? John H. Hammergren: We're really pleased with the continued performance in our relationship with Rite Aid. I would say that our contract negotiations are -- have progressed the way we had anticipated. The conversation around September was probably more focused on our delivery of generics to their individual stores. So we are probably better than halfway through the implementation of store delivery of generics directed by McKesson, and that will continue to evolve until we have 100% of that responsibility as we get to the fall time frame. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And in terms of contribution to your bottom line, should we see that in the following quarter? John H. Hammergren: I think you -- our guidance anticipates the effect of Rite Aid's business flowing through McKesson. And so I -- other than the dilutive effect, it has been a bit of a surprise from Hep C from a margin rate perspective. The rest of the performance of the business is right in line with our expectations. Operator : We'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : John, I just want to talk to you about the North American Distribution business. The company continues to post very solid results in that segment and if I hear you correctly, obviously, specialty sort of helped the revenue line maybe volumes also helped the revenue line. But if I filter that down to the operating profit line, we're still seeing very sizable beats. And I'm wondering if you could help us sort of think through what might really be driving that better-than-expected result. Is it the branded and generic price inflation being pulled forward? Is it the volumes? Or -- we're not really sure what the margins look like on the specialty drugs you're talking about. So any sort of help in triangulating what's really driving that operating profit would be helpful. John H. Hammergren: I think it comes from many of the sources that you just highlighted. Clearly, the brand and generic performance in the quarter was very strong. We're pleased with the revenue growth we received, in particular, out of Canada and in Specialty. But even our standard Rx business has been supported by robust growth really across-the-board. And the continued uptake of our generic portfolio, the strength of Northstar, our ability to continue to bring market share to our customer base and the strength of OneStop, our generic program in our markets, continues to remain very strong. So I really feel like the businesses in North American pharmaceuticals are performing very well. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Maybe I'll just follow-up on Celesio. Obviously, they're out with operating results this morning and kind of looking through those results, it seems like maybe some of the segments might have performed a little bit better while some of the other segments continue to be -- face some challenges that I think you've talked about in the past. But maybe could you give us some high-level commentary about maybe what you thought of the results? And is everything kind of performing relative to where you would have expected? John H. Hammergren: Yes, I think so. Overall, we're basically in line with our expectations. As you noted, in their comments, they've talked a little bit about where their strength is coming and where some of their weaknesses are. And I think that their commentary is generally in line with what we expected. Operator : Our next question, we go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So I just wanted to go back to guidance, a couple of moving pieces here relative to the previous communication. Am I correct to assume that there was some slight synergies assumed previously from the timing of operational control of Celesio and would that now not be included in the new guidance range given the pushout of the expectation on operational control? And then on the International Technology business, I understand that you're absorbing the $0.11 charge. But as we think about the balance of the year, are there corresponding earnings from that business that come back into the P&L? James A. Beer: Yes, so on the first of your questions, what we've spoken about in the past was that we expected just a modest amount of synergies from Celesio during fiscal '15. So yes, at some level, the pushout of operational control by a few months does have some impact on that. But again, they were modest expectations in the first place, I just want to emphasize that. And in terms of the workforce business and the impact later in the year, I would expect that, that would continue year-over-year because again, we've recast history. So we have all of that in the schedules to the press release. I would expect that, that would continue to create something of a headwind year-over-year for the balance of the fiscal '15. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's helpful. And then, John, I guess just on the cash deployment, I understand you got probably about 1.5 on hold for Celesio and there's some debt redemptions over the next 18 months. But still a lot of cash with over $4 billion on the balance sheet today, solid cash flow again. Anything you can give us around how we should think about that cash being returned to shareholders or any perspectives on the M&A landscape at this point? John H. Hammergren: Well, as you point out, there are a couple of uses of the cash that we already have sort of planned into our future. One is the purchase of the remaining outstanding shares of Celesio. We still have 24% left to accumulate, which we believe will happen over time, as well as the debt repayment that we've committed to accomplish as we go forward. We want to remain investment-grade, as we've indicated. And that, as a backdrop, will probably cause us to continue to have a portfolio approach to our capital deployment. But it doesn't mean that we won't return to shareholders, through dividends and share repurchase, some of that cash. But what it does mean is that our priority is to make sure we maintain investment grade and that we avail ourselves of opportunities from an M&A perspective that make sense, which we've done on a regular basis. Operator : And we go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So a couple of quick ones here. First the 2% revenue growth in the Med-Surg distribution segment, is that an indicative of a normalized run rate that we should expect maybe for the rest of the year? John H. Hammergren: Well, I think that we believe the Med-Surg business is growing in line with our original expectations. So we think mid-single-digits is probably where we're going to be. So it's a little softer in the quarter than we would have -- we would forecast for the full year. And I think the softness is really in line with what we believe the market performed at for the first [indiscernible] for us. And I have to emphasize that we're really pleased with the continued progress of Med-Surg. From an integration perspective, we are really accomplishing our objectives there, and the team is doing a good job. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then just quickly, you guys had that previous commentary about the percent of earnings in the first half of '15 being similar to fiscal '11 through '13 and I know that was kind of loose sort of guidance or commentary previously. But is that still relevant with these 1Q results or does that sort of go out the window with the strength of 1Q? James A. Beer: Well, I think what I'd say is I'd stick to the annual guide that we've offered. I think given the quarter-to-quarter volatility in our results, it's hard to give directional assistance to you just for a single quarter. And I think this quarter is a good example of that. We saw some price increases both on the branded side and on the generic side move up into this quarter earlier than we had planned. And then also, we saw some of the brand-to-generic conversions that we were expecting pushed further back towards the end of fiscal '15. So I think I'd really just align you to the overall annual guide. Operator : And for our next question, we go to Ross Muken with ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : So it's now been a pretty remarkable period for the company. I mean you obviously had the Celesio acquisition, the Rite Aid agreement. It sort of shows the value you can provide to some of your larger customers. How has that sort of begat discussions with other customers you have in terms of the McKesson value proposition and how you can obviously then prove that you can obviously provide more value to kind of the broader universe as well? John H. Hammergren: Well, we think our early success with the implementation of the Rite Aid relationship as well as our continued performance in these businesses is an indication of our customers' reliance on our ability to work in partnership with them to deliver superior results. And I think we continue to work with those customers that have not fully availed themselves of the offerings that we have to make sure that they understand the kind of results we think we can obtain together and to help them quantify, not only the savings from sourcing with us, but also the savings associated with having us manage the logistics requirements associated with the purchase of product as well. And there's still significant customers that are somewhat redundant with us related to those deliveries that we think afford both of us opportunities. Having said that, these are big strategic decisions that have to be made and it'll take some time for some customers, I think, to reach the same conclusion that others have already reached. But I think our performance, as the first quarter shows, is an indication of customers' continued reliance on our ability to help them on many dimensions, including sourcing of products. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : That's helpful, John. And maybe just on Technology Solutions I mean, this has been a bumpy ride now for quite a while and I know you've done a lot to sort of scale-down some of the clinical pieces where you've struggled. But as you think about the investment in this space and you think about the footprint, I mean -- so what is, at the board level and at the management level, what is the debate on sort of longer-term aspirations and goals for certain businesses? And then how do you -- how did you figure out what needed to go versus what needed to stay and how does that sort of affect how you're going to continue to look at the portfolio, I guess, going forward? John H. Hammergren: Well, if you set aside the surprise we had, so to speak, going into this quarter, which was the lack of our ability to exit the portion of the international operations business that we had related to the workforce and to run that contract out as opposed to selling it, if you set that aside and you actually look at the performance of the business, it's basically in line with our expectation. And what we've been focused on there is making sure that we have the appropriate operating margin for businesses of this type. That we're growing the earnings of the business in a way that's responsible and reflects the opportunity that we see in front of us. That the growth coming from the positive businesses in that segment are able to offset the drag associated with businesses that are not growing, as we know that they won't in certain categories there. In particular, the Horizon Clinical business that we're in the process of winding our way out of. And I would say that the last dimension that's important to us is these businesses are significant cash producers for us and I think the management team knows how to operate them. So the bumpiness on occasion is caused by things like IOG that we didn't fully expect to roll back into operations, and we'll work our way through that as well. I think at the portfolio level, we have a responsibility to look at this business as well as all of our businesses, not so much in the aggregate in the way that we report them, perhaps. But if you disaggregate them, there are a lot of the smaller businesses and product lines that make up these 2 large segments -- or 3 large segments now. And I think what we're focused on is how do we make sure that we've got the right portfolio of products and services in those segments to grow the business. Operator : And for our next question, we go to Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee. Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Guys, I apologize if I missed this. But for the quarter, James, just thinking about the 14% North America pharmaceutical distribution business, what do you believe was the contribution from the Hep C launches for the quarter, just in terms of contribution to growth rate? James A. Beer: Well, you've seen Gilead announce their results, and I'd just say that directionally, our revenues coming out of Sovaldi, for example, would have been in line with the overall market share across the 3 big distributors in this country. Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's fair. And then just lastly, on the same topic, as it relates to kind of the margin dilution, if you will, year-on-year from the launch of the Hep C drugs, any noticeable impact just in terms of stomping margin expansion for the distribution solutions segment? James A. Beer: Well, the guidance that I offered a little earlier, mathematically it represents a very modest reduction in margins for Distribution Solutions. And obviously, those have been going up consistently in recent years. And at Analyst Day, you'll recall that we reset the long-term margin goal for Distribution Solutions up to between 250 and 300 basis points. So modest impact from these Hep C drugs in the short term. Operator : And for our next question, we go to John Ransom with Raymond James. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Sorry to keep beating this horse, but one of your competitors mentioned that generic inflation was higher this year than they thought versus expectations of being lower. You talked about it just being more price pull-throughs earlier than expected, how do you -- how do we square those 2 comments? Has inflation, in fact, been higher than you expected or is it really just timing? John H. Hammergren: I can't really comment on other's -- other people's comments. But what I would say is that I would reflect on the fact that we all have different fiscal years. We all have different portfolios of generics. We have different proprietary programs in the generic world. We have different relationships with generic manufacturers. And having said all of that, our point of view on generic price inflation for our fiscal year remains unchanged from the guidance we gave you at the beginning of our fiscal year. The only thing that we really tried to clarify in this call was that we believe some of that inflation was pulled forward in the first quarter, but our full year remains sort of intact with our previous view. So I know that it's a complex, complex discussion to have. Just also makes it even more complex when we're trying to forecast the behavior of others in the channel where we don't have complete visibility. So it's -- frustrating, as it may be to you sometimes, we can't tell you what our goal for generic inflection will be for 12 months out. But frankly, it's a little bit of a black box for us as well, and have to make educated and informed estimates as to what we think will happen. And sometimes, those estimates are off either from a timing perspective or from a magnitude perspective. And what we're saying here is that really we're seeing some timing differences. But the magnitude, we think, will remain relatively the same. James A. Beer: Yes. And that magnitude that we talked about when we offered the guide for fiscal '15 was high single-digit growth year-over-year. Operator : And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions on our roster. Therefore, Mr. Hammergren, I will turn the conference back over to, sir. John H. Hammergren: Thank you, Rufus, and thanks to all of you on the call and for providing some time today to listen to our results. I'm pleased with our strong first quarter performance. We're certainly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of all of our employees and their contributions to these great results. Now I'll hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin? Erin Lampert : Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On September 9, we will present at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference in New York. On September 30, we will present at the Leerink Partners Healthcare Services Roundtable in New York. And on November 11, we will present at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. We will release second quarter earnings results in late October. Thank you, and goodbye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Erin Lampert : Thank you, Melissa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for our investors. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2015 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks. And here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid results for our second quarter with total company revenues of $44.8 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.79. We've seen strong execution across all of our businesses, and I'm pleased with the great performance of our team in the first half of the fiscal year. We remain confident in our outlook for the full year and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015. Before I begin my comments on our business performance for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on our acquisition of Celesio. Currently -- excuse me, approximately, 1 year ago, we announced our intention to acquire Celesio, the former global leader in health care services, by bringing together the strengths and expertise of 2 companies with complementary geographic footprints, shared values and common histories as trusted partners to our customers. The next important milestone in bringing together our 2 companies is the registration of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with a relevant German court, which we continue to expect by the end of calendar 2014. The registration of this agreement will effectively allow McKesson and Celesio to begin our cooperative work to develop and deliver the synergy case we have outlined, where we expect to achieve 277 -- $275 million to $325 million in annual synergies by the fourth year following the registration of the domination agreement. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead of us to continue to lead in an increasingly global pharmaceutical supply chain and to enhance our customer's ability to deliver better and more efficient health care services. Moving now to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions had strong results in the second quarter with revenues of $44 billion, up 37%, and adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion, up 29% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Based on the strong revenue trends we have seen year-to-date, we now believe full year revenue growth in North America will be in the low double digits, driven primarily by strong demand for recently launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C and the timing of certain generic launches, which will come later than we had originally planned. We also now expect adjusted operating margin for the Distribution Solutions segment to be flat to modestly up year-over-year, driven primarily by our expectation they will have a much stronger mix of branded pharmaceutical business in fiscal 2015 compared to our original plan, specifically driven by the higher-than-anticipated revenue from hepatitis C drugs and the delay in certain generic launches. Our updated full year outlook for Distribution Solutions operating margin also includes an assumption that margin in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business will come down modestly from the prior year. North American distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, delivered strong results for the second quarter. Within North America, revenue growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business exceeded our expectations in the second quarter, driven by the continued strength and demand for 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C as well as solid growth across our hospital, national retail and independent customers. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business continues to innovate and expand the boundaries of operational excellence in everything we do for our customers and our manufacturing partners. We perform an essential and valued service for our branded manufacturing partners and continue to earn steady levels of compensation in return. We also benefit from the growth across our portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals, where we are extremely well positioned with our customer-focused proprietary programs and the value we provide across our extensive generic offerings. We continue to see strong growth in our proprietary OneStop Generics program as a growing number of our customers benefit from the strength and scale of McKesson's sourcing expertise. An important addition to our OneStop program in the first half of the fiscal year has been the volume associated with Rite Aid. I'm very pleased to report that during the quarter, we completed the operational transition associated with the implementation of our expanded agreement with Rite Aid, which we first announced back in February. I want to recognize the outstanding efforts of our U.S. Pharmaceutical team and the team at Rite Aid for successfully completing the transition, with a clear focus on ensuring great service through Rite Aid stores. McKesson's direct-to-store deliveries to all of Rite Aid's more than 4,500 stores helps to ensure operational efficiencies, excellent service levels and improved product availability for Rite Aid's customers. Our expanded agreement with Rite Aid is delivering the savings envisioned by both organizations by driving additional efficiencies in the distribution and sourcing of pharmaceutical products and the significant savings associated with improved working capital utilization. Our team does an outstanding job day-in and day-out by aligning our interests with our customers' interests, and we know that their success is our success. The strength, skill and scale of McKesson's global procurement team ensures we are providing our customers with the results that are better than they would have achieved on their own, with the highest levels of product quality and availability. By working together with our customers, we are able to truly create a winning formula that delivers savings and efficiencies in the delivery of pharmaceutical products. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in the second quarter and the outstanding results we have delivered in the first half of the fiscal year. Turning now to our Specialty business. We had another quarter of solid results and we continue to see strong growth across the business. I'm pleased with the growth in our oncology business, where we are focused on delivering the highest-quality cancer care in a payment model that rewards value. And we continue to see growth in our other specialties, such as ophthalmology and rheumatology, where we believe we can leverage our distribution and sourcing expertise along with our technology assets to help ensure specialist physicians continue to grow their practices and deliver high-quality care to their patients. And our Canadian business had another solid quarter with the results that were in line with our expectations. We continue to grow our Canadian business through our focus on operational excellence, ensuring we have an optimized and efficient distribution infrastructure in place, investing in important and growing markets, such as Specialty Services and Distribution, and growing our presence in private label generics in the Canadian market. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the second quarter were $7.3 billion, an increase of 4% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant currency basis. As you may have seen in Celesio's results announced this morning, we continue to expect revenue to increase modestly year-over-year on the underlying results of Celesio and now expect a modest decline in operating profit year-over-year, driven by market pressure in Germany, France and Brazil, partially offset by continued strong performance in our U.K. businesses. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were $1.5 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 4% over the prior year. Our Medical-Surgical team continues to do an excellent job with the integration of PSS, bringing together and optimizing the sales, distribution and information systems platforms within the business. Integration and our pursuit of synergies from the acquisition remain on schedule and in line with our expectations. Critical to our success to date has been the significant progress we have made in our integration efforts while maintaining strong momentum with our customers. We continue to make great strides leveraging the best sales force in the industry to serve our customers and drive strong performance in our customer service and satisfaction across the expanded customer base. In summary, I am pleased with the strong second quarter results in Distribution Solutions. Technology Solutions' revenues were down 6% for the second quarter, driven primarily by anticipated revenue softness in our Horizon Clinicals software platform and the disposition of a product line as contemplated in the original guidance we provided for fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating margin in this segment was 18% in the quarter, primarily due to favorable revenue mix and timing. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin in the mid-teens for the Technology Solutions segment. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in our Technology Solutions portfolio and the year-to-date improvement we've seen in the core operating margin profile of this segment. Last quarter, I provided an update on the CommonWell Health Alliance, where McKesson and the other members are pioneering solutions to lead our industry in addressing the issue of data interoperability, to make health information available to the providers who need it when they need it, regardless of where the care occurred. I continue to be encouraged by the Alliance's ability to demonstrate real-world progress, including the continued addition of new members across the health care ecosystem, successful pilots in 4 geographies, demonstrating real-world data exchanges across disparate systems and most recently, a multiyear agreement for nationwide commercialization of the services, with the core services being provided by RelayHealth. At McKesson, we are committed to improving health care through data interoperability. Our systems are built on open, contemporary architectures that are low-cost and easy to implement for our customers. The CommonWell Health Alliance members join us in making data available to providers in their current systems, expanding down their current investments without having to replace their existing systems. As McKesson and other CommonWell members now look to drive nationwide deployment and expansion, we continue to encourage other organizations to help lead our industry and our country in moving the information between platforms to enable better patient care. In summary, we will continue to focus on our key strategic priorities for Technology Solutions : including helping our customers reduce cost and operate more efficiently; providing our customers with solutions to drive improved analytics; and supporting our customer's transformation to a world of value-based care. Now to wrap up my comments for fiscal Q2. I'm pleased with our results for the second quarter and the strong execution across all of our businesses in the first half of the fiscal year. We remain confident in our outlook for the full year, and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015. In addition to the strength of our operating performance, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. For the first half of the fiscal year, we've generated cash flow from operations of $165 million, and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2015 remains unchanged from our original guidance. With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James A. Beer: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter results and our performance in the first half of fiscal 2015. Before reviewing our second quarter results, I'd like to address a request from some of our investors related to the impact of foreign currency rate movements on our results. As you might recall in our original guidance for fiscal 2015, we assumed an exchange rate of $1.36 per euro for the full year. For the first half of the year, the average exchange rate was in line with this assumption and thus, foreign exchange did not have a material impact on either our first or second quarter results. However, given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we are now assuming an average exchange rate during the second half of our fiscal 2015 of $1.27 per euro. This would drive a full year average exchange rate of $1.31 per euro. This equates to a negative foreign currency translation impact of approximately $0.04, net of the Celesio noncontrolling interest, during the back half of our fiscal year. However, as John mentioned, we are maintaining our full year outlook for adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $10.50 to $10.90 per diluted share. Now let's move to our results for the second quarter. My remarks today will focus on our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.79, which excludes 3 items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues increased 36% for the quarter to $44.8 billion. On this 36% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 46% to $3 billion, driven by Celesio and the strong performance of our other Distribution Solutions businesses. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.9 billion were up 59% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of Celesio, operating expenses increased 1% for the quarter. Other income was $23 million during Q2. Interest expense increased 68% versus the prior year to $99 million, driven by debts issued and assumed related to our acquisition of Celesio. Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 32%. As usual, I would expect this tax rate to fluctuate somewhat from quarter-to-quarter. As a reminder, we still expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 31.5%. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $658 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.79. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1% year-over-year to 235 million. Now let's turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Distribution Solutions' segment revenues increased for the quarter to $44 billion, up 37% on a reported and constant currency basis. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 14% to $35.1 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 15%. Current quarter revenue growth primarily reflects higher-than-expected demand for Sovaldi and Olysio, 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C, market growth and our overall mix of business. For the year, we are forecasting higher-than-planned branded drug sales, which reflect our strong market demand for the 2 hepatitis C drugs and delays in certain generic launches, including Nexium and COPAXONE. As a result, we now expect that our North America revenue will increase by a low double-digit percentage for the full fiscal year. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $7.3 billion for the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 4% on the underlying revenues of Celesio. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 4% for the quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 58% for the quarter on a 37% revenue growth, resulting in an 80 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin, driven by our acquisition of Celesio and market growth. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 88% for the quarter due to our acquisition of Celesio. Excluding Celesio, operating expenses for the segment increased 4% year-over-year. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 242 basis points, a decline of 15 basis points versus the prior year, driven by a higher mix of branded drug sales, including the effect of the hepatitis C drugs and the brand to generic delays that I just mentioned. Excluding the impact of both hepatitis C drugs, segment-adjusted operating margin was approximately 250 basis points for the current quarter. As a reminder, for the full year, our expectations for branded and generic drug price inflation remain unchanged, although we expect some variability in the impact of pharmaceutical prices from quarter-to-quarter. Based on the impact of the 2 hepatitis C drugs and the delayed generic launches as well as our assumption that operating profit in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business will be down modestly year-over-year, we now expect full year Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin to be flat to modestly up over the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $770 million. This decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, the planned elimination of a product line and the wind-down of our U.K. workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 5%, driven primarily by restructuring actions taken in the prior year. Despite the anticipated decline in segment revenues, second quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment was flat at $139 million. And the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 18%, representing an increase of 102 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was based on a favorable revenue mix in the second quarter as well as the effect of reduced expenses. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. In addition, our working capital metrics also include Celesio. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 2 days versus the prior year. Excluding Celesio, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 24 days. Our days sales in inventories were flat year-over-year at 30 days. Our days sales in payables increased by 1 day year-over-year to 49 days. Excluding Celesio, our days sales in payables increased 3 days to 51 days. We generated $165 million in cash flow from operations during the first 6 months of fiscal 2015. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.8 billion, with $2.1 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $272 million for the first half of fiscal '15. Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, our fiscal 2015 guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $10.50 to $10.90 is unchanged but now assumes a second half $1.27 per euro exchange rate. Before I conclude, I will make a few remarks regarding our acquisition of Celesio. As John mentioned, we continue to expect that we will achieve operating control of Celesio by the end of calendar 2014. By the fourth year after obtaining operating control, we continue to expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. And finally, with respect to our expected GAAP earnings per share for the full year, we now expect $1.32 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.57 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude between $0.97 and $1.07 per share in LIFO-related adjustments. In summary, McKesson delivered strong financial results during the first half of fiscal 2015, and we are well positioned for the second half of our fiscal year. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Melissa? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : John, can you maybe just talk about drug price inflation in the quarter on the Generics side? The last few quarters, it's been pretty strong, but I didn't hear you specifically call it out in this quarter. Is there anything that's changed? John H. Hammergren: As we chatted on the first quarter, we believe that some of our second quarter inflation was pulled slightly ahead into the first quarter. Our outlook for the year remains unchanged, down slightly from the inflation rates we experienced last year but still pretty robust. So the second quarter came in line with exactly where we thought it would be when we finished the first quarter comments. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then James, just a numbers question. If I listen to what you said around the delay in Nexium, COPAXONE and the foreign currency, am I right thinking that versus your initial expectations that those things combined are somewhere in the neighborhood of a $0.10 headwind versus the initial guidance that you gave us? James A. Beer: Well, in terms of the initial guide, certainly -- obviously, we're reaffirming the guide that we've outlined earlier in the year so we feel very comfortable with the range. We have been surprised by the strength of the hepatitis C volumes. And they come along with lower margins, as I intimated. Without those 2 hepatitis C drugs, our margin would have been right around the 250 basis point level for Distribution Solutions. So hopefully, that gives you some sense as to the impact of those hepatitis C drugs on our quarter. So that was really an important driver, but overall, we still feel good about the guide even though we have the $0.04 currency headwind that I mentioned as well. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Right. As well as the delay in the Generics, right? James A. Beer: Yes. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So the combination of those, that's an incremental headwind to what we would have expected post last quarter? James A. Beer: Yes, that's right. So we referred to generally strength in branded pharmaceutical sales in terms of the mix. And those delays of products like Nexium and COPAXONE are important drivers within that theme. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Could you speak to the way that you're looking at the noncontrolling interest and your willingness to put cash to work as long as the noncontrolling interest is outstanding? I guess more specifically, do you think that your minimum cash balance, as long as the interest is out, has to encapsulate it? Does it need to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion-plus, whatever it takes to run the business. Or if this looks like it's going to go on for a long period, would you consider using the cash that is offshore? James A. Beer: Well, in terms of capital allocation, we obviously have to be mindful of the noncontrolling interest that you're mentioning there. Also, we have to be focused on the larger debt maturities that we have coming due in fiscal '16, where the maturities move to the $1.5 billion type level, whereas this year, debt maturities have just been a couple of hundred million dollars in total. So those are important things to bear in mind. But having said that, nothing has changed in terms of our overall portfolio thinking towards capital allocation. And historically, that has meant a balance between M&A, internal capital expenditures as well as share buybacks and dividends. So that's how we're really thinking about cash and the capital allocation equation. John H. Hammergren: I also think, Eric, it's difficult to forecast when the minority interest or noncontrolling interest purchase would take place. And I think that's one of the other challenges is it may not be 100% in our control, given that they have the ability to put those shares to us. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Sure. So -- but it sounds like you're still approaching the noncontrolling interest as you would any capital allocation decision? Or is there a strategic need to own it? James A. Beer: Well, again, those minority holders have the right to put their shares to us or we would continue to pay them a defined annual dividend. So this equation is very much in their hands. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Right. But you don't feel the need to chase that? James A. Beer: Well, as we've said for our full year guidance -- fiscal '15, we're assuming 76% is going to be our ownership level for Celesio. And again, the core process defined through our independent evaluation are the rights for the minority. John H. Hammergren: And also, I would remind the listeners that the operating -- operational control process that we're pursuing, that we believe will be completed by the end of the year, is not affected by the ownership position of the company. Once we surpass the 75% ownership position, it allowed us to pursue this activity, which will give us the ability to begin to realize the synergies that we've outlined. And so I -- they are 2 separate and distinct discussions : one is operational control, which is the process that's underway; and the second is the ownership -- the remaining ownership of the 24% that is not currently held by McKesson. And to affect operational control, we do not need to buy any of the additional outstanding shares. Operator : Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : John, can you give us a little bit more color on kind of like your thoughts about -- on the European market dynamics in line of the Celesio-revised guidance and your comments on the 3 geographies in Europe and how that compares to kind of like your thought when you provided guidance and entered a transaction? John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, the Celesio management team has a responsibility to comment on their results, and I think they did so this morning. I think stepping away from Celesio specifically and looking at the markets, clearly, there is continued price pressure in Germany, in the wholesaler side of the business, and which I think the industry has been talking about for some time. Clearly, the French economy has not performed at the level that some would have had expected. And there's additional pressure in that market. And Brazil has been a challenge for many of the companies that are competing in the Brazilian market. I think the -- anybody that has followed Celesio specifically would recognize that there have been certain operating challenges that they have faced and I believe that they're beginning to address. However, McKesson really can't be involved in their decisions and their actions to correct some of their challenges. I would also remind everyone that the synergies that we believe come from gaining operational control and that we've outlined on a continued basis remain very significant and we believe would also provide another vehicle to offset some of the operating challenges that may exist on a country level within Celesio. And clearly, they highlighted the strength of the U.K. business and the continued performance there, which I think is a positive. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. I think John, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that Rite Aid operational -- operation transition was completed. Should we assume that the contribution from Rite Aid in the quarter is now at full run rate? And also, around kind of like along those lines, you announced that you've extended your contract with CVS from 3 years to 10 years a couple of months ago. Should we assume that, that was also in your updated guidance, assuming that the step-down in pricing is you normally see with product renewals and extensions? Or is this something that we should factor in through fiscal year '16? John H. Hammergren: Well, the Rite Aid operational completion took place in the quarter, so I would suggest that not 100% of the results were realized in the quarter. But I do think it's certainly bounded by the range that we've provided and continue to support. Likewise, I would say the CVS contract renewal or extension was a -- was contemplated also as we thought about our comments last quarter and this quarter. So I don't think there will be any specific changes to our guidance going forward based on either of those 2 events. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : John and James, I wonder if I can kind of revisit Lisa's question in a different way, which is if we look at how you guys came out of Q1, results were really strong and you got the guidance raise. And then kind of as we've moved through now, the company has seen some significant headwinds, but the guidance has been maintained. You talked about the $0.04 euro impact and the FX impact. There's probably a couple of pennies of just weakness in the Celesio business as France and Germany and Brazil deteriorate. Nexium and COPAXONE get pushed out. I guess, what I want to know is would you quantify kind of if we were to -- kind of back to Lisa's $0.10 question, is that the right number? Or would you guys kind of quantify the things that have changed in your -- the things that have changed versus your original expectations, kind of what were they worth and how should we think about those moving pieces? James A. Beer: Well, I won't have a specific issue-by-issue breakdown for you. But as you note there in your question, we have changed during the year our guide for Distribution and Solutions margins. So originally, before we saw the hep C type volumes, we were thinking that we could grow those margins high single digits. And then as we got a better understanding of the hep C volumes during Q1, we brought that down to the mid-single-digit growth that we talked about 90 days ago. And what we're doing today is again updating that view for these continued growth on the hep C side as well as these other items that you're mentioning that are coming into play, particularly around the brand to generic conversion time lines. So you can kind of think of that margin point progression along the lines of the impact of the hep C drugs originally, and then this quarter, both hep C and the brand to generic conversion. John H. Hammergren: And I also would say, George, I guess to be more specific, I think you're accurate in your assessment that the strength of the underlying business has offset some of these challenges that we didn't contemplate. So as much as we are missing the margin related to 2 product launches, we've largely been able to grow through that by the strength in our proprietary OneStop Generics program, which even without the Rite Aid volume, grew by more than 20% in the quarter. And the strength in the rest of our operations that continue to deal with the headwinds delivered by the delay in the Generics, the headwind delayed -- the headwind related to the FX, the currency exchange rates, and the headwind delivered by Celesio's revised view of the rest of their year. All of those are built in and yet, we're still optimistic that we'll be within the guidance range that we've provided. So I think people should feel good about the underlying operating results of the business, given those circumstances. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Yes. That's kind of where I'm going, John. And maybe then just a quick follow-up is I'm actually not looking at the margin mix impact, I'm looking at the absolute gross profit dollar growth impact. And kind of x these things, it's safe to assume that gross profit dollar growth would have been stronger than you guys reported. So I guess, James, I would just ask, you talked about the hep C drugs. You guys are making an absolute gross profit dollar on them, they're not loss leaders for you guys. So they're additive to the gross profit line, right? James A. Beer: They are, but very much more dilutive than the norm from a margin perspective. Operator : Our next question is from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : We've heard from some of the retailers about pressures they're experiencing from both generic inflation and reimbursement pressure from payers. I'm just curious, do either of these issues that they're facing have any collateral risk to you? And along those lines, are any of these issues that have arisen at the retail level made others more skeptical of joining some of these purchasing platforms, obviously, specifically McKesson's purchasing platform? John H. Hammergren: I think it's interesting when you talk about customers because each one of our customers experience their business in an individual way because they're a mix of payers, their view of inflation, their contracting processes, how they price their book, are all different. So I think it's difficult to lump everybody into a giant basket and say this is how they're being affected. And I think that independents clearly have a different book of business than the large chains do and certainly, mail orders, et cetera, have different vehicles by which they offset or take advantage of trends in the business. I would say that McKesson continues to focus on the success of our customers, and we remain extremely flexible in our relationships with our customers to make sure that they're afforded an opportunity to continue to enjoy the efficiencies of doing business with a wholesaler, while at the same time, taking advantage of the opportunities that they may have enjoyed outside of the wholesale channel in the past. I'm absolutely convinced that with the exception of perhaps one of our customers, all of our customers would benefit by buying their generics strictly through McKesson. And I believe that we will continue to make progress on our ability to grow our business on the Generics side more rapidly because of our increased penetration of our existing customers and the strength of our model going forward. So I have no doubt that we will continue to evolve our partnership with our customers in a way that adds value to them and grows our business at the same time. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's helpful. And I guess just my follow-up around generic purchasing. There is some chatter or concern in the marketplace that maybe some of the synergies that were originally mapped out on paper relative to these purchasing consortiums might not be translating at the actual negotiations level with generic manufacturers. I'm just wondering if you could comment around how your negotiations have progressed as you've gone out to the generic manufacturers around buying better with more scale? And any change relative to the original or previous expectations that you laid out around the procurement benefit? John H. Hammergren: Well, you've heard us talk regularly and repeatedly about our success with our relationship with Rite Aid, which is clearly our largest example of an alignment of a customer buying off of our contract book and our ability to work together with our combined volumes in a way that delivers benefit to both enterprises. And I think that is the best proof point. I would point out that there are many voices in this discussion. And the voices have different objectives perhaps. And that maybe the objectives of some of those voices is to try to make sure that these purchasing collaboratives, cooperatives, joint ventures, whatever you want to call them are not successful in aggregating volume because it may be to the disadvantage of other people in these channels. And so I -- all I can speak to is the fact that we continue to get the benefits that we had expected as we entered these arrangements. Or we continue to build our book of business, which adds significant value to the manufacturing partners that are part of our solution going forward and deliver significant value to the customers that have availed themselves of not only the price points that are available through McKesson because of our scale, but also to the service offering that we make available to our customers that take them out of the logistics business that is clearly more superior coming from McKesson. So I would say that we remain extremely optimistic, and the data that we're seeing continues to possibly reinforce the decisions we've made around generic sourcing. James A. Beer: And until we get operating control, we can't even have discussions with the manufacturing partners that include Celesio's volumes. John H. Hammergren: Right. So that's yet to begin. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So I'll also pile on and ask a question on generics as well. But for me, I guess on the inflation, if I recall, I think you were previously including some of the new product launches in your generic inflation outlook, of the high single digits for this year. So I guess with your inflation view unchanged, but with some of these delays and some of the big launches that you've talked about, I presume we would have been high margin. Could we potentially infer that maybe the inflation trend on the older base of generic products is perhaps greater than expected to offset those launch delays? Or am I just -- perhaps I'm reading too much into that? John H. Hammergren: Well, I think Steven, you asked a very good question, and this is a very confusing discussion for almost everybody involved in it because the definition of generic inflation is done differently by different people in the business. So I think it's important for us to explain how we think about it when we talk about our view of generic inflation being unchanged from the point from which we gave guidance coming into this year. Maybe James can give you a little color on how we define generic inflation. James A. Beer: Yes, our definition is for generic drugs beyond their exclusivity period. So you can think of those as the more mature drugs. So we would specifically exclude from our commentary those drugs that are just now converting from brand to generic. So again, the experience that we've had thus far this year leaves us comfortable with our full year guide that we would see generics outside of their exclusivity period, rising high single digits year-over-year. So as John alluded to a little bit earlier on one of his responses, that's a smaller year-over-year increase than we saw last year, but still clearly well above the historical norms for generic price inflation. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. Yes, I appreciate that clarity, but I guess at the same time, it leaves me scratching my head though on the discrepancy then on your view of the generic inflation outlook versus some of the peers that I thought were also definitely excluding those new launches from their inflation outlook but were suggesting lower numbers. So I guess we can follow up off-line on that. James A. Beer: Yes... John H. Hammergren: The other thing I'd say, Steven. I know you're off the line now, but I would say that remember, everything we say is related to McKesson's book of business and our mix. So I'm not sure that everybody's mix would be similar to ours or book, so that might be an additional variable that people can't reconcile. James A. Beer: And then also the way we think about the dollars that we drive from those price increases are very much related to the inventories that we have for those drugs that are seeing the price increases. So you would, I think, naturally see between that as well as the mix point that John is making, a variability across different parties. John H. Hammergren: And different fiscal years as well. Operator : The next question is from Ross Muken with ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : So it seems like Medical continues to track along reasonably well. Can you talk about sort of the next phase of sort of the PSS integration and synergies? It seems like we've sort of moved on from the initial profit capture there. And it seems like the margin profile is still maintaining quite well and hopefully, moving up. And so maybe just give us a little bit of a picture of kind of how that is trending currently. John H. Hammergren: Now sure, Ross. And the PSS integration has been trending very positively for McKesson. We are through the phase which included the retention of the sales forces and the combination of our sourcing activities and the things we are doing around the brands and compensation systems, et cetera. And now we're into sort of the heavy-lifting phase, which is the consolidation of some of the distribution and transportation infrastructures of the 2 companies. Probably less risk, but maybe even more work, given the amount of energy that has to go into making these consolidations happen, but clearly, there's a lot of value left to harvest out of the integration as we take out some of this duplication from an expense perspective. But most important, I think, was our ability to retain the sales forces with their great relationships with our customers, to continue to focus on our customers' success and our performance with those customers, and now to take some of the cost out that's redundant. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And maybe just on Tech Solutions. Obviously, a very good margin print this quarter. But the revenues, given some of your actions, continue to drag. And it seems like maybe by the end of the year, into early next year, we could possibly get back to revenue growth. I mean, is it your belief, once we sort of comp through these changes, that we can sort of maintain sort of the margin trajectory, hopefully, up to the mid- to upper teens while also kind of -- sort of starting the growth engine in that piece? John H. Hammergren: That's probably premature to guide on what we might see in the fiscal year ahead or beyond. I would say that our businesses are well positioned, that we know of the business that we've had the biggest challenge with in the EMR kind of space. We do -- we believe that our long-range guidance on margins should be in the high teens. And so clearly, we see that as a continued objective for us in the business. And we should be growing the businesses at or above market rates when we're post this transition of Horizon to Paragon. So I think we remain cautiously optimistic that we're in the right places at the right time. I would certainly point to you and to other listeners that know this business, that we have a very large footprint in medical imaging. Although we have a very significant market share there, the customers have not been focused on imaging products, they have been focused on buying products to meet their requirements from a Meaningful Use perspective. So some of the revenues in that business have been not growing, that we hope will grow again once people get past their obligations to meet government regulations. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : John, as it relates to the kind of ending process of getting operational control of Celesio, is there anything out there in that process either in or outside of your control that might change your expectations relative to the calendar and timing of when you guys do achieve operating control? John H. Hammergren: I think it's difficult to speak about this process with certainty. I can tell you that our expectations remain that we will get operational control this calendar year. There is a process that's outlined for it, and the parties that are involved have presented their facts and their cases as they see them in the process. And we're hopeful that we'll get an outcome that allows us to move forward with domination, like I said, by the end of the fiscal year. So I think it's difficult to say other than the fact that we remain optimistic and there's been no new news that would cause us to change our view of being optimistic about making it through this process. David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Is it -- a quick follow-up then, switching gears a little bit. On the logistics side of your business, given the sharp decline in fuel prices here of late, is there any way -- or I guess, is there a meaningful contribution to lower expenses that you guys are seeing from lower fuel prices generally? And is there any way that you guys might be able to help us quantify that benefit? John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, there's a benefit in our transportation cost centers across the corporation when fuel prices are in a decline. I'd have to say though, Dave, they're -- in aggregate, they're not a material impact at all to McKesson. And that's something that we focus on in a real specific way. And a portion of our transportation is already outsourced so the benefit would fall to those contract agents that we use in logistics. But I think that it's certainly not a negative event, and we are encouraged by it, but it won't have any meaningful impact on our business. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : A little bit of a leading question, perhaps, but thinking about hep C, well, it's perhaps a little bit more than you expected obviously to begin the year and maybe even this quarter. I doubt The Street mismodeled hep C by the nearly $2 billion that you beat in North America pharmaceutical, if I adjust for international. And your Med-Surg revenue also was pretty good. So when I think about that, I think about Owens & Minor this morning beating by 2.5%, 3%. It seems to me like overall market activity, utilization volumes, et cetera, are up. But I haven't really heard you talk much about that tonight, and it's always good to get a distributor to true-up what we're hearing from the labs and hospitals. So I'll just ask you for your comments on the overall market environment. John H. Hammergren: Sure, Eric. Thanks. We do see, I think, at the margin, an increase in utilization across all of our businesses. I think that almost every one of our executives would say that they believe that there is a certain amount of revenue increase being driven by just more patients in the system and patients in the system that have the appropriate coverage or at least some coverage from an insurance perspective. So I think that it has been a positive component to our results. And I think I'd also add that as people take on more risk for the patients and they're paid for performance, whereas we've talked about paid for value or outcomes, we find that the utilization of pharmaceuticals increases. It's the first and best avenue for people to go to if they have responsibility for a patient to make sure they're on their meds, they stay on their meds, and that I think also will continue to be a fuel for our industry. So I think that in light of what's happening, I think we remain optimistic that this is having some -- at least at the edges, some effect on revenue growth. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : John, if I could ask you this question, I think 1 large European pharma manufacturer is talking about diabetes this morning, talked about some big price competition going on with some of its other competitors. It's kind of new in the sense that these are large-branded categories, would not really need generic competition. I saw a little bit of that, I think, with -- sorry, asthma drugs, a little bit earlier. Can you talk about some of the dynamics you're seeing in the market on the brand side here? And does that have any positive or negative effects for you as the distributor? John H. Hammergren: Well, we continue to see innovation on the brand side as we've talked about with some of the specialty drugs that have come out. I have to admit that I'm not that close to some of the diabetes work that you refer to. And I do think that as we've talked about, we continue to see price increases on the brand side in line with our expectations and sort of the historical performance. So I think what -- reflecting that at a 40,000-foot level, I think we're pleased to see innovation returning to the brand world, and these companies are not only going to make a difference in people's lives, but they certainly will help provide additional fuel for our industry. So I think that, that would be my takeaway. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Great. Then maybe if I can just follow up then on hep C more specifically. As we go into next year and we get more competition in the class, does that offer you some opportunities? Or is it really a function here that brand drugs remain -- that the margins, regardless of the manufacturer, will likely be small for you guys in this category? John H. Hammergren: Well, it's difficult to forecast specialty drugs or new drug launches in a sort of a uniform way. Clearly, some of these drugs will be launched in oncology, and we're very optimistic that when new launches happen in oncology, they're not only better for the patients, but they're also, because of our position in oncology, better for our business. And we benefit from the position we have in that marketplace and can help the manufacturers get their product not only through clinical trial, but also utilized in the correct fashion. And that provides an opportunity for us economically. The hep C product, because of its unusual orientation towards government buyers and mail-order buyers, has an unusual distortion, so to speak, in our volume because of our footprint in those markets. And so I would say that other specialty launches may not have a similar characteristic in terms of the uptake of the product. And so each channel has a different characteristic for us from an economic perspective. But overall, we're happy to see the innovation happen. Operator : We'll take a question from David Larsen with Leerink Swann. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : So as more hep C drugs come to market, say, next year, is that generally a positive for your margins? John H. Hammergren: Well, hep C has been a negative for our margins. As James discussed, it was a significant impact in the quarter for our margins and will continue to be a drag on our ability to get to our guided margin for the year, and that's why we've changed it and were specific about it. Over the long term, clearly, we believe this stuff will flow through the system and we were still confident with our long-term objectives of 250 to 300 basis points for Distribution Solutions. Clearly, we need to continue to evaluate the economics of these products as related to the service we provide to both the manufacturers and to our customers. And we need to make sure we're being properly paid by the channel for the role that we play. And hep C clearly would be a product that we would focus on, and future products of this characteristic, we would have to focus on to make sure that the dilutive margin effect that it's had doesn't continue. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Yes. It's clear that as a percentage of revenue, your gross margins would have an unfavorable impact. But as more competing hep C products come to market, relative to having only, say, 1 vendor like Gilead, would you generally earn more gross profit dollars as competition comes to market for that therapeutic class? John H. Hammergren: Well, that's a good question. I think the ability for us to be paid for affecting the competition would require us to have some role in the channel. And it's not clear to me that we would be in a position to tell our mail order customers, for example, which hep C drug they're going to put on their formulary. So in that specific example, it may be difficult for us to increase our margins specifically because of an additional launch in the category of another branded product. It will probably not provide the same ability for us to move share that, for example, generic drugs provide us. So I'm not particularly optimistic about that single event. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Okay. Great. And then just any preliminary thoughts around fiscal 2016, the impact of new generic launches? It seems like with these pushes, there could be a positive comp impact for fiscal '16, and it seems like there could be some pretty big ones, Nexium, COPAXONE, ABILIFY, maybe Enbrel and Advair. Any general thoughts around that? John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, to the extent that these positives are pushed into next fiscal year, then that's where they will be realized. And so I think we remain optimistic that our position in Generics is doing nothing but improving. And that as our scale and our footprint expands globally, we'll be able to bring even more value to the market relative to the generic manufacturers and to partner even more closely with them. So yes, I'd say on the margin, we're excited about the Generic portfolio as we look forward. Operator : We will take our last question from Garen Sarafian with Citi. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I wanted to go back to Celesio. You stated how your expectations are to have operational control by year-end and the fast-track approval. So I'm wondering if it's not, what's the alternate method entail? So maybe if you could give a worse case or best case range of outcomes there, I would really appreciate it. John H. Hammergren: Well, thank you for the question, Garen. I don't know that we have a firm view on the time line or the potential outcome in terms of how long it would take us to gain operational control. I think if we don't get it in the fast-track process, we remain extremely optimistic that we will get it. And then it's just a question of why didn't the fast-track happen and what do we need to do to facilitate the right decision, which is to give us operational control later on in the process. And so I think it's difficult to speculate. James A. Beer: But all of that said, we still remain confident that we are going to get operating control in this calendar year. John H. Hammergren: Well, I want to thank you, operator, and also, I want to thank all of you on the call for your time today. I'm pleased with our solid results in the second quarter and I want to recognize our employees who dedicate themselves to focusing on our customer's success and continue to drive outstanding performance across our businesses. I will now hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin? Erin Lampert : Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On November 11, we will present at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Health Care Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. And on January 13, we will present at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco. We will release third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you, and goodbye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a good day.",

Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2015 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks. And here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid results for the third quarter, with total company revenues of $47 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.89. In addition to the solid execution across our business, our third quarter results benefited from a pull-forward of certain brand price increases into the quarter, which had previously been anticipated in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter results also reflect a lower-than-expected tax rate driven by the intense enactment of recent legislation. James will address both of these items in further detail in his remarks. I'm pleased with the strong performance of our business for the first 9 months of the fiscal year. We've updated our outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $10.80 to $10.95 for fiscal 2015. Before I begin my review of our business results for the quarter, I will provide a brief update on our acquisition of Celesio. During the third quarter, we achieved an important milestone with the formal registration of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement. As I mentioned in my remarks last quarter, with this milestone now complete, McKesson and Celesio can begin our cooperative work to deliver the synergy case we have outlined, where we expect to achieve $275 million to $325 million in annual synergies by the end of fiscal 2019. We've established a new global procurement and sourcing office based in London to begin the work associated with realizing the synergy case we have outlined. The team, consisting of seasoned executives from both McKesson and Celesio, will focus on expanding our relationships with our manufacturing partners and further building upon our global sourcing capabilities. As the needs of the health care industry continue to evolve, broader global reach, channel influence and greater purchasing scale are increasingly important. We're excited to serve our customers as one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of health care services in the world. Moving now to our business results. Distribution Solutions had strong results in the third quarter with revenue of $46.3 billion, up 38% as reported and up 39% on a constant-currency basis. Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating profit was $1 billion in the third quarter, up 33% as reported and up 34% on a constant-currency basis. North American distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, delivered strong results for the third quarter, with 17% revenue growth on a reported and constant-currency basis compared to the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by strong growth within our existing customer base, including further penetration of our generics programs, solid market growth and the demand for recently launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver excellent value for our customers. During the third quarter, we were extremely pleased to have expanded our long-standing relationship with Omnicare, the nation's largest institutional pharmacy and a leading specialty pharmaceutical services provider. For over 10 years, Omnicare has partnered with McKesson for the distribution of branded pharmaceuticals. As part of our expanded agreement, McKesson will now have responsibility for the sourcing and distribution of generic pharmaceuticals as part of McKesson's proprietary, OneStop Generics program. We are proud of the value we deliver as our customers choose McKesson as not only their distribution partner but also their sourcing partner. Our customers value the strength of our OneStop program, our industry-leading service levels and the working capital efficiencies we are able to drive on their behalf. We also created outstanding value across our independent pharmacy customer base. I'm pleased to share that Health Mart was recently named Pharmacy Innovator of the Year by Drug Chain Review (sic) [Chain Drug Review], a leading pharmacy industry publication. We are proud to accept this award on behalf of all of our independent pharmacies who are in the front line caring for patients every day. This recognition acknowledges Health Mart for its commitment to giving member pharmacies the tools they need to thrive in their markets, its efforts to enhance and expand the scope of pharmacy practice and the pharmacy's consistent high-level performance in terms of patient satisfaction. We are privileged to partner with our Health Mart pharmacy customers and to provide the tools that enable them to grow their business and enhance the deep relationships they have with their customers. In summary, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver tremendous results as we strengthen and expand our relationships with our customer base. Turning now to our specialty business. We had another quarter of excellent results. In addition to the strength of our oncology business and the growth we are driving in other specialties, such as ophthalmology and rheumatology, McKesson's Specialty Health offers a tremendous value proposition to our pharmaceutical manufacturing partners. Our specialty manufacturing services span across the entire pharmaceutical life cycle, from R&D to post-commercialization and maturity. We are unique as a partner to manufacturers in facilitating clinical trials. US Oncology has conducted more than 1,400 clinical trials including 120 early phase studies, and more than 60,000 patients have participated in these trials conducted by US Oncology. US Oncology Research has participated in the development of more than 300 investigational products, including 51 FDA-approved cancer therapies, which represents nearly 1/3 of cancer therapies approved by the FDA to date. Manufacturers value our deep clinical understanding and the expertise through our provider-centered organization. We also have a leading technology set of assets customized for the needs of specialty providers and focused on driving better patient outcomes. And as the leader in community oncology, we have the benefit of tremendous scale in the market. I am pleased with the strong results of our specialty business in the quarter and believe we remain very well positioned to serve our customers and partners in this exciting market. Our Canadian business had another solid quarter with the results that were consistent with our expectations. In addition to the growth at our core distribution business, we are driving great results with our extensive base of independent pharmacies operating under one of our many banners, the expansion of our private-label generics program, Sivem, and the growth in our specialty business in Canada. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the third quarter were $7.3 billion, an increase of 7% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant-currency basis. As I mentioned earlier, we are extremely pleased to have reached a key milestone on achieving operating control of Celesio during the third quarter. We're only just beginning to work -- to do the work to bring together these 2 great organizations, and I remain excited about the opportunities we see as we move forward together. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were $1.6 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 7% over the prior year. We continue to see solid growth across the alternate site markets we serve, and our third quarter results also reflect an increase in sales of flu vaccines and supplies compared to the prior year. We are entering the third and final year of our PSS integration efforts. We remain on track to deliver the synergies we had previously outlined, and I continue to be impressed with the progress made by our Medical-Surgical team. In summary, Distribution Solutions performed well in the third quarter, driving excellent service and value for our customers and delivering strong financial results. Technology Solutions' revenues were down 7% for the third quarter, driven primarily by anticipated revenue softness in our Horizon clinical software platform and the planned elimination of a product line, both contemplated in the original guidance we provided in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was 16.3% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations for this business. I am pleased with the progress we've made as we evolve our Technology Solutions portfolio. Increasingly, we are hearing about the shift toward value-based reimbursement in the delivery of health care. Just last month, the Department of Health & Human Services announced the goal of tying the vast majority of traditional Medicare payments to quality or value metrics by 2016. At McKesson, we are focused on helping our customers prepare for this shift to value-based reimbursement. And we have the unique expertise and set of solutions to position our customers for success as their businesses evolve. The important component of the shift to value-based care is enabling patients and providers to have a holistic view of the patient across different settings of care through data interoperability, which is why we are proud members of the CommonWell Health Alliance. The CommonWell Health Alliance continues to expand, with new members joining, additional studies of care added and more provider sites going live. Through CommonWell, we are committed to leading the industry towards a vision of patient-centered interoperability that moves us well beyond the challenges of today's point-to-point exchange towards an environment where the right health information is available to the patient at the right time. We will continue to focus on our key strategic priorities for Technology Solutions, including helping our customers reduce cost and operate more efficiently, providing our customers with solutions to drive improved analytics and supporting our customers' transformation to a world of value-based care. Now to wrap up my comments for Q3. We delivered solid results in the third quarter and I'm pleased by the great execution we have seen across our business. We've updated our outlook for the full year and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.80 to $10.95 for fiscal 2015. In addition to the solid operating performance in the third quarter, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. For the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we generated cash flows from operations of $1.2 billion, and our expectation to deliver cash flows from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2015 remains unchanged from our original guidance. With that, I'll turn the call over to James. And we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James A. Beer: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, we are pleased with our third quarter operating results, driven by the solid performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. Late in the third quarter and consistent with our expectations, we secured operating control of Celesio. As we look ahead, we are working to execute against our previously articulated synergy case and are beginning our integration efforts. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter consolidated financial results and I will also provide an update on our fiscal 2015 outlook. Later in my remarks, I will highlight revisions to our financial statement presentation, subsequent to achieving operating control of Celesio, alongside key transaction milestones and assumptions. Before I review our third quarter results, there are 4 items that I'd like to bring to your attention that I hope will give you a better perspective on our performance in the quarter. First, in addition to the solid execution across our business, our third quarter results were aided by a lower-than-expected tax rate, primarily due to the passage of recent legislation. The related reduction in our tax expense for the quarter contributed approximately $0.13 to our adjusted earnings. Second, our third quarter Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating profit reflects a timing benefit, primarily from a pull-forward of certain brand price increases from our fiscal fourth quarter into our fiscal third quarter. This benefit contributed approximately $0.09 to our adjusted earnings. Third, during our second quarter earnings call, we discussed our average exchange rate assumption of $1.31 per euro, applicable to our fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS guidance range. While currency rate movements did not have a material impact on our adjusted EPS during the first half of our fiscal year, I indicated that we expected a negative foreign currency translation impact of approximately $0.04 during the second half of fiscal '15. The actual adjusted EPS impact from currency movements during our fiscal third quarter was approximately $0.03 per share. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we are now assuming an average exchange rate of $1.15 per euro in the fourth quarter. This would drive a negative foreign currency translation impact of approximately $0.04 to our adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter. In summary, the negative foreign currency translation impact on our full year adjusted EPS, as compared to our original plan, is now anticipated to be approximately $0.07 versus the previously guided $0.04. Lastly, we realized a $0.05 benefit from an update to our accounting for the noncontrolling interest in Celesio, which I'll cover later in my remarks. We now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $10.80 to $10.95 for fiscal 2015, based on a full year average exchange rate of $1.29 per euro. Now let's move to our results. My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.89, which excludes 3 items : Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues increased 37% for the quarter to $47 billion. On this 37% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 52% to $3 billion, driven by Celesio and the performance of our other Distribution Solutions businesses. Total adjusted operating expenses of approximately $2 billion were up 61% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of Celesio, operating expenses increased 3% for the quarter. Other income was $13 million during Q3. Interest expense increased 64% versus the prior year to $97 million, driven by debt issued and assumed related to our acquisition of Celesio. Now moving to taxes. This quarter's adjusted tax rate benefited significantly from the R&D and international tax provisions of legislation passed in December 2014, which applied retroactively to the beginning of the calendar year. The resulting benefit of approximately $20 million, in addition to other discrete items, reduced our Q3 tax rate to 28.7%. For the full year, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 31%. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter were $679 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.89, up 95% versus the prior year. Excluding Canadian tax reserve adjustments and the technology product realignment and impairment charges taken in the prior year totaling $0.70, our adjusted EPS was up 33%. As I discussed earlier, our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter benefited from a lower-than-expected tax rate and from a pull-forward of certain brand price increases from our fiscal fourth quarter into our third quarter. Collectively, these benefits contributed approximately $0.22 to our adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share during the quarter. Wrapping up our consolidated results. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1% year-over-year to 236 million. Now let's turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Distribution Solutions' segment revenues increased for the quarter to $46 billion, up 38% on a reported basis and 39% on a constant-currency basis. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased to $37.4 billion, up 17% on a reported and constant-currency basis. Current quarter revenue growth primarily reflects market growth and our mix of business, including strong growth from existing customers, continued demand for drugs used in the treatment of hepatitis C and the timing of certain generic launches. Driven by these factors, we now expect that for fiscal '15, our North America revenue will grow by a mid-teens percentage over the prior year. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $7.3 billion for the third quarter. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 7% on the underlying revenues of Celesio. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 7% for the quarter, driven by market growth, including the incremental benefit of a strong flu season. Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 63% for the quarter on 38% revenue growth, resulting in an 87 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin, driven by our acquisition of Celesio and the market growth. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 90% for the quarter, primarily due to our acquisition of Celesio. Excluding Celesio, operating expenses for the segment increased 6% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by the strong revenue growth within our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business during the quarter. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 226 basis points, a decline of 8 basis points versus the prior year. This decline was driven by a higher mix of branded drug sales and an adjusted operating profit contribution from Celesio that was lower than we expected. Excluding the impact of Celesio and the hepatitis C drugs, the segment-adjusted operating margin was 248 basis points, an increase of 14 basis points over the prior year. Based on our anticipated mix of revenues, including continued strong demand for hepatitis C drugs and the lower contribution from Celesio, we now expect the full year Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin to be down mid-single digit basis points versus the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 7% for the quarter to $755 million. This decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon clinical software platform, the planned elimination of a product line and the wind down of our U.K. workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. For the full year, we now expect revenues to decline by mid-single digits year-over-year, driven by the factors I just mentioned and the impact of some large customers delaying certain contracting decisions due to competing business and regulatory priorities. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 11%, driven by our restructuring actions. Excluding the impact of charges taken in the prior year, operating expenses declined 8% year-over-year. Third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 60% to $123 million. Adjusting for the impact of prior year charges, adjusted operating profit increased 3% year-over-year on 7% lower revenues. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate was 16.3%. Adjusting for the impact of prior year charges, the adjusted operating margin was up 167 basis points year-over-year. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing. In addition, our working capital metrics also include Celesio. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 2 days versus the prior year to 26 days. Excluding Celesio, our days sales outstanding remained flat year-over-year. Our days sales in inventories remained flat year-over-year at 31 days. Our days sales in payables increased 5 days year-over-year to 52 days. Excluding Celesio, our days sales in payables increased 6 days to 53 days. We generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations during the first 9 months of fiscal 2015. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.6 billion, with $2.2 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $405 million for the first 9 months of fiscal 2015. We now expect full year internal capital spending to be approximately $525 million versus our initial guidance of $575 million to $625 million. Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook. Let me once again remind you that our earnings this quarter was specifically impacted by 3 items that also affect our full year outlook. First, we benefited from a lower-than-expected tax rate which allowed us to reduce our full year adjusted tax rate to 31%. Second, the negative foreign currency translation impact to our full year adjusted EPS is now anticipated to be $0.07 versus the $0.04 previously expected. And we have now updated the full year average exchange rate applicable to our adjusted EPS guidance to a rate of $1.29 per euro. Lastly, based on our anticipated mix of revenues, including continued strength and demand for hepatitis C drugs and a lower-than-expected profit contribution from Celesio, we now expect the full year Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin to be down mid-single digit basis points versus the prior year. Considering these items and our year-to-date results, we are updating and narrowing our guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations to a range of between $10.80 and $10.95 per diluted share. With respect to GAAP earnings per share for the full year, we now expect $1.48 in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.63 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude between $0.97 and $1.07 per share in LIFO-related adjustments. Now let me take a few moments to talk about our updated financial statement presentation for the noncontrolling interest in Celesio. At the highest level, we continue to consolidate the financial results of Celesio and we continue to expect that our ownership of Celesio will remain at approximately 76% for the remainder of fiscal 2015. However, as a result of achieving operating control of Celesio in December 2014, some important changes were necessary to appropriately reflect McKesson's obligations to the minority shareholders of Celesio within our financial statements. When we initially gained greater than 75% of Celesio's fully diluted shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, you might recall that a line titled Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests was presented below our net income line on Schedule 1, which accompanied our press release. Through the second quarter of fiscal 2015, this line item primarily reflected the minority shareholders' claim to approximately 24% of Celesio's net income. Subsequent to achieving operating control this past December, McKesson now retains 100% of Celesio's net income. In exchange, McKesson is obligated to pay an annual dividend of EUR 0.83 per share to Celesio's minority shareholders. In today's results, this dividend drives approximately $50 million of the Schedule 1 entry for the 9 months ended December 31, under the heading Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. This $50 million amount addresses our calendar 2014 dividend commitment to Celesio's minority shareholders. Beginning in our fourth quarter and continuing through subsequent fiscal years, this EUR 0.83 dividend will drive a quarterly expense of approximately $12 million, assuming our 76% ownership stake remains unchanged and an exchange rate of $1.15 per euro. Once again, these dividends will be recorded in the line entitled Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. This change in accounting contributed approximately $0.05 to our adjusted EPS in Q3. We do not expect any material impact to adjusted EPS from the accounting change in Q4. Distribution's segment results as outlined on Schedules 3 and 4 continued to reflect 100% of the results of Celesio. The balance sheet, as reflected on Schedule 5, includes a new caption titled Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. Subsequent to a pending operating control of Celesio, the carrying value of the noncontrolling interests in Celesio of approximately $1.5 billion were reclassified from equity to redeemable noncontrolling interests. This reclassification was triggered when noncontrolling interests in Celesio became redeemable, allowing put rights held by the minority shareholders to be exercised. As a reminder, these put rights allow minority shareholders to sell their Celesio shares to McKesson at a price of EUR 22.99. In summary, now that we have operating control of Celesio, we recognized 100% of Celesio's net income while owning only 76% of Celesio's outstanding shares. And for this benefit, we are obligated to record annual dividend compensation of EUR 0.83 per share or approximately $12 million per quarter, payable to Celesio's minority shareholders. In addition, our assumptions related to our previously articulated transaction synergies are unchanged. As mentioned by John, by fiscal 2019, we still expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. In summary, we've recorded 3 very solid quarters this year and we are excited to have secured operating control of Celesio. We expect the transaction to deliver tremendous value to our customers, manufacturing partners and shareholders in the years ahead. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Travis? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : John, I just wanted to follow up on some of James' comments regarding the noncontrolling interest piece of Celesio. So how do you think about it from this point going forward? It seems like a pretty straightforward capital deployment situation. You could either pay up to redeem the remaining piece or you could just let it continue to sit out there and make the dividend payment on a quarterly basis and reallocate that capital elsewhere. So given that you've already guided the market that you would reaccelerate capital deployment in fiscal '16, how do you think about that capital deployment situation from here? John H. Hammergren: Glen, thanks for the question. I think that you have the basics right. I believe the only thing that's missing in your assumption there is related to their ability to put the shares to us. So we look at it as a source of financing. We know what the put right is, we know what the dividend cost is on an annual basis and we know how much money is tied up related to this obligation. The only difference is that we really can't call those -- that right. We have to have it put against us. But I think just from our perspective, it's a source of financing and there is no longer any P&L or earnings upside by the consolidation of those remaining shares other than a reduction of the dividend, but replaced by whatever are the costs you have associated with the deployment of that capital. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Maybe if I could just follow up on some of the comments you made in your prepared remark regarding the global procurement office that you opened in London. Could you give us a sense for maybe what types of products we'd be purchasing out of there, or what percentage of your products? Can you do all your generics, branded, OTC? And then, James, how do we start to think about that having an impact on the company's tax rate over time? John H. Hammergren: Well, to begin with, I think it really is -- we've been focused on the sourcing on a private-label basis in an appropriate tax-efficient way for some time. I think the addition here with this expansion in London is focused primarily on generics and branded drugs, our relationships with the manufacturers and how we plan to go to market. And, James, maybe you can talk a little bit about tax. James A. Beer: Well, I would just observe that obviously now with a broader worldwide operation, we'll be looking at optimizing our tax position on a global basis, obviously, consistent with all the rules and regulations of each authority in which we're doing business. So I wouldn't want to point to anything in particular emanating out of London. John H. Hammergren: But, Glen, you did mention OTCs. And I do think that the addition of Lloyds Pharmacy through the acquisition of Celesio does give us a large footprint in OTC products and relationships that would expand beyond our typical branded and generic relationships, albeit that's probably a third leg to put into the strategy. We're going to focus on pharmaceuticals first. I do think there's a way for us to bring our other U.S. customers' and North American customers' demand for OTC products into this discussion at some later date. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : John, I think you talked about the outsized growth coming from a couple of different areas, and one of the ones that you called out was hep C. Yesterday, Gilead came out and said -- or the day before that, came out and said that they would expect that they could see a 25% increase in the number of patients treated based on these new agreements that they've signed with managed care and PBMs. I'm just wondering how this stuff's going to impact your business going forward. Two things. One, would you expect that you would pick up a consistent amount of that market share? And maybe you can help us understand how much of the growth this quarter came from hep C? And then secondly, maybe if you could just help us to think about the margins around hep C and any other of these more expensive specialty drugs that are coming to market. John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Lisa, for the question. It's probably difficult for us to comment specifically on the number of patients that are not being served from a hep C perspective, and certainly some of the market share changes that might be forecast between the various manufacturers related to the market. This business for us is primarily government-related and mail order. So that we have a -- as you know, with our relationships both in mail and with the VA and the DoD, we have a heavy concentration of products in those markets and clearly, hep C is one of those products. The product is -- the hep C products are dilutive to our overall margins. And so from a revenue perspective, they're very positive from a growth perspective but they are not all that helpful on the bottom line. And I'd say that we -- our growth this quarter was certainly impacted by hep C but I might also say, we think we grew well in excess of market growth rates through our expanded relationships with our existing customers and the strength we've had in expanding things like generics into Rite Aid and the pull-through of generics in our other customer bases. So I think that we are feeling pretty good about the momentum we have in our base of business. James A. Beer: And, in fact, if I could just add, an example of that growth is in our OneStop program, where even aside from the growth that Rite Aid represented in OneStop, we still, in addition, grew OneStop 20% year-over-year. Specifically to the revenue contribution of the hepatitis C drugs, they drove about 4 points of the 17% growth that we saw in Q3 year-over-year. And as we're alluding to here, they're 1 of the 2 drivers, along with the Celesio contribution, that were driving our commentary around Distribution Solutions' margins in Q3 and for the full year. Operator : We'll take our next question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I guess, John, I kind of noticed that absent from the commentary of this call was kind of the thoughts on generic drug price inflation and 2 of your peers have kind of talked about moderating generic drug price inflation. I thought you might give us an update on what McKesson is seeing. John H. Hammergren: Our view on generic price inflation is basically in line with how we viewed the year as we came into the year. We said that we felt it was going to be generally flat with last year, perhaps slightly down compared to prior year. And I think our view has remained consistent and remains consistent as we think about what we've accomplished in the first 3 quarters and what we have in front of us. I would say it's difficult perhaps to compare the commentary between those in the industry because all of us look at generic price inflation, we define it differently, first; and then secondly, we all have different books of business with different manufacturers and have probably different exposure to all of this. So I would say that our quarter results in Q3 and what we're talking about for the rest of the year is pretty much in line with our expectations when we started the year. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up on Celesio. I'm going to assume that there were no Celesio synergies delivered in the quarter and you guys are sticking to your guidance on the procurement synergies. I guess at what point kind of in the process of the acquisition will you be ready to talk about operating synergies as opposed to procurement synergies? John H. Hammergren: Well, you're right. There really were no synergies in our results for the quarter related to Celesio. I mean we just achieved operating control, which allows us to go as a unified body to the marketplace, which this London operation is beginning to do, has begun to do in January and is continuing throughout the rest of this quarter. So the $275 million to $325 million has yet to be executed on, particularly from a product perspective. Now some of the tax savings that we forecasted there should begin to flow more quickly than the products side of it. As it relates to operating synergies, we have a bit of a path here to get the organization to where we think it can be operationally. And clearly, one of the big things we need to do is invest in the IT infrastructure that's necessary to help Celesio realize the advantage of scale and to be more productive in the operation. We have some work underway to help them optimize certain functions in terms of distribution and transportation. We're working on those initiatives. But clearly, it's probably too early to forecast any operating synergies related to Celesio as we think about the remainder of this year. James A. Beer: And I would expect that those items that John was just mentioning to be one of the drivers of our capital spending each year. John H. Hammergren: And in fact, to some extent, George, the synergy from an operating perspective in the early phases may be more of a dis-synergy as we invest more heavily than we get returns on in the early phases. And so we'll probably see actually a little more expense. Now clearly, the upside from this acquisition wasn't in significant operating synergy in the near term in Celesio. It was really about accomplishing our sourcing and procurement synergies. And we have no reason to believe that we won't be successful on that objective. And I think that, that is a first priority. The second priority is what do we do to assist Celesio in its operations. In the near term, that's probably more of an investment expense slash phase than it is a synergy that we deliver to the bottom line phase. So we're focused on doing both. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : John, you spent some time in the prepared remarks talking about the specialty business and the opportunities there. Can you help us quantify what percent of the 17% top line growth came from specialty? And I'm assuming that specialty segment is excluding the HCV benefit. And what are the specific areas within specialty that you're seeing most growth from? And then I have another follow-up. John H. Hammergren: Well, I mean, our specialty business, once again, it's similar to the other themes in this conversation. Probably each person participating in the industry may define specialty differently. When we talk about specialty, we're not talking about hepatitis C drugs or some of the things that have impacted our revenues in such a significant way. What we're talking about are primarily oncology products and some of the other -ologies like rheumatology and ophthalmology. From a growth perspective, we have some of those other specialty areas growing more rapidly than oncology, but it's off of a very small base. Oncology continues to be the main driver of our performance in specialty, and our bullish remarks regarding our growth in specialty is driven by our success in the oncology portfolio of our business, on a combined basis : Both the work we're doing on the network to grow the number of physicians in US Oncology; in our distribution platform out to oncology and other specialties; and clearly in some of the work that we're doing with manufacturers on the clinical services, and the data work that we're doing, really is all-encompassing. But we're pleased with the progress we're making in specialty, and it's an important part of our continued performance. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then just one follow-up on the Rite Aid, which you talked about the contribution to OneStop. I mean, obviously, Rite Aid very publicly attributed their improved outlook to their expanded relationship with McKesson. Is kind of the proof of concept that we're seeing in Rite Aid starting to resonate with some of your other large retail clients that are not buying the bulk of their generics from you? John H. Hammergren: Well, we certainly think so. And I think the best example would be the success in our relationship with Omnicare, and not only renewing that partnership, but getting them to work with us and source through us their generic portfolio. I think Rite Aid played a role in that as a great reference point relative to our success. And I think as Rite Aid and others continue to say McKesson is the best alternative, frankly, along with other industry players that are beginning to turn to wholesaling as the source of product that they otherwise would have purchased direct, I think is a continued reinforcement of the power that wholesaling brings to the industry, both in terms of our purchasing and sourcing capabilities, but also frankly, our ability to use capital efficiently and our logistics expertise. And so there are several benefits why customers -- McKesson customers are turning to us and saying that we'd like to expand our existing relationship beyond brands into the generic portfolio. And we're optimistic about that. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : John, I just wanted to go back to the comments around the pull-forward you saw this quarter. And I feel like we've heard this from time to time from you and your competitors. I mean, is this just seeing pricing coming in ahead of your internal expectations? Or is it actually something more contractual? John H. Hammergren: Well, once again, I can't speak for the industry or our competitors. But related to McKesson's work with manufacturers, particularly those that we have a contractual relationship with, we have great visibility to the amount of income we might earn from those relationships over time. The methods by which we earn that income and the timing is not always easy for us to forecast. And that's why we don't frankly provide quarterly guidance because we're not necessarily always certain about when those price increases might fall. And that was really what we were speaking about here relative to the pull-forward. We know the total amount we're going to get and then we know if we get a bunch of it in the third quarter, that it's not going to come again in the fourth quarter. And clearly, there's a portion of our income with branded manufacturers that's still earned outside of these relationships. But I would say that the large portion of what we realized here is -- was totally visible to us and is just a movement from one quarter to the next. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. That answers the question. And then I guess, just the follow-up I have was around biosimilars. That's something the industry has been talking about for years. Now it seems like we have a feel on the near-term horizon with Remicade and Neupogen. Can you maybe just remind us how you see the economics playing out for McKesson? Is your expectation that as we see biosimilars, and these 2 specifically, come to the market, that the wholesalers will be able to leverage their value? Or could these maybe end up looking more similar to additional branded launches? John H. Hammergren: Well, I think it's difficult to -- once again, to make sort of an industry call. I do think that McKesson's position is unique as it relates particularly to cancer drugs, given our position with US Oncology and our network. We obviously don't own those physicians but we do partner closely with them. And as I discussed in my prepared remarks, our understanding of the clinical work that's necessary to bring a branded drug to market and take it to the various phases of clinical trial should be helpful as people begin to prove that the biosimilars have an equivalent outcome for the patient as the product that it might be replacing. And so I think that, that resource is unique to McKesson, and I do think our ability to use that resource to build value for the manufacturers that are entering this space will be helpful for us. It's probably too early to quantify when and what might occur as a result of this. I just wanted to point out the differentiation that we bring to the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I guess kind of looking back through time. The McKesson fiscal fourth quarter EPS results have been up sequentially versus fiscal 3Q, like every year for the past 8 years or so, potentially even further back from that, except for the fact that my model doesn't go back, so I can't analyze it further on the fly. But really the question is, I guess, is the pull-forward of the brand inflation economics really that material to drive this unique cadence this fiscal year? Or again, maybe I missed it, were there 1 or 2 other big factors that might be driving the EPS down sequentially besides just that brand inflation? I know you mentioned a little bit about Celesio profits staying a little bit lower. But I just want to make sure I didn't miss any other key variables there. James A. Beer: Yes. I think it is a little bit more complicated this Q4 sequentially. We have this branded pull-forward item that John has just been discussing. We also have the tax rate effect between Q3, which was particularly low, and Q4. And then, of course, we also have a little bit higher FX headwind than we were expecting 90 days ago when we were on the call. And then we've also given you something of a sense around both of the DS margins and how they would be driving relative to this quite high DS revenue growth. And then we've also given you a sense of the TS revenue situation as well for the full year. So I think those are really the key drivers that will be relevant for us in Q4 and drive the sequential pattern that you're referring to. Operator : We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division : So given that you have operational control and you're expecting $1.8 billion in cash flow in the coming quarter, James, could you help us understand, are there any barriers from preventing you from reaccelerating putting cash to work? And how do you think about the minimum cash balance? Do you consider the noncontrolling interest? I know last quarter, you mentioned debt maturities. And I imagine there's a chance you could end up with a inefficient balance sheet given that noncontrolling interest could extend for a long period of time. And I know you have the ability to refinance and grow via -- or de-lever via EBITDA growth. So how do you account for those items? James A. Beer: Yes well, you're right in that we certainly have to be ready for those minority Celesio shareholders to put their shares to us. So I talked a lot on the call about the accounting, but in terms of usage of cash, we have to be ready for them to put their shares to us. And directionally, that's an amount of money of the order of $1.5 billion. And then also, as you mentioned in your question, we have debt maturities in fiscal '16 that will be appreciably larger than what we've seen in recent years, so again, about $1.5 billion coming due in fiscal '16. All of that said -- and certainly, there's a clear commitment to our ongoing investment-grade credit ratings here, all of that said, there's no change philosophically from the portfolio approach to capital allocation that McKesson has had for many years. And that portfolio is internal capital expenditure, M&A, dividends and share buybacks. And we do certainly want to emphasize the internal CapEx and the M&A as ways in which we can potentially drive further cash flow growth in the years that we think will be valuable to our shareholders. Certainly, in the 1.25 years that I've been here, I've been impressed as I've inspected the long-term track record of McKesson's M&A. I think McKesson has a terrific record around driving value through M&A. And so we'd want to have some capacity to enter into M&A should attractive opportunities come along, while we're in this de-levering period. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And do you view de-levering as it must come via a reduction in the debt level? Or will growth in EBITDA play a role? James A. Beer: Well, I think it will be both. I think it will be us paying down maturities, as well as consistent growth in EBITDA in the coming years. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : John or James, do you expect Celesio here to grow sequentially from this point? And what actually did drive the slightly lower profits for the business this past quarter? John H. Hammergren: Well, I think that the -- Celesio's a tale of many different markets. And so I think that depending on the market and whether we're talking about wholesaling or retailing, we do obviously expect growth in our businesses at market levels or above. There are certain markets like Brazil and France that we are a little more uncertain of relative to what kind of growth we're going to expect and certainly in France, given some of the reimbursement pressures that they face. Germany's been a troubled business for us, but we do see some signs of stability there and good growth from a revenue perspective. And clearly, the U.K., on both wholesale and retailing, has been a very positive story for us. So -- and I guess, we were pleased with the growth that Celesio's delivered from a revenue perspective this quarter and I think we would expect that business to continue to grow at or above market levels. And from a market perspective, James? James A. Beer: Well, I was just going to add, our experience thus far in fiscal '15 has been a stronger first half than a second half. And while we're only just really still in the middle of our FY '16 planning exercise, directionally, I wouldn't be surprised to see that continuing into the future. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And just margin-wise, just various challenges across various markets but nothing specific? James A. Beer: Well, I think the margin side of Celesio will be driven by the experience of Brazil and France in particular. Again, the U.K., we're seeing strong performance and we're somewhat encouraged by the situation in Germany that seems to be seeing some stability. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Well Robert just knocked off my question so I'll just ask a separate one that's of lesser importance. But, John, you mentioned -- you always like to mention a small business in the company that's doing well. And this time, you spent a little extra time in prepared remarks talking about US Oncology and the CRO services businesses. I'm curious if there was anything specific around that, that drove the additional attention this time related to the market or areas where you're investing and things of that sort? And I appreciate it. John H. Hammergren: Well, I think you're -- the question is a good one. Our focus really is not material from a financial perspective on what we do on the CRO business related to what we get paid to do those clinical trials. It's probably more relevant, our position with the manufacturers and the import that we have in the network to those manufacturers relative to working with them about products, particularly early in the community-oncology space. I would say that there's a lot more clinical trial work done obviously in these big universities settings when they can go to a single enterprise to get a bunch of work done. But there's really no other aggregation of community oncologists where they're going to have a single enterprise approach and pick up so many different markets and so many different types of doctors. So I think that we're heavily focused on making sure that in the portfolio of things we do for manufacturers in all of our businesses, that we continue to add value in a significant way and find ways to differentiate what we do. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI, Research Division : So I just wanted to quickly touch on the Tech Solutions business. It's been a sort of long winding road the last few years. And obviously, you've made a number of decisions to kind of restructure and revamp the business. As we're sort of exiting the year, I'm looking for more qualitative not quantitative, but how do you feel like the portfolio now is kind of taking shape? And I guess as you think about areas to either strengthen or whether or not there's even anything left that's small, left to sort of maybe not divest but deemphasize, how do you feel like you need to kind of continue evolve that asset to be a sort of net contributor to the business on an EBIT growth basis going forward? John H. Hammergren: Well, we're pleased with the performance of that business, it's basically in line with what we had anticipated this year, given that we had talked about that we were going to and have prepared the portfolio to focus on those businesses where we felt we had an opportunity to grow. And in particular, took out a business or 2 that produced no earnings. And part of what you've seen is great margin expansion as a result of that focus and attention. The businesses that are performing well there are businesses that we've had for a long time and that are continuing to modify their models so we can create a recurring revenue stream. And I would say the businesses that are flat or struggling are those that have either been replaced in the market with other priorities that people are spending on, other things that they have to buy and not buy some of our products that they'll have to come back around to later, or businesses where a transition's underway from a technology perspective. So I think we are still in middle of the game relative to the transition between Horizon and Paragon, which will be ongoing, which is a bit of a headwind as we think going forward. But we're also trying to invest in front of what we think will be a buy cycle for products that will help customers understand data better to make better decisions to take on risk and to follow the patient in a more longitudinal way. So there's a bunch of interesting places that we're placing bets, including CommonWell Health, that we think will pay off. But generally steady as she goes is the way we think about it at this point. Operator : We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Maybe if I can jump onto Ross' question a little bit, expand if you could, John. If we were to look at this business a few years out from now, I know in the past and today as well, you talk about some of the strengths, particularly interoperability and RelayHealth -- the assets that were RelayHealth. What do you think the mix of this business will look like? And as you kind of wind down some of the other legacy businesses, how much longer do you think that will take for you? John H. Hammergren: Well I think that it's -- the question is difficult to answer given the prioritization our customers place on some of these activities. An example would be the significant amount of business we have in the payer space and our ability to focus our customers on spending against the next opportunity to optimize their performance as opposed to spending against issues that they have to deal with either from a regulatory perspective or a security perspective, et cetera. So our customers' priorities sometimes don't necessarily match where we're well positioned from a product portfolio perspective. I would say though that as you think out 2 or 3 years, the EMR space and the transition away from Horizon will be more complete or complete, and we'll see more results, we think, in terms of this pay-for-performance priority. I mentioned that HHS and others believe that the market has to move more towards a value-based reimbursement methodology. That's going to require additional investment. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : And is that coming from sort of more through the trained up spaces, really from your payer solutions business, as well as sort of the RelayHealth business? John H. Hammergren: Well I think we're well positioned in the connectivity spaces because those transactions are already flowing through our businesses and those transactions are well underway and we are helping our customers do things more efficiently with more knowledge as a result of connectivity and interoperability. I think it's the places where folks can delay their purchasing decisions that we experience the volatility in our base. And most of our businesses today that are ahead of plan are ahead of plan because of volumes related to transactions. And most of the businesses that are behind their plans in our technology suite are behind not because customers have chosen somebody else's solution, they're behind because the buy decision has been delayed because there's other priorities for the customer, either from a capital deployment perspective or other priorities from a workload perspective for their IT groups to focus on other things other than buying a piece of software that might have a great return but they just don't have the ability to do it given that the priorities are someplace else. So I think that that's why this business is a little bit difficult to forecast because of some of those nuances that don't frankly exist in our distribution businesses where, unless you lose a large customer, you can count on the volume being there the next year, and it's just a question of maintaining that satisfaction level of the customers to continue to grow the business. Operator : Our last question today comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : The first question was a quick follow-up bringing it back to procurement. I know it's only been a short while since obtaining operational control. But knowing Paul and his team, I suspect they've already had a healthy dose of meetings with the manufacturer. So could you give us any specifics as to the progress you've made there and maybe some broad strokes as to how the conversations are going? And maybe even if and how you shifted your approach to the market as you're receiving early feedback? John H. Hammergren: Well, we are very early in this process. We couldn't really begin this dialogue until we had operational control. That didn't happen until middle of December. And I would say that our early conversations with manufacturers have been very positive, and we've made very nice progress. And I think most of the manufacturers in the world have an interest in having a dialogue with McKesson because of the value that we bring and the customers that have entrusted us with their business and their volumes to go to the marketplace in a unified way. So I do feel positive about where we're headed. I think it's early to try to quantify timing or value. But I think from a first-step perspective, we're on track with where we thought we would be at this point post-domination. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Fair enough. I had to try on that one. And then just a quick follow-up. James, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned in the Technology segment that there were some larger client delays due to competing projects, I believe it was. So could you elaborate on that a little bit? And what gives you confidence that it'll come back? James A. Beer: Yes. It's really just what John was expanding on in one of his last comments there. We have seen in some of the technology businesses a delay in some of the bookings that we continue to expect to come through. But from the customers' perspective, it's a bit of a sequencing, a bit of a prioritization issue. So yes, I would expect to get that business. It's just a matter of precisely when. John H. Hammergren: Well. Thank you, operator, and thank you, all, for being on the call today and for your time. I'm pleased with our solid results in the third quarter, and I'm excited about the opportunities we see across our business to deliver exceptional value to our customers. I'm now going to hand the call back to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin? Erin Lampert : Thank you, John. On March 3, we will present at the Cowen Healthcare Conference in Boston, and we will release fourth quarter earnings results in May. Thank you and goodbye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

Thanks and here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Our fourth-quarter results wrap up another year of outstanding earnings growth led by strong performance in our Distribution Solutions segment. For the full year, revenues increased 30% to $179 billion and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 29% over the prior year to $11.11. Fiscal 2015 was an exceptional year across McKesson as we deepened our relationships with our customers and manufacturing partners while expanding our scale in global reach. There are many achievements to highlight, but to name just a few. In fiscal 2015 we formally secured operating control of Celesio and created a global sourcing and procurement office in London. This office will lead our efforts since we partner with manufacturers to more efficiently and effectively provide pharmaceuticals across a wide variety of markets and geographies. During the year we demonstrated the strong value we provide to our U.S. Pharmaceutical customers as we successfully operationalized our agreement with Rite Aid and entered into an expanded relationship with Omnicare for both the sourcing and distribution of brand and generic pharmaceuticals. Our Medical-Surgical business met or exceeded all of our year two integration priorities related to the PSS acquisition, driving significant efficiencies in our IT and distribution infrastructure while maintaining the exceptional level of service our customers expect. We drove market-leading growth in our specialty business, expanding our position across oncology, rheumatology and ophthalmology and extending our track record of annual growth for new physicians joining the U.S. Oncology Network, and we continue to work alongside a growing number of partners in the CommonWell Health Alliance where we are beginning to see real-world progress in making the promise of data interoperability a reality. In addition to these terrific accomplishments, we generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow for the year and continued our strong track record of creating value for our shareholders through our portfolio approach to capital deployment. I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in fiscal 2015. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their leadership and constant focus on putting our customers' success at the forefront of everything we do. Today we also provided fiscal 2016 guidance of $12.20 to $12.70 per diluted share, representing an expected increase of 12% to 16% in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. This plan reflects strong growth across our businesses on top of the exceptional results in fiscal 2015. I'm excited about the outlook for our business and the momentum we have for fiscal 2016. We have a tremendous number of opportunities ahead of us, and I'm confident in our team's ability to continue to deliver innovative solutions that help our customers drive better business health. Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment, the key themes of an aging population are rise in chronic diseases and the challenge of containing costs remain important in the evolution of our industry. Against this backdrop it is encouraging to see great innovation taking place. Pharmacies continue to expand their value as convenient sites of care for patients by providing an ever-increasing set of services to help consumers better manage their health. In turn, consumers are more engaged in understanding the cost and quality of healthcare. With higher deductible plans becoming more prevalent and consumers playing a larger role in the selection of their health insurance through employers or exchanges, people are increasingly looking for transparency and data as they make more informed healthcare choices. The policymakers have set meaningful direction to support a transition to value-based care in the United States. Recently Congress overwhelmingly passed H.R. 2 which permanently replaces Medicare's sustainable growth rate system. The bill, which was signed by the President, provides needed reimbursement stability and predictability for providers in the near term while they transition to a more incentive-based payment system by the year 2019. The bill also contains provisions for healthcare data interoperability among other important provisions. I believe the passage of these measures and the bipartisan support for continued reforms intended to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery in our country will continue to spur business innovation to solve healthcare's most critical challenges of cost, quality and access. McKesson stands unique in the industry for our depth of our relationships and strength of our experience across healthcare, and this positions us well to help our customers navigate ongoing challenges and emerge as stronger, more effective businesses. Moving now to our business results for the fourth quarter and the full year, Distribution Solutions had another excellent year led by outstanding performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. On a constant currency basis, full year fiscal 2015 Distribution Solutions revenue increased 33% and full year adjusted operating profit increased 31% compared to the prior year. Although adjusted operating margin in this segment declined modestly year-over-year, driven primarily by the impact of the mix of hepatitis C drugs, we remain confident in our ability to consistently expand operating margin over time. North America distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, delivered strong results for the year with 17% revenue growth on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The U.S. Pharmaceutical business delivered tremendous growth in fiscal 2015, driven by the strong expansion of our generics business including growth of approximately 40% in our one-stop proprietary generics program. We are proud to be a full-service generic sourcing and distribution partner to an increasing number of our customers. Fiscal 2015 provided a visible platform for our U.S. Pharmaceutical team to demonstrate their ability to drive strong value to our in-house proprietary sourcing expertise and to drive efficiencies throughout the supply chain while strengthening the service levels our customers enjoy. In fiscal 2015 we also continued to perform well for our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners and maintained steady levels of compensation in return. And Health Mart maintained its strong record of growth during fiscal 2015 ending the year with nearly 3,800 stores or approximately 15% growth over the prior year. In summary, the U.S. Pharmaceutical team had an excellent year and I believe this business remains extremely well positioned for continued success. Our Canadian distribution business delivered solid results in fiscal 2015. In addition to maintaining market-leading position in pharmaceutical distribution in Canada, we continue to grow our extensive network of banner independent pharmacies across Canada where we now serve approximately 1,900 participating stores. The expansion of our private label generic pharmaceutical offering under the Sivem brand continues to exceed our expectations. And we're pleased with the exceptional growth and the expansion of our Canadian specialty business in fiscal 2015 which now includes more than 85 Inviva infusion clinics across Canada. Turning now to our U.S. Specialty business. In fiscal 2015 results were strong driven by growth across our portfolio of assets included in our oncology business as well as other specialty categories such as rheumatology and ophthalmology. I'm also pleased to report we continue to grow the number of physicians who choose to joined and further strengthen the U.S. Oncology Network. For the fourth year in a row, Black Book ranking placed McKesson's iKnowMed as the number one oncology electronic health record in the market. We continue to expand our services to both payers and manufacturers. We are working with payers using innovative payment models that tie quality to outcomes and have secured multiple contracts for value-based reimbursement in oncology care. And with manufactures we continue to be a key partner to our clinical trial research network and our comprehensive manufacturer facing solutions including commercial support, product distribution support and patient services. I want to acknowledge that there has been quite a lot of talk of late regarding biosimilars. We expect the biosimilar landscape to evolve over time and we believe this new category will play a growing role in the specialty market. The success of each biosimilar drug and drug class has many dependencies, including the channel of delivery, the disease which the drug addresses, physicians' views on quality and efficacy and the value delivered by various participants in the supply chain. Our comprehensive service offerings and capabilities put McKesson in an excellent position to provide value in this exciting and evolving market. In summary, North American pharmaceutical distribution and services delivered outstanding results in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016 we expect high single digit revenue growth compared to the prior year. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues were $26.4 billion for the full year, an increase of 5% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant currency basis. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in the last five months since formally gaining operating control of Celesio. Our London-based procurement organization is off to a solid start and we still expect to generate between $275 million and $325 million in synergies by the end of fiscal 2019. We are making important long-term investments to upgrade the information technology infrastructure across Celesio and we continue to invest in refreshing our existing retail pharmacy footprint creating a differentiated health focused experience in our pharmacies and we are encouraged to see signs of more stable performance in important markets by Germany. And as previously announced, we have launched a sale process for the Brazilian businesses, PanPharma and Oncoprod, which are now reported in discontinued operations. For fiscal 2016 we expect that the international pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue will be roughly flat compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis. I'm pleased that our Celesio businesses are performing well and are well-positioned to execute on their operating plans and priorities. Our Medical-Surgical business delivered solid results with 5% growth in revenues in fiscal 2015. We have now completed year two of our three-year PSS World Medical integration plan and I'm pleased to report the team continues to meet or exceed expectations on all fronts. The Medical-Surgical team made significant progress in the integration distribution center network, migrations of critical IT systems and harmonization of our product portfolios in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 represents the third and final year of integration work and we expect to complete consolidation of our distribution network and further integration of key IT systems across the business this year. I remain extremely impressed with our Medical-Surgical team and our ability to grow and expand the strong relationships we are privileged to have with our customers while keeping operational excellence at the center of everything that we do. For fiscal 2016 we expect Medical-Surgical revenue growth in the mid-single digits compared to the prior year. Overall I'm proud of our full-year operating performance in Distribution Solutions and believe we have strong momentum as we enter the new fiscal year. As we look ahead to fiscal 2016 we expect that Distribution Solutions revenue growth will increase by mid-single digits compared to the prior year, and we expect adjusted operating margin to expand by low double digit basis points compared to the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the year Technology Solutions revenues were down 8% to $3.8 billion. Full-year adjusted operating profit was down 8% to $486 million. We remain encouraged by the strong results we see, particularly in our Relay Health Pharmacy and Connectivity businesses and our Payer Solutions business and by the signs of stabilization and growth that we see in our Medical Imaging business. At the same time we continue to take steps to further refine our portfolio of businesses. Our fiscal 2015 results were impacted by the anticipated year-over-year decline in our hospital software business, the planned elimination of a product line and the previously disclosed wind down of our international technology business. Looking forward to fiscal 2016 we expect Technology Solutions revenue to decline by mid-single digits year-over-year as growth in our Connectivity, Payer Solutions, Medical Imaging and provider revenue cycle businesses will be offset by an expected decline in our hospital software business and the pending sale of another business line. However, we expect adjusted operating margin in Technology Solutions will expand in fiscal 2016 to the low end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of high teens. In summary, we remain committed to helping our customers use information technology strategically to better enable business, better enable care and better enable connectivity. To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a strong plan for our fiscal 2016 that reflects growth across our broad portfolio of businesses. And we expect that both of our segments will expand operating margin and will reach the initial part of the range for the long-term adjusted operating margin targets we outlined at our investor day last June. We have the financial strength and discipline to continue to invest in the growth we expect across our businesses, and finally we are in businesses that continue to generate strong cash flow from operations. We expect that our cash flow from operations will be approximately $3 billion in fiscal 2016. I'm confident in our teams' ability to continue to deliver value to customers and the strong financial returns for our shareholders. We expect fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.20 to $12.70, representing 12% to 16% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results. James? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard we are very pleased by our results for the quarter and for the full year. Our results reflect strong growth in our adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share driven by the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. In addition, our capital structure remained a source of financial strength as we generated strong operating cash flow and continued to leverage our portfolio approach to capital deployment. Today I will cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. I will also present guidance for fiscal 2016. As a reminder, we provide our guidance on an annual basis due to the seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter variability inherent in many of our businesses. Before I begin, there are two aspects of our financial results for our fourth quarter and full year that I would like to bring to your attention. First, our current year and prior year financials were recast to exclude the results of Celesio's operations in Brazil. The results from our business in Brazil and other businesses held for sale are reported as part of discontinued operations on Schedule 1 of the tables accompanying our press release. Brazil's operations drove a loss from discontinued operations per diluted share of approximately $0.10 for the quarter and for the full year. As part of the decision to sell the Brazilian business, we also recorded a $235 million after-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of this business to its estimated net fair value. This impairment charge generated a loss of $0.99 per diluted share from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter and full year. Second, during the fourth quarter the euro traded at an average exchange rate of $1.12 per euro versus our prior expectation for a rate of $1.15 per euro. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar generated an incremental negative foreign currency translation impact of approximately $0.03 to our adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter versus our prior expectation. Now let's move to our results. My comments today will focus on our full year fiscal 2015 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $11.11, which excludes four items : the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments. Now turning to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2A and 2B, consolidated revenues increased 19% for the quarter and 30% for the full year to $179 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 11% for the quarter to $3 billion, driven principally by an additional month of contribution from Celesio as we closed the acquisition in February 2014 of the same quarter last year. For the full year, adjusted gross profit increased 36% to $11.8 billion, primarily driven by our acquisition of Celesio and market growth, including strong execution in our Distribution businesses. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.9 billion were up 9% for the quarter, driven mainly by the inclusion of an additional month of Celesio's operating expenses given the timing of our acquisition, as previously mentioned. For the full year, excluding the impact of Celesio, consolidated adjusted operating expenses increased 1%. Other income for the full year totaled $65 million. Full year adjusted interest expense increased 47% versus the prior year to $374 million, primarily driven by debt issued and assumed related to our acquisition of Celesio. For fiscal 2016, we expect our year-over-year interest expense to be less than the prior year based on $1.5 billion of planned debt repayments. Now moving to taxes, for the full year our adjusted tax rate was 30.6%, which reflects our mix of income and a number of discrete tax items. Our fiscal 2016 earnings outlook assumes an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31.5%, which is based on our expected mix of U.S. versus international earnings; however, this rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For the full year, adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $2.7 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $11.11. Overall, this year's adjusted earnings per share benefited significantly from our mix of business, specifically the favorable performance across our entire portfolio of generic pharmaceutical offerings, and the contribution from our acquisition of Celesio. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1% year-over-year to 235 million. During the fourth quarter we completed a $340 million share repurchase, which fully exhausted the previously-granted board authorization. In addition, our board recently approved a new share repurchase authorization amount of up to $500 million. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2016 is 236 million. We expect to continue our historical portfolio approach to capital deployment while addressing upcoming significant debt maturities. Specific fiscal 2016 capital allocation priorities are as follows. Planning for existing debt maturities and thereby maintaining our investment-grade ratings, investing in our current businesses and reviewing opportunities to pursue value creating M&A. Let's now turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. On a constant currency basis, Distribution Solutions total revenues increased 23% for the quarter and increased 33% for the full year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by our acquisition of Celesio and market growth in our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business. During fiscal 2016, we anticipate Distribution Solutions revenues will increase by a mid-single digit percentage over the prior year driven by expected market growth and our mix of business. North American distribution business revenues increased 18% on a reported basis and 19% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. For the full year, revenues increased 17% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by market growth and our mix of business including revenues from the sale of drugs used in the treatment of hepatitis C. For fiscal 2016, we expect our North American distribution of business to deliver a high single digit percentage revenue growth compared to fiscal 2015. For the fourth quarter, international pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue increased 30% on a reported basis and 51% on a constant currency basis to $5.9 billion, reflecting one additional month of revenues as we closed our acquisition of Celesio in February 2014. For the full year, the underlying revenues of Celesio increased by 5% on a constant currency basis. For fiscal 2016, we expect Celesio's constant currency revenues to be approximately flat to the prior fiscal year. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 5% for the quarter and the full year driven by market growth. We continue to execute against our three-year PSS integration plan and perform well against our synergy business case. During fiscal 2016, we expect to complete the final year of our integration plan while delivering mid-single digit percentage revenue growth year-over-year. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 46% for the full year on a 31% increase in segment revenues resulting in a 58 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, segment adjusted gross profit increased 48%. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 59% on a reported basis and 62% on a constant currency basis for the full year driven primarily by our acquisition of Celesio and by the strong revenue growth within our North American distribution business. Excluding the impact of Celesio, our full year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expense was up approximately 3% versus the prior year. As we look ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect continued growth in segment adjusted operating profit driven by the contribution from our generic business specifically from expanded one-stop sales and the breadth and depth of our global sourcing efforts. In addition, we expect branded pricing trends to be consistent with the prior year and anticipate generic drug pricing trends slightly below those observed in fiscal 2015. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 243 basis points, a decline of five basis points over the prior-year. This decline was primarily driven by a higher volume of branded drug sales including the sale of hepatitis C drugs and a lower than expected contribution from Celesio. Excluding the impact of the hepatitis C drugs, the segment adjusted operating margin was approximately 255 basis points for the quarter, up 7 basis points from the prior year. Distribution Solutions full year adjusted operating profit increased 30% to $4.2 billion and we ended the year with an adjusted operating profit margin of 238 basis points, a decline of three basis points over the prior-year. Again, this decline was driven by a higher mix of branded drug sales, in particular hepatitis C drugs. Excluding the impact of these hepatitis C drugs, segment adjusted operating margin was approximately 247 basis points, an increase of six basis points over the prior year. For fiscal 2016, we expect Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin to expand low double digit basis points compared to the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 10% for the quarter and down 8% for the full year to $3.1 billion. This full year decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the hospital software platform, the planned elimination of a product line and the wind-down of our U.K. workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect Technology Solutions revenues to decline by a mid-single digit percentage as year-over-year growth in our payer-facing and connectivity businesses will be offset by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the pending sale of a business line. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 14% for the quarter and 9% for the full year as a result of various cost management and restructuring initiatives. For the full year, adjusted operating profits decreased 8% to $486 million, primarily due to a lower revenue base and the wind-down of our U.K. Workforce business. Our full year adjusted operating margin remained flat to the prior year at 15.8%. During fiscal 2016, we expect to achieve an adjusted operating margin in the high teens. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing. In addition, our working capital metrics also include Celesio. For receivables, our days sales outstanding decreased three days to 26 days. Our days sales in inventories decreased two days from the prior year to 31 days and our days sales in payables was approximately flat versus the prior year at 54 days. Our working capital management is illustrative of our continued focus on cash generation. During fiscal 2015, we reported $3.1 billion in cash flow from operations. We ended the year with a cash balance of $5.3 billion with $2.3 billion held offshore. Looking ahead, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016. Internal capital spending totaled $545 million for the full year, which includes spending related to Celesio. For fiscal 2016, internal capital spending is projected to be between $600 million and $650 million as we continue to develop our information technology infrastructure across McKesson and make incremental investments related to our retail pharmacy operations. Now I would like to briefly review some important considerations regarding our acquisition of Celesio and the related synergy case. Our current fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS guidance contemplates making measured progress towards achieving transaction synergies of $275 million to $325 million by the end of fiscal 2019. And as a reminder, the vast majority of these synergies represent procurement-related savings from our global sourcing efforts. You might recall that subsequent to achieving operating control in December 2014, McKesson consolidates 100% of Celesio's net income, and in exchange we are obligated to pay an annual guaranteed dividend of \u20ac0.83 per share to Celesio's non-controlling shareholders. And today, while we continue to consolidate 100% of Celesio's results from continuing operations, it is important to note that for fiscal 2016 we expect our ownership of Celesio to remain unchanged at 76%. Our dividend obligation to Celesio's non-controlling shareholders will be recorded controlled in the line titled net income attributable to non-controlling interest on Schedule 1 and is expected to drive a fiscal 2016 expense of approximately $44 million or about $11 million per quarter assuming our 76% ownership stake at an exchange rate of $1.10 per euro. Now before I conclude, I would point out that in today's press release we detailed the key assumptions underlying our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $12.20 to $12.70. As always, our plan includes certain risk but overall we see significant opportunities to create continued value for our shareholders, customers and business partners in fiscal 2016. Our plan calls for outstanding growth on fiscal 2015 results that were exceptionally strong and represents adjusted EPS expansion of 12% to 16% on a constant currency basis. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thank you very much for taking the question. John or Jim, maybe just a little bit on Celesio. You guys \u2013 Celesio has put forward the plan to delist the shares. How should we think about how that accelerates whether or not investors in Europe are going to put the shares back to McKesson? And, I guess, can you guys provide us any update on when we might expect to see the shares delisted? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, George, I think the objective we have is to focus on down listing now and it will probably lead or could lead to delisting in the end but our focus now is to down list. It provides certain efficiencies and it streamlines some of our reporting requirements in Europe. As to how the minority shareholders may behave as a result of this, it certainly would be speculation on my part. As you know they have a price that's already been fixed through this process that they can put their shares to us and clearly we'd have an obligation to buy them at those prices and to the extent that this accelerates their interest in doing so then we have to have the wherewithal available to us to make that transaction possible, but I guess other than that I don't have much else to say about it. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Then maybe just a quick follow up would be, you are a few more months now into your majority ownership of Celesio. Any kind of surprises or anything new the company's learned either to the positive or the negative side? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's a good question. I appreciate it. I think that as you might have noticed in the quarter we announced that we were going to put for sale our Brazilian assets and I think that's an example of what McKesson typically does in these types of situations, is to look carefully at the portfolio of businesses that are represented, particularly in a large asset like Celesio, and begin to focus our efforts and our management team on those assets that we believe will deliver the best long-term value for our company and for our shareholders. And as such this portfolio modification or optimization was contemplated and announced as a result. We continue to be very encouraged by the progress we're making in the U.K., in particular in our retail strategies. Several of our other markets are performing well and we are continuing I think to make progress. You may have noticed in the conversation, I talked about the revenues being relatively flat and it's principally driven by two factors, and that is in addition to the Brazilian operation going into discontinued ops, the Norway business loss, the large hospital customer, which affected our revenues in that market, and we also continue to have some challenges in the French market as reimbursement continues to be a pressure point there. But I would say that we see signs of Germany continuing to stabilize and as I mentioned the U.K. business in particular is performing well. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. John, can you maybe just give us an update on the London procurement operation? At what point, what percentage of contracts have you signed, I mean just to give us an indication as to how much more work you have to do on the procurement side? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks for the question, Lisa. As you know, we were delayed in getting operational control of Celesio, so it delayed our ability to really begin to execute against the procurement synergies that we believe exist for us as we create a global footprint and a single relationship with these manufacturers on a global basis. And so that work was delayed. As I mentioned, we've launched that opening of that office in January. We're in the midst of our discussions with, as you might imagine, the very largest of our manufacturing partners, talking about how we can streamline the relationship between our companies and make sure that they win when we win, and those discussions are probably too early to describe relative to how far along we are or certainly percentages of completion. I would say that we're getting a terrific response, however, and the manufacturers are eager to work with a company like McKesson where we can deliver such significant value. And I think it also helps that we can sort of have a unified message globally with what we're trying to do. And clearly our footprint in the U.S., our strength with Rite Aid, our strength with Omnicare, our Health Mart capabilities, I mentioned the 1,900 banner pharmacies in Canada along with the several thousand pharmacies in Europe, both owned under the Lloyds brand as well as franchised, give us a significant footprint that manufacturers are very interested in. So I'm excited about the early progress and we'll clearly keep you guys informed as we continue to make progress. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And in fact just staying on that generic theme, I was surprised to hear in fiscal 2016 you expect generics to be below 2015. Is that because of the timing of the way Nexium came in, or am I missing something as I just look at what's expected to lose patent protection over the next 12 months? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's a good question. I think we actually expect more dollar value of generic launches, or I should say branded generic launches \u2013 launches of branded drugs in fiscal 2016 than there were in 2015. So you're right, there's more dollar value of product going generic. I think as we look at our portfolio of generic estimates, we frankly see the character and characteristics of some of those generics being not quite as favorable for us as the launches that took place in FY 2015. So an example would be a generic that might have many, many participants, and the value back to the supply chain as a result of that competitive activity wouldn't be as great. So I would just say there are some nuancial differences between our view of the portfolio of generics. It's not so much size-based as it is characteristic of the launches. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks, John. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the question. You're obviously ending with a cash balance very strong, over $5 billion. It looks like the free cash flow you're calling for in fiscal 2016, about $2.4 billion. And based on your comments, both John and James, it sounds like maybe share repurchases for next year aren't quite as high a priority as M&A. I'm curious if A, there's anything specific leading to this maybe slight re-prioritization for next year? And then, John, I guess more importantly, can you share maybe what in your mind are the priorities right now as you think about where you maybe want more exposure across healthcare? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Why don't I start with the answer and let James fill in some of the details. Clearly based on our belief at this point and what we've described as our expectations for fiscal 2016, we will have a very strong balance sheet at the end of the year. We've also talked about our priority related to maintaining investment grade. We did talk in the call about debt that's going to be extinguished this year as it comes due and in an earlier conversation we talked about the rights of the minority shareholders of Celesio. So there are some uses of capital including internal investment that James and I have described for fiscal 2016 that will consume some of this financial strength. We've also talked over time about our \u2013 in addition to the priority of remaining investment grade, the priority of high-value transactions and the ability for McKesson to execute on those transactions in a strategic way that produces very positive returns, above our cost of capital returns, for our shareholders. And that remains a priority as well. And we did talk about the board approving a $500 million repurchase, which is not insignificant as it relates to share buybacks. So I think you'll continue to see us unfold our strategy as the year goes on and we're cognizant of the fact that our balance sheet remains a source of opportunity for us and we plan to use that opportunity judiciously on behalf of our shareholders. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would just further emphasize that I think it's helpful to have some cash balance flexibility to allow us to take advantage of attractive M&A if it should come along during this period of delevering. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's fair. And I guess just a quick follow up on some of the comments you made around follow-on biologics or biosimilars, John. I know you don't typically get into individual drug launches but given this is kind of the first of its kind, I was wondering if you could maybe share your thoughts around how you think about biosimilar in Neupogen coming to the market and whether or not there's anything factored into the guidance around that launch or potential launch I should say? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you hit in a very key comment there about potential launches. So I think that it relates to our fiscal 2016 guidance and the uncertainty related to biosimilars and their uptick we have nothing included in our guidance related to biosimilars. I would say that I think the company is well-positioned to hit the biosimilar space. As you know, we have a very active specialty business and we have a complete array of services that could be provided to a bio similar manufacturer which we think will launch in a very similar way to branded manufacturers launches in terms of the support for patients, the special handling requirements, the reimbursement requirements, the physician contact that needs to happen. And we do that in a significant way today. In addition, I might add any of the biosimilars that we'll be focused on the oncology market are particularly attractive to us because of our physician network. And the U.S. Oncology Network has a track record of helping branded companies come to market through our clinical trial work and we also have the ability to create formularies when they're convinced that from a clinical perspective the product can be selected and defined for the patients in a way that delivers best-in-class quality and lowest possible cost. So, I think that unique asset in US Oncology will play a role here over the years as biosimilars come to market in the oncology class. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: It should be interesting to watch how it plays out. Thanks, John. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question, guys. John, I'm curious. It's \u2013 I know your business is kind of second derivative in nature but with King Burwell kind of weeks away from a decision of the Supreme Court, how would you view a negative Supreme Court ruling on ACA subsidies relative to your outlook on the core U.S. Pharmaceutical and Med-Surg business? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's been difficult for us all along to quantify ACA's effect on the demand in our businesses albeit we do believe there is a positive effect associated with people getting access to care in the fashion that ACA is providing. I would say that in my conversation with people on the Hill and at the state level around markets, I believe that the countries are going to have to position itself to take care of folks that are not able to afford their own care or to do so in a way that is an effective and efficient for the businesses and for our country. And so I think the end result or even if something were to come from the Supreme Court ruling that may put a question mark on the subsidy or support for these patients I think that there'll be a quick reaction on the Hill to try to find another way to provide low-cost quality care to patients so they don't fall through the crack and end up in the emergency rooms in America. And I would remind also to the listeners that know this well that pharmaceutical use and the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals and primary care physicians is the best way to treat patients as opposed to letting them their situations falter and having them end up in an acute situation in one of our Great American hospitals and that I think needs to be avoided. So, I think it's early to call but I think that this combined with the continued pressure from the demographic perspective and all the things that we see from a growth and opportunity perspective in our industry keeps me very excited about the future for McKesson. David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful. And a quick follow up, flipping over the IT side of the business with the doc fix legislation and some of the focus there being on interoperability and what have you, what do you see as kind of the status of CommonWell and opportunities relative to both CommonWell continued move forward and revenue opportunities for Relay Health in particular as it relates to work that you guys do in there? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks for the question. We are excited to be a participant in CommonWell, and as you know the CommonWell is a not-for-profit gathering of roughly 70% or so of the systems provider volumes in the country for physician offices and hospitals, and that aggregation of technology companies who have decided to come together and create a method by which we can move information between our non-native systems or between each other's competitors' systems, said another way, is a landmark opportunity for this country to actually get interoperability and exchange data in a way that's never been done before. So this opportunity for McKesson, I guess, translates into our ability to continue to support CommonWell's mission through the services that have been offered by Relay Health, and Relay is one of probably many in the future providers of capabilities to CommonWell that will facilitate this movement of patient data and financial data that'll be very helpful. So I'm quite excited about it. I'm frankly right now more excited about what it's going to do for healthcare in this country than I am necessarily for the revenues of Relay, which will follow over the years. But I think the adoption curve is going to be steep and I think people are going to benefit from CommonWell's efforts. David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good afternoon, and congrats on a great quarter and guidance. A couple follow-up questions. First on the Tech Solutions, so, John, obviously you expressed your excitement around CommonWell, but when you think about the Tech Solutions segment in performance over the last few years, when you think about the different parts of the business does the segment still fit strategically with the rest of the McKesson portfolio? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Why, I think the way we think about our technology businesses is the value that it delivers to customers and our ability to make sure that we're delivering against those needs. As we think about the overall portfolio of McKesson's companies, you can see that we are always active in our management of that portfolio, and that's frankly one of the reasons that the Technology Solutions segment, which is an aggregation of many different companies, revenue has been down as a result of that portfolio activity. But there are assets in there that are very directly correlated to other business unit strategies in our corporation. It could be things like our Relay pharmacy business, which is the connectivity provider for most of America's pharmacies, or it could be our outsourcing business for physician offices, which is heavily correlated with our practice management activities where we're supporting the efforts of community oncology or community physician work, and then there's other businesses that may not be as correlated to the strategy of the rest of our businesses, and in those cases the key for us is can we optimize the performance of those companies as standalone companies vis-\u00e0-vis their competitors. So I don't ever rule anything in or out on any of our businesses relative to our strategy. I think I look at it as an evolution, and we need to continue to do so, and we need to make sure that we optimize the value and the performance of these businesses on behalf of our shareholders. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And one follow up that's related to questions that we're getting from investors. Obviously there's a lot of chatter out there about potential M&A of some clients of yours and some of them have longer-term contracts. So do these contracts typically have a change of control clause in them? If you can just clarify that. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the industry's going to continue to be filled with chatter and clatter related to strategic partnerships and mergers and acquisitions, and certainly people in our healthcare industry that promulgate some of these discussions and rumors more than others. McKesson as a policy, really doesn't \u2013 we don't talk about our customer contracts, and we certainly don't talk publicly about M&A or potential M&A. We have very solid relationships with our customers. We've earned the right to have their business for years and sometimes decades, and as you know, we've currently earned the right in several cases of expanding our relationship with our customers to include all of the purchasing of their generics and the distribution of their business. And I might also note that we have a very broad base of customers. So we clearly, to the extent that we \u2013 that our relationship with one customer changes, hopefully we're at the same time expanding relationships with others. So all I can tell you is we stay close to our customers and in many cases if a customer changes from an ownership perspective, McKesson stays with that customer even into the new entity from a service perspective and you might recall, Ricky, when CVS purchased Caremark we were fortunate to have CVS continue the Caremark relationship with McKesson. So I think there are many examples where you will see M&A activity and McKesson maintains the relationship. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess just from me just a quick question on the FY 2016 guidance. While EPS at the midpoint is just a touch below The Street consensus, it seems to me, it may just be due primarily to slightly higher tax rate year-over-year also that that flash share count $500 million buyback authorization. I my sense is investors probably are not going to be too concerned about but I guess for me just big picture, just curious that there's still potential for the combined company tax rate to still come down over the next few years despite the fact that they may be up a little in FY 2016. Thanks. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, the tax rate guidance that we've offered for FY 2016 reflects the expected mix of profits between our international businesses, which tend to be taxed at a lower rate versus our domestic businesses. And recall, of course, those domestic businesses have been growing very nicely in recent years. And so that's a fact in the thought behind the 31.5% tax rate guide for fiscal 2016. We're not looking to try to project out beyond fiscal 2016 at this point in time. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, and good evening. I also wanted to follow up with one quick question on the guidance. It seems like one of the components of your guidance you talk about maybe lower pricing on the generic side in fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. It's kind of nice to have a conference call that is not dominated about generic price inflation but, John, I'm kind of curious. Could you give us your perspective in terms of what you are seeing there? And are you actually seeing any changes in the market? Or do you just believe it's prudent to assume some level of normalization? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Glen, I think you hit the same word I was going to use and that was prudent. I think we've seen a very robust cycle of generic inflation at least as we view it. And clearly, we expect it to continue at least we expect it to moderate as we give our guidance for next year to the extent that our prudent guidance proves to be incorrectly low and then at some point we'll over achieve our expectations to the extent that we projected to be too high in our crystal ball, then we'll be disappointed with what happens with the generics. But I think overall we remain very optimistic about our portfolio and how we manage it and I think we get good job of forecasting where the business is going to be. Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks very much. First I was just hoping that perhaps you could size the U.S. Specialty business and growth rate? But really my question is around specialty pharmacy. To be fair you have a specialty pharmacy operations ex-U.S. You interact with patients in U.S. Oncology. You own pharmacies, you have pharmacy franchises globally. So I'm just not sure why specialty pharmacy would truly be a foreign business to you, no pun intended on that or why you might not actually be interested in moving more in that direction and I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks for the question. We are in the Specialty Pharmacy business in various aspects of our strategy. And certainly if you think about it globally, particularly where we own pharmacies we have specialty pharmacy activity and you pointed out oncology is one example. I think we've always been sensitive to supporting our customers and their activities and we are reluctant to compete with our customers in any real significant way. So to the extent that specialty pharmacy can support our overall strategy and not be in conflict with what our customers expect from us and we'll continue to pursue and it in certain areas it makes a lot of sense for us to be there and in other areas it makes sense for us to support other people's Specialty Pharmacy businesses. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Is there any chance I could get you to put some figures around the size of specialty overall in the U.S., and the growth rate, you did mention you were growing above market? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No chance. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): What do you think the market's growing? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Slower than we are. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. Have a good night. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good afternoon. So, sticking on sort of the international parts of the business, you've owned the asset now for some time, you guys have done a tremendous job historically of rolling up various industries and obviously you have plenty of firepower to do deals. What have you learned about the various geographies so far where you play and where you don't play? And what is sort of your view of Brazil? How did that impact your view in emerging versus more developed markets to move into with that asset? And then how would you characterize valuations in some of those geographies versus what we see in the U.S., so a kind of a broad-reaching question on the M&A outlook in some of those newer markets? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ross, that's a very interesting question and I think it has a very complex answer that is \u2013 that I'll try to deal with. I think the way we think about Europe is the way I think about McKesson 16 years ago when I landed in this seat. How do we \u2013 how can we optimize the performance of the businesses we have and focus on those businesses and then how do we branch from those businesses to adjacencies that we know how to operate in markets where we can compete. And I think the situation with Brazil, it was not obvious that we could create a market-leading strategy there particularly given the vertical nature of some of the retailers in that market. And nuances associated with the business models down there and clearly whether it was scaled properly, et cetera, that I think the conclusion was reached that we should have our focus on Europe and in those markets where we currently have a strong beachhead. And in many of those markets we're number one or number two already from a distribution or a retailing perspective. And in many of those markets the hospital business is still direct, the specialty business is nascent. There aren't a lot of services that are similar to what we provide here in the U.S., both to manufacturers and to the end customers. And so I think we do see an opportunity both through organic growth as well as M&A in several of those markets and that'll be part of our focus as we think about the strength of our balance sheet. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : That's perfect. It's 6 o'clock, so I'll end there. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. I know there are a few other folks that are still on the line hoping to ask questions. So if you want to go a little bit further I'm happy to do that. Operator : We will go next to David Larsen with Leerink. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Yes. Congratulations on a great quarter. Can you just highlight again what the growth rate was in the OneStop Generics program? I thought I heard a very high number? And then maybe some descriptions around what drove that would be very helpful. Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, the OneStop program has been and continues to be very successful for us and this last year, the number I quoted was a 40% growth rate year-over-year, which was quite significant. Now, obviously a portion of that was our success with Rite Aid but the business still grew very significantly even outside of the Rite Aid business. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : We will go next to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask on Health Mart. The growth of 15% seems much stronger than the market so what portion of this is due to market growth as you define it? And where is the remainder of the growth coming from? Is it more taking share or small change that you did, (62:06) some of these activities in-house that are now going to the Health Mart franchise? Can you just elaborate there a little bit? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Just to be clear, the growth rate was in store count not in revenue of those stores. And so the stores, I'm sure some of them did come from competitors but I would imagine there's a portion of them that just came from great customers that have been doing business with us for a while and realized that Health Mart added a bigger opportunity for us and for them, and that expansion of our footprint with them and the services we provide gave us a better position with those customers. So it expands our footprint at Health Mart across the country and our objective with our customers is hopefully to earn the privilege to be Health Mart for all of them, obviously with the exception of the large chains which are creating their own brands. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then the follow up is just a bigger picture question, of ongoing M&A among pharmaceutical manufacturers and what we read about in the press. To ask the question a little bit differently though, at what point would you begin to get concerned of too much consolidation in the pharmaceutical space? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'm not concerned yet, and I would say that the manufacturing advantages (63:26) we have are very significant. Clearly to the extent that we can create value by delivering channel or volume to them, they're interested in working closely with us, and that's our objective. And I certainly don't see on the horizon a situation where manufacturers no longer need McKesson as part of their solution. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for sneaking me in there. A simple one would be, the London organization that you've created, is that independent from the international distribution business, meaning it doesn't roll up \u2013 the profits would roll up within the Celesio business? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Eric, I guess the best way to describe it is that it's a separate operation that is organized in London and it reports directly to Paul Julian, and its job is to focus on a global relationship with large global manufacturers. And as to the financial effect of those businesses, of this activity, you probably would find it in many different parts of our corporation, including maybe even Medical Supplies as we source globally for medical supplies and private label. So it really will \u2013 it'll end up in various P&Ls as success is reached there. Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : At this time we have no further questions so I return the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I certainly want to thank everybody for their time today and for being on the call. I know we ran a little bit over but it was our year end and we spent a little time chatting, so I wanted to make sure that we spent some time making sure we have all of your questions answered. We think we have a very strong operating plan for fiscal 2016 and certainly exciting growth opportunities across McKesson. I'm certainly proud of our track record of delivering value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders and to each of you, and I'm certainly proud of our terrific McKesson team which continues to deliver year in and year out. So with that, I'll turn it over to Erin for upcoming events for the financial community. Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, John. I have a preview of some upcoming events. We will participate at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference in Las Vegas tomorrow, May 13, and the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes on June 9. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you, and goodbye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson Corporation quarterly earnings call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Solari. Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6 :00 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I'd remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results : amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2016 results, available on our website, for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Please also note that on today's call, we will refer to certain measures calculated on a constant currency basis. Additional information on constant currency effects is available in our SEC filings. Thank you. And here is John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Erin. And thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today we reported a solid start to fiscal 2016. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $47.5 billion, up 13%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.14, up 30%, both on a constant currency basis over the prior year. During the first quarter we completed the sale of our Nurse Triage business, a small business within the Technology Solutions segment, and we recorded a gain of $0.16 per diluted share in the quarter. Therefore, we are updating our full-year guidance and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.36 to $12.86 for fiscal 2016. Turning now to our business results for the quarter, Distribution Solutions revenues were $46.8 billion, up 13% on a constant currency basis. And Distribution Solutions adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 17% on a constant currency basis. Our North American Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business, which includes U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, and McKesson Canada, continued to lead the way, with revenue growth in the first quarter up 16% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business exceeded our expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong growth from a few of our largest customers and brand pricing trends ahead of our expectations. However, generic pricing trends were well below the level of the prior year and below our expectations for the first quarter. We will continue to monitor pricing trends in the market and will provide updates as we communicate our quarterly results going forward. We continue to grow our business with our U.S. Pharmaceutical customers across the retail, institutional, and independent channels. I'd like to take a moment to highlight our vibrant community of independent pharmacy customers. Last month we hosted our annual conference for retail independent customers, which brought together thousands of community pharmacy owners and pharmacists from across the country, including our growing base of Health Mart pharmacy customers, now representing more than 4,000 stores across the U.S. Record attendance at this year's conference reinforced the growing need for independent pharmacists to understand the dynamics shaping their industry and to evolve their business to meet these new demands. This year's conference centered on our strategy to help customers attract more patients through greater access to preferred networks and highlighted McKesson's suite of services, which enable pharmacies to operate more efficiently and capture new sources of revenue. We've hosted this conference now for almost 40 years, and it continues to provide an exceptional platform for peer networking and continuing education while celebrating innovation, patient commitment, and business growth of our exceptional independent pharmacist partners. In summary, I'm proud of the value we deliver for our U.S. Pharmaceutical customers and the innovative services and solutions that set us apart. As some of you may have heard me say on occasion, it is our standard of operational excellence that earns us the privilege to serve our customers every day. And it's our team's focus on our customers' success that allows us to grow our relationships and create value far beyond the core of Distribution Solutions. Turning now to our McKesson Specialty Health, I'm extremely pleased with the results for the first quarter, which represent a strong start to the fiscal year. Once again, we delivered impressive growth in our specialty business, driven by the performance in the U.S. oncology network and our broader oncology offerings and continued excellent growth in other multi-specialty categories. I believe we are very well positioned to continue to grow and innovate in this dynamic market. And our Canadian business had nice growth in the quarter, with results that were in line with our expectations. At our Investor Day last month, we highlighted the great achievements of our Canadian business. I'm now pleased to tell you that our team continues to grow, not only our core distribution business, but also expanding into our specialty and retail banner presence in the market. The recent addition of the Remedy'sRx banner in Canada adds to the scale we have built to support independent pharmacy. I'm proud to say that roughly 40% of all independent pharmacies in Canada operate under one of our banners, and we leverage our innovative services, products and technology to drive better results for our business and our customers. Turning now to our results for international Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services, revenues for the first quarter were $5.8 billion, roughly flat year over year on a constant currency basis. And operating performance from Celesio was ahead of our expectations in the quarter. Earlier today, Celesio announced the acquisition of the pharmacy operations of Sainsbury's, a leading chain of supermarkets in the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the agreement, Celesio will acquire 277 in-store pharmacies and four hospital-based pharmacies, which will now be operated and branded as LloydsPharmacy. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2016 and will broaden the already strong footprint of LloydsPharmacy in the United Kingdom and add scale to the more than 12,000 owned or banner pharmacies across McKesson. In summary, we're off to a positive start to the year and I'm encouraged by the momentum in our international Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business. And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter, with revenues of $1.4 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year, including strong growth in our physician office business. Our McKesson surgical team continues to do an excellent job as we enter the home stretch of the integration activities driven by the PSS World Medical acquisition. We expect to complete our planned integration efforts by the end of fiscal 2016, on schedule and ahead of our original business case. And while our Medical-Surgical team is still in the midst of a tremendous amount of work, I'd like to recognize the outstanding progress they've made to-date and their success in driving better value for our customers. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of Distribution Solutions in the first quarter. We now expect Distribution Solutions revenue growth of high-single digits compared to the prior year. And we now expect that full-year adjusted operating margin in Distribution Solutions will be up in the mid-single digits compared to the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 4% for the first quarter to $736 million, driven primarily by anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the sale of our nurse triage business. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was 22.7%, which includes a $51 million pre-tax gain associated with the sale of the nurse triage business. Excluding this gain, adjusted operating margin would have been 15.8%. Our first quarter results benefited from the steady growth profile of our Financial and Clinical Data and Services businesses, which include RelayHealth and our physician revenue cycle business, along with positive results in our payer solutions business. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions, and I remain confident in our outlook for the full year, which includes an expectation for achieving adjusted operating margin in the high teens from the segment. Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments. We are updating our full-year outlook for fiscal 2016 to a range of $12.36 to $12.86 to reflect the gain on the sale of our nurse triage business. For the first quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $454 million. And our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance. Earlier today the Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.28 per share. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a solid start to fiscal 2016. As John discussed earlier, we are raising our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.36 to $12.86. This revised outlook is a result of the pre-tax gain of $51 million or $0.16 per diluted share from the sale of our nurse triage business, which is reflected in both our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the quarter. We do not expect that the elimination of the nurse triage business' operating results will have a material impact on our expectations for fiscal 2016 adjusted operating profit. Now let's move to our results for the quarter. My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS of $3.14, which excludes three items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2 and Schedule 3, consolidated revenues increased 9% for the quarter to $47.5 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 13%, led by strong growth in our Distribution Solutions segment. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 4% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit increased 9%, driven by the performance in both segments. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 5% for a quarter on a reported basis and up 1% on a constant currency basis. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, operating expenses are presented net of the $51 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our Nurse Triage business. Excluding this gain, total adjusted operating expenses were up 4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted other income was $15 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $89 million decreased 7% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis. Now moving to taxes, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31.1%. As usual, I would expect this tax rate to fluctuate somewhat from quarter to quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of 31.5%. Adjusted income for the quarter was $737 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.14, up 27% on a reported basis and up 30% on a constant currency basis. The year-over-year currency headwind equated to $0.06 per share. Wrapping up our consolidated results, our diluted weighted average shares were flat year over year at 235 million. While we continue to plan for upcoming significant debt maturities, today's announced acquisition and dividend increase are consistent with our portfolio approach to capital deployment, which for some years now has focused on a blend of internal investments, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends. Let's now review the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $46.8 billion were up 10% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency during the quarter. North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues of $39.5 billion increased 16% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, U.S. Specialty, and Canadian businesses. Our largest customers drove strong growth, with a corresponding impact on our mix business and margin profile. In addition, this quarter's revenue also benefited from the timing of certain branded drug price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally anticipated. For the full year, we now expect North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues to increase by a low double-digit percentage versus the prior year. International Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues were $5.8 billion for the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues were flat relative to the prior year and in line with our expectations. Overall revenue growth, driven by our businesses in the United Kingdom, was mainly offset by an anticipated revenue decline from last year's loss of a Norwegian hospital contract. As a reminder, the results from Celesio's operations in Brazil are reported as part of discontinued operations on Schedule 1 of the tables accompanying our press release. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 4% for the quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 4% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. The increase in Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit was driven by the strong revenue growth in our North American Distribution business, the timing of certain brand drug price increases that occurred earlier in the fiscal year than we expected, a benefit from antitrust settlement proceeds that was contemplated in our guidance, and a better than expected performance from Celesio. Offsetting this growth were weaker than expected generic drug pricing trends in the quarter. The level, nature, and timing of generic pricing trends remain difficult to predict. We will continue to monitor market activity and will provide updates to you as we communicate our results each quarter. Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 3% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, segment operating expense increased 4% year over year. Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion increased 14% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 242 basis points, an improvement of eight basis points on a constant currency basis versus the prior year, driven by solid growth across the segment, including continued expansion of our generics business, favorable timing of certain branded drug price increases, the anticipated antitrust settlements, and better than expected results from Celesio. This year-over-year segment adjusted operating margin expansion was partially offset by weaker generic pricing trends and our business mix. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect full-year revenue growth from our North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business to increase by a low double-digit percentage versus the prior year, driven in part by higher than expected demand from our largest customers. Based on this growth and the resulting mix of revenue in our North American Distribution business, we now expect segment adjusted operating margin to increase by mid-single-digit basis points year over year. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 4% for the quarter to $736 million. This decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the hospital software platform and the sale of our Nurse Triage business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. As I discussed earlier, our consolidated first quarter gap in adjusted results reflect a pre-tax gain of $51 million from the sale of our Nurse Triage business. This gain was recorded as a reduction to Technology Solutions operating expenses for the first quarter. Adjusted operating expense in the segment decreased 27% and segment adjusted operating profit increased 109%, primarily as a result of this gain. Excluding this gain, segment adjusted margin increased 534 basis points year over year. For the full year, excluding the gain recorded on the sale of our Nurse Triage business, we continue to expect to achieve an adjusted operating margin in the high teens. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics, as you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding were relatively flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased by one day to 30 days. Our days sales in payables increased by three days to 53 days. We generated $454 million in cash flow from operations for the quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.6 billion, with $1.9 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $120 million for the quarter. Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier we are raising our fiscal 2016 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from our original range of $12.20 to $12.70 to a new range of $12.36 to $12.86 to reflect the gain on the sale of our Nurse Triage business. This outlook assumes a full-year average exchange rate of $1.10 per euro, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. In addition, we now expect $1.24 per share in amortization of acquisition-related tangible assets and $0.30 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude between $0.86 and $0.96 per share in LIFO-related adjustments, short of our adjusted earnings. While we cannot predict the timing of pharmaceutical pricing activity, our current expectation is that the split of earnings between the first and second half of fiscal 2016 will be in line with our experience in fiscal 2015. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Solari? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions here. First of all, obviously, generic inflation is a big focus area for investors, so thank you for your comments on that. But can you just help us understand, how should we think about generic inflation trending within the context of your guidance range? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Certainly, as we've mentioned, we did see generic price increase activity below the levels of the last fiscal year and below our original expectations. Now, that said, obviously our guide that we issued a few months back has a variety of variables that are key to it, and we list those out for you. So the width of the range allows us some flexibility to take into account variables of one driver that's up versus another driver down. So we're comfortable with the range that we've articulated this afternoon. That reflects the addition of the care management nurse triage gain. And of course we'll keep everyone updated as we proceed through the fiscal year. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just as a follow up, very strong top-line growth for distribution solutions, up 15% despite some impressive year-over-year comps you're anniversarying. So when you think about the environment and branded inflation that you've seen in the quarter, do you expect similar trends for the remainder of the year? It seems just the growth is stronger than what you guys implied in the Analysts Day. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think we've had good success in growing our business across the board. And I think the interesting part of the base of business that we have in our mix is that we have some customers that are growing we think more rapidly than the market. And that growth is clearly seen in our business. That comes with it better revenue growth, but it does put a little pressure on our mix as a result of the scale of those customers. We're certainly pleased with the performance in the quarter and we expect that revenue momentum to continue throughout the fiscal year. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And one of the other drivers of the revenue strength in Q1 was the acceleration of some of the branded price increases that occurred in the first quarter that we were originally expecting to occur later in the year. Next question? Operator : We'll move next to Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. I think we all understand the comments about generic inflation being difficult to predict. There's definitely no question about that. But I guess I'm just curious, with your privilege of daily conversations with generic suppliers, with some 20/20 hindsight now, do you have any thoughts or any opinions on what you think may have just led to that temporary slowdown of generic inflation in the June quarter? Or do you just attribute that to randomness and obviously some tough comps year over year that we saw for the June quarter in particular? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks for the question, Steve. I think the comps are clearly one of the challenges when we think about the strength of the price increases in the prior year. I think that although we have close working relationships with the generic manufacturers, they don't always share with us their plans related to price increases. Clearly their view of product launches, their merger and acquisition activity, there are lots of things moving around in the market that may also be distracting them from some the things that they may be doing on a short-term basis or could have done on a short-term basis. I think our view is that we believe that generic pricing power will remain a part of the strategy generic companies will employ. And that balanced with the scheduled generic launches, et cetera, are part of the things that drive their P&Ls. I would say following on to what James said earlier, there are lots of variables in the way our quarters flow. And one of the positive things in the quarter was the fact that our brand price inflation work was a little stronger than we'd seen on a compare basis. So there are always puts and takes as you move along. And I think the most important thing is that we continue to find ways to move the business. And we're obviously also very pleased with the performance of our Specialty business and Celesio had a very good quarter. So both Specialty and Celesio performed above what we would have expected, even though our generic price part of our business may have been a little bit behind. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, all right. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : We'll take next Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. So on the topic of growth at large customers, do you think that growth is coming at the expense of smaller customers? Or is it that the larger customers are getting a greater share of where we do see outsized market growth? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Clearly I think the Specialty business is more inclined to go through the larger customer, particularly in the PBM channel. We obviously have seen some market shifts in PBMs as well. And I would imagine on the edge, our larger customers are taking some incremental share in the market. But I would say that at least the base of independents that McKesson is involved and closely working with, we've seen good strength in that business, both in the growth of Health Mart stores but also in terms of their revenue growth. So I think the most important thing for us to do is to continue to focus on bringing our scale and our capabilities to the smaller customers to help them continue to level the playing field relative to the larger customers. And on the larger customer side, we have to find ways to add more value so that our margin impact isn't as negative as it can be when the mix changes. Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Even absent the growth at the top line, operating expense seemed to come in quite a bit below where we expected on the Distribution side where you didn't have the impact. Could you speak to some of the activity and how it felt relative to your own expectation? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We are very focused on, as you know, Eric, in being efficient and productive in our operations. I think we have over 3,000 \u2013 closer to 6,000 black belts if you include Celesio around the world. And those folks are designed to help us drive efficiency in our operations. I also think it's important for to us maintain discipline around pricing. Albeit the mix thing is hard for to us control, our pricing decisions are within our control and we have to stay disciplined on that. James, there might be color you want to add on expenses. I think our interest expense was down a little bit. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The operating expense line, really the focus ongoing right across the company, as John is referring to there, including Technology Solutions, and part of the business we've really been able to build our margins quite nicely. So directionally in line with what we were expecting, but we're certainly very pleased by the ongoing progress around our cost structure and our productivity. Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next we have Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. John, when you called out North America and some of the things you talked about, you did talk a little bit about Specialty in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe just give us a little more detail as far as what you saw for revenue growth there in the quarter, especially versus your expectations? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We expected our Specialty business to grow above market levels. And I think not only did it grow above market levels, it grew more than we had expected. And I think our strength in particular in our community-based oncology business was very strong. Clearly, U.S. oncology continues to perform well. Albeit off of a slightly smaller base, our multi-specialty business is growing very rapidly as we create value-differentiating capabilities in that market. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then just on the follow-up side for the small acquisition that was made for Sainsbury, can you give us any indication as to what the earnings or financial impact will potentially be from that acquisition? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's obviously a very important strategic move for us. It significantly expands the presence of Lloyd's Pharmacies in the UK, and it's an endorsement of the strength of the Lloyd's brand and operating model. I think that's an important aspect to what this win signifies to our team and to the markets. James, you might want to comment on the timing and margin impact. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Just based on our expected normal regulatory review process, we're expecting the transaction to close toward the end of February of this coming year, so I wouldn't expect it to have any material impact on fiscal 2016. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next we have Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks and good evening. James, I just want to follow up on the gross margins a little bit. This was probably \u2013 the gross margins are probably a little bit lower than what we had thought and maybe the lowest gross margin we've seen in five or six quarters, and I'm curious. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of what impacted that gross margin? I don't know if that was tied into the generic inflation comments or if there's something related to the purchasing synergies from Celesio having kicked in or Rite Aid or Omnicare. Can you give us a little bit better sense of what's go on there? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Really I would point you to two comments that we made during our prepared remarks. First of all, very strong growth from our largest customers and therefore an impact on the mix and the margin, the gross profit margin profile. So that's number one; and then secondarily, the lesser effect around generic price increases than we were originally expecting in our plan. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, maybe I can just follow up on that. John, for those who have been following the company for a while, you may recall we always used to talk about branded price inflation every quarter. And we went through a long period where we didn't talk about it, and now it feels like we're talking about it every quarter again. Has anything changed with respect to your relationship with the manufacturers and the IMAs [Inventory Management Agreements] that you've historically had in place? And how do we think about branded price inflation as a driver maybe relative to the size of like, for example, what generic price inflation has done for the company? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks for the question. What's great about the business model that McKesson has been employing for a long time is that it has a lot of levers that we can use to help drive our performance over time. And as you point out, if you go way back to the early stages of my presence as the CEO, brand price inflation was the key driver that helped us drive our company. And over time, that became less important as a factor, but it always remained a factor. And so I think our comments today are more directional in nature related to our expectations brand price inflation came in higher than we anticipated. And as you point out, as we moved our model, we eliminated part of the variability or impact that branded price inflation has on our business model. And also as you recall, at one point in our evolution, generic price deflation was something we had to manage quarter to quarter, and now we've been in a period where we've actually experienced some inflation. So our comments there, once again, are directional in nature that it came below where we had anticipated. But we believe both brand and generic price inflation will remain important tools for us as we look out this fiscal year and beyond. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Just perhaps to add one thing, recall that around a fifth of our relationships with the branded manufacturers are variable in nature, so the other 80% are a fixed fee-for-service type of structure. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll move now to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the questions. Sorry to go back to this again, but it does seem like the biggest change relative to the update we got from you guys at your Analyst Day. You're pointing out a mid-single-digit margin expansion in the Distribution Solutions business. And I'm just curious if there's any more detail you can give around how much of that lower margin expectation is just from revenue mix versus the less generic inflation that you guys have called out. And I guess the bigger picture question, John, would just be given where Specialty is growing and the growth there, is margin expansion as we think about this business going forward, is it something that we should think about in a more tempered manner? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the point on margin is a good one. We clearly didn't anticipate our revenues to be growing as rapidly as they have. And that has, as James mentioned, had a depressing effect on op margin. But if you actually look at operating profit growth, it's still very strong. And our objective is to satisfy the needs of our customers. And as you know, we have long-term contracts with many of them. So as they grow, the bigger ones will put some pressure on the mix. But the most important dimension here is I think our focus on making sure that we are driving efficiency in our operations as revenue grows, and that was pointed out earlier from an expense perspective. And we're disciplined in the way we approach the market. The comment about Specialty is an important one. That's a very high-growth area. Each company I think in the country probably defines specialty slightly differently, so it's difficult to talk to any one of us and get a perspective that's really industry-wide. From our point of view, there are some very profitable, positive mix products in the Specialty category, but there are also some products in the Specialty category that are really expensive and carry a margin rate that's low but produce tremendous returns and profit drop in the P&L. Albeit it may be dilutive to our margin expectations, they're certainly producing great returns. And I think that we have a responsibility to try to manage the company with both a perspective on margin rate as well as dollar growth and clearly at the bottom line the returns on our business. So we look at it in a portfolio way. If there's one message you can take away from me on the Specialty business, it has been a priority for us now for many years. We came from a very weak position to now we are in a very strong position, and I'm very pleased with where we are in that market. And as we define it, I think in most of them we're either number one or number two and growing very rapidly. So we are well positioned as we think out and look at the new product launches. Those launches, given the characteristics of some of them, could put some pressure on our margin rates. But clearly, we think that they'll be value-creating, and we're in the right position to take advantage of the relationships we have with our customers in the markets that we serve. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful, and just a quick follow-up on the Celesio deal announced earlier today. Any sense you can give us on how we should think about the transaction as far as adding to your ultimate synergy target? And then the types of deals, is the type of deals we should expect to be building upon the Celesio acquisition? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Clearly, we are excited to have the business from a fundamental perspective beginning to stabilize and become more of a McKesson type of operation. We've always had a great view, a positive view of the resources and the people inside of Celesio. But as we talked about when we did the acquisition, there was some infrastructure and systems things we had to do and some strategy changes we had to make that would help us begin to get to a growth phase. I think we're entering the early stage of that growth phase. The deployment of capital we talked about as a possibility. You're beginning to see evidence of that. This type of acquisition fits right in with what we want to do. It's in a market that's extremely friendly to the utilization of generics and the incentives for both wholesalers and retailers to help their patients take generics. And so when we have an opportunity to expand our channel of generics in an important market like the UK, it drives synergy across the entire corporation through our global procurement operations that we talked about. So I think not only is it helpful to Celesio as a standalone opportunity and to LloydsPharmacy in particular, it's also helpful to McKesson overall as it builds on this 12,000 storefront base of business that we have out of the some odd 60,000 or 70,000 stores that we service, in the case of the 12,000 that are owned or banners of ours that buy off our portfolios. So it's important to recognize that pull-through buy power and the part of our strategy that this helps serve. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you so much. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : Next we'll go to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : Good afternoon, guys. So maybe on the Tech Solutions business. Obviously the reformation of that asset continues. It seems like the margin outlook for the year is good. If my math is right, is this going to be a year where we actually see EBIT growth and, not only that, but maybe get back to some of the higher levels of EBIT we saw historically? And secondarily, when do you actually think we can see some of the transactional businesses come through to where we could actually see the division grow again? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I appreciate the question, Ross. We have been, as you know, working diligently for the last several years to reposition the business in the areas where we think we are strong or market leading and where the markets are actually growing and are favorable to McKesson. We have extremely strong franchises inside of our Technology Solutions business. And we have been struggling with our hospital IT business, where we have been reinvesting in the go-forward products and deinvesting in the products that we've already announced that we plan to sunset. And so it's difficult as an investor to see the positive momentum in the business through some the drag that's present as a result of, as you described, the reformation of the business as we position it for growth going forward. And I think we are optimistic that we continue to make the right decisions to get the momentum back in the business. As to margins, I'll turn it over to James to talk a little bit about what you should think about there. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : As we track towards that high-teens goal for fiscal 2016, I would say that right now we're looking at an increase in operating profit year over year, and that's excluding the $51 million benefit from the gain around the nurse triage business. So we're on track for some operating profit growth this year. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : And maybe, James, there's been some momentum in DC on a tax holiday or the ability to repatriate some cash. I think you guys have roughly $2 billion or so offshore. How would that change your more medium-term capital allocation priorities? I know you have some of the debt maturities and you have the Celesio put. One, is that something you've been thinking about? And, two, would that free you up maybe to do a little more repurchase if it happened? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We feel as though we have a very nice mix in terms of our cash balance between what's domestically and what's held offshore. And we have spoken a few times about \u2013 obviously, yes, we have the upcoming debt maturities to take care of. Those are U.S. dollar denominated. But beyond that, our priorities for capital allocation are, first of all, internal investment and, second, looking at value creating M&A opportunities. And given the international breadth of our business now, we feel as though we have a nice balance in terms of the flexibility of the offshore cash that we have available for deployment as well as the domestic cash available for deployment. So we'll see how the tax discussions in Washington DC play out, but we already like the balance of cash that we have available to us, so we feel as though we have the degrees of freedom that we need. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : Thanks so much. Operator : We'll take Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple follow-up questions at this point. First, sorry to harp on this again, but regarding moderating generic inflation, could you characterize that a bit more? Was it across the board, in certain therapeutic classes, vendor, anything? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would just observe that we saw fewer manufacturers taking increases on fewer drugs. So both of those variables we saw less activity than we had certainly seen last year during our first quarter and less than what we were assuming we would see when we put our plans together. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And you mentioned Celesio performed better than expected. Maybe I missed it, but could you comment on what area of Celesio specifically exceeded your expectation thus far? Was it on the synergy front, top line? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'd say the revenue was really right on track on a constant currency basis with what we were expecting during the first year. We continued to see strong performance out of the United Kingdom businesses. And we're seeing some modest improvements in the German environment, where obviously we've had something of a history of market discounting. We're seeing a little improvement in that discounting environment in Germany. Offsetting that, the French market is still looking like a challenging one. But net-net, we're pleased with the progress that we made at Celesio in Q1, and we feel as though we have more opportunities for the balance of the year. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right, great. Thanks. Operator : We'll take David Larsen with Leerink. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Can you comment on the Teva and Allergan transaction? Is that material or not with respect to generic inflation? Our objection is that as the generic industry consolidates, sometimes manufacturers raise price because they can. Just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We clearly have a very strong working relationship with both Teva and Allergan. And I think that we see, as do you, that the question of generic inflation is sometimes driven by the ability for the price to actually benefit the generic manufacturers or otherwise stick in the marketplace. And so to the extent that the consolidation provides some of that opportunity, that would be a positive. I think that the market remains competitive, and I think these consolidations will help eliminate costs. But I also think that McKesson's position in the market will continue to afford us an opportunity to work with these very large companies in a very positive way for both parties. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. And just any general thoughts around PCSK9 and how material that might be going forward? Maybe you can characterize the (47:07) benefit. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's difficult to tell. It's a little too early for to us comment on the characteristics of that product, albeit it is a positive, and the continued innovation that comes out in these categories of products will be extremely important to us going forward. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, our footprint in Specialty continues to grow. And I think that as people launch with some of these more unique products, it will help the patients, but it also will help McKesson. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Great, thanks a lot. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Operator : We'll take George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. John, first a quick one, are there any situations where generic drug prices inflate where you guys don't benefit? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : George, I think drug price inflation and the benefit is in the eye of the beholder. I think all of us in the supply chain have different characteristics with manufacturers and with customers that are highly variable, including the relationships of both in terms of the way the business models work, but also the way the contractual relationships might work. So I think it's probably better said that we try to optimize our value to the generic companies in a way where we benefit and may benefit. But at the same time, we have to stay extremely disciplined and diligent around making sure that our customers are also benefiting through our action in the supply chain. And that's been our priority and will remain our priority. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful, and maybe a quick follow-up on the Sainsbury transaction. It's interesting that this the second deal like this that's occurred in a little over a month. And as you see global payer consolidation, do you foresee global pharmacy consolidation? And how do you guys feel like you're positioned if global retail pharmacy consolidation steps up? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's a good question. Obviously, we've seen tremendous consolidation across healthcare in the last 90 days alone. There has been all kinds of activity. I think the way we think about consolidation is clearly we want to be positioned with winners, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we have to be always positioned with only scaled players. In fact, we think our Health Mart customers, for example, are winners and are able to consolidate in their own space with other independent pharmacies because of the scale we bring to them and the value we can deliver. In fact, that's why I continue to focus on the footprint of owned and banner pharmacies, provide us the ability to help our customers would are perhaps not all owned by the same enterprise, continue to benefit through their relationship at McKesson and may be able to stay as independent operators. Even though they may appear on the surface to be subscale in terms of store count, they may improve their efficiencies through their partnership with us and clearly improve their margin structure through some of the value-added services that we help them deliver into the marketplace on behalf of payers and consumers. So our focus is to help our customers be more successful across the board. And to the extent that people consolidate and we consolidate into our customers, we win or at least break even from a revenue perspective. And our objective is to continue to be more and more efficient with these larger customers so that we can earn the privilege of continuing to serve them. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Operator : We'll move next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good evening. John, let me take that answer and go a little bit further with it. To the extent that we are seeing consolidation among many players in the supply chain, including payers and obviously some on the retail side, do you foresee the need strategically or otherwise to potentially further consolidate and own additional assets within the supply chain, or are there inherent conflicts in that which will keep you from doing that? How do you best position the company to be most advantageously positioned going forward? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's a very good question. In fact, all of these questions are good questions. I think the industry is changing significantly. And I think it's incumbent upon us as it relates to our customers and our shareholders to remain open to any strategy that we think is sustainable and can create value. Having said that, it's always been our position that we don't compete with our customers. And so the challenge in some the conceived combinations would either have us competing with people that are on the partner/supply side of our business or perhaps on the partner/customer side of our business, and that makes it difficult to conceive of some of those types of combinations. So I think that we remain open to everything. We'll be very cautious before we ever cross the line of competing with our customers. David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Operator : That does conclude our question and answer session. At this time, I'll turn it over to the speakers for any closing or additional remark. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great, thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you on the call today for your time. McKesson is off to a good start for fiscal 2016, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to driving better business health for our customers every day. I'll now hand the call over to Erin for her review of upcoming events in the financial community. Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, John. On September 16 we will present at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare conference in New York. And on November 10 we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. We'll release second quarter earnings results in late October. Thank you and goodbye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call, everyone. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice-President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Audra. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 9 :30 a.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results the amortization of acquisition related and intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO related adjustments. We also refer to certain non-GAAP measures calculated on a constant currency basis. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing our second quarter fiscal 2016 results available on our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Additional information on constant currency effects is available in our SEC reports. Thanks, and here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Erin, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Before I recap our quarter, I want to take a few moments to discuss the issue that must be on everyone' s mind : the announcement of Walgreen's acquisition of Rite Aid. We have a very strong relationship with Rite Aid. For many years we've provided distribution services for their brand pharmaceutical volume. When we expanded the relationship last year, Rite Aid was attracted to closer ties to McKesson because of our generic purchasing scale and our sourcing expertise, our leading industry distribution capabilities, including our ability to provide better levels of service to Rite Aid stores and the significant working capital and cash flow benefits available through this closer relationship. Since that time, McKesson has added significant additional scale to our Generics program. Customers want a deeper relationship with McKesson, not only because of the competitiveness of our offering but also because we've built a broad array of customer-centric programs that deliver real value well beyond core distribution. In addition to our relationship with Rite Aid we've also had a strong business relationship with the management team at Walgreens Boots Alliance. We have great respect for what they've accomplished. There's no doubt our industry is going through a period of dynamic change. I've been CEO of this company for 15 years and in healthcare my entire career. I've seen this industry go through transformative change on a number of occasions. I believe one of the fundamental strengths of McKesson has been our ability to constantly adapt and lead during times of change by staying focused on our customers and our true core values. McKesson leaders are the best in the business and we've demonstrated our ability to innovate and to drive consistent and steady growth over many, many years. And I believe we remain exceptionally well positioned across all of our businesses as we look to the future. Now turning to our financial results, for the second quarter we achieved total company revenues of $48.8 billion, up 14%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.31, up 20%, both on a constant currency basis. In a moment I'll provide highlights of what was another solid quarter of operating performance across our businesses. But before I do, I will mention a few items that are important to understand with respect to our second quarter results. During the second quarter, we completed the sale of ZEE Medical, a business that was within our McKesson Medical-Surgical business and recorded a gain of $0.14 per diluted share. And we recorded a $25 million favorable tax item in the second quarter as a result of a recent U.S. Tax Court ruling. This drove a benefit of approximately $0.11 per diluted share in the quarter. Excluding these two items, our second quarter results were better than our expectations, primarily driven by the timing of brand price inflation, which occurred earlier in the year than we had anticipated. As well as some favorable timing in our Technology Solutions segment. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance of our business in the second quarter. Coming back to the broader industry environment, pharmaceutical pricing trends have become the frequent subject of news headlines as we get deeper into this presidential election cycle. The observation I would make is that this pharmaceutical pricing discussions tend to ebb and flow over time. However, what remains clear is that pharmaceuticals are still the most effective and affordable way to treat patients. And innovation and drug development and the trend toward higher levels of generic penetration continue to deliver real value and cost savings through the healthcare industry. The desire to tie payments to value and expand medication adherence in a world of fee for value is tremendous. And the issues of quality, access, and cost remain at the center of improving healthcare delivery. And McKesson is extremely well positioned to help our customers not only compete but thrive as they look to the future. Turning now to our business results for the quarter, Distribution Solutions revenues were $48 billion, up 14%, and adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 11%, both on a constant currency basis. Our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, all turned in impressive results with a combined revenue growth of 17% in constant currency. Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business was ahead of our expectations in the second quarter driven by continued strong growth, primarily from our largest customers, and the timing of certain brand price increases which occurred earlier in the fiscal year than we had previously anticipated. During the second quarter, we were excited to announce our expanded relationship with Albertsons. As you know, we signed a new five-year agreement that includes the sourcing and distribution of both brand and generic pharmaceuticals to Albertsons' network of nearly 1,700 pharmacies in the U.S. I'm also pleased to report that we've signed an agreement with CVS Health to retain Omnicare's long-term care and Specialty distribution business. We are proud of the exceptional value and service we provide to both CVS Health and Omnicare, and the great relationship we have enjoyed with both companies over many, many years. We are privileged to continue to serve them going forward. And I would note that Health Mart is now more than 4,200 members strong, an increase of over 300 stores in the first six months of this fiscal year. This is a tremendous result. And I'm confident in the strength and scale of our value proposition for our customers and our manufacturing partners. And I believe that we remain extremely well positioned. Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health. We continue to deliver excellent revenue growth in our Specialty business driven by the strong performance across our community Oncology business, the strength in our multi-specialty categories, and the strength of our U.S. Oncology network practices. In the second quarter we saw the first biosimilar launch in the U.S., the biosimilar for Neupogen. We anticipated an increasing number of biosimilar launches in the years to come and we are confident that we are very well positioned given our multi-channel presence, particularly our strength in the community clinic setting and our comprehensive service offering to be a partner of choice for our customers and manufacturers. And our Canadian business got another quarter of solid revenue growth driven by great performance in our core distribution business, and the expansion of our independent pharmacy banner business along with outstanding growth in our Canadian Specialty business compared to the prior year. Turning now to our results in International Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services. Revenues for the second quarter were $5.9 billion, up 2% year-over-year in constant currency. And Celesio's operating performance was slightly ahead of our expectations for the first half of fiscal 2016. We're excited about the acquisition of pharmacy operations of Sainsbury's which will add 281 pharmacies to our leading Lloyds pharmacy brand in the United Kingdom. And we also announced the acquisition of the pharmaceutical distribution business of the United Drug Group, which provides us a strong platform for growth in the Irish market. These acquisitions complement the excellent position of Celesio businesses in the European market and further enhance McKesson's and Celesio's global value proposition to our customers and manufacturing partners. We remain encouraged by the steady improvement we are seeing in the operating results of Celesio as we continue to make important investments in modernizing the IT infrastructure of the business, which will provide a foundation for further operating improvements going forward. And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenue of $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year. I am really pleased with the growth we are driving across Medical-Surgical with a special focus on our Primary Care business which includes physician offices, clinics, surgery centers, and health systems. And although primary care was, as anticipated, the most complex part of the integration work, we've made tremendous progress with the PSS integration through the retention of our world class sales force, the alignment of our technology, and the optimization of our distribution network, all without missing a beat in serving our customers. We also have done a terrific job of creating value with our McKesson brand products. I spend a fair amount of time speaking about global sourcing as it relates to our pharmaceutical business, but it's also important to highlight the global sourcing strength of McKesson in our Medical-Surgical business where we've built exceptional expertise and capabilities over the last decade. It's clear to me that we are emerging from the effort of the PSS integration not only as a more scaled business but also as a partner that can deliver best in class customer service and selection in this industry. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the second quarter. We now expect Distribution Solutions' revenue to grow at mid-single digits compared to the prior year, which includes the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of the third quarter. And we now expect that the full-year adjusted operating margin in Distribution Solutions will be up low-double digits compared to the prior year, reflecting the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical and the expiration of the Optum contract. This is partially offset by generic pharmaceutical pricing trends that we expect will remain weak in the second half of our fiscal year and similar to the level we experienced in our second quarter. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 6% for the second quarter to $721 million, driven primarily by the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter and an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was approximately 22%, which was driven by strong performance in our payer solutions and relay connectivity business and favorable timing in our Medical Imaging business. We expect to achieve a full-year adjusted operating margin for the segment at the upper end of the high teens, which includes the gain we recorded in the first quarter from the sale of our nurse triage business. Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal second quarter results represent solid execution across both segments. We are updating our full-year guidance and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.50 to $13 for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.14 compared to the guidance we provided in July. Our full-year guidance includes the positive impact of three items : a net gain of $0.11 for the full year in the sale of ZEE Medical; a revised full-year tax rate of 31% compared to our previous assumption of 31.5%, primarily driven by the favorable discrete item recognized in the second quarter; and the full-year impact of a $500 million share repurchase completed late in the second quarter. Now these positive items are partially offset by the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of the third quarter, our view that generic pharmaceutical pricing trends will remain weak in the second half of the fiscal year but at similar levels to what we experienced in our second quarter. And as you know, our prior guidance did not contemplate a change to our sourcing or distribution agreement with Omnicare. We are very pleased that we have since reached an agreement to retain the distribution portion of that relationship with Omnicare and CVS Health and are updating our guidance to reflect this revised agreement. For the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion, and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance. The Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and we are extremely well positioned to continue to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders from a mix of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter results and our performance in the first half of fiscal 2016. As John discussed earlier, we are raising our previous outlook for fiscal 2016 and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.50 to $13. This revised outlook is driven by the following five items. First, a pre-tax gain of $51 million or $0.14 per diluted share from the sale of the ZEE Medical business, which is reflected in both our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the second quarter. The benefit to our full-year adjusted earnings from this divestiture is $0.11, which is net of the $0.03 in adjusted operating profit that we no longer expect to earn from the ZEE business during fiscal 2016. Second, a discrete tax benefit of approximately $25 million related to a U.S. Tax Court ruling during the second quarter which allowed us to revisit a previous tax filing position. Third, the reduction in our expected weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2016 from repurchasing $500 million in common stock late in the second quarter. Our updated diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for the fiscal year is now 234 million. Fourth, our view that generic pharmaceutical pricing trends will remain weak in the second half of the fiscal year but at a similar level to what we experienced in the second quarter. And fifth, the impact of certain customer contracting decisions since our previous earnings call in late July, including the expiration of our contract with Optum and our new relationship with CVS Omnicare. Before reviewing our second quarter results, I would like to highlight an update to the schedule accompanying our earnings press release. We have expanded Schedule 3 to include supplemental constant currency information to outline both the dollar and percentage impact of currency movements on our reported results. This supplemental information provides a framework to assess how our business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations. I hope you all find this to be a valuable addition to our ongoing disclosures given the now global nature of our business. During the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2016, our reported adjusted earnings per diluted share included currency headwinds of approximately $0.03 and $0.08 respectively year-over-year. Therefore, during my prepared remarks, I will reference both the reported and constant currency figures which are provided in Schedule 3. Now let's move to our results for the second quarter. My remarks today will focus on our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.31, which excludes three items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2 and 3, consolidated revenues increased 10% for the quarter to $48.8 billion. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.4 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis, revenues were $50.2 billion, an increase of 14%, led by strong growth in our Distribution Solutions segment. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter decreased by 1% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit increased 4%, driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 7% for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical, which was recorded in the Distribution Solutions operating expense line, total company operating expenses were up 1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted other income was $17 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $91 million decreased 4% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. Now moving to taxes, during the second quarter the previously discussed discrete tax benefit of $25 million drove a reduction in our adjusted tax rate to 29.1%. For the full year, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 31%. As a reminder, our full-year adjusted tax rate reflects our expected mix of domestic and foreign income and anticipated discrete tax items. Adjusted income for the quarter was $776 million with our adjusted earnings per diluted share at $3.31, up 19% on a reported basis and up 20% in constant currency. As I mentioned earlier, the year-over-year currency headwind to Q2 adjusted earnings equated to approximately $0.03 per share. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares were flat year-over-year at 235 million. As mentioned earlier in the second quarter, we executed a share repurchase of common stock totaling $500 million which exhausted the previously granted board authorization. As a result, we now expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be $234 million (sic) [234 million] for the fiscal year. And our board has recently approved a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion. While we continue to plan for and repay significant debt maturities in fiscal 2016, our recently announced acquisitions, increased dividend, executed share repurchase, and new share repurchase authorization are consistent with our portfolio approach to capital deployment which we have implemented for several years. Now let's turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $48 billion were up 11% on a reported basis. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.4 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. Constant currency revenues were $49.4 billion for the second quarter, reflecting growth of 14%. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $40.6 billion in the second quarter, up 16% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis primarily reflecting market growth in our U.S. pharmaceutical, U.S. Specialty, and Canadian businesses. Demand, primarily from our largest customers, which includes a growing mix of Specialty pharmaceuticals, drove strong revenue growth but also a corresponding impact on our margin profile during the quarter. In addition, this quarter's revenue also benefited from the timing of certain branded drug price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally anticipated. For the full year, we continue to expect North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues to increase by a low double digit percentage. However, it is important to note that this revenue forecast now includes expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of our third fiscal quarter. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $5.9 billion for the second quarter. International revenues were impacted by approximately $1 billion in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year. Adjusting for this currency impact, revenues were approximately $6.8 billion in the second quarter, up 2% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by market growth. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 3% for the quarter, primarily driven by market growth offset by the sale of ZEE Medical. For the full year, we now expect medical surgical revenues to increase by a low to mid-single digit percentage versus the prior year as a result of the sale of the ZEE Medical business. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit of $2.6 billion decreased 1% on a reported basis and increased 4% on a constant currency basis to $2.7 billion. Adjusted gross profit was impacted by growth in demand from our largest customers and weaker generic pricing trends compared to the prior year, offset by the timing benefit of certain brand price increases. Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 8% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, segment operating expense decreased 1% year-over-year. Excluding the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion increased 8% on a reported basis and 11% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 239 basis points, a decline of 5 basis points year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, the segment margin declined 7 basis points. Excluding the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical, the segment adjusted operating margin decreased 17 basis points on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. The decline in year-over-year segment adjusted operating margin was driven by our business mix and weaker than expected generic pricing trends relative to the prior year, offset by the favorable timing of certain branded drug price increases. As a reminder, for the full year, our expectations for branded drug price inflation remain unchanged, although we do expect some variability in the impact of branded pharmaceutical prices from quarter to quarter. Based on the net gain on the sale of ZEE Medical and the expiration of the Optum contract at the start of the third quarter, offset by our business mix and weaker pricing trends on generic pharmaceuticals, we now expect the Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating margin to expand by low double-digit basis points versus the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $721 million. This decline was primarily driven by the sale of our Nurse Triage business in the first quarter and anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. During the quarter, adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by our ongoing expense management efforts. Second quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 13% to $157 million. And the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 22% representing an increase of 373 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit increased 9%, representing an adjusted operating margin increase of 281 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by strong performance in our Payer Solutions and Relay Connectivity businesses, along with the benefit of favorable timing in our Medical Imaging business. For the full year, we expect the adjusted operating margin for the segment to be at the upper end of the high teens, which includes the gain we recorded in the first quarter from the sale of our Nurse Triage business. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding were flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventories increased by one day to 31 days. Our day sales in payables increased by five days to 53 days. We generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations for the quarter. And for the full year we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.4 billion, with $2.2 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $274 million for the quarter, and we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares totaling $500 million while repaying approximately $500 million in long-term debt. Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2016 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from our previous range of $12.36 to $12.86 to a new range of $12.50 to $13, an increase of $0.14. As John mentioned in his remarks, our full-year guidance includes the positive impact of three items : A net gain of $0.11 for the full year on the sale of our ZEE Medical business; a revised full year tax rate of 31% compared to our previous assumption of 31.5%, primarily driven by the favorable discrete item recognized in the second quarter; and the full-year impact of a $500 million share repurchase completed late in the second quarter. These positive items are partially offset by the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of the third quarter, our view that generic pharmaceutical pricing trends will remain weak in the second half of the fiscal year, but at a similar level to what we experienced in the second quarter. And as John just mentioned, our prior guidance did not contemplate the change to our sourcing or distribution agreement with Omnicare. We are very pleased that we have since reached an agreement to retain the distribution portion of that relationship with CVS Omnicare, and our updated guidance reflects our revised agreement. Our outlook assumes a full-year average exchange rate of $1.10 per euro which is unchanged from our prior guidance. In addition, we now expect $1.25 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.33 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect between $0.89 and $0.99 per share in LIFO related adjustments. In summary, McKesson delivered solid financial results during the first half of fiscal 2016, and we are confident in our outlook for the fiscal year. Thank you, and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Audra? Operator : Thank you. . We'll go first to Lisa Gill at JPMorgan. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Thank you, John for all the detail. I was wondering maybe if we could just start with Europe and Celesio. The last two acquisitions you've made have been in Europe. Can you maybe just give us an update on how you view the European market? What are some of the opportunities? And, you know, how has it played out over the last year and a half versus your expectations when you bought Celesio? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Lisa, for the question. Clearly we went into Europe with our eyes wide open on two fundamental things. One was that Celesio wasn't operating at the level we thought it could and should, and certainly under McKesson's ownership. And second was that the European market does have some risk related to the demand profile as well as the regulations and reimbursement structures that exist there. Having said all of that and knowing where we are headed, we're really pleased with the quality of the results thus far. We believe there's significant opportunities for us to grow both organically in that business by penetrating the areas of the market that have yet to be touched by wholesale distribution, and certainly not touched by us. Like Specialty or Oncology or Hospital distribution. And clearly we think there's a great opportunity for us to deploy capital effectively, efficiently, and appropriately in Europe to help build our value proposition in that market. And also, as you know, we brought with us a very large retail footprint which grows through the acquisition of Sainsbury's and it is growing also just organically in Europe as we complete our banner rollouts with our European pharmacy network, et cetera. So all said, I think we feel like we're in really good shape. We have a couple more years of building out our technology capabilities there. We're in the midst of installing SAP and we have some other work to do, but we do believe that we'll get into business position to not only invest in it the way we have started to, but also to get organic growth. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : John, does the company have a goal for how much of operating profit or revenue of the company will come from outside of North America, say over the next several years? And I know I'm not allowed three questions, but I just need a clarification on the comments out of Celesio that you cleared the transfer agreement. Does that mean that you're de-listing the stock? And then I'll stop there. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, certainly on the first part of that question, Lisa, we do have an expectation to grow in all of our businesses, and to grow at rates that are at or above market levels, particularly in markets where we are under-penetrated and there's significant opportunity for us. And that would be the case in Europe. We think there's significant growth prospects for us in most of the markets in which we compete. And as I mentioned, I think this idea of continuing to bring a banner Health Mart-like approach to Europe has been successful and is continuing to show great promise. So you'll see us roll out more Lloyds or Lloyds-like pharmacies throughout Europe. And James, perhaps you can talk a little bit about the... James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. In terms of the Celesio stock, when we gained operating control of Celesio, Celesio was trading on five German exchanges, and we have since then de-listed from three of the five. And on the remaining two, we're still a part of the regulated unofficial market. Those markets are Munich and Dusseldorf. I can't comment on any future plans around de-listing. There are a variety of German legal requirements for us to adhere to, but that's an update on our progress. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll move next to Steven Valiquette at UBS Financial. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : All right, thanks. Good morning, John and James. Congrats on the results. So I guess, John, in your prepared comments, you reinforced the notion that there's a lot of change going on in the U.S. pharmaceutical supply channel marketplace. And I guess in light of that, do you think we've reached an era now in the U.S. where large drug distributors could potentially own and operate fairly large retail drug chains in the U.S., similar to what McKesson and others are already doing in Europe? Is this something that you think you could consider now, just given all the U.S. alliances that have already been formed? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you, Steven, for the question. And obviously in Europe the construct of the industry is a little bit different in several of the markets where the wholesalers and retailers are part of the same organization. And in most of those cases, it's the same for all the industry participants, that they are both in the retail business as well as in the wholesaling business. We've looked at that phenomenon for a long time in Europe and wondered if it made sense in a U.S. context. I can tell you that we continue to believe that our customers appreciate the fact that we bring to them a focus on their success and that focus is not hampered by our own interest in a business similar to theirs or competing with them. And so I think that there's still, at least at McKesson, a focus on not competing with our customers in these segments and helping them be more successful each and every day. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Can I sneak in just a quick one on the Omnicare? Just for the generic, I'm guessing the sourcing will probably go through Red Oak, but are you saying that you'll still do just the physical distribution of the generics for Omnicare? Or is your distribution retention just on the brand side? Just want to clarify that piece. Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you might recall that when we started the relationship with Omnicare many years ago, they relied on us for their brand distribution and purchased their generics directly themselves and put it into their own warehousing infrastructure. With our more recent agreement that we worked through with them, you know, we took on the rest of that responsibility, which I think was extremely beneficial to Omnicare. The new structure of the ongoing relationship with CVS will take us back in the direction where our original agreement was with Omnicare, principally focused on the brand side. Now having said that, almost with all of our customers, there is some generic business that we do, principally when there's a shortfall from a centralized warehouse approach or a direct approach. But we'll go back to more of our old relationship. And we're really pleased to be able to do that and to continue to service these Omnicare sites. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, got it. Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser at Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi, good morning, and congratulations for the Omnicare contract. Two questions here. The first of all, is there an impact of the deals \u2013 you're going back to kind of like the old Omnicare generics, some uncertainty around other deals. Does losing kind of like generic business from these kind of like assets that now have been acquired has any impact on your generic purchasing power as it relates for the rest of your business? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Ricky, for the question. Clearly we have had a long run of building significant scale in generic sourcing. And what's interesting about the model that we've built is our customers are choosing to rely on our ability to continue to grow scale and to negotiate favorable agreements and then use us and our assets and our service delivery model to fulfill their needs. We continue to grow our presence quite significantly from a sourcing perspective. You heard me mention a little bit about it when I talked to our continued growth in Health Mart and our new arrangement with Albertsons. And we have over 20,000 pharmacies now that are principally buying all of their generics from McKesson. And so that bulk of business is quite significant and quite attractive to get access to our channel by the generic manufacturers. So, one could argue whether we're number one, number two, number three at any one point in time in any specific market in terms of our generic sourcing. But I believe we have significant scale and are retaining and growing that scale in a way that will be attractive and will bring manufacturers to us in a positive, collaborative way where we can get real value for our customers and for the manufacturers Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the follow-up is around the branded side. I mean, in the prepared remark obviously you talked about the fact that your assumptions regarding branding inflation are unchanged. There is some uncertainty in the marketplace around inflation, especially given the election debate that's shaping out. How should we think about McKesson's exposure to branded inflation overall and especially when we think about the March quarter, right, being usually a quarter with more inflation than the rest of the year? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, in our prepared comments we talked about the fact that we believe the first half of the year was slightly stronger from a branded inflation perspective. But for the full year, we expected it to be in line with our expectations. And that is still our point of view. Now, clearly there is more media attention and there is more discussion about price inflation in the market. But I happen to believe that the manufacturers that we work with at least will largely retain their current strategy. And there may be some outliers that begin to change their perspective slightly, but overall I think we expect the trends to continue. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the questions. John, I actually just wanted to go back to the comments around Europe and Celesio specifically. I know in the prepared remarks you said Celesio has been exceeding your operational expectations, but I'm curious if you could give us an update on the synergy progression there, maybe relative to some of the targets you guys had shared previously. And I guess specifically, just how the generic purchasing benefits are going and if they're flowing through the combined entity today. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think we've made very good progress. As you know, we established our global sourcing and procurement operations in London, and we have suggested to you in the past that the synergies of $2.75 to $3.25 would be more first half-loaded over a four-year period. So we are in that cycle now and I think we're making very good progress and are on track to accomplish our objectives. So once again, I think the manufacturing community has responded favorably to our global footprint and believe being a strong partner with McKesson will help them grow their business. And that's really the value proposition that we're putting forth and are delivering is that it's a win-win for people that are working closely with us in this collaborative way. So making good progress. And the comments I made earlier about Celesio was more on an operating perspective, that we're beginning to stabilize the operations of the business, put the systems in place and the culture in place along with building on the great management team that is already present. In fact, I was recently both in Italy and in the UK meeting with the management teams there, and there's some exciting things going on and I think the team is really energized about the opportunity of being part of McKesson in the first instance, but also the fact that investment is flowing both in terms of internal investment in warehouses and strategy and in IT systems and infrastructure but also in terms of bringing acquisitions to the table that make sense to grow our business and to grow our platform. So I think that the perspective is quite positive. Now, having said all of that, it's a while before this thing is going to grow the way you know we can grow it. It just takes us some time to put the foundation in place. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No. I appreciate all that. And then I guess just one more specific one, James. If I go back to the change in guidance, if I maybe exclude the ZEE Medical and the tax benefit, trying to just get my head around the $0.11 reduction. It looks like buybacks added maybe around $0.10. Could you maybe just walk through the other moving pieces, specifically around the contract decisions you mentioned and then the change in generic inflation assumptions? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, well, as we laid out a little bit during the prepared remarks, we have the ZEE gain for $0.11, the updates to our full year tax drives around $0.06, the share repurchase, the $500 million activity that we went into in Q2 drives around $0.09. So when you offset that against the loss of the Optum contract, and we've also talked about the fact that our guide now for the full year includes the new relationship with CVS Omnicare and our expectations for generic price increases, that really fills out the various drivers. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, I'm sorry. Just a clarification then. So did the generic assumption change, and that's part of the change in guidance? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, what's important to remember is when we were last talking to you and talking about the guide, we did not have any change for the back half of the year to how we had been thinking about generic pricing right at the start of the year. So what we're doing now is updating the back half of the year from a generic pricing perspective, and we're saying that you would see a similar level of weakness there in line to what we saw in Q2. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bob Willoughby of Bank of America. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Just a quick one. You'd mentioned in an earlier call that some of the assets in Brazil for Celesio were for sale. Is there an update on that? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you're right. We did mention that. And the business has been I think working with potential buyers to portray the high quality assets that we have there, and I think we're still in a process with several interested parties. So I'm hopeful that we'll get that concluded within this fiscal year, if not in the third quarter. So we're making progress and we'll keep you updated as that goes. But yes, that is exactly what we said and we plan to continue with that plan. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Is there any way to size that, John? Is it bigger than a bread box? Is there a gain or a loss associated with it? Do you expect to associate with it? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, all I'd say is remember that this is part of our discontinued operations now. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Right. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So it wouldn't impact \u2013 the end result won't impact our adjusted EPS. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I would say that it's on the small side as bread boxes go. I wouldn't fret about it too much. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Garen Sarafian at Citi Research. Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research : Good morning, John. Good morning, James. First on Omnicare, I appreciate the further clarification you made earlier in the Q&A, but I'm curious around the dynamics leading to this result. I would have thought that from a client perspective, all else equal, they'd want to keep both sides of the distribution with a single vendor. And from the distributor side, I thought that branded alone was fairly standardized low margin offering and pretty much a commodity. So I'm just wondering if there's anything unique that you were able to provide or any other unique dynamic that you can offer to help think through this. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's difficult for me to make blanket statements about what every customer chooses to do. I would say that our current relationship with CVS on the retail side of their business is principally the distribution of branded pharmaceuticals, and their strategy around generics is actually to ship those products directly from their own CVS warehouses and not to order them through distribution. So albeit I can't speak necessarily to what they ultimately will do with all of the Omnicare business, but usually the decision that large customers make is either to put all the generics and all of the brand into the single wholesaler that they've selected to partner with, at least for that store or that business line. Or to bifurcate the two of them and purchase the generics on a direct basis, put them into their own warehouse, manage their own logistics, and ship them to the stores. You might recall when we had the discussion related to Rite Aid last year when they made a decision to get out of the generic business. What they were doing was not moving Rite Aid's generic volume from another wholesaler to McKesson. They were actually moving their generic volume out of their own infrastructure and into McKesson's infrastructure. So I would say that my belief is that CVS is still a self-warehousing customer on generics, and I would imagine that at least there's a strong possibility that what they'll do is move the Omnicare model back to the model that's frequently used within the rest of CVS. So I don't believe there'll be two distributors at Omnicare. I think there'll be a McKesson relationship on brand and perhaps some generic fill-in, and the rest of it will come out of CVS on a centralized, coordinated basis like they do for the rest of their operation. Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research : Got it, okay. That's helpful. And then just moving to Tech Solutions. Your margins were clearly strong leading to the revision to the high end of guidance. But in the prepared remarks, out of the three reasons behind the strength, two of the three were arguably sustainable. So could you just elaborate on how you're thinking about the margin profile of this segment moving forward? I'm just trying to get an idea of why this wouldn't continue its trajectory, at least on the margin front. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, what we have said in the prepared remarks is that we would expect the full-year guide for Technology Solutions' operating margin to be at the upper end of the high teens. So recall that when we gave you original guidance at the start of the fiscal year, we were expecting to be around the low end of the high teens. Now, the primary delta there is the care management gain that we recorded in the first quarter. Now, peeling back from that, we continue to be pleased with the growth we're seeing in our payer provider businesses and the relay connectivity businesses. But of course the growth there is having to be offset by our decision to exit the Horizon Hospital software business. So that will have an impact on technology solutions. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But obviously to reinforce what you're saying, we're pleased with the margin trajectory of that business and we're pleased with the progress we've made in taking as much cost out as we can as we take that Horizon business down over the next couple of years. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Coldwell at Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks very much. John, I think I generally agree with your views on branded inflation and clearly brand inflation is not as important as it was more than a decade ago under the old industry structure. But I would love it if you could give us a little more detail on sort of the current state of contracts, maybe the percent of sales that are not under fee for service relationships. And then under fee for service, suspending disbelief, if branded price inflation did pare back, what would happen with the model? How would you adjust? What kind of impact might we see? And I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks for the question. Clearly as you mentioned, if you go back in history, there have been lots of different models that McKesson has used to create relationships with manufacturers that are beneficial to them and beneficial to ourselves and certainly onward to our customers. And over time we have created relationships with the manufacturers that have been less dependent on price inflation, providing more visibility to the manufacturers on our supply chain and working in partnership with them to give them the data and the things that they might find useful to them in their own production activities and their go-to-market strategies. And in return, they've gone and paid us for that work in these fee for service or distribution relationships contracts that they've have signed. That has frankly taken some of the top off the opportunity on price inflation and taken some of the bottom off on price inflation risk, so the band of performance is probably certainly a little more forecastable. And we've also talked in the past that roughly 80% plus or minus of our business are in structured arrangements that are fee for service type of dialogue or certainly more constructed and documented than the rest of the balance. So that also has helped reduce some of the volatility you might find in this particular lever of profitability inside of our P&L. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): With the \u2013 you talk about the 80%, and I think that is a pretty consistent message. Is the 20% \u2013 is a certain percentage of that your Specialty business, or are you talking core traditional brand at retail when you give the 80% figure? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's really sort of across the board. And I think another response I could give to you and your associates, when you think about inflation risk for McKesson, there are lots of levers we use in our business to drive our performance. And when we try to give you these high level themes, it's because they are important themes, and we talk about them at the annual guidance point. We give you our assumptions because they are drivers of our value. But clearly as you go through the year, there are a lot of things that aren't quite as you expected at the beginning of the year, and if they're part of these larger forces, we'll update you as the year goes on. And James spent some time talking about generic inflation and its relative position against our expectations when we started the year. But there are also lots of other drivers in our business that are going both positive and in negative throughout the year, and I can assure you that the company remains extremely focused on driving our performance as we have over the last 15 years, and we use these other vehicles to offset risk that might be apparent to us in our business as those risks materialize. So, do we have risk on inflation? Clearly we talked about generics today, and we talked about our views of brand inflation. But it's also our responsibility to not only tell you about these things but manage these risks on a proactive basis and be assertive and on top of it. And if there was some fundamental sea change in our industry relative to our views of where these metrics might go over time, then we would begin to reformat our relationship with our customers and our supplier partners and we'd find ways to continue to grow our business. And so I think that that level of confidence is what you should be getting from us today. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks very much John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : We'll go in next to George Hill at Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning guys, and thanks for taking the question. John, appreciate all the comments around kind of the Rite Aid announcement. I guess, but the company seems a little bit snake-bit by industry M&A lately. I guess either John or James, can you guys quantify the risk around the Rite Aid relationship? And John, I would ask as you think about industry consolidation strategically, do you feel like the company needs to be more aggressive than it has been historically and does it change the risk profile at all for how you think about acquisitions? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks for the question here. Clearly we've had a longstanding relationship with Rite Aid and we'll do everything we can to help them in this transition. And we have a great deal of respect for Mr. Pessina and his team at Walgreens and the kind of value they've delivered over a long time. And we've been working with Walgreens for 20 years, and I know Stefano for over 18 years, having traveled back and forth to Europe before he got to the scale that they are today. And so, these working relationships usually help us as we work through transitions in our industry, and we're really proud of the fact that our longstanding relationship with CVS both on the mail side as well as the store side at least came into play when we had the dialogue regarding Omnicare. So are we sometimes on the wrong end of these transactions? Absolutely. But as to the second part of your question, it doesn't mean we're going to deploy capital in a reckless way. We've got a long track record of building value through a portfolio approach and we'll continue to do that. We're not oblivious to the risk that exists as our market consolidates both on the supplier and the customer side. And clearly sometimes we're with the consolidators and sometimes we're not. And when we're not, we have to find a way to either create a relationship or build on an existing relationship or find another avenue to grow our business, which is our ultimate objective. And we have chosen thus far, and we believe this is the right path, to not compete with our customers. So I don't think we'll begin acquiring providers in an effort to offset the risk of provider consolidation in our book of business to deal with it. What we'll continue to do is focus on the value we can deliver for our partners. And as that value creation opportunity expands, then hopefully even through acquisitions, people will find that McKesson is the partner of choice, and they'll build their relationship with us as opposed to discontinuing it. But you can tell also from our guidance that sometimes when these relationships change, it has a negative effect on our margin structure, and that's really what we're reflecting when we talked about some of the puts and takes in the quarter. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'd just add that an example, a very recent example of where we're building with the consolidator is Albertsons Safeway. So it's a mix, a natural ebb and flow of the business cycle. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, and I guess maybe then just the quick follow-up would be does industry consolidation maybe from an M&A perspective think about how far just from the core that you look? And I guess how, when I think about McKesson's expertises, it's in procurement, it's in supply chain, it's in logistics, it's in distribution. Do you start to look into tangential spaces in healthcare or are there customer groups that you don't serve now where McKesson's expertise can be leveraged that you see opportunities? Thank you John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks for the question. Clearly our job is to find ways to grow our business and to do it intelligently and to do it in a risk-bounded way and to deploy capital intelligently. So I think our number one priority is to deploy capital in places where we have a base and an expertise and where it's not a completely new leg of the stool, but it's something that's additive to what we're currently doing. So, I think we evaluate everything and clearly every healthcare or almost healthcare distribution opportunity that comes on the market comes through McKesson and many of them we pass on because it's not straight up our alley or we believe that the price is too high. But otherwise, we're going to stay pretty focused. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, and I'd just add in terms of the breadth of our businesses, whether it's Canada, Europe, Specialty, Medical-Surgical, Technology Solutions, and there are a variety of businesses that we have where there will be opportunities that are down the middle of the fairway. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Exactly. We've just been told there are a few more questions pending so we're going to run this call just a little bit later for those of you that have time to do that. So we'll go on to the next question. Operator : And we'll move to Charles Rhyee at Cowen. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question here. John, James, John, I think in your remarks you talked about biosimilars with Neupogen being the first launch. Just curious what you've seen in terms of the uptake in that product and how that might be shaping your views on biosimilars in the future. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you for the question. Clearly biosimilars are going to be an important aspect of our business portfolio going forward and we will continue to, I think, see benefit of these biosimilar launches over the coming years. As to the specific launch that we've recently seen, it frankly has not gotten a ton of traction yet, at least not in our business, and it's behaving much more like a branded product than it is a typical quick-to-substitute generic. At some point these biosimilars probably will be more substitutable because their clinical effectiveness and efficacy will have been proven in some fashion. And that's where we'll have more opportunities to make faster transfers of the product. And we think we're very well positioned, particularly when the product are right down the alley of community oncology and we can use our U.S. oncology network to help validate the efficacy of the product and then move market share very quickly, either keep the market share with the originator or move it to the biosimilar to the extent that they're replaceable. So we will look for opportunities going forward. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: If I could just follow up there, though, right now then would you say the margin profile also looks more like a brand than a generic? And then in terms of substitutability, though, it seems like in the biosimilar pathway that it doesn't have the same type of A-B substitutability that traditional generics do. Do you think that regulations have to change to allow that for distributors to really benefit from that ability to move share? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it is behaving more like a brand, and not only in terms of the way it's being taken to market and its pricing structure, but also in the way that the physicians are viewing it. I think they want to have a discussion about the product itself as opposed to accepting an automatic substitution by a pharmacy or by a wholesaler. I do believe, though, over time that substitutability question will become less and less a question and to the extent that we can help people create evidence that supports the A-B interchangeability or therapeutic substitution, then we certainly will pursue that. In the meantime, though, we look at that as a long-term priority, and I wouldn't consider any of the up and coming pending things in the next six months to a year as being blockbuster, big successes for us, at least right out of the gate Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Percher at Barclays. Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. I'd like to go back to one of your early comments, John, on consistency. And this may be a question more for James. But I look at the balance sheet and think this is a large lever for you to be able to drive consistency as we look out to the forward years. Particularly today, you mentioned $5.4 billion of cash and $1.7 billion of CFO to come. We saw the revolver put in place. As we look over the balance of the year, I know there was some debt maturity. We've got the international acquisitions. But it feels like there'll still be a pretty substantial capability. So could you walk us through what will be due and maybe what was behind the revolver and where you sit as you look at the remainder of the year? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we're certainly pleased with the financial flexibility that we have. And I'll start off just by really reminding you of the portfolio approach that we have to capital allocation. And within that portfolio, internal capital expenditures and M&A are the first and second priorities. So certainly want to be clear about that. But given the degree of flexibility that we have, obviously we're also going to look regularly at what we think is a realistic M&A pipeline in the short, medium term. Contrast that against our cash balance and our coming projected free cash flow and make an assessment as to whether there's excess cash available for share repurchases. And you've seen us take that action in terms of buybacks now both in this last Q2 and in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year. So we're pleased that the board authorized the new $2 billion authorization for share repurchases. So it feels as though we have the liquidity and the right portfolio approach, the right flexibility, to continue to deploy capital effectively on your behalf. Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And the change in, or the element that has impacted guidance was the $500 million being done earlier in the year. There's no change. The $2 billion issued is not implied to be used in your current guidance. And I guess it also begs the question when you look to Europe, are there $10 billion deals, or are most of these $2 billion, $3 billion, or much smaller? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, in terms of the weighted average shares outstanding, the full-year number that I mentioned was 234 million. Embedded within that is the $500 million buyback. There is nothing assumed about progress against the new $2 billion authorization. In terms of the transaction sizes available to us, I wouldn't want to really comment on anything specific to M&A. You've seen the recent deal sizes with UDG and Sainsbury's. But there's a wide range of opportunities across the very broad set of businesses that we operate. Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Dave Francis at RBC Capital Markets. Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks, and congratulations on a solid quarter. Just a real quick one, John. Bigger picture, I appreciate the commentary on what you're seeing from pricing trend perspective across both the brand and generic baskets. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing volume-wise in terms of any meaningful change in the marketplace up or down domestically? Is there anything going on in the broad economy that's impacting volume trends as you're seeing them in the U.S. business? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks for the question, Dave. I think we see things pretty much in line with what we had expected for the year on a volume basis. And clearly you can see that the numbers that are being posted by the various sources as to prescription volumes. I think we don't see any major changes. There are perhaps some changes that you might see in the physician office perspective, but I would say that the biggest change or trend that we continue to see is that some of our larger customers are growing more rapidly than the rest. And in particular, our largest mail customer has had pretty nice growth. And so that puts a little pressure on our margin structure, particularly on the Specialty products that go through that particular customer. But otherwise, everything's pretty much in line with what we'd anticipated. Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Very good. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : And our next question comes from David Larsen at Leerink. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey, guys. Can you talk about the generic inflation comp? Like, when do you expect that to start to ease? So inflation rates were obviously very high in calendar 2014. They've pulled in over the past couple of quarters. So next year, and just any general thoughts. Would you expect the comp for generic inflation to ease a bit? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, generic inflation is not forecastable and we certainly don't have any insight from what the manufacturers are planning to do in their businesses. We've updated our assumption for the back half of this fiscal year. And of course we really want to take a step back and emphasize how generic price inflation is just one of a number of variables that drive again this broad set of businesses. So I would urge not to have an over focus, if you will. It's an important issue, as John was mentioning earlier. We included in our initial annual guide, and we update you as the year goes along. But I really think we want to keep this in perspective in terms of the broad number of drivers of our businesses. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. And then just any quick thoughts on Target? Have you had any discussions with CVS around Target and that account? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, unless you've heard something different, we've not heard of the Target transaction closing, and I would imagine our conversations with CVS would be more worthwhile post that process than today. So I'm not really prepared to comment or speculate on it other than to say we're continue to service the Target business with all of our focus and we want to make sure those stores are in great shape pre the transition to CVS ownership. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll take Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Maybe just not to beat the horse on Rite Aid, but just going back, one of the big questions we've gotten from a lot of investors is just sort of understanding how change of control provisions work on these kind of contracts. Obviously you've dealt with quite a few of them recently. And I guess, secondarily, understanding the sort of pushes and pulls long-term of being a key provider to a large retail chain. Obviously you still have a relationship with CVS and we'll have to see what happens with Rite Aid. But that's on the mail side. How do you think about that? Does it help you at all with the independents? I'm just trying to understand the long-term implications of that as well. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, just to make sure that I'm clear, that \u2013 our CVS relationship is with both the mail as well as many of their retail stores and now our continued relationship on Omnicare. As to Walgreens and Rite Aid, we've had a long-term relationship with Walgreens. It just hasn't happened to have had distribution as a key component of it for perhaps a couple of decades. Like anything else we're going to work hard to make sure that those Rite Aid stores are serviced and continue to focus on making our customers successful there. And we'll see where things head over time. But remember, customers kind of come and go in people's business, and albeit we've had a bad run here with two or three M&A transactions that were \"not our fault\" related to losing customers. But you also should expect that we'll continue to work hard to grow our business. And I talked before about the fact that we have a very large base of people who are dependent on us from a generic perspective. And albeit that base continues to grow. We think no matter what happens from a customer perspective, we will still be one of the largest suppliers of generics in the world and a very valuable partner to the manufacturers. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks. I'm sorry for the poorly worded question. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, that's okay. I just said I want to make sure everybody else listening was clear on it, Ross. I think we have time for one more question. Operator : And we'll take that from John Ransom at Raymond James. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : John? Operator : Mr. Ransom your line is open. Please go ahead. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Sorry. Trying to multi-task here and doing it very poorly. I'm sorry if this has been asked, but the Rite Aid contract expires in 2019. Is there a change of control out on the other side? Or do you expect that to remain in place through 2019? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we don't talk specifically about the terms of our agreements other than what we say at the beginning of them. And I think that the comment I made in answer to the question earlier is we plan to continue to serve their business with all of our effort and make sure that they're very successful as they continue through this transaction process. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's all I had. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. You're welcome. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I want to thank you, Audra. Thanks also for all of you on the call for your time today. Our industry experiences periods of dynamic change, and this is certainly one of them. And I'm confident that we will continue to participate in that change in an extremely positive way. We remain extremely well positioned to deliver the best service and value in the industry on behalf of our customers. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin? Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, John. On November 10 we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Conference in Scottsdale Arizona. And on January 12, we will present at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. We'll release our third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you, and good-bye. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation.",

All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice-President, Investor Relations. Erin Lampert : Thank you, Mellissa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2016 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a brief business update and will then introduce James who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO related adjustments. We also refer to certain non-GAAP measures calculated on a constant currency basis. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for our investors. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2016 results available on our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Additional information on constant currency effects is available in our SEC reports. Thank you. And here's John Hammergren. John Hammergren : Thanks, Erin, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. As we had an opportunity to speak with many of our investors since we last provided an update just a few weeks ago on January 11, I'll keep my remarks fairly brief this afternoon. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to James and he will walk you through our results for the third quarter. But before I do, I have three key messages I want to leave you with today. First, there have been no changes to the fiscal 2016 outlook and preliminary fiscal 2017 outlook, which we provided on January 11. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90 for fiscal 2016. Second, our third quarter results were right in line with our revised expectations. I'm proud of the excellent progress we've made in expanding our global pharmaceutical sourcing scale delivering operating margin improvements in our Technology Solutions segment and successfully executing on the Celesio acquisition synergies. And third, I have great confidence in our future. As we enter the final months of fiscal 2016 and look to the future, I am as confident as ever in our industry and the unique role we play in making the business of healthcare more efficient. I'm confident McKesson, our focus on innovation in our customer first mindset has repelled us to be leaders in the markets we serve. And most important, I'm confident in the extraordinary team we have at McKesson were truly the best in the business. Our businesses are very well positioned, both domestically and internationally. And we have a tremendously strong balance sheet, which we will continue to deploy affectively and strategically to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Year-to-date we repurchased approximately $850 million of our common stock. We paid nearly $1 billion of long-term debt and made internal capital investments at $417 million and paid a $179 million in dividends. We ended the third quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance. With that, I'll turn the call over to James to review our third quarter results and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James Beer : Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. As John discussed earlier, we provided our updated view on fiscal 2016 earnings on January 11 and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90. Our results this quarter are consistent with our revised expectations. I will now review our third quarter consolidated financial results. As a reminder, Schedule 3 of the accompanying tables to our press release includes supplemental constant currency information to outline both the dollar and percentage impact of currency movements on our reported results. During the third quarter and the first nine months of our fiscal 2016, our reported adjusted earnings per diluted share included currency headwinds of approximately $0.03 and $0.11, respectively. Therefore during my prepared remarks, I will reference both the reported and constant currency figures. Now, let's move to our results for the third quarter. My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.18, which excludes three items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2 and 3. Consolidated revenues increased 3% for the quarter to $47.9 billion. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis revenues were $49 billion, an increase of 5% led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter decreased by 3% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was flat to the prior year driven by the performance of distribution solutions, primarily reflecting the impact of a weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends offset by growth across our other domestic and international businesses, and continued progress on procurement synergies related to our acquisition of Celesio. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 5% for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency basis driven by diligent cost management in both segments and the sales of our nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses earlier in the fiscal year. Adjusted other income was $14 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $87 million decreased 6% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. Now moving to taxes, this quarter's adjusted tax rate of 25.5% was driven by both a favorable mix of income and certain favorable discreet tax items which totaled approximately $0.07 primarily reflecting recent Celesio first of changes in both the U.S. and Europe during the third quarter. For the full year we continued to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 29.5%. Adjusted income for the quarter was $739 million with our adjusted earnings per diluted share at $3.18 up 9% on a reported basis and up 10% in constant currency. Wrapping up our consolidated results for the third quarter diluted weighted average shares decreased 2% year-over-year to $232 million. During the third quarter we completed a share repurchase of common stock totaling $350 million. In fiscal year-to-date we have repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock. Overall we expect to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment which reflects a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends and we continue to expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be $233 million for the full fiscal year. Now let\u2019s turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $47.2 billion were up 3% on a reported basis. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. Constant currency revenues were $48.3 billion for the third quarter reflecting growth of 6%. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $39.6 billion in the third quarter, up 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter revenues primarily reflecting market growth in our U.S. pharmaceutical Specialty and Canadian businesses offset primarily by the expiration of a customer contract at the start of the third quarter. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6 billion for the third quarter. International revenues were impacted by approximately $700 million in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year. Adjusting for this currency impact, revenues were approximately $6.7 billion in the third quarter, down 1% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015 partially offset by continued growth in our U.K. business. Medical-Surgical revenues were flat year-over-year, primarily driven by market growth in our primary care business offset by the sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit of $2.5 billion decreased 3% on a reported basis and increased 1% on a constant currency basis to $2.6 billion. Overall the third quarter adjusted gross profit reflected our mix of business including a growing proportion of specialty pharmaceuticals, a weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends when compared to the prior year and continued progress on driving Celesio related procurement synergies. Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 5% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis segment operating expense was flat year-over-year, primarily driven by expense management and the sale of the ZEE Medical business during the second quarter. Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion was flat on a reported basis and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 224 basis points, a decline of 8 basis points year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, the segment margin declined 9 basis points primarily driven by the adjusted gross profit result. Generic pricing trends are anticipated to be weaker during the second half of our fiscal year as we on outlined on January, 11. Therefore, we now expect the Distribution Solution segment adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat to the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 8% for the quarter to $694 million. This decline was primarily driven by the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter, and the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. During the quarter, adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by our ongoing expense management efforts and the sales of nurse triage business. Third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 7% to $133 million. And the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 19%, representing an increase of 274 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit increased 2% representing an adjusted operating margin increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by strong performance in our Payer Solutions and Relay Connectivity and Medical Imaging businesses. For the full year, we now expect the adjusted operating margin for the segment to be in the low 20% range. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days, sales outstanding were relatively flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventories increased by 2 days to 33 days. Our days sales in payables increased by 3 days to 54 days. We generated $566 million in cash flow from operations during the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.4 billion, with $2.4 billion held offshore. For the 9 months ending December 31, we had $417 million of internal capital spending, repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock, repaid approximately $1 billion in long term debt and paid a $179 million in dividends. Now I\u2019ll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90. Our outlook assumes a full year average exchange rates of $1.10 per euro which is unchanged from our prior guidance. In addition, we now expect $1.27 per share in amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and $0.31 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect between $0.72 and $0.82 per share in LIFO related adjustments. In summary, McKesson delivered results consistent with our revised expectations for the quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect to leverage the core operational strength and scale of our leading global businesses and our longstanding portfolio approach to capital deployment to create value for our shareholders, customers and business partners. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Melissa? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : First question is on kind of a distribution segment operating margin. When we look at gross for the North America business in a normalized basis about up 7% year-over-year, it's kind of like the disclosed level that we've seen since fiscal year '14. So should we think about this as kind of a new market growth for the segment and is HCV kind of like the key factor there that kind of like contributed to that mid teen growth in last 18 months that we should \u2013 that have kind of like normalized and will do so going forward? James Beer : Well, the first part of your question I would expect that is our normal cause give you more of a steer for FY17 margins when we do our update in early May. So as it relates to what is being impacting the margin thus far is obviously, we've spoken extensively about the impact for generic price increases. And that's really being the driver of that margin results the DS function. Could you just repeat the second part of the question? Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. The question was really not about the margin, it was more about the topline for distribution solution for North America. It's kind of like up 7% in the last kind of like 18 months, we've seen this growth in kind of like low to mid and even high teens. So the question really is the two parts toward, like forward looking is 7% the new growth rate and then when you look at what's driving the slow down, is it kind of like did you seen an abnormal growth from HCV? John Hammergren : We had a \u2013 Ricky, this is John. We had a very large - we have a very large customers in the mail business that had some significant year-over-year progress in terms of customer winds. You saw us benefit from a revenue perspective that help pushes into the double digits in addition to the launches of some of these specialty drugs. So the combination of those two events were probably the things that propelled us from the revenue perspective. The 7% from my perspective at least now is more consistent with what we think the market underlying growth rates are probably running out today. Obviously, there are some minor changes in what we might see from a mix perspective and I think to James' point is probably little premature for us to talk about FY17 revenue forecast. But I think we're probably going to grow like we are today in line with the market. It's just a question of any customer changes that might happen during the year either customers of ours that are winning or losing business or when on occasions sometimes we lose a piece of business like we did with a large mail to customers just recently. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then just one follow-up on the gross profit margins \u2013 actually third quarter gross profit came in a little bit better than we've kind of like expected and seems \u2013 you still seeing kind of like benefit from kind of like buy side margin. So when we think about the new guidance that you provided few weeks ago, should we think about kind of like this quarter to third quarter it's kind of like the last quarter, we should think about modeling is like seeing a benefit on the buy side from generic information. And from this point on we should think like a bad, like a slowdown or like modulated, like the 0% that you've highlighted a few weeks ago? John Hammergren : Well, I would emphasize our view around a generic price inflation was normal, so not zero, but certainly modest \u2013 certainly significantly down from when we came into this fiscal year with much higher expectations. James Beer : So there is really no change in what we said to you on January 11. Things are coming through as we had sort of expected. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : On the administrative cost structure review, you guys shared earlier this month. Just looking back over the last few years and trying to adjust for acquisitions like PSS and Celesio. It looks to us that SG&A has grown somewhere in the 10% range per year. As we think about the cost structure review and some of the client attrition, you've experienced over the last year. How should we think about the right level of annual SG&A growth? Just any progress you guys have made. I know it's early, but any progress you've made in that review details behind it will be helpful for us. John Hammergren : Well, it is early in our work. Obviously, this is something that we did embed within the preliminary guide that we offered a couple of weeks ago for fiscal '17. But we're going through the detailed work now. We do think that there is opportunity and I've noted before that that opportunity would likely drive a one-time charge in Q4 of the current quarter. And will be able to hence provide an update in May. But certainly we feel that there is some opportunity. James Beer : And Robert, I think it's probably fair to say that looking at our SG&A without all of the acquisition noise that comes in and goes out and certainly currency fluctuation are really \u2013 if you look at our internal numbers in our calculations, our SG&A is normally growing in the low single digit kind of range. So we typically don't average at 10% increase in SG&A that would be way outside the boundaries if you look on base core expense kind of trajectory it's nowhere near that. So I think you might see some abnormalities occasionally because of M&A and how that flows through, as well as some of those currency stuff that I think overtime you should expect our SG&A to grow more that single digit rates, once we get passed at some of this work we're doing today on administrative costs. Robert Jones : Got it. I guess there is lot of focus on the pharma business maybe just on medical. It looks like it was essentially flat revenue growth there both sequentially and year-over-year. I think originally what you guys are talking about mid-single digit type growth for this year. So I guess what's changed relative to your original expectations and then any thoughts about the trajectory of the medical business growth from here will be helpful. James Beer : With medical surgical revenues, we updated our guide quarter or so ago to be low to mid single digit revenue growth and that was driven by our sale of ZEE Medical. So we talked also about the strength of the primarily care business within medical surgical. And there were some challenges on the extended care side, but overall we're very pleased with the continued development of the business. John Hammergren : I think you have to net it for ZEE that's probably the thing the most people miss when they look at those numbers. So we don't adjust those out. They are in our adjusted numbers with you and your reflection. Robert Jones : And nothing changed on the end market side then? James Beer : No, not really. And we've seen a little bit of weakness in flu, but that's not going to be something you're going to see dampen our overall revenue to significant extent. It really is the sale of ZEE. Operator : We'll next go to Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette : I guess for me just a quick question on the expected anti-trust litigation settlement gain for fiscal '17 that you alluded to a few weeks ago. And that extra $70 million year-over-year adds an extra $0.20 or $0.25 in fiscal '17 that we assume normal tax rate, which is fine. But just, is there any chance you can walk through the drivers of aerodynamic so what's going on there just to better understand. And why those gains were greater fiscal '17. John Hammergren : These things come through in unforecastable and sometimes lumpy fashions. It's really is just a single settlement. It's quite large by comparison to others that we receive and certainly by comparison to other years, so I think that\u2019s really it. James Beer : Yes. And the case is quite far along, which is why we felt it was sensible to make an assumption that we would enjoy that $140 million benefit in fiscal '17. Steven Valiquette : The other real quick on is just the $0.85 that you talked about for - you're heading fiscal '17 from a combination of a generic pricing and customer transitions. Obviously, we're still getting a lot of calls on that. Is there any chance that you're willing to maybe give just a bit more color just size wise on the magnitude of one of those buckets versus the other within that $0.85 at this stage or you still going to perhaps hold off on it till later. John Hammergren : Well, I'd like to say that the majority of that $0.85 has being driven by generic price increases changes. Operator : We\u2019ll next go to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : John shifting gears little bit given the kind of recent pull back in the market assets would seem to be more attractively valued right now. I guess can you talk little about whether or not the company feels pressured to put capital to work and are on the capital deployment strategy may be talk about the appetite for increasing the companies leverage ratio and the appetite for deals that might add another leg to the store something that might be more transformational as it relates to the business. John Hammergren : Well, thanks for the question, it clearly - we try not to feel pressure on any dimension because it may cause you do something that doesn\u2019t make sense. Having said that, as our balance sheet is become healthier and we paid off some of the debt and made the commitments that we said we would make relative to de-levering after Celesio, we are very aware of the fact that we now have expanded opportunity to deploy our balance sheet in a portfolio way and we planned to continued to do so. I would say that, the fluctuation and evaluations does make some opportunities more attractive than others and clearly even some of the private companies have might have dreamed of IPOs et cetera may be more available to a conversation with us than they might have been otherwise. And as it relates to putting leverage back on the company, I think the fact that we were able to lever up and then de-lever again give us creditability with making our commitments a reality and I think that the issue of another leg on the stool or transformational deal and clearly we look at any deal that make sense to its financially and strategically. I don\u2019t think we push anything away from the table. But having said that, synergies are usually more possible on deals that in more line of side on deals that are in one of the segment that were currently participating in. And so I would tell you that our buyers is to go into businesses that we currently understand and operate as suppose to something that\u2019s for a field when the synergies are based on some expectation that the markets are going to be more attractive whether going to grow faster and we use we can add lot to those values if we don\u2019t have synergies to bring into the transaction. George Hill : And then may be just a quick follow up again we\u2019ll kick and hit the generics topic again. You guys have pretty modest expectations for generic price inflation in fiscal 17 but lot of the back - the drivers they drove generic price inflation haven\u2019t changed much. I guess can you talk about, can you give us any color on what you\u2019re saying in the channel on what's driving the diminished rate of change and inflation and I guess I\u2019m looking for more anecdotal information that helps us kind of see what\u2019s going on in the market there. Thank you. John Hammergren : You may recall that we talked about generic inflation in the past, we talked about the fact that is driven by a small number of molecules from a small number of manufactures that have inflated to very high degree and I\u2019d say that our current experiences at some of those out layer increases have diminished significantly. But overall if you think about the portfolio overtime it has been in more of a deflationary mode so we talk about inflation. We really talking about the net effect of inflation on our business driven by those molecules not the overall portfolio inflating or deflating because that typically deflates. We think that its \u2013 we\u2019re in a period now where we\u2019re going to have modest inflation that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been experiencing, that\u2019s what we talked about in January 11, and that\u2019s what we anticipate for the rest of this fiscal year and into next fiscal years is modest generic inflation. Operator : We\u2019ll next go to Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : John, few weeks ago we talked about the incremental opportunity to add incremental generic procurement deals. I think you talked about the fact that you've done some Safeway are hold [ph] and some others. But can may be just remind us of what you see as incremental opportunities that are still available to you within your own book of business out in the marketplace? John Hammergren : Well, clearly we have made significant progress in helping our customers procure generics more affectively and use our distribution channel to bring them to their stores at a more cost effective way as well. And so I think we\u2019ve have seen progress you mentioned our hold and Albertson's Safeway and many of our independent customers have continued to join us in the generic procurement side and have become more and more reliant on the customs ability to help them reduce their cost and improve their performance. Our Health Mart stores are now above 45,00 stores and that program has been extremely successful in driving generics and our proprietary generics programs are still growing in healthy double digit kind of ranges. So overall I think we continue to make progress. Some of our largest customers still procure some are all of their generics on their own, through their own distribution network and do their own sourcing activities and we continue to have conversations with those customers about the value of using McKesson\u2019s combined power with their to do an even better job and those conversations obviously are important to us as we think about the relationship of these customers. It would be premature for me to talk about specifically which customers we think might provide the most opportunity but I don\u2019t think the table isn\u2019t run yet relative to opportunity for us. Lisa Gill : Is there a way to quantify that number of may be using analogy of \u2013 if you want to use to baseball at innings as far as how penetrated you are in your current book just so we can think about as we move into '17 and '18 beyond what the potential incremental opportunities are as it pertains to these hyper generic procurement relationships. James Beer : I will say the opportunities not in significant and many of you have talked to us about specific customers that you know are continuing to procure a large majority of their generics on their own. And so I think it's not an material impact in front of us if we\u2019re able to persuade these customers with the data that we have that our procurement activity would be beneficial to them. I\u2019m hesitant to describe it in innings, including customer count. We\u2019ve got a lot of customers using us today but in customer value based on the size of their generic spend their significant opportunity left for us. Lisa Gill : And then just my follow-up would just be both sounds well, as well as UDT now in a second review process. Was that your initial expectation and how should we think about the timeline of closing those two acquisitions. John Hammergren : Our initial expectation was at the regulation, regulatory process would be extended and follow about the pattern that we have seen before in this country and I think we\u2019ll remain extremely optimistic that these transactions are examined through their process that we will stand a very good chance of accomplishing the acquisitions in large and reform that we had expected when we announced them. And then answer to your earlier question also Lisa relative to procurement, I might also point out that the opportunities for us extend beyond just the U.S. and many times customers look - you look at customers that you know of in the U.S. that are buying on their own but there are also customer buying on their own in other important markets for us where we and they have the ability to dispense to generic that we\u2019ve sourced together. And so I think that we remain very optimistic with our global activity and our procurement programs will continue to grow. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David Larsen with Leerink. David Larsen : Can you please talk about the competitive environment. So when you got a market and bid for a new pieces of business, how is the pricing environment now that we\u2019ve got, couple of large JVs that are in the market, with like Red Oak and Rite Aid. Can you sort of talk about, what the pricing environment looks like? Has there been a significant shift in 2015, 2016 relative to previous years or not. Thanks. John Hammergren : It's difficult Dave to comment on pricing because it's sort of in the lands of where we are currently doing business and where we\u2019re competing for business. I would say that overall the business remains competitive but stabilized. I don\u2019t see a lot of customer changes that would drive one to believe that there is something going on the materially different from a pricing perspective out in the marketplace. I can speak for McKesson's strategy and that is we continue to focus heavily on our selling efforts within our existing customer base trying to find ways to add more value to those relationships and through that value added create a relationship that has more stability but it also provides a better profit for our customers and better profit for McKesson as we evolve these partnerships. And so I think our principle focus is in the area of expanding our footprint with the existing customers and helping them perform better. Operator : We\u2019ll next go to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : So may be just quickly we saw some headlines last week or so on some core rulings in Germany. Can you just remind us sort of where we are with the Celesio staff and the process let there, sort of determine whether or not you, we\u2019ll get to kind of ultimately acquire the remaining portion and how we should think about the purchase price? James Beer : Well, first of all, we own around 76% of Celesio and for the other 24 points or so of the ownership, they have a put to us. We do not have a call on those shares outstanding. As to the news these past few days related to suit that Magnetar had brought that we had previously seen dismissed at the local court level if you will, back in December of 2014. That decision was appealed by Magnetar. It did get overturn just a few days ago. We are planning to appeal that decision and I would expect that process to play-out over a year or more. And given the issues specific to this case, I think it is unlikely that McKesson will be required to pay what some have been extrapolating as the substantial liability, the case at hand related quite narrowly to a few shares that had been put to us. And so the court decision related to around \u20ac260,000 total. We see an extrapolation from that figure up into the \u20ac370 million range. I would not expect given the specifics of the case and the process around German law, that we would be looking at that sort of payment. John Hammergren : And I'd also point out to this obviously, there is no effect on the operating control we\u2019ve already established with Celesio. There is really no effect on our financial statements other than this potential cash liability but the - we consolidated their earnings, we operate the company and to James' point, this outstanding share are remain outstanding and can be put to us when they decide they want to put them to us. Ross Muken : And just quickly on the Rite Aid front. Can you just help us think through, sort of, how you have to game plan for an outcome there? I mean, obviously you are not be going to able to share with us, sort of, what the discussions go like [indiscernible]. I\u2019m just trying to think practically in terms of, as you have to have that decision tree of what the various options are, how quickly, if the business ultimately transitions this year, next year whenever, how quickly you can adjust your cost structure? How flexible it is and what are these sort of things we should look for to best understand, how that will impact the parts of the P&L. John Hammergren : First off I\u2019d remind folks that on early January I've made a comment about this business we believe will be retained by McKesson in its current form through late in our fiscal 17 numbers. And so with the guidance we\u2019ve given you for fiscal 17, that range includes that we would - or assumes that we\u2019d continue to enjoy the Rite Aid business in relative its same relative form through that end of that period. Obviously, we could be off, plus or minus depending on what your view of the process by which Walgreens will complete the transaction and how that may actually take shape. I'd say that we were reluctant to ever comment on what a customer might do when the decision is in their hands. I\u2019d say however, you\u2019ve seen certain customers of ours, value the incumbent relationship and continue to enjoy a relationship with McKesson going forward like you do at target at Omnicare where the relationship change from a mix perspective but we are able to retain at least a portion of the business. I would not take that speculation and apply it necessarily to Walgreens but I\u2019d just point that out as certainly an alternative that has some possibility other than that not much I can say Ross. Operator : We\u2019ll take the next question from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Garen Sarafian : Good afternoon John, James. James first question to you. Could you first repeat what the technology solutions adjusted constant currency margins were for this quarter which I think favorably benefited margins. But even if so, it\u2019s been quite strong year-to-date that you\u2019re not guiding to the 20% margin level for the year. So is there anything unique for us to some of these trends wouldn\u2019t continue into next year? James Beer : Well, I have been pleased with the operating margin trends in technology solutions in recent quarters and I think it very much reflects the work that the team there has been doing to reorient our focus to specific businesses around our peer solutions, around our transactional type offerings and also our imaging business, as well as our revenue cycle management businesses. So we've really shifted the focus to those areas where we think we have nice growth opportunities and we have solid margins. And that has flowed through in combination with good cost control to allow us to record much stronger margins with the comment that we think for the full year will be in the low 20s. About one point of that margin benefit of course, remember comes from the sale of our care management business a couple of quarters or so ago. So that's really the story on the technology margins. Overall, in constant currency the margin number itself is 20.5%. Garen Sarafian : 20.5, okay. Great. And then maybe going back to your question that was just asked regarding grade Rite Aid. Previously, you guys have sort of shied away from acquiring to the retail pharmacy space as there could be some conflicts at least in the U.S. that's not present in Europe. So with the potential acquisition in Rite Aid where there is the possibility of a material amount of stores being sold. Are you willing to reconsider that view or would there still be too much of an impact with your remaining retail clients taken through that? James Beer : I don't think we will be interested in buying the stores. To the extent stores are divested and we would not be interested in buying them. That's not the business we're in in the U.S. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take a question from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric Coldwell : My primary McKesson ones have been covered at this point, but I am curious after many years of waiting we finally got the AMP final rule 658 pages of glory. I'm curious if you and your teams have had a chance to go through that at all. And if there is anything that stands out to you as you think about your business over the next year once that \u2013 I guess it goes into affect actually starting fiscal '17 for you, but curious where your thoughts might be if you have any at this point. John Hammergren : I've read the whole thing several times and highlighted the areas of most interest to me. Obviously, it's still very early to understand all of the implications and to understand the ability of the states to implement this rule. I think that it's likely to be pretty limited in the states that have already largely moved to manage medicate program in recent years. This really is a state medicate fee for service kind of an application and I guess our initial assessment is that we expected to have a fairly limited impact in the supply chain as we see it today. Operator : We'll next go to Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher : John, I'd like to go back to the first question where you were asked to pine on 7% as perhaps a going-forward number. When we look at 7% in this quarter and the decline relative to the prior quarters, you mentioned a couple of items, but it's fair to think over the next several quarters we've got a contract movement, we have the sale of assets, FX may become an easier comp going forward. So is it fair to say that that's not reflective of long-term industry growth or how do you think about long-term industry growth today? John Hammergren : Well, I'm reluctant to make an industry call. You guys are and others are well positioned to do that. Clearly, part of what you have to look at is the amount of generic launches that come out, what kind of price inflation you're going to get on the branded launches. What kind of specialty drugs might hit and when. So there is lot of complexity. I guess what I was attempting to describe was that the relative higher rate that we had in advance of this quarter was driven by some specific customer wins that happen to flow through our P&L and that lapping affect of that success by that customer is what \u2013 is comparative that we\u2019re chatting it outside. That makes sense to your - Eric Percher : Yes. And as we've gone a couple of weeks into the year as you look at brand inflation trends, have you seen the political discussion translate into any material change in those trends? John Hammergren : No we really haven't seen any change of any significance in the branded side and I'd say that the results are aligned with our expectations. Operator : We'll take a question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : John, just going back to your expectations on inflation and not only just generic, but also maybe on branded, how you guys are thinking about in terms of this being election year and to the extent that you're seeing sort of a moderating environment. Any thoughts on as to how much you think may be an election cycle is impacting that? John Hammergren : Well, it's also is difficult to speculate on what the drivers are. We are not the ones making the decision on the generic or the branded side is relative to inflation. I would say the political discourse that's taking place and the congressional inquires relative to pricing practices, I think are obviously going to have people at least pausing perhaps to consider whether now is the right time to take price increase. There obviously are other circumstances related to pricing associated with supply disruption, availability, new product launches. I mean there is all kinds of things that probably play into the calculus here and I would say \u2013 I think the political discussions really, clearly and the media discussion probably has some impact to speculate on how much it would be difficult. Charles Rhyee : That's fair. And then just maybe one quick follow up on that. You mentioned earlier in a response that you're clearly looking at - there is nothing really - you're going to send us few items that kind of really drove some of the inflation that you saw. Historically, you've not really seen that right now. But is there anything structural to the market as you look forward in the next couple of years or something like that couldn't happen again or do you think there has been some changes in the market where it's probably less likely we'll see kind of what we saw maybe the last two years. John Hammergren : I believe the performance of branded pharmaceutical companies is probably easier to forecast give that it has been less volatile in the last decade than perhaps the generic industry we've seen more volatility. And that volatility certainly is partially driven by supply and disruption. So I would say that if you could forecast what supply disruptions might occur in the future then you might have the ability to at least have some inclinations to what happens with branded price or generic price inflation. I'm really reluctant to speculate on how things may play out. We clearly have given you guidance for the rest of this fiscal year on that dimension of inflation both branded and generic. And we've given you our thoughts relative to fiscal '17 our guidance on those two dimensions. And I think that we stand by our current speculation on that, but it's just that - those views are amongst other views we have to take every year and what might happen throughout the year and we just want to be transparent with you about what we're thinking so. I think that's probably the most I can say about it. Charles Rhyee : Thanks a lot. John Hammergren : I understand that we don't have any additional questions in the queue. I know we hit a lot of these subjects in early January and I appreciate all of the attention that you've paid to these matters and others and for your time on the call today. As we entered the final few months of our fiscal year and I look to the future, I'm excited about the opportunities I see for us to continue our lead from an innovation perspective and how we can help our customers meet the many challenges they may face. The fundamental strength of McKesson has long been our ability to constantly adapt and grow during times of change and by staying focused on our customers and through to our core values. I'll now hand the call over to Erin for a review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin Lampert : Thank you, John. On February 10, we will present at the Leerink Partners Global Healthcare Conference in New York. We will release our fourth quarter earnings results in May. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a good day.",

Thanks and here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I am pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across both our Distribution Solutions and our Technology Solutions segments. Fiscal 2016 was a year of growth and expansion across McKesson despite the headwinds resulting from generic pharmaceutical pricing trends and industry consolidation. I want to highlight a few important accomplishments across our company over the last year. In our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, we continue to expand our relationships with our customers and drive strong growth across all channels, including national retailers, independent pharmacies, and health systems. Our global sourcing and procurement office, based in London, delivered tremendous results in fiscal 2016. And I am proud of our team's performance and the value they are delivering on a global basis for our company and for our manufacturing partners. In fiscal 2017, we expect to achieve the full run rate of procurement-related synergies as articulated in the original Celesio acquisition, more than one year ahead of the original business case. Our Specialty Health business delivered strong mid-teens revenue growth for the fiscal year while announcing two strategic acquisitions to further complement our core business. We saw solid expansion of our leading independent pharmacy banner programs across the United States, Canada, and Europe. We also saw strong growth across the Lloyds brand pharmacies in Europe. And we were also very pleased to announce our proposed acquisition of Rexall Health in Canada. The operating margin rate in our Technology Solutions segment expanded nicely as a result of our efforts over the last several years at reshaping our portfolio and focusing on our investments. And as we discussed in January, the company undertook a review of its cost structure across the enterprise and implemented a set of actions designed to ensure McKesson remains at the forefront of operational excellence, efficiency, value, and innovation. I also want to highlight McKesson's strong operating cash flow results for fiscal 2016, which exceeded our expectations. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.7 billion in operating cash flow, up 18% year over year. There's one more item I'd like to call to your attention. Many of you joined us in January when we made an unscheduled announcement to highlight some industry trends and company-specific events that impacted our fiscal 2016 results and our preliminary outlook for fiscal 2017. One of the topics we discussed in January and it continues to receive attention, is the subject of generic pharmaceutical pricing. We believe some of you may be seeking clarification as to how it affects various industry constituents. So let me take a moment and talk about how it works here at McKesson. Over a very long period, our generic pharmaceutical portfolio has experienced deflation and continues to do so today. I also would remind you that our agreements with our manufacturing partners contemplate and protect us from a decrease in the value of our inventory. However, on a small group of generic drugs, as we have in the past, we expect \u2013 we will continue to experience price increases. When we talk about generic inflation at McKesson, we are specifically referring only to this small subset of generics that experience a price increase. As we think about fiscal 2017, we expect a nominal contribution from those generic pharmaceuticals that will increase in price. We saw this trend early, and our guidance today is consistent with the information we shared with you in January. And further, the fiscal 2017 guidance of $13.30 to $13.80 that we provide you today is in line with what we communicated with you back in January. I'm proud of this management team and their constant focus on growth and innovation to create value for the long term. I'm pleased with our accomplishments in fiscal 2016, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their leadership, consistent focus on putting our customers' success at the forefront of everything that we do. Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment, across all of the markets we serve, the themes of cost, quality, and access remain central to the opportunities and challenges facing healthcare. And as I've seen with relative consistency over my own career, these same themes continue to take a prominent place in the national platform of the current Presidential election process in the United States. I think it is important to remember that the issues of cost, quality, and access are not new. And demographics will continue to drive strong demand for pharmaceuticals, and the use of pharmaceuticals will continue to play an important role in the healthcare systems across the world and remain the most effective and cost-efficient way to treat patients across a variety of disease states and chronic conditions. And the pace of innovation continues to advance our industry in exciting ways, from the discovery of new pharmaceutical therapies to fight and cure disease, to new technology-enabled ways in which consumers are engaging in managing their own health, to real progress we see in the pay-for-value care delivery models that are emerging. Against this backdrop of change, I see great opportunity for McKesson. Change inevitably opens the door to new conversations with customers about how we can bring the strength of McKesson to help address the opportunities they see and the challenges that they face. Our customer-first culture demonstrates a commitment and an awareness that McKesson's long-term success is linked to our customers' success. And while change can bring its own set of challenges, I'm very excited about what the future holds for our company. Now moving on to our business results, Distribution Solutions concluded another solid year with good performance across the segment. North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services delivered 11% revenue growth on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The U.S. Pharmaceutical business delivered solid results for the year despite pricing trends on generic pharmaceuticals that were below our original plan and a few notable customer transitions related to consolidation within our healthcare supply chain. Despite the impact of these two events, the business saw growth and expansion across a number of important areas. In fiscal 2016, we continued to see excellent growth with existing customers who expanded their business with McKesson as well as new customers choosing McKesson as their pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution partner. At the beginning of April, we began to service the pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution for Albertsons and Safeway, and I'm very pleased with the way our team was prepared to hit the ground running on day one. Our OneStop proprietary generics program continued its strong performance and grew 21% year over year. And Health Mart extended its tremendous track record of growth during fiscal 2016, ending the year with more than 4,600 stores or approximately 19% growth over the prior year. I know that customer consolidation which impacted us in fiscal 2016 has caused some to question the scale and competitiveness of McKesson's generic pharmaceutical sourcing. To me, there's no better proof point than some of the examples I just walked you through, where we continue to expand our customer relationships, win new customers, deliver strong growth in our OneStop proprietary generics program, and rapidly expand the number of independent pharmacies who see real value to their bottom line by joining Health Mart. I'm incredibly confident in the strength of our relationships with our manufacturing partners and in McKesson's ability to be a great partner to them through our global procurement scale and operational footprint. In summary, I believe in the core strength and competitive position of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. And while we recently faced challenges related to a shift in generic pharmaceutical pricing trends and customer consolidation, I am confident that this business remains extremely well positioned for continued success. Our Canadian distribution business delivered solid results in fiscal 2016. In addition to the strong performance of our leading Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business, we also had strong performance across our extensive retail banner business. Several weeks ago, we announced our proposed acquisition of Rexall Health, which we expect to close later this calendar year. This acquisition supports McKesson's commitment to drive value in the industry by improving healthcare solutions delivered in the retail pharmacy setting. And it enhances our ability to provide best-in-class pharmacy care for patients through an expanded retail footprint across Canada. Our team in Canada has an outstanding track record of delivering great value to our customers and to patients, and I'm very excited about the opportunities we see for this business in fiscal 2017 and beyond. Turning now to our Specialty Health business, fiscal 2016 was another year of exceptional growth in our oncology and multi-specialty businesses. We recently brought together several assets under a new Manufacturer Services organization within McKesson Specialty Health. By integrating these capabilities, we will offer improved coordination of our best-in-class solutions to manufacturers and ultimately improve patient access and adherence to essential life-saving therapies. Additionally, we closed on our Biologics and Vantage Oncology acquisitions on April 1. Biologics is the largest independent, oncology-focused specialty pharmacy in the United States. And Vantage Oncology is a leading national provider of radiation oncology, medical oncology, and integrated cancer care. And in combination with our U.S. Oncology Network, this now includes over 120 integrated cancer centers across 29 states. These two important acquisitions will increase McKesson's Specialty Pharmaceutical Distribution's scale, expand our oncology-focused pharmacy offerings, enhance our solutions for manufacturers and payers, and broaden the scope of practice management services available to providers and patients. These investments demonstrate McKesson's commitment to the success of our community oncology partners and our customers. And we believe the acquisitions of Biologics and Vantage Oncology complement our holistic approach to exceptional care for cancer patients. Our teams are hard at work with our new colleagues from both Biologics and Vantage Oncology as they put in place detailed integration plans. And we are incredibly excited about welcoming the talent and expertise that exists across these two terrific organizations to the McKesson team. Turning now to international Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services, I am pleased with the results for fiscal 2016. We are making strong progress on some important investments to strengthen the information technology environment across Celesio while we continue to invest in the European retail pharmacy business. Additionally, in fiscal 2016 we announced a number of acquisitions across several of our markets where we see strong opportunities to enhance our services and capabilities. Looking ahead, Celesio is well positioned to execute on its operating plan, which includes a focus on the integration of acquisitions during fiscal 2017. In our Medical-Surgical business, we saw strong results in our physician office business, including outstanding growth with large accounts and customer wins with integrated delivery networks. Our surgery center and laboratory-focused businesses also delivered strong growth in fiscal 2016. And I'm pleased to report that we have successfully concluded our integration plan of PSS World Medical, which delivered synergies as expected. Overall, I'm proud of our full-year operating performance in Distribution Solutions. We have an exciting year ahead of us in fiscal 2017 that will require us to do what we do best : focus on our customers' success; leverage our culture of operational excellence and innovation to deliver the best value in the industry; and execute, integrate, and deliver value through the acquisitions we have announced. As we look ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect that Distribution Solutions revenues will increase by high single digits compared to the prior year, driven by market growth and acquisitions. Turning now to Technology Solutions, I am pleased by the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016. We experienced outstanding growth in our payer solutions, medical imaging, and relay connectivity businesses. And while revenue growth in Technology Solutions has been impacted over the last several years, primarily by important actions we have taken to focus our investments and shape our portfolio, our enhanced focus has resulted in meaningful improvements in our adjusted operating margin rate for the segment, which we expect will lead to further margin expansion in fiscal 2017. To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a solid plan for fiscal 2017. Growth across our businesses and growth from capital deployment is balanced against the negative impact of generic pharmaceutical pricing trends in the United States and customer consolidation. We are in a business that continues to generate strong cash flow from operations. And while the business of healthcare continues to transform across the markets we serve around the world, we are well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities for our company. At McKesson, we have the best management team in the business, and I'm confident in this team's ability to continue to deliver value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders. I'm proud of our performance in fiscal 2016 and look forward to the many exciting opportunities ahead of us in fiscal 2017. With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results. James? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2016 results reflect solid execution and core operational growth from both segments. In addition, we delivered operating cash flow which exceeded our expectations while applying our portfolio approach to capital deployment to create shareholder value. Today, I will cover both the fourth quarter and full-year results. I will also present annual guidance for fiscal 2017. Now before I review our fiscal 2016 results, I would like to address the cost alignment plan, which John mentioned in his remarks. This plan primarily includes workforce reductions and business process initiatives. As outlined in January, our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings guidance did not include restructuring charges related to this cost alignment plan, given that this plan was initiated late in the fourth quarter. Our earnings press release outlines the pre-tax charges related to the cost alignment plan, totaling $229 million, were recorded during the quarter, representing an adjusted earnings impact of $0.73 for fiscal 2016. Overall, cost alignment charges reduced adjusted gross profit by $26 million and increased adjusted operating expenses by $203 million for the fourth quarter and full year. The tables accompanying our press release outline our reported results inclusive of these cost alignment charges. However, in order to review our core operating performance for the quarter and the fiscal year, my remarks will provide our constant currency results excluding the impact of both the cost alignment charges and the gains realized earlier in FY 2016 on the sale of the Nurse Triage and ZEE Medical businesses. These gains totaled $0.29 per diluted share. Therefore, in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation includes additional information about our cost alignment plan, including actual fiscal 2016 charges and the charges anticipated during fiscal 2017. This presentation also provides more of a core operational or baseline view of our fiscal 2016 earnings in constant currency excluding the cost alignment charges and business sale gains that I just mentioned. During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2016 baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal 2017 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the fiscal 2016 baseline consolidated and statement gross profit, operating expense, and operating margin values provided within this presentation. For the balance of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results, including consolidated revenues, I will review the customary tables which accompany our earnings press release. Now let's move to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B of the tables accompanying our press release. Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter increased 5% in constant currency. For the full year, revenues were $195.3 billion in constant currency, an increase of 9% over the prior year, led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment. I'll now refer you to slides three and four of the supplemental presentation. Fourth quarter baseline gross profit was relatively flat and full-year baseline gross profit increased 3% in constant currency year over year. Fiscal 2016 baseline gross profit was driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions, primarily reflecting market growth, our mix of business, and our global procurement benefits, offset by the weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends, primarily in the second half of the fiscal year, which were in line with our previous expectations. Fourth quarter baseline operating expenses declined 4%, and full-year baseline operating expenses were flat in constant currency. For the full year, total baseline operating expenses benefited from lower expenses recorded related to the Nurse Triage and ZEE Medical businesses sold earlier in the fiscal year. Now turning back to Schedules 3A and 3B of the tables accompanying our press release, adjusted other income was $17 million for the quarter and $68 million for the full year. In fiscal 2017, other income is expected to increase by approximately 40% from the fiscal 2016 level, primarily related to the anticipated profit contribution from Celesio's equity investment in Brocacef, which previously announced its acquisition of the Netherlands subsidiary of Mediq. Interest expense of $86 million decreased 4% in constant currency for the quarter. Full-year interest expense of $359 million decreased 4% in constant currency, primarily driven by the retirement of debt obligations during the fiscal year. For fiscal 2017, we expect our year-over-year interest expense to be relatively flat to fiscal 2016, driven primarily by scheduled debt maturities and the incremental financing related to acquisitions we expect to close in fiscal 2017. Now moving to taxes, for the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 28.9% excluding cost alignment charges, reflecting our mix of income and a number of favorable discrete tax items. For fiscal 2017, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31%, which is primarily based on our expected mix of U.S. versus international income. However, this rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For fiscal 2016, McKesson's constant currency net income from continuing operations totaled $3 billion excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $169 million and after-tax gains on the sale of the two businesses that I mentioned earlier, totaling $67 million. I'll now refer you to slide five of the supplemental presentation. Our full-year baseline fiscal 2016 earnings per share of $12.52 increased 14% in constant currency versus the prior year. Overall, this year's baseline earnings per share reflects market growth across the Distribution Solutions segment, margin expansion in the Technology Solutions segment, global procurement synergies, the cumulative benefit of share repurchases in the fiscal year, and a lower adjusted tax rate versus the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 1% year over year to 233 million. During the fourth quarter, we completed a $650 million accelerated share repurchase program, bringing the value of total shares repurchased during fiscal 2016 to $1.5 billion. At the end of fiscal 2016, approximately $1 billion remained on the current share repurchase authorization granted by the board. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2017 is 228 million. Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B of the tables accompanying our press release. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter to $46.4 billion. For the full year, Distribution Solutions constant currency segment revenues were $192.4 billion, up 9%, primarily driven by market growth in our North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business. In fiscal 2017, Distribution Solutions revenue growth is expected to increase by a high single-digit percentage compared to fiscal 2016. As previously outlined, we continue to assume we retain the existing sourcing and distribution relationship with Rite Aid, which would contribute approximately $13 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017. For the quarter, North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues increased 6% in constant currency. For the full year, North American distribution revenues increased 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, Specialty, and Canadian businesses, offset primarily by the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of our third quarter. For fiscal 2017, we expect our North American Distribution business to deliver a high single-digit percentage revenue growth compared to fiscal 2016. International Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues were nearly $6 billion for the quarter, up 2% in constant currency. For the full year, international revenues of $23.5 billion were impacted by approximately $3 billion in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year. For the full year, revenues were $26.5 billion in constant currency, up 1%, driven by growth in our UK business, partially offset by the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2017, we expect Celesio's revenues to grow by a low double-digit percentage on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the acquisitions we announced in fiscal 2016. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 1% for the quarter and 2% for the full year, driven by strong growth in our primary care business, offset by the sale of ZEE Medical in the second quarter and weaker market conditions affecting our long-term care business. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect to drive mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth year over year. I'll now refer you to slide six of the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions baseline gross profit decreased 1% in constant currency for the quarter and increased 3% in constant currency for the full year. Full-year segment baseline gross profit reflected market growth and our mix of business, including a growing proportion of specialty pharmaceuticals, weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends when compared to the prior year, and lower profit contribution from our Medical-Surgical business, primarily driven by the sale of our ZEE Medical business in the second quarter. Full-year Distribution Solutions baseline gross profit also included our global procurement synergies and $76 million in antitrust settlement proceeds. Let's now move to slide seven of the supplemental presentation. Full-year segment baseline operating expenses increased 1% in constant currency from the prior year. Segment baseline operating expenses benefited from lower operating expenses following the sale of the ZEE Medical business. Now I'll refer you to slide eight in the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions full-year baseline operating profit increased 7% in constant currency to $4.5 billion. And we ended the year with a baseline operating profit margin of 234 basis points, four basis points below the adjusted operating margin we reported in the prior year. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect the segment baseline operating margin to approximate the fiscal 2016 baseline operating margin. Underpinning this outlook in fiscal 2017 is planned growth in segment baseline operating profit, driven by the contribution from our generics business, including both our global sourcing efforts and expanded one-stop sales, strong growth from our specialty, Canadian, international, and Medical-Surgical businesses, and the contribution from the previously announced acquisitions we expect to close in the fiscal year. Offsetting this anticipated profit expansion, we expect lower profit contribution from the customer contracts we previously discussed during fiscal 2016 but were impacted by market consolidation. In the U.S. market, we also expect branded drug pricing trends to be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016. And we anticipate a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price during fiscal 2017. We also expect the contribution from the launch of new oral generic drugs in the U.S. market to decline from the prior year. And finally, we expect a higher mix of more complex and expensive therapies, which will impact our margin rate. Now, turning back to Schedules 3A and 3B of the tables accompanying our press release, Technology Solutions revenues were down 5% for the quarter and down 6% for the full year to $2.9 billion. This full-year decline was driven by the anticipated revenue softness in our hospital software business, the sale of the Nurse Triage business, and the wind-down and transition of our UK Workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect Technology Solutions revenues to decline slightly year over year, as growth in our connectivity, payer solutions, medical imaging, and provider revenue cycle businesses will be more than offset by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business. Now I'll refer you to slides nine and slide 10 of the supplemental presentation. Full-year baseline segment gross profit was flat year over year in constant currency. Full-year baseline operating expenses in the segment declined 5% in constant currency from the prior year. Full-year baseline operating expenses benefited from various ongoing cost management initiatives, including the fiscal 2015 Workforce reductions and lower expenses following the sale of the Nurse Triage business in the first quarter. Let's now move to slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 12% in constant currency, driving a full-year baseline operating margin of 18.72%, up 288 basis points over the prior year. During fiscal 2017, we expect the baseline operating margin for the segment to be in the low-20% range. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased two days from the prior year to 28 days. Our days sales in inventories increased one day from the prior year to 32 days. And our days sales in payables increased five days from the prior year to 59 days. As a result of our profit growth and disciplined approach to working capital management, we reported $3.7 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2016. And we ended the year with a cash balance of $4 billion, with $2.2 billion held offshore. In fiscal 2017, we expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15% excluding $270 million in expected cash payments related to the combination of the cost alignment plan and a settlement agreement with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Justice, as previously disclosed in April of 2015. Internal capital spending totaled $677 million for fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2017, internal capital spending is projected to be between $700 million and $800 million. Our dividend obligation to Celesio's non-controlling shareholders is included within a line titled Net Income Attributable to non-Controlling Interests on Schedule 1 of the tables accompanying our press release. We expect this obligation to drive a fiscal 2017 expense of $46 million, or approximately $12 million per quarter assuming a 76% ownership stake. During fiscal 2017, we also expect to record income for non-controlling interests related to our joint venture physician partners operating within Vantage Oncology, the previously announced and now completed acquisition within our U.S. Specialty business. As a result, in fiscal 2017, we expect income attributable to non-controlling interests to increase by approximately 50% from fiscal 2016. And finally, we also anticipate a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.03 during fiscal 2017. In today's earnings press release, we detail many key assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2017 outlook of $13.30 to $13.80 per diluted share, which excludes anticipated FY 2017 cost alignment plan charges of $40 million to $50 million, equating to approximately $0.12 to $0.15 per diluted share. I'll now refer you to slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year-over-year baseline earnings growth. Our fiscal 2017 guidance of $13.30 to $13.80 provides baseline earnings growth of 6% to 10% year over year, which is in line with the fiscal 2017 preliminary outlook we provided back in January. Thank you, and with that I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Vicki? Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi, good evening and thank you very much for all the details in the supplemental slides. It's very, very helpful, so two questions here. So first of all, when we think about all the headwinds and tailwinds, what do you guys think of for the normalized EBIT growth going forward in absence of benefit from generic inflation excluding M&A? Is the baseline EBIT growth of about 5% that you delivered in the quarter for the Distribution segment, is that a good way for us to think of what a normalized EBIT growth rate should look like? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Ricky, for the question. I think the best way for us to think about this is really related to post the challenges we faced this year from the lapping of the generic price phenomena we experienced last year as well as the customer consolidations and the negative mix change associated with those customers. We think once we lap those changes and we get through this fiscal year, you should begin to see us perform at a level that's very similar to the level we performed at in the past. We don't really see anything structural in our business or in our business model that would cause us to be concerned about our ability to grow organically in a way that's very similar to the way we've grown in the past. Now clearly in FY 2018, we also have the transition with Rite Aid, and obviously you see us making lots of moves now to prepare to grow through those challenges. But we'll talk about that more as the time approaches. But other than that additional headwind that we'll face in that fiscal year, I think the business continues to perform as it has in the past. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then one follow-up question that we're getting is really about how you think about branded inflation and how you factor that into your guidance. Obviously, we've heard a lot and we talked a lot about the generic pricing impact. But it happens to be that in the summer manufacturers don't take the same level of price increases that they have in the past. Is that somewhat factored within your guidance range? Thank you. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : As we've thought about branded price increases, we've assumed that they would be modestly below the levels that occurred in fiscal 2016. So we feel as though we've made a prudent assumption in that regard as well. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you very much. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Operator : We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. John, I just want to follow up to a comment that you just made. You said fiscal 2018 you plan to grow through the Rite Aid challenge. As we think about the acquisitions that you've made and you think about the cost cuts that you're doing, et cetera, is it fair to say \u2013 and I know you're going to say it's really early to think about 2018. But is it fair to say that you think that you've set this up so that even with the challenge of Rite Aid you'll be able to grow in 2018? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It is early to talk about 2018. I would say that we talked a lot about the cost reduction programs we've put in place and the quick action we've taken to streamline the organization and to make sure we maintain our efficiencies. We don't really see any structural changes in our business that cause us great concern. And obviously, the one unusual event is the pending sale of Rite Aid. And it's our objective certainly to find a way to grow through that. But I hesitate to provide any forward guidance into FY 2018, but I can tell you that certainly is our intent, and we're working hard to make sure that that happens. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's very helpful. And then I guess my follow-up would just be around the incremental cash flow you saw towards the end of this fiscal year and the cash flow going into next year. Is there something unusual in the business or anything that's changing that's really providing this nice tailwind around cash flow? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'll let James jump in here in just a minute, but we clearly have the organization focused on doing what's right and balancing our objective to grow our earnings but also to manage our cash and to grow our cash flow along the way. So I think the team is very focused, and you're seeing some results from that focus. And, James, you might want to talk... James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I was obviously pleased with the cash flow growth in fiscal 2016, very much driven both by the profit growth as well as this ongoing focus that we've had right across our businesses, both distribution and technology around working capital management. And we think there's more opportunity to continue to build this level in fiscal 2017, as we indicated in our guide. It is important to remember, though, that the guide that I was referring to excluded that $270 million of cash outflows that we would expect to incur in fiscal 2017, driven by two things, the cost alignment plan and then the DEA payment. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you for the comments. Operator : We'll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. John, if we can go back to the earlier question around actually the brand inflation, I think you made the comment that you take some assumptions for it. But can you talk about that actually in relation to your fee-for-service contracts, in terms of what's embedded on how much changes in inflation can affect how your fee-for-service contracts may work, or actually how you get paid for in terms of fee-for-service? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks for the question, Charles. We have a longstanding tradition of building value with our manufacturing partners, both on the generic as well as on the branded and specialty sides of our business. Our relationship with the branded manufacturers has remained pretty consistent for a long time now. And I would say that our proportion of earnings that comes through price change in the branded portfolios has remained relatively constant as well, and it is a small portion of our overall branded profit arrangement. Most of our profits are covered under a more fixed arrangement that is pretty reliable regardless of what happens with price inflation, and there's a small portion that we talked about in that 20% plus or minus range that has some price inflation effect on it. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: And just to follow up, would you \u2013 when you talk about when you embed your assumptions around it, do you guys also take into the political climate? Obviously, we're in an election year. Do you try to factor some of that into your assumptions as well as we think about the coming year? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, we're not oblivious to the conversations that are going on in the media and with the current political activity, and we're certainly not oblivious to the investigations and conversations that have been going on from a Congressional perspective into these areas. I think our assumptions are reasonable and they're based on our historical work with the manufacturers. They're certainly buffered by what we see as the current climate. So I would say that as we stated them today, we believe these assumptions are realistic and are likely to occur in the way we've laid them out in our fiscal 2017 guidance. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. I'd like to return to cash flow. So given the increase in cash flow that we see, maybe a little bit of focus on what your plans are for that cash. James, I'd love to hear your view of leverage and where you'll be post-financing, maybe some of the maturities that come up this year, minimal cash balance in the EU and U.S., and how you're looking to put cash to work this year? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Eric, certainly we remain committed to our portfolio approach to capital deployment. I think you know that well. That's the four elements of internal capital spending, M&A, dividends, and share buybacks. And one of the themes of this past fiscal year was that we deployed all four levers of that portfolio approach. Now that said, we've also indicated in the past and maintain a preference for value-creating M&A, if we can find good alternatives versus share buybacks. And so clearly, we've made some nice progress on that recently. Yes, in terms of overall leverage, we've made significant progress in the last 12 months with debt maturities, bringing down the gross debt level that we entered into to finance the Celesio acquisition a couple of years ago. So we've brought ourselves an additional level of financial flexibility as a result of doing that, and I think that's been very important. But I also indicated in my script that as we think about closing on some of the acquisitions in the coming several months or so, expect us to be raising some additional debt in order to be able to accomplish those closings as well. So you'll see us I think using our debt capacity in a way very much consistent with our investment-grade credit rating and sticking with our portfolio approach to capital deployment, with an emphasis on looking for strong acquisitions as we've done in recent months that we think can continue to grow our cash flow and earnings over time. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And at this point, we had talked about 3% to 4% earnings growth from capital deployment. It appears that has perhaps been achieved already. Is that a fair statement? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it's a fair statement. I'd say we're modestly above the top end of that range that we indicated preliminarily back in January. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks for the questions. It feels a little unnatural to be asking so many around branded \u2013 on the branded side over the generic side, but here goes. It seems, like you guys are assuming, you had mentioned less inflation of the branded side in 2017 than you saw at 2016. Just to be clear, is that because you're already seeing less price increases in the market to date, or is this just more conservatism that you're baking into fiscal 2017? And I guess just within that, anything specifically you're seeing around specialty pricing trends today than what you're assuming within specialty would be helpful. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : On the branded side, I just wanted to emphasize that our assumption is a prudent one. It's not based on anything that we've seen. Obviously, we're very early in the year. But as John was indicating in his last answer, we're obviously watchful of the political environment and so forth. So that would be how I would address the branded price. The other part of your question was? Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Specialty? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In terms of pricing there? Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: In terms of pricing, yes. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'd say that has a relatively modest effect on our business plan. And so that's mostly a fixed-like fee-for-service type of agreement on that side of the business. So I wouldn't draw particular attention to the pricing there. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And I guess just to follow up, it sounds like you guys now expect to realize the procurement run rate in fiscal 2017. So, John, you had mentioned that you're ahead of schedule. I guess just within that, do you think there's more upside beyond that original range as you move through 2017 and into 2018? And then if you could help us level-set what the run rate was leaving fiscal 2016 around that procurement savings, that would be very helpful. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Obviously, we made significant progress since the acquisition of Celesio to accomplish the objective that we had laid out when we made the acquisition to begin with. And you might recall that the synergy between $275 million and $325 million was quite additive to the existing run rate of margin and profit coming out of the Celesio business on its own without these additional global synergies. So I am very pleased with the progress the team has made. And as you might imagine, in all of our McKesson businesses, last year's result is not good enough for next year. So we are certainly pushing our organizations to continue to make progress on all the dimensions within our businesses to improve. But clearly the magnitude of improvement left available us to in global procurement is larger than realized, and now it will be more incremental improvement on that baseline. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Operator : We'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys, two quick questions. First, an easy one for James. Any chance you would quantify the EPS impact or the step down of generic introductions in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We're assuming that that would be a relatively modest figure. Again, I wouldn't want to overdo that point. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, and then one for John. John, I'm just interested how you think about the Specialty business as it relates to oncology evolves. You guys have made quite a big bet on oncology, especially with the two most recent acquisitions. And you've got the Medicare Part D demonstration project that's out there that seems to have everybody upset. I guess do you guys feel like that you're protected around the business investments that you've made in specialty? And I would just love your thoughts on how you think the oncology business evolves, both from a benefit perspective and from a business perspective. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think clearly there are two parts to that question, the evolution of the oncology business and how we feel about our position in oncology. And the second part of the question was really related to the demonstration project that has some people concerned. As to the demonstration project, it really has no material effect on our business as a demonstration. And frankly, even if it's rolled out in its current form, which we don't think necessarily is in the best interest of patients or oncologists in this country, it would still be relatively immaterial to our corporation. Clearly, we are very focused on helping our oncology practice partners, whether they're in our network or they are customers of ours, become more efficient, improve the profitability of their practices. But the fundamental strategy for us is to be well positioned as a corporation for what we believe is a continued significant launch cycle for new oncology treatments, including drugs and other protocols, the increase in the rate of cancer patients in this country, and to be positioned to help our community oncology practices thrive in an environment where they can demonstrate already a lower cost, equal or better outcomes, and clearly better flexibility for the patients that they serve. And so when you see us combine our efforts in not only our existing businesses but with these new acquisitions, we're really focused on making sure that we have a wide variety of offerings for the clinician to use when they're making decisions about the appropriate patient care. And I might also mention that CMS has other programs underway, and McKesson participates very heavily in those pilot programs to make sure that we're helping to demonstrate new ways to treat patients, new ways to develop value-based cost and quality-oriented outcomes. And we're excited to be working with all the payers in those areas because we think we can do a great job in the community and that, frankly, we're in a better position to deliver better cost and better value and better outcomes than many other constituents. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking the questions. The first one is a follow-up to the prior question, so a bit different way of asking it. So in terms of the generic launches for your upcoming year, you made a similar statement a year ago. So I was more interested in the relative difference from the step-down last year versus the step-down this year. So on a relative basis, does it turn from a tailwind to a headwind type of a question? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm not sure that there's very much I can add at this point. One observation I would make is that the launches that we see in fiscal 2017 have more of a profile that will drive a lesser profit contribution for us. And that's because we see the likelihood that there would be more exclusive type launches than has been the case in some other years. So that's really the driver of the 2017 over 2016 effect. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it, okay. And then second question is one of your peers mentioned reimbursement pressures of clients. Could you maybe discuss what you're seeing from your various customer segments within distribution, any recent trends? And if so, what does guidance assume for the upcoming 12 months? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In terms of our guide, I wouldn't point to anything material in terms of our logic around changes in reimbursement. We feel comfortable with overall sets of puts and takes that go around any guided range. And we feel as though we've got the ability to be able to execute against that range based on a variety of different types of business conditions that may or may not arise. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Fair enough, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning \u2013 good afternoon, sorry. So I guess as we think about your strategy on the pharmacy side, obviously you've made again some acquisitions there internationally. I guess as we think about your experience so far with Lloyds and what you've learned and how you think about that as a long-term vehicle of driving value at McKesson as one of the key pillars, what are the key things you've learned that are maybe different than your perception, even though obviously, you service them in the U.S., about how the international pharmacy markets differ? And then how do you view that business model relative to your overall mix? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We're excited about the performance that we've achieved with Lloyds and the evolution of the pharmacy business in Europe in particular, given that it is extremely well positioned to be a big part of the healthcare system in many of those countries, in particular in the UK, where healthcare demand outstrips supply and where governments and other payers are looking for lower cost alternatives and vehicles to serve their populations and certainly ways to reduce the queueing that goes on in the larger health systems by using a pharmacist as another expert, as a provider in the healthcare system. And so we're excited about Lloyds being positioned as a destination for healthcare services. We are trying to carve a position with our pharmacy strategy, frankly, around the world that is more focused on being in the care process as opposed to some of the other avenues that some of these retail stores can take. And so I think we're pleased with where we're positioned in Europe, and we're also pleased with where we're headed in Canada, and we're excited to bring many of these benefits to our independent pharmacy customers, either through our banner programs or just through close partnerships. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, John. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : We'll go next to David Larsen with Leerink Partners. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Expanding on that last question a bit, can you talk about some of the organic growth opportunities that you see for Celesio over in Europe potentially becoming an intermediary between hospitals or manufacturers, or anything along those lines? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Clearly, I just talked about Lloyds and how we think Lloyds both in our own stores and also in our banner stores in many different markets is well positioned to participate in the care process in a broader way and more comprehensive way. Now clearly, the hospital business and the specialty business in many markets in Europe is managed directly between the manufacturers and the large health systems. We believe that both the manufacturers and the governments and others that operate these enterprises would be much better off if McKesson was in the middle through Celesio trying to provide the streamlined supply chain and information stream that we do here in the United States. And we continue to make acquisitions in Europe that better position us in adjacencies outside of retail pharmacy. So we think that there are opportunities for us to grow our footprint, and you see us continue to invest in our infrastructure of Celesio so that we're prepared to do that. I think we have time for one last question. Operator : We'll take our last question from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, John. Thanks for squeezing me in. Real quick on the strategic front, can you talk a little bit about how the Rexall transaction reflects any change in your acquisition or business development philosophy as it relates to the retail footprint for McKesson in North America? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We try to be leaders in the businesses that we are participating in, and that's our objective. And so when we see an opportunity for us to lead in the market with a business, that becomes attractive to us. We believe both in Canada as well as in parts of Europe, we have an opportunity to be number one or number two in the retail market. And we have the ability to bring that expertise to the rest of our customers when we partner closely with them, sometimes through ownership and sometimes not, in a way that builds value. As it relates to the U.S., which is where some of these questions sometimes go, we don't see a real vertical opportunity in the U.S. that would allow us to create that leadership position as being number one or number two in the U.S. marketplace. So clearly, our strategy here in retail is to align very closely with people that we believe are great business partners that are also winning in their sections of the market and stand clearly with independent pharmacies and other chains that are focused on having us help them in a more material way. So I think that that captures our strategy as it relates to retail. Thank you for that question, Dave. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I want to thank you, Vicki, for your help with the call. I want to thank also all of you for your time today. I do think we presented a very solid operating plan for fiscal 2017. I'm excited about the growth opportunities that I see across all of McKesson. And I'm certainly proud of our track record at delivering value to our customers and strong financial returns for our shareholders. And once again, I want to thank all of our employees for a very strong fiscal 2016 and a very positive plan for fiscal 2017, and thank you all for your time again. Erin? Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, John. We will participate in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference in Las Vegas on May 11. We look forward to seeing you in the new fiscal year. Thank you and goodbye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Craig Mercer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Craig Mercer - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and James will reference items excluding cost alignment plan charges and foreign currency exchange effects. In addition, I would call to your attention the supplemental slides which we will reference on today's call and can be found on the investors page of our website. We believe the supplemental slides, which include non-GAAP measures, will provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance and comparability of financial results period over period. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2017 results and the supplemental slides for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you, and here is John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Craig, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our call. Today we reported a solid start to fiscal 2017. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $49.9 billion, up 5%, and earnings per diluted share of $3.53, up 18%, both on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. We are maintaining our full year guidance range of $13.43 to $13.93 for fiscal 2017. Before I dive into the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some recent events that continue to demonstrate our commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. First, we continue to proactively develop our portfolio of businesses. In the past quarter alone, we closed seven acquisitions including Biologics, Vantage Oncology and UDG Healthcare. We started the important work to expeditiously integrate and achieve each acquisition's underlying business case. And we divested our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business. Second, we jointly announced with Change Healthcare the creation of a new company to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower health care costs, improve patient access and outcomes, and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care. This new health care information technology company will offer complementary capabilities that will help enhance opportunities to benefit customers, employees and shareholders. This is a significant undertaking for both McKesson and Change Healthcare during the past few quarters, and I am pleased with our progress in driving this transaction forward. Last, in May we announced a strategic sourcing partnership with Walmart. Walmart is a very sophisticated company, not just on the logistics side, but around their sourcing and procurement operations. The selection of McKesson is a clear endorsement of not only our long-term partnership, but also McKesson's world-class pharmaceutical sourcing and procurement capabilities. Building a long-term relationship made sense for Walmart and we were the right partner. Our advantage relative to others in the industry is our ability to combine our exceptional operational excellence with our global scale and sourcing expertise. First it takes quality people that are trained and experienced to make this happen. Second, it takes great partners on the manufacturer side to make the supply chain work effectively. And last, it takes a continued source of knowledge and analytics around what's possible to make great procurement decisions. All of these things position McKesson as the best partner in the industry. We've had a very busy first quarter and are encouraged by the work of our employees to successfully execute against so many important initiatives. Turning now to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions revenues were $49.2 billion, up 5% on a constant currency basis, and Distribution Solutions adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis and in line with our original expectations. Our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which includes US pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, drove revenue growth in the first quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis, despite the lapping effect of our customer consolidations that occurred late in fiscal 2016. Revenue at our US pharmaceutical business met our expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong growth from customers across the retail, institutional and independent channels. Note that effective April 1, we started servicing the combined Albertsons Safeway network of nearly 1,700 pharmacies in the US under our new five-year distribution agreement, and I'm pleased with our team's execution to onboard this important customer, which includes the sourcing and distribution of both branded and generic pharmaceuticals. I'd like to take a moment to highlight our strong and growing community of independent pharmacy customers. Last month, we hosted our annual ideaShare Conference for our independent retail pharmacy customers, including significant participation from our Health Mart partners. With approximately 4,700 stores nationwide, Health Mart has grown by 50% over the past three years. This growth is attributed largely to, first, our focus on helping our independent retail pharmacy customers deliver, and be recognized for, top clinical performance, and second, our delivery of innovative solutions and implementation support that helps members compete and grow their business. Some important tools available to our independent retail pharmacy customers include Health Mart's Pathway to Better Pharmacy Performance and Profit, a step-by-step approach to help members navigate the changes in today's retail pharmacy market and stay ahead of the curve, and myHealthMart, a proprietary online portal that enables pharmacies to proactively manage their business. Additionally, as a market leader in managed care solutions, McKesson's AccessHealth provides the education, expertise and tools pharmacies need to gain access to, and compete in, preferred networks. In summary, I'm proud of the value we deliver to our independent pharmacy customers, and the innovative services and solutions that set us apart from the competition. Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health, we again delivered impressive growth in our specialty business, driven by the performance in our oncology and other multi-specialty categories. I'd like to spend a minute to highlight an example of our progress and commitment toward the transition to value-based care. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation is developing new payment and delivery models designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of specialty care. Among those specialty models is the oncology care model, or OCM, which aims to provide higher quality for highly coordinated oncology care at the same or lower cost to Medicare. Under the OCM, physician practices enter into a payment arrangement that includes financial and performance accountability for care related to chemotherapy. The practices participating in OCM have committed to providing enhanced services to Medicare beneficiaries such as care coordination, navigation and national treatment guidelines for care. Earlier this month, we announced that 12 practices affiliated with the US Oncology Network, representing approximately 800 physicians, will participate in the OCM. In total, approximately 3,200 physicians were chosen to participate in the OCM, which means our network-affiliated physicians represented one fourth of all participating physicians, and if we consider customers supported through our Onmark GPO and Vantage Oncology affiliated practices, McKesson Specialty Health supports nearly 50 practices that have been selected, an unparalleled commitment to value-based oncology. The OCM marks a major milestone in the shift to value-based cancer care, and we congratulate all of our affiliated practices selected to participate in this innovative program. We remain committed to new care delivery models that will better position our affiliated practices to more effectively operate from a clinical and financial perspective, and build further upon our strength in this transformation to value-based care. Moving to our Canadian business, we had nice growth in the quarter with results that were in line with our expectations. Our Canadian operations represent a diverse collection of businesses similar to those in the US, with a particular emphasis on specialty and retail. We expect to close the previously announced Rexall transaction later this calendar year which will further enhance McKesson's retail pharmacy capabilities, procurement scale and best-in-class pharmacy care for patients across Canada. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter were $6.4 billion, up 9% year over year on a constant currency basis. Operating performance from Celesio was slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to recent retail pharmacy reimbursement changes in the UK. While scheduled reimbursement cuts were expected, there were further unanticipated cuts made by the UK government effective in April and June this year which impacted the first quarter and will impact the remainder of the year. Despite the unanticipated events surrounding recent reimbursement changes, as well as the UKs decision to exit the EU, we continue to believe that Celesio represents a strong long-term range growth opportunity across retail, wholesale and specialty. And finally, our medical-surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, an increase of 2% over the prior year, driven by market growth, partially offset by the prior-year sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the prior-year second quarter sale of ZEE Medical, growth in the segment was 4%. In summary, I am pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the first quarter. We continue to expect Distribution Solutions revenue growth of high single digits compared to the prior year and that full year adjusted operating margin will remain flat relative to the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 1% for the first quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the prior-year sale of our nurse triage business, largely offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Technology Solutions' operating margin was up significantly relative to the prior year. Our first quarter results benefited from growth in our payer solutions and connectivity businesses including favorable timing and lower operating expenses. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions. Our continued efforts to deliver customer success and improve profitability position our technology businesses well for the future of changed healthcare. I remain confident in our Technology Solutions outlook for the full year which includes an expectation for achieving adjusted operating margin in the low 20% range for the segment. Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments, and we are maintaining our full year outlook for fiscal 2017 at a range of $13.43 to $13.93. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. As John mentioned, today we reported results which reflect a solid start to fiscal 2017. Before I get to our results, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational, or baseline view, of our fiscal 2017 earnings in constant currency. This baseline view excludes the impacts of cost alignment charges from our adjusted earnings as well as a gain on the sale of a business in the first quarter of the prior year. During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2017 first quarter baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal 2017 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the first quarter baseline consolidated and segment gross profit, operating expense and operating margin values provided within this presentation. Now let's move to our results for the first quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $3.50 per diluted share which excludes four items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Baseline EPS was $3.53 per diluted share on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.14 per diluted share included a gain on the sale of the nurse triage business totaling $0.16 per diluted share. Our consolidated results can be found on schedules two and three of the tables accompanying our press release. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 5% in constant currency. I'll now refer you to slides three and four of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline gross profit was up 1% in constant currency year over year, driven by global procurement benefits, recent business acquisitions, and an incremental pre-text gain related to anti-trust settlement proceeds, largely offset by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity. First quarter baseline operating expenses decreased 2% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our cost alignment plan. Adjusted other income was $23 million for the quarter, an increase of 53% in constant currency, consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $79 million decreased 11% in constant currency for the quarter. Now moving to taxes, our adjusted tax rate was 27.1%, which includes the discrete tax benefit of $37 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, driven by an amended accounting standard related to share-based compensation that I mentioned at our Investor Day in late June. I would note that while the impact of this standard may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in general, the largest effect will likely continue to occur in our first quarter due to the timing of the expiration and vesting of our share-based compensation awards. For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect a total impact of approximately $0.20 due to this amended accounting standard. As a result of this accounting change, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 30% in fiscal 2017. However as a reminder, this rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. McKesson's baseline net income from continuing operations totaled $805 million in constant currency, excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $5 million. I'll now refer you to slide five of the supplemental presentation. Our first quarter baseline earnings per share of $3.53 increased 18% in constant currency versus the prior year. The year over year currency headwind equated to $0.01 per diluted share. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year over year to 228 million. We continue to expect a full year share count of 228 million. Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on schedule three of the tables accompanying our press release. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $49.2 billion were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency in the quarter, primarily reflecting growth in our US pharmaceutical, specialty and Canadian businesses, as well as the contribution from our recent acquisitions. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.4 billion for the quarter, up 9% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions. Revenues were modestly impacted by approximately $35 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. Moving now to the medical-surgical business, revenues were up 2% for the quarter, driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year's sale of the ZEE Medical business. I'll now refer you to slide six of the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions baseline gross profit was flat on a constant currency basis for the quarter. Baseline gross profit reflected the anticipated weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends, customer consolidation headwinds, and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer when compared to the prior year. As we've discussed previously, the year over year impact from weaker generic pricing trends will more heavily impact the first half of our fiscal 2017. For the full year, we continue to expect a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price. Benefiting our first quarter baseline gross profit was the incremental impact of a pre-tax gain related to an anti-trust settlement recorded in the quarter, which was contemplated in our original fiscal 2017 guidance. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal 2016 we recorded a pre-tax gain of $59 million related to anti-trust settlement proceeds, so the year over year impact in the most recent quarter from these settlements totaled $83 million. We continue to expect that branded pharmaceutical pricing trends will be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016. Let's move now to slide seven of the supplemental presentation. First quarter Distribution Solutions segment baseline operating expenses were flat on a constant currency basis. The segment operating expenses benefited from the cost alignment plan actions taken in late fiscal 2016 and lower operating expenses due to the sale of ZEE Medical in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. I'll now refer you to slide eight in the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions first quarter segment baseline operating profit was flat in constant currency at $1.1 billion. Segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 231 basis points, a decrease of 11 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by the expected weaker generic pricing trends, recent customer consolidation and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, offset by the anticipated anti-trust settlement recorded in the quarter, global procurement benefits and lower operating expenses. We continue to expect the segment baseline operating margin to approximate the fiscal 2016 baseline operating margin. Now turning back to schedule three of the tables accompanying our press release. Technology Solutions revenues were down 1% for the quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business and the prior year sale of the nurse triage business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. I will now refer you to slides nine and ten of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline segment gross profit was up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the timing of a few items that were originally expected later in fiscal 2017. First quarter baseline operating expenses in the segment decreased 10% in constant currency from the prior year, driven by actions related to the cost alignment plan. Let's now move to slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 53% in constant currency, resulting in an operating margin of 24.55%, up 879 basis points over the prior year. This improvement was driven by our continued focus on higher margin businesses, lower operating expenses and certain timing benefits. We continue to expect the full year segment baseline operating margin to be in the low 20% range. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 1 day from the prior year to 27 days. Our days sales in inventory were flat from the prior year at 30 days, and our days sales in payables increased 6 days from the prior year to 59 days. We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. We continue to expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15%, excluding $217 million (24:37) in expected cash payments related to the combination of the cost alignment plan and a settlement with the US government, which we previously disclosed in April of 2015. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.7 billion, with $2.5 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $114 million for the first quarter. We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach. In particular, we have been active on the M&A front, announcing the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare as well as closing seven acquisitions during the quarter. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. I'll now turn to our fiscal 2017 outlook and refer you to slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year over year baseline earnings growth. As John discussed earlier, we are reiterating our fiscal 2017 outlook of $13.43 to $13.93, which excludes approximately $0.12 to $0.15 in expected charges related to the cost alignment plan announced in March of 2016. This range provides baseline earnings growth of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Our outlook anticipates a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.10 during fiscal 2017, consistent with our recently updated guidance announcement on June 29. And as a reminder, on May 4, we guided that our fiscal 2017 results would be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect to generate approximately 48% of our earnings in the first half of the year. And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our FY 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share. Thank you, and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Justin? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks and good afternoon. In the 10-Q tonight I noticed that there was a comment on Distribution Solutions gross margin being impacted by lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer. I'm sure that's a fairly obvious item, I can guess at what manufacturer that might be, but I'd love any commentary you have on that, and just want to make sure it's not more of a sector theme as opposed to a one-off situation. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks, Eric, for the question. I think your perspective is probably correct, and I would like to just further by saying our relationship with the branded manufacturers remains pretty consistent across the board. Our contracts renew on a regular basis with very minor modifications to the terms typically. And what you see here is just basically a difference in the yield year on year from an existing agreement with an existing supplier. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And again, John, you think that's clearly a one-time item with this one manufacturer? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well certainly the magnitude of it is. If you think about the year on year change in pricing behavior, that's really what's the driver behind it. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks very much. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : And our next question will come from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon. First I guess I'll take the obligatory generic inflation moderation question. In your prepared remarks, you sort of reiterated your expectation of nominal contributions to earnings. But could you just elaborate a little bit further as to what you've seen since last quarter, just to give us more insight? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Really, it's been a very similar theme in recent months, so it wouldn't likely point to any particularly notable change quarter over quarter. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then on implementing Walmart, congratulations on that deal, but could you discuss the timeline of when this will occur? You mentioned it being operational by the end of fiscal 2017, but I'm wondering what are the critical steps that are preventing some of the benefits from occurring earlier? So for example, wouldn't at least some of your current contracts be tiered for additional volume so that you could benefit from incremental scale sooner? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well our agreements, as you point out, are in place today, and one of the things we will be doing as we go to market with the new Walmart relationship will be modifying those agreements to reflect some of the incremental volume delivered by Walmart. But really a combination of the terms and other features of these contracts exist with both organizations. And I do think there clearly is some nominal value that may be delivered in FY 2017. We really think that the preponderance of the value will be delivered in FY 2018, and I think that's consistent with what we've said before, and that's still what we think, Garen. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Fair enough. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'd just add to that, that it does take some months to ramp up the physical side of these relationships, and that was very much the case when we implemented the broader relationship with Rite Aid, for example. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Got it. Thanks again. Operator : And moving on to Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. John, obviously you're closing on the, you have the Rexall business in Canada. You are running retail operations in the UK, and with Health Mart you have obviously kind of a franchise business. Any reason at some point in the future with the way the retail market is consolidating in the US, does that ever create an option for you to branch back into the domestic side, on the US side of the business, into a retail pharmacy? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well I think we've been asked the question before, obviously, and our chosen path in the US is to partner with our customers. And as you mentioned, independents in particular have been great partners and a growing base of our business, particularly the transition of our customer base from just buying wholesale services from us to being partners in the Health Mart business. And that really is a much more intimate relationship and one where the customer benefits significantly from our involvement, and clearly we do as well because they buy more and more of their product and service requirements from us. We have lots of other customers that are very successful in competing in this market, and frankly we just don't see it, an alternative for us to enter the market directly, both that would benefit us, but also at the same time allow us to provide additional benefit to our customers. So I just don't see us entering the retail space directly in the US, but we'll continue to support our customers as we have in the past. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Appreciated. And then as a follow-up, if we look at the regional chains, outside as of the big major retail chains, can you talk about sort of your share in sort of the more regional chains across the US, and sort of what that landscape looks like? And do those tend to be Health Mart customers or when we think about Health Mart, or think about even smaller kind of numbers, owned stores? Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well yeah, you're welcome. Most of the regional chains have their own very strong brands and particularly if they're part of a combination where they're selling groceries or warehousing kind of marketing tools, there probably is little interest for them to use the Health Mart brand. But obviously, we'd be open to them participating with Health Mart any way that we can. I would say the preponderance of our Health Mart stores are independent stores, and they'd be aggregated into regional chain-like setups, but that they would still be small in terms of total numbers of stores per aggregator, if that's the way to explain it. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : And next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good evening. A couple of questions here. First of all, John, can you comment on the discussions, the ongoing discussions with manufacturers on specialty pricing models? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we're very excited about the growth in our specialty business overall. We've made significant strides in building out our value proposition for the customers. You heard us talk about oncology in particular, but in several of the specialties, I think we're very well positioned and the business continues to grow at rates that would be at or above market level. So we are well positioned and we're pleased with the array of services that we provide. Clearly the manufacturer and the customer are both important aspects of driving profitability in that business, and we are continuing to expand the relationships in both directions, and we do believe that the manufacturers benefit significantly by using our services and are willing to pay for those services, because it certainly reduces a lot of the financial and logistics workloads that they have on their laps. So I hesitate to speak universally about a class of customers, but I think our relationships with the manufacturers are very sound and those relationships continue to build. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then a follow-up question on the numbers, just because of the moving parts here. So first of all, James, was the $0.38 in litigation benefit that you talked about on the Analyst Day, did you assume that it will all be captured in the June quarter? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. That was our assumption going into the year. I mentioned back on the January earnings call that it was a single case and that it was quite far along. So that was very much a part of our initial full year guide to you. And then the other thing really just to emphasize is the fact that we also have an anti-trust settlement of substantial scale in Q1 of last fiscal year. So the year-over-year impact from these anti-trust settlements is $83 million versus the much larger figure that we recorded specifically in this Q1. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And when we think about the margin, because obviously for us when we model those operating margin assumptions are important. I think that last year you've given us some guidance there. You haven't this year. So when we think about the quarter, right, in schedule 2, it's 2.28% in Distribution Solutions. If we back out the benefit from that settlement, we get to around I think 2.03%. What should we be using as a base for the remainder of the year? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, just to reemphasize that for the full year, we're expecting the Distribution Solutions operating margin to be in line with that of the prior year. And so yeah, we're obviously off to a stronger start in Q1 because of this anti-trust settlement very much benefiting us in the back quarter, but really the overall story for the year is flat. The other thing I'd just further emphasize again as you think about the first half/second half split is that we'd expect about 48% of the earnings for McKesson to come in the first half versus the second half. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ricky, we can go back and check our guidance at the beginning of the year, but I believe we did give you a margin guidance. It was in line with what we just said, flat for full year, so. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's right, we haven't changed that guide since we initially laid out guidance. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And to make sure that we're all using the same base for 2016, should we use the 2.29% for the year? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's 2.34 percentage points. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So excluding the restructure. Okay. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Right. Yeah, I think that's the way you should think about it. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Operator : And next will be Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America : Thanks. Good afternoon, John and James. Yeah, so I guess for us there's been obviously some discussion in the pharma supply channel this year about lower penetration rates at some of the more recent individual first-time generic launches relative to the brand. Could you just remind us again your observations on that subject and really just specifically, it seems to us that maybe some of those key generics that were in question have now actually achieved some much higher penetration rates with the passage of some additional time this year. Just curious to get your latest thoughts on that subject. Thank you. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, in terms of brand to generic conversions, we went into the year believing that we'd see a lower overall profit contribution than had been the case in the prior fiscal year. And obviously, Crestor has been a big launch early in the year, and based on what we've seen there, we don't have any change in our point of view. We would continue to believe that we'll see a lower profit contribution from these brand to generic conversions. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, there really isn't much of a change in our past experience based on what we're seeing today. And I think there's the best way to sum it up, Steven. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America : Okay. Well and a quick one just on the cost alignment plan progress. I guess that you've dug deeper into your operations. Have you found any new or additional sources of savings, or is everything about as expected with that whole program? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, that's moving along as I expected it to, again, at the point where we last talked about our guidance. So no, it's very much on track as expected. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the charges you're seeing or will see this year are charges we anticipated when we launched the program last year. They just had to be recognized when they were realized, and some of them were going to be realized this year. So it's not a new cost alignment plan, it's a continuation of the one that has already been completed and the financial impact of some of those charges rolled into this year. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, that's right. Some of the charges have to be taken in fiscal 2017 versus the bulk that we took in fiscal 2016. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America : Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks. Operator : And moving on to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. John, I just wanted to follow up on an earlier comment that you made around the branded manufacturer. I'm just curious, as we think about inventory management agreements on your branded business, I think in the past you've talked about 85% to 90% are under inventory management agreements. Are you seeing any changes in that other 10% to 15% as some of those manufacturers come under pressure to have a more firm relationship with the distributor, or a more defined relationship like some of the larger manufacturers do? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think we have not seen much of a change in the big relationships. They remain pretty consistent, and I'd just sort of remind people that even in some of the larger relationships, there is exposure that remains both positive and negative depending on how you look at it relative to their price increase activities. And so when we talk about the year over year change, you can imagine that with that particular manufacturer, we benefited from their previous price increase patterns and in this quarter have benefited to a lesser degree, and that's why we call it out. But if you step back from that specific individual company, we're not really seeing any change to the character of our relationships. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, just looking at the technology side of your business coming in better than at least our expectations in the quarter. I'm just wondering if it beat your expectations and if there's anything notable to call out within that business in the quarter? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we ran through some of the drivers. Obviously, we're very pleased with the progress of the results there, very much a focus on the higher margin businesses, very much lower expenses as a result of the cost alignment plan and so forth. But at the same, there are also some timing items that benefited Q1 that I would expect to revert out in Q2. So I'd just temper the situation with that last thought. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And you heard us in our prepared remarks talk about the low 20% type of margin, which is slightly below obviously what we recorded in the first quarter, which is reflective of us going back to a more normal run rate. But I would agree with you that we see the business performing very well, and it sets us up nice as we think about the completion of our transaction with Change Healthcare. And we think customers in particular and investors will benefit significantly from the combination. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : And moving on to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. So lot of confusion I can sense from my inbox on sort of the implied 2Q guide, and I realize you guys don't typically give a ton of sequential commentary, but I think some of the issue is just sort of off of what base to think about the 48% in the first half. So I just, one, want to make sure we're all talking about the same numbers in terms of which of the two sort of annual forecasts, with or without the CAP we're speaking to, and that we've got clarity. And then, if you could just help us, other than the sequential sort of shift obviously in the anti-trust plus tax, how to think about the progression aside from those two factors. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so the base from which I'm making that 48% first half comment is very much from our guide of $13.43 to $13.93, which is excluding $0.12 to $0.15 of CAP charges. So that's the base from which you should start. In terms of Q1 versus Q2 items, I just mentioned to Lisa the point that I would expect there will be some timing items around the Technology Solutions business. And then obviously, Q1 benefited substantially from the anti-trust settlement, that roughly $0.38 in the quarter, equivalent to a year over year impact of $83 million. And then in terms of the change in accounting around share-based compensation, as we discussed at Analyst Day, that was going to be $0.16 benefit for Q1. And then only another incremental $0.04 over the balance of the year, so just directionally about a $0.01 or so benefit in Q2. So I think those are the important drivers, if you will, of the Q1/Q2 split. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Okay, that was helpful. And maybe just quickly for John, was there anything in either of the two lead candidates for president, the platforms, that you thought was sort of notably relevant for the business? I mean obviously more recently, a lot of was made on Part B and a few other things. But I'm curious if anything stuck out to you that was notable? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think the thing that's most notable is that in both platforms, you hear a discussion about cost and quality at some level. And clearly we believe the healthcare industry is headed on a continued improvement front on both of those dimensions. We need to take cost out of the healthcare system, and we need better visibility to quality, and people are increasingly going to be paid in a way that reflects the value they deliver on those two dimensions. So I think regardless of the candidate that wins, or the party platform that gets adopted, we're trying to help our customers prepare for that environment of more cost pressure, and more inspection of their ability to deliver value. And part of that is also going to require them to collaborate and connect across the boundaries of their individual businesses. So I would say that that theme is the thing that stuck out the most, is that I think the issues that have been raised in the previous administration around these issues, or I should say the interest raised around these issues in the previous administration will continue. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : And next question will come from David Larsen with Leerink. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Can you talk about your ability to move share with biosimilars please and how that may differ from some of your competitors? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well we're pleased with our position in specialties. I mentioned it a few moments ago, and I think that our business has continued to focus heavily on our ability to add value to our customers and deliver through our scale and knowledge a product at an improved value. Clearly, biosimilars produce an opportunity for us to reduce cost and deliver quality to our customers, and in places where we can influence the selection of the biosimilar, we believe we will benefit and our customers will benefit. Clearly part of the challenge biosimilars face in the market is their ability to prove the equivalence of their product compared to the originator. And we think in particular, our US Oncology Network is prepared to work with manufacturers to do the type of work that will be necessary, not only to prove to us that the product produces a similar result at a lower cost, but also provide a beachhead or a benchmark from which other customers can be convinced given the rigor and discipline that our network uses to evaluate these types of opportunities. So I think in some categories we may not have much influence, but clearly in products that are used in clinics or in oncology practices in particular, we're very well positioned to create value for the manufacturers and as a result deliver value to our customers through that relationship with the manufacturers. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Great, and then regarding Omnicare, Optum and Target, we're completely through all of those as of this quarter. Is that correct? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I wouldn't put it that way. I think it's important to note that the year over year headwinds from both generic pricing effects and customer consolidation, the cash grow you're just referring to are very much weighted to our first half of the fiscal year. So once we get into the second half, they're significantly less, but they're very relevant in the first half of fiscal 2017 year over year. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the questions. John, you mentioned the change in reimbursement in the UK. Any chance you could give us a sense or quantify the headwind that that creates in fiscal 2017 versus your previous expectations? And then within international, I know the original guidance was for low double digit constant currency revenue growth. Does that still hold true in light of these reimbursement changes? John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well I'll let (50:19) first question a little bit. The second question you may have to repeat so I make sure I fully understand what it was. On the first one, I think that the second change the UK \u2013 the first change we understood and we saw it coming, and we had prepared our organization to make moves to offset it and to grow through it. And I think the second change was almost equal in its magnitude related to the first change, which was not insignificant, and so the second change is going to be more problematic for us. And that's I think what we're preparing to deal with as we go through this fiscal year. If you step back from those two issues, the Celesio businesses are performing quite well, and in fact, we're making progress in almost every country to improve our market position, our operational efficiency, getting our product service levels up and so on, the technology that's necessary to support the business including moving into areas hopefully like specialty and the hospital business, et cetera, over time. So I think we're quite pleased with the progress of the businesses. I think that the second hit in the UK was not anticipated, and frankly will be a little bit of a headwind for that business this year. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No, and I guess just, John, to the follow-up on that specifically was just previously you guys had talked about low double digit constant currency revenue growth in the international business. I was asking in light of this second reimbursement hit, does that expectation still hold true for the international business's revenue growth? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The significant driver of that double digit revenue guide is really the effect of the acquisitions that we closed a number of them in Q1. We have others yet to close, including the Sainsbury's transaction for example. So really that will be the driver of our ability to execute against that double digit guide. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So it's probably fair to say that the cuts in the UK are not a significant impact on the revenue side of Celesio. So we'd expect those earlier forecasts to hold. It's more of an issue to earnings in that business than it is revenue. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. That's right. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Understood. Thank you. Operator : And moving on to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon guys, and thanks for taking the questions. James, I think if we think about the gross margin pressure, the gross margin erosion, if you were to just kind of bucket it by order of magnitude if we think about the tough comps on generics, how much of it is mix, brand versus generic versus specialty? And how much of it is just kind of the changing of the business mix given the M&A that's going on, I guess? How should we think about kind of the leading drivers of generic pressure, I'm sorry, of margin pressure? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, if you think about the gross profit margin, I would really point you back to the impact on a year over year basis, the impact of generic price increase activity and the customer consolidation issue, particularly on the Care and the Target pharmacies. That's really the most significant pairing that's driving the gross profit margin line. And then the other thing that we've spoken about this afternoon is that branded manufacturer, and the compensation that we happen to have driven from them in this particular quarter. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Compared to prior year. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, I guess then maybe if I step back and I back all this out, if I back out the items in Q1 of last year, and the items of Q1 of this year, would gross margin actually have been up, ex the generic drug pricing impact? Like would margins have actually expanded? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I would say the effect of those customer consolidations had a significant impact on the gross profit line in Q1, and again that factor and the generic pricing increase factor will be significant in the first half of our fiscal year, so in Q 2 as well. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, and maybe just last quick follow-up. John, I know it's early in the process, but any interest in EIS yet, and has that process kind of started to get rolling yet? Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's probably too early to talk about EIS. Clearly, we're focused on making sure we maintain that customer base and continue to develop the product and retain the people, and as we have news to update you guys on, we'll certainly bring it to you. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : And we have a question from Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC : Thanks guys. So just going back to Ross's question, because we're definitely getting pinged as well here. So, I just want to make sure we're kind of all on the same page as we think about \u2013 so if we kind of use $3.17 in 2Q of last year, just backing out the benefits from ZEE Medical, and what the implied is for the second quarter, it looks like potentially down year on-year just in terms of earnings growth in 2Q. Is that just kind of the remainder of the residual impact from this negative comp, if you will, and generic pricing and then we kind of start to lap that to some degree as we get into the third and the fourth quarter? Is that kind of another way to think about it as well? James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, actually yeah. I'd just emphasize again, the impact in both Q1 and we expect in Q2 of the twin effects of the generic pricing environment, the lack of price increases relative to the prior year, and the effect for us of the move of Omnicare and Target away from us. So those are both going to be significant drivers in both Q1 and Q2. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thanks, James. James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well thank you, Justin, for helping us out today, and thanks to all of you on the call for your time today. McKesson is off to a good start for fiscal 2017 and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to driving better business health for our customers every day. I'll now turn the call back to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig? Craig Mercer - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, John. Our preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On September 13, we will present at the Morgan Stanley Global Health Care Conference in New York. On November 8, we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Care Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. We will release second quarter earning results in late October. Thank you and goodbye. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for your participation today, and have a great day.",

Thank you. And here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Before I jump into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to frame our discussion today, as events impacting our second quarter results have implications for our outlook for Fiscal 2017. Let's start with our revised Fiscal 2017 outlook. In particular, we now provide an update to our expectation of a lower profit contribution, resulting from recent customer pricing activities, and lower operating profit as a result of further moderating branded pharmaceutical inflation trends, compared to previous expectations, both of which affect our U.S. pharmaceutical business within Distribution Solutions. As a result of these updates, we now expect $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share, which excludes from adjusted earnings a goodwill impairment charge in our Enterprise Information Solutions business, which James will cover in his comments, as well as estimated charges related to our cost alignment plan that was previously announced in March of 2016. As we built our plan and entered Fiscal 2017, we assumed some moderation around drug inflation activity. In particular, we commented on our expectation for a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price. We also commented that our expectation that branded pharmaceutical price trends would be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016. First generic price inflation has been largely in line with our original assumption. However, customer pricing and branded inflation continue to evolve. In our first quarter, we witnessed some evidence of inflation and pricing softness in line with our original assumptions. However, this softness became much more pronounced in our second quarter, first around brand inflation and later, around customer pricing. While we generally do not provide specific assumptions around customer pricing activity, we do operate in a competitive environment. And though competitive, we've always been focused on delivering value to our customers, value not just defined by price, but by service, innovation that helps our customers partner, manage, and run their operations, and manage their capital more effectively, and innovation that helps our customers connect with patients in a more informed and intimate way. Now, price is always a consideration. We provide our customers with premium value through our superior service and innovation, for which we expect to get an appropriate price. We believe that delivering premium value builds more sustainable customer relationships and long-term shareholder value. Generally speaking, we anticipate pockets of increased competitive activity as part of our normal course of business. What we began to see more recently is competitive activity that is broader than our original expectations, more aggressive, and across several areas of our U.S. pharmaceutical business. As I've mentioned in the past, McKesson manages pricing on a centralized basis, although I think all of our customers believe we've been charging fairly for the service we provide and are willing to pay for this service. When a competitor significantly undercuts our existing pricing, we are compelled to respond. And although we cannot be absolutely assured that recent price concessions will address the recent heightened competitiveness fully, we believe our responses have been appropriate and measured. We remain committed to our careful and thoughtful approach to customer pricing, and to the value we deliver to help differentiate our customers' capabilities and performance, relative to their competitors. We believe the services we provide to both our provider customers and our manufacturer customers offer substantially greater value than what either party could develop with a more direct relationship. And we expect that with our focus on the value we deliver, our margins will recover over time. As for branded inflation, I suspect many of you have tracked the evolving conversation in the U.S. Last month, James highlighted concerns we had around some manufacturers appearing to delay some price increases we would have otherwise anticipated, based on their historical and our historical experience. What we have seen this year to-date, our fewer products with price increases, and those price increases are at lower rates than both prior year results and our expectations for the current fiscal year. Given our second quarter performance specific to branded price inflation, we now expect full-year branded pharmaceutical pricing trends to be meaningfully below those experienced in Fiscal 2016. Let me spend a minute and talk about how we are compensated for branded pharmaceutical product distribution services. Today, all of our contracts with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are individually negotiated, but generally, are constructed around charging for the service we provide. In almost all cases, the charge is derived as a percent of revenue managed and delivered by McKesson for that specific manufacturer. These charges vary not only by manufacturer, but also by the service requirement at the product level. Clearly, revenue-based fees are all affected at some level by inflation. However, in some cases the benefit from inflation is greater, given the specifics and the characteristics of individual contracts, and a specific behavior of the manufacturers that are our party to these agreements. So although a large majority of our compensation is relatively easy to forecast, inflation-based income derived from these relationships can impact our results on a more variable basis. Through these agreements, speculative buying or buying large quantities of product in front of anticipated price increases no longer exist. Essentially, all of McKesson's pharmaceutical purchases are done in partnership with the manufacturer, unlike the industry standard practice years ago, before any contracts presided over the relationships between wholesalers and their manufacturer partners. These changes that happened years ago have translated into more stable inventory levels that are appropriate to meet the customer demands and service levels. So the takeaway here is that branded inflation still plays a meaningful role, and in some cases, it can be an important part of our overall compensation with specific manufacturers, and we can be impacted by their decisions, relative to price increases. Although some contracts with manufacturers may not have specific compensation elements tied to product price changes, our internal branded price inflation assumptions often appear to be directionally aligned with externally published data. But the mix matters. So even relatively small changes in behavior could have a more or less impact on our results, depending on the characteristics of that individual manufacturer contract. We'd like to think we do a superior job of exceeding the expectations of these partners, so there should be even some variability in our industry related to results driven by brand and generic inflations. So what does all of this mean moving forward? It means we expect to receive less compensation from branded price increases than we originally anticipated in fiscal 2017. It means we will continue to monitor pricing activities throughout the year, especially in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is typically an important quarter for price increases. And it means we are engaging with our manufacturer partners to ensure we receive appropriate compensation, relative to the services and value we deliver, amidst a softer pricing environment. Now, turning to our revised outlook for fiscal 2017. We expect the combination of recent competitive pricing and further moderating branded price increase activity will have a combined negative effect on our business by approximately $1.60 to $1.90 per diluted share, versus our July fiscal 2017 outlook, with a larger impact coming from competitive pricing. Turning now back to our second quarter results. In the interest of time, I'll hit a few key themes, and then, we'll hand the call over to James to cover our financial performance. Let me start with the progress we've made on integrating the several acquisitions we closed last quarter, as well as early progress on Sainsbury's, which we closed at the beginning of September. These are important strategic investments that are tracking to our expectations, and contributing positively to our financial performance. We were especially pleased by the stronger-than-expected performance of our Biologics acquisition, which is an important offering to our manufacturing partners in the rapidly growing oncology specialty pharmacy market. Turning now to some highlights within Distribution Solutions segment for the quarter. Our sourcing partnership with Walmart is progressing well. We made considerable progress to date in our efforts to establish the new sourcing function, and we are on track to realize benefits from this new venture in fiscal 2018. We remain confident in our assumption that we will service the Rite Aid business through our current fiscal year given that the acquisition by Walgreens is still pending. We will continue to follow the progress of this transaction as well as any new developments around the opportunity to serve any of the acquired or divested stores. We are making a fundamental change to the structure in terms of our relationship with both providers and manufacturers as it relates to hundreds of specialty products. We are charging separately for the supply chain value we add across a wide array of product categories and manufacturers. Our conversations with customers and suppliers around specialty pricing are proceeding as expected, and we are pleased with the responses we are receiving. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the great work from our U.S. pharmaceutical teams that support our customers every day. We started the fiscal year with the successful onboarding of the Albertsons-Safeway network, another successful ideaShare conference with our independent retail pharmacy customers. And in the second quarter, Health Mart stores were ranked highest overall in customer satisfaction among chain drug pharmacies across the U.S. in the J.D. Power 2016 Pharmacy Satisfaction Study. It's great to see recognition for the positive experiences patients receive every day in these pharmacies. Turning now to our international pharmaceutical distribution and services. As we mentioned in our earnings call last quarter, reimbursement cuts imposed by the UK government to retail pharmacy rates as well as the UK's decision to exit the EU have unfavorably impacted Celesio's operating performance. Despite these headwinds, I'm encouraged by the significant progress we've made to help shape the long-term opportunities we expect are available to us across the European markets in which we operate. In addition to our internal focus strategy, such as Six Sigma training and the standard ERP platform across our many geographies, we are engaged with external stakeholders in productive discussions around services we can offer to state-run health systems, where wholesalers today often play a limited role, or expanding the services a retail pharmacy may deliver to its customers. We continue to make good progress on further developing our opportunities in our European markets. As for our other Distribution Solutions businesses, such as McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, Medical-Surgical, they're all performing very well, showing strong growth and profitability, including double-digit adjusted operating profit growth year-over-year for all of these businesses in Q2. Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm encouraged by the exceptional performance from our Technology Solutions team, even with considerable distractions to support the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare, this segment delivered solid results. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions in support of a strong future with Change Healthcare, while managing the work to retain the Relay Pharmacy business and prepare the EIS business for strategic alternatives. In Q2, we recorded a material non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to EIS. As you may recall, we are considering strategic alternatives for EIS, which is part of our broader Technology Solutions strategy that we unveiled earlier this year. Our commitment has been and will always be to the long-term value creation for our customers, employees and shareholders, and we are confident in the direction we are headed with our Technology Solutions businesses. Now to wrap up my comments. We've spoken for a few quarters about how generics inflation and customer consolidation challenges that we identified last year, which were incorporated into our fiscal 2017 outlook. We've effectively lapped these items at this point in time. However, we recently experienced new challenges around pricing softness in the form of increased competitive pricing activity and lower branded inflation, which I discussed a few moments ago. These new challenges resulted in a lower fiscal second quarter result and a revision to our previous full-year outlook for fiscal 2017 of a $13.43 to $13.93 old range to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. Our business remains structurally sound. We are in the right businesses in the right markets and we bring scale and efficiency to all stakeholders. Our leadership team and I met with each of our business unit leaders earlier this month. These visits reinforce my conviction that we have the best people in the business making the right decisions every day to help our customers lead the change across the healthcare system we serve. We consider it an honor to serve in this capacity and, clearly, our people have the passion necessary to lead through change. The quality and ingenuity of our team give me great confidence in our future. We have a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generation. We are extremely well-positioned to deploy capital and deliver value for our shareholders through a combination of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we're pleased to announce earlier today an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. Today I will first discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook and then review our second quarter results. In addition, I will provide more information related to the pending Change Healthcare transaction prior to John and I taking your questions. Before I get to our outlook, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational view of our fiscal 2017 earnings or adjusted earnings excluding unusual items. We exclude from this view the non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge taken in our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment during the second quarter as well as charges or related reversals associated with the cost alignment plan we announced in March 2016. This view also excludes prior-year gains on the sales of two businesses. To expand on these unusual items, in the second quarter, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million or $1.24 per diluted share associated with our EIS business. Also, in the second quarter, we recorded pre-tax credits of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share related to the cost alignment plan. Now I will focus on our fiscal 2017 outlook. As John discussed earlier, based on our reported earnings and expectations for the remainder of the year, we have lowered our fiscal 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $13.43 to $13.93 to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. This new range excludes approximately $1.31 to $1.33 from adjusted earnings driven by the combination of the EIS goodwill impairment charge and anticipated charges during the fiscal year for the cost alignment plan. Our revised outlook includes the impacts of competitive customer pricing and softness in brand inflation that John just discussed. We expect these two headwinds to drive a combined reduction of between approximately $1.60 and $1.90 to our fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS. We expect the larger of the two impacts to be driven by more competitive pricing. These headwinds will be partially offset by a number of items including savings from ongoing cost management efforts, lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and the effects of our ongoing capital deployment. A listing of the key assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2017 outlook can be found in the supplemental slide presentation on slides 17 and 18. I will not take you through each key assumption on this call. However, I would like to draw your attention to the following significant updates to our revised outlook. We now expect the Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated cost alignment charges, to be approximately 30 basis points to 40 basis points below the fiscal 2016 adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items of 234 basis points. We now expect our interest expense to be down by a mid-teen percentage compared to fiscal 2016. We also expect a full year adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge of approximately 27.5%, which may vary from quarter to quarter. Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per share are expected to be approximately 226 million for the year. And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share. As it relates to the progression of our fiscal 2017 results, we expect that our second half results will be more weighted to our fourth quarter. While we are lowering our guidance today, we are promptly taking steps to address the industry headwinds that we have identified. For example, our cost alignment plan and additional ongoing cost management initiatives continue to bring savings to the company and position us well for future growth. And I am pleased by our strong operating cash flow generation in the first half of the year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to increase approximately 15% year-over-year, excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments related to the cost alignment plan and the settlement agreement with the DEA and DOJ. For the balance of fiscal 2017, we expect to continue to deploy capital in line with all four elements of our portfolio approach. Now, let's move to our results for the second quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.72 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS excluding unusual items was $2.94 per diluted share. As a reminder, our second quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.31 per diluted share included a $0.14 gain on the sale of the ZEE Medical business. For comparison purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS excluding unusual items was $3.17. Now, I will review our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 3% in constant currency. Second quarter adjusted gross profit excluding unusual items was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic inflation trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity and lower compensation from a branded manufacturer, partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and global procurement benefits. Further, as I previously discussed, we also saw softness in certain branded manufacturer pricing activity and, more recently, increased competitive customer pricing activity. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 1% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our cost alignment plan as well as ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted other income was $25 million for the quarter, an increase of 47% in constant currency consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $78 million decreased 14% in constant currency for the quarter. Now moving to taxes. Adjusted tax rate excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge was 25.4%, driven by our mix of income and multiple discrete tax benefits. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items, totaled $669 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS excluding unusual items of $2.94 decreased 7% versus the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million. Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant currency revenues of $49.6 billion were up 3% year-over-year during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 2% in constant currency. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter on a constant currency basis, up 12% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $305 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 4% for the quarter driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, consistent with my previous comments. Second quarter Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase in expenses related to recently completed acquisitions, substantially offset by our cost reduction actions. Distribution Solutions second quarter segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 15% in constant currency at $933 million. The second quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 188 basis points, a decrease of 40 basis points on a constant currency basis driven by the same factors as previously discussed. Technology Solutions revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $680 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Second quarter adjusted segment gross profit excluding unusual items was down 7% on a constant currency basis. Second quarter adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 6% in constant currency from the prior year driven by our cost reduction actions. Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, decreased 10% in constant currency, resulting in an adjusted operating margin excluding unusual items of 20.74%, down 104 basis points relative to the prior year. The reduction was driven primarily by the expected decline of our hospital software business, partially offset by lower operating expenses. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding are flat from the prior year at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased two days from the prior year to 29 days, and our days sales in payables increased six days from the prior year to 59 days. The increase in days sales in payables relative to the prior year is largely due to a steady increase in our generic pharmaceuticals sourcing scale, and the fact that generic pharmaceuticals have longer payment terms than branded pharmaceuticals. We generated $2.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first half of our fiscal year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.5 billion, with $2.9 billion held offshore. In the first half of the year, McKesson paid $2 billion for acquisitions and spent $240 million on internal capital investments. And earlier today, the board of directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, and authorized a new $4 billion share repurchase program. Now, moving to our announced transaction with Change Healthcare. While the transaction has not yet closed, and McKesson and Change Healthcare continue to operate as separate companies, we wanted to provide some updates and clarity around how the transaction will impact McKesson upon a successful closing. We continue to be optimistic that the transaction will close in the first half of calendar year 2017. The assets and liabilities being contributed to NewCo have been reclassified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016. In addition, we expect that our 70% equity ownership contribution from NewCo will be reported in the other income line. This line item will reflect the pre-tax equity income from our share of NewCo. At the time of the close of the transaction, McKesson is anticipated to record a significant one-time gain on the divestiture and related contribution of our net assets to NewCo. Next, I'd like to address the drivers that I previously mentioned that will have an impact on McKesson's EPS results when the transaction closes. First, NewCo will be servicing approximately $6.1 billion of debt with an interest rate of approximately 5% to 7%, thus driving higher interest expense estimated to be between approximately $210 million and $300 million year-over-year, after accounting for our 70% share of NewCo's earnings. Second, as is customary with transactions involving technology companies, we will record fair value adjustments to the contributed businesses deferred revenue, which we expect to reduce reported earnings year-over-year by approximately $150 million to $200 million, after adjusting for our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings. Please note that the deferred revenue range I have provided today is sensitive to our fiscal year-end sales activity. Assuming that the transaction closes on April 1, 2017, the combination of financing costs and accounting-related fair value adjustments is expected to drive between approximately $1.10 and $1.30 in fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS dilution, which will be partially offset by an operating profit benefit, including the first-year synergies from our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings. This benefit will be higher than the amount that the MTS contributed assets would have generated absent our transaction with Change Healthcare. While this transaction will initially impact our adjusted EPS, we continue to believe that the creation of NewCo is very much in the best interest of our shareholders. Working with Change Healthcare, we will drive significant customer and financial synergies. In addition, we have a strong partner in Blackstone with a shared focus on value creation, an agreed-upon path to an IPO and a plan that allows us to exit the investment in a tax-efficient manner. In closing, while we are currently being adversely impacted by multiple market conditions, our talented team focus on both gross profit initiatives and the expense management, strong cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility underpin the confidence we have in our business. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Noah? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good afternoon. So, John, having been covering this company a long time, I can't recall the last time we had a discussion on competitive pricing. And so, I guess what do you think caused that part of the environment to change over the last three or six months? And obviously, the magnitude that you've given is quite large, and so it's a fairly substantial change. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of different constituents talk about drug pricing and all sorts of other things, but this seems actually unrelated. And so help us just understand, one, what you think caused this, how you think the industry will then respond and hopefully heal. And then, secondarily, on your end, I guess how we should put this into context of what has happened historically, if there's anything that you would compare this to. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Let me start with that, Ross. I have seen this, obviously, throughout my career. But we also saw it at McKesson that where, in particular, we took a step function down with pricing. You may recall, I think in the early part of 2008, we had talked publicly about a significant price-related challenge that we are facing now. It happened that year that we were able to fill the margin hole created from that stair step through a unique opportunity to be the sole provider of the H1N1 flu vaccine back then. And that gave us a stream of profitability that allowed us to grow through that challenge. So it does happen from time to time. You'd have to really probably ask the companies involved in it as to why they would pursue price. I can tell you that McKesson doesn't believe you can build sustainable relationships with customers or value for shareholders with a price-oriented approach. And I know that at least one company in our sector has been pretty public about growing revenues above market and about regaining market share, particularly in the independent space. And so I think that certainly people have different motives perhaps to grow their business beyond the market. I would tell you that what McKesson's been focused on, as we've talked about year in and year out, is the expansion of the service we provide our customers and the value that we deliver to create those relationships and expand our margins while we do so. And margin growth comes from solid relationships that are built over time. And from time to time, those relationships can be challenged if the price differential between where the customer perceives the market price to be and what we're asking for become disconnected. So it has happened before. We covered through those periods of time. And like I said, I don't think a price-oriented approach to market share is something that's stable in the end anyway. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : That was helpful. Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. And John, you may have just spoken to it because you called out the pricing pressure, and I wanted to see if you could comment on which market sub-segments are you seeing the pricing pressure the most. It seems like you spoke to independents, but also is it in the independents and the franchisees and the big boxes? I guess any more color on the pricing pressure would be helpful. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thanks for the question, George. I think the most acute area right now is in our independent segment. And clearly, that's a place where you have lots of customers that had long-term relationships, but they also can be fluid. And I think what we've tried to say today is that we plan to maintain our share positions and to grow our business on the value we deliver. And that's really what we're after. The rest of our segments are always competitive, but this is the most material impact we've seen in some time. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just my only follow-up would be from a quantification perspective. You gave us the basis point impact. But is there a way to think about the magnitude of the pricing change in that segment that you're seeing? Quantify that. I'm sorry. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, I think James talked a little bit about the reduction in our expectations and how that split with a larger portion really coming from the price pressure we feel. And so that gives you a sense for the magnitude. And clearly, the independent segment for us is a very valuable and important franchise and we have a lot of business there. So I think that between those comments, you should really get a sense directionally for the size of the challenge. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. John, just looking at the industry, my understanding was always that a bigger component of your margin actually came from the manufacturers versus the customer relationships. So can you talk about what's happening on that side of your business? And our understanding has been that inventory management agreements cover 80% or 85%. What are you seeing in that other 15% to 20%? Is that having a direct correlation on what you're seeing as far as the reduction in earnings as well? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Right. There really are two factors, and I'll have James talk a little bit about the manufacturers in a minute. Because that obviously, when we talk about brand price inflation trends and we tried to quantify once again in our prepared comments how much of this challenge we had this quarter and the forecast for year is coming from that component, we do have some variability that resides in that part of our business. Clearly, the manufacturers that play a very important role for us, and we're constantly working with the manufacturers to make sure that we've identified the value that we deliver and that we're properly reimbursed for that value and we plan to continue to do so. On the customer side, it's not unimportant I think to point out that we do have a nice and profitable relationship with customers on the generic portion of our business. And albeit we may not make much or any on the brand side, the profit stream we get from generic participation as we've talked about before when we were picking up the Rite Aid generic business or the Target generic business. That generic business is a source of profitability, and there is obviously flexibility in how we price those generics. And there's a market for generics. And we have to be responsive to how the market pricing plays for generics. James, maybe you can talk a little bit about the manufacturer side. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. In terms of when we came into the year, we were assuming that the level of brand manufacturer or pricing inflation would be modestly below what we had seen in the previous fiscal year. And today, we've updated that tight commentary to now being meaningfully below what we saw last year. To try to perhaps put a little bit more quantification around that, I would say that the delta, if you will, between the rate of inflation that we expected and the one that we have seen thus far year-to-date is greater than a third reduction versus our original expectations. The other thing I would comment on in terms of the brand income, why this inflation rate is important is that there is both a fixed component and a variable component of the income that we receive from branded manufacturers. Now, a year or more ago, we were talking about that being a roughly 80%, 20% type split in terms of the fixed component of the equation versus the variable component. In part, the contracts have evolved. But also in part as inflation rates have come down in the last few months, I peg that split more at 90%, 10%. 90% of our income is fixed, 10% is variable. But obviously, that 10 points is still being able to have a meaningful impact on the financials that we've been talking about today. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : James, can you help us understand what the actual rate of inflation was last year, when you say you expected it to be down, but now it's meaningfully down? Is there a number you can put around that? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: I wouldn't throw out a specific number, but that's why I articulate, the decline that we have seen in the inflation rate is greater than a third of the original expectation for the year. So it's a significant decline. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I think, Lisa, also, when we look at what we come up with from a calculation perspective on branded inflation, it's plus or minus what you'll see from published sources of inflation. But it is also important to point out that those averages sometimes don't necessarily tell the whole story, because of the mix, or the relationship, or the individual products that are going up or going down in the portfolios can be materially different. And so I do think the economics aren't always necessarily driven with the direct correlation to the average price increases that everybody talks about. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS. Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon, guys. I'm going to take this in a little bit of a different direction. I just want to clarify relative to the Change Healthcare deal. James, if you don't mind going back over it, so you said, I believe, $1.10 to $1.30 of dilution from the deal, offset by some other estimate. So is that $1.10 or $1.30 a net dilution deal number to the entire business, or is that offset by those benefits, in which case we're on our own to make the assumptions on that front? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. So you should think of the $1.10 to $1.30 as the combined effect of the two items that I discussed. The impact of the deferred revenue and then the impact of the higher interest expense on $6.1 billion worth of debt. So wanted to put quantification around those two items. Then, the other comment I made was getting at the reality that as we're actually operating the business and starting to drive the synergies, the EPS that will drive from the contributed assets, if you will, our share of NewCo will be greater than the ability of those assets, absent our deal with Change Healthcare, to drive EPS. So there's an accretive effect, if you will, on that element of the equation. As you would expect, when we come together and drive synergies in a deal. But there are also going to be these two large, very distinct items that will drive dilution, the interest expense and the deferred revenue, haircut you could call it, and that those two items total to this $1.10 to $1.30 range that I mentioned. Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. I know this is a complicated transaction. I appreciate the color. I'll let other people ask some other questions. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess to that, James, do you have any growth forecasts for each of the businesses, EIS and the others? I don't think I see them anywhere. And just maybe, can you speak to the inventory environment? I know last year you scaled up inventory meaningfully in the third quarter. This year you liquidated some. I mean, does that not account for some of the profit shortfall? I know you say you don't do it, but isn't there some opportunity associated with that practice from a profit standpoint that maybe fell out of the model? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: There was nothing unusual in the third quarter. You would very normally have an inventory build as you come into the winter season. So no, I wouldn't point to anything odd around inventory management. Our cash flow was obviously a bright spot in our numbers here, and that was very much a result of ongoing working capital management initiatives, these sorts of things that have been going on at McKesson for years as well as our underlying operating profitability obviously as well. But the working capital initiatives have been important focus for us, and we'll continue to have that. The first part of your question, the technology businesses, I wouldn't get into specific growth rates around EIS or any particular segment of the business. Overall, we feel as though our technology segment is performing very nicely, they're very much where we expected them to be at this point in the year. Even though there, as John mentioned in his remarks, is plenty of work going on around setting up the new company or preparing to set up the new company, so we've been pleased that they've been able to maintain their focus. And so we feel good about the trajectory of those businesses generally. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And just a clarification. James, you did liquidate inventory in the September quarter of this year that did not scale up. Is it just a combined effect of all the businesses resulted in a modest reduction? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. What I was observing is, in Q3, you would normally have an inventory buildup as you go into the winter season. So yes, that's right. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All right. Thank you. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the questions. Yeah, John, I guess like others I'm surprised to hear you highlight competitive pricing, just given how rational the industry has been for so long. And I guess if I take a step back, this year alone, we've seen the negative impact to profitability from generic pricing, moderating. Now, we're talking about a slowdown in branded inflation. Is there any thought that those dynamics themselves are what are forcing your competitors to maybe go harder after market share to make up for what seemingly would have created a shortfall in profit? And then, I guess more importantly, how sustained do you think this competitive behavior could be? Do you think this is more of a one-off, a few accounts that they went after harder, or do you think this could potentially be a more lasting changing dynamic? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I think those are all good questions. I think that the best way for me to answer them would be the way we think at McKesson. I can't speak to how our competitors make their decisions or how they make their pricing calls in the industry. I can tell you that McKesson is focused on retaining our customer base and creating additional value for our customers as I talked about before, and charging a fair price. And on that fair price idea, there is plenty of headroom in terms of the value we deliver to the industry that we don't charge for. And as I've seen in the past when \u2013 we have faced pressures like this, where there's been a reduction in product launches or other things happen, with some of the profit pools become more difficult. What typically we would attempt to do is reduce the level of incremental discounts that we pass on to our customers when we're in those discussions. But clearly, that conversation isn't successful if there are alternatives that are providing something that is even more significant. My best hope is that we demonstrate to our customers that they're going to always get a fair price from us, and in return, they're going to get superior service and tremendous focus on their success. And that's where we plan to stay. And I know at McKesson, at least, we think growing market share through a price-oriented approach ultimately will not be successful, because customers don't want a change. Our customers, when they get a better deal, come to us and say, hey, listen, can you match this deal because I'd like to stay with you. And so that customer pressure to remain with us because they like us always provides McKesson an advantage when we're in these discussions. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. I'll leave it there. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Co. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious, James or John, when we think about the reduction in guidance for the year, can you give us a split, maybe, between how much you think is coming from the customer side, versus how much is from the brand inflation side? Is it half and half or...? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. So a couple of points. In terms of the negative effects, I would say it's the competitive pricing having a greater impact than the brand manufacturer price inflation rate. But also, remember that we offered $1.60 to $1.90 range for those two items. We're bringing the overall company range down by less than that because we've got tailwinds in our view around our tax rate, around our share count, around our interest expense and so forth. So that's going to drive the delta between the two ranges that we're offering today. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then to just follow up on the brand inflation side. Obviously, I think most people coming in would have thought, hey, the elections are a factor driving this. How are you guys thinking about it as we move into next year post-elections? Obviously, a lot of spotlight on Congress right now on this topic. How are you at this point thinking about \u2013 do you think it bounces back, or do you think this is maybe the new normal and we have to wait for the anniversary? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think the view we have is sort of a year-to-date view. We have the same information that you have and probably the same visibility. And we're just guessing as to what manufacturers are likely to do going forward like everybody else. They control their pricing decisions, and we don't have much visibility into anything, other than their historic behavior. And their historic behavior, obviously, has been rising over the last several years. And if you go back before the more recent years, there's always been a level of \u2013 at least in our data, always been a level of inflation that has occurred. And you do hear some manufacturers talking today about having a policy around how much inflation they think they should be able to provide to the industry over time. Some of them are making those statements more publicly than others. And clearly, there might be some near-term changes in their behavior that will be different over the longer haul. We do think that innovation requires profitability. We think the lack of new product launches in the face of generic conversions causes pressure to branded manufacturers and that they ought to have the ability to raise price appropriately on branded drugs to help fund their R&D requirements and their profitability requirements. And so I think that a common person's view would be that you'd still see inflation at some levels. I think that the outer bounds of inflation that had been experienced in the past by our industry, that we've had conversations about in the past, are probably likely to not exist anymore. So I just think those heavy outliers on both brand and generic, those outliers will come in, which obviously will have an effect. But, yeah, it's probably a little bit early to speculate. And I think as we get through the rest of this year, we've given you some assumptions about directionally where we think it's going to be the balance of this year. As we get into the next fiscal year, we'll give you a sense for where we think it's going to be. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Is it possible to renegotiate these contracts on the fly, or is it you have to wait as the terms come up? And I'll stop there. Thanks. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think anything is possible. We typically have renegotiated the contracts when they come up as opposed to whenever we're under significant pressure. I think that we always have the opportunity to go back to manufacturers and demonstrate once again the value that we deliver. And in particular, where manufacturer's behavior has changed dramatically from its previous behavior and we had come to depend on those mechanisms as part of our funding source with that manufacturer, I think we have every right to go back to those manufacturers and say, listen, we need to open the dialog again because by your unilateral decision, you have significantly impacted our profitability on your particular product lines and we don't think that's fair and we want to recover that lost margin. So I think that that certainly is something we plan to pursue. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good evening. So a few questions here. First of all, just to clarify, John, when you talk about inflation being meaningfully lower, I hear you saying that year-to-date you're seeing greater than a third reduction. And I think going back to past comments, I think you saw 12% last year for your fiscal year. We're getting to around fiscal year 7% year-to-date. But when you think about the December quarter and the March quarter, which usually has a lot of inflation, in your assumption are you assuming that the second half you're going to see that same reduction that you've seen year-to-date? Or are you assuming some acceleration in that given that all the commentary we're hearing about the industry trying to self-regulate? I'm just trying to better understand are you clearing the decks here with this $1.60 to $1.90? Or could there be potentially more downside if in the second half of your fiscal year brand inflation decelerates even more? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: James, why don't you... James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Ricky, to answer your question very directly, what we've assumed for the back half of fiscal 2017 is a continuation of the inflation rate that we have experienced year-to-date. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So basically the same type of price increases that we've seen year-to-date to continue for the next couple of quarters. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yes. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then when we think about the sell side pressure that you're talking about, is that a number that we can take and annualize into next year? And I think my point being is that, obviously, it's a (57:26) and when we think about the margin implication. Is it fair to assume that you just repriced that portion of the contracts that are perennial for this year, or have you also gone proactively to your customers and locked in contracts that are going to come up in the next year or two at a new pricing level? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think those are, obviously, both good questions. I think to the point that James is making when he answered it a moment ago, we typically see stronger price inflation as you get into our third and fourth quarters. And so when we say we're guiding on a year-to-date basis, that already tells you that we believe there'll be some moderation in those quarters relative to previous behaviors. On the sell side, it's a little bit more difficult to make projections because we're basically in a position where we are reacting to some extent and not being the people that are making the decision. I think that our view is that we have made a very significant change in our pricing practice to match where the market is today. And we, like I said to answer another question that was asked, we have seen this kind of event happen in the past as well and we didn't see a continuation of the event. And our objective is to continue to maintain our market share. So I think we believe we provided guidance that has reasonable expectations from that perspective and that you can count on the range. That's one of the reasons that the range is somewhat wider, though, is it's somewhat dependent on what happens going forward. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So I think that one of the things that we are all trying to get a better sense of is when we think about fiscal year 2018 and I fully understand that you're not guiding to 2018 and there are a lot of moving parts, but is it reasonable for us to take that $1.60 to $1.90 in EPS impact that we're going to see in the second half of the year and just use it as a run rate for fiscal year 2018 just for these two components? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, at this very early stage, Ricky, it's really I don't think it's appropriate for us to try to make any predictions about FY 2018. So I think really we should leave that for closer to the start of that fiscal year. And we'll, obviously, be getting into our guidance process as normal. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'm just assuming all steady state, right? So if you're seeing the step-down in your sell side margin, traffic to the EPS impact is going to just slow through... James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. No, I... Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I guess that's the question right now. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: I understand the logic. It's just hard for me to take a position on FY 2018 at this very early stage. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, I think it's a difficult question to answer. But I think \u2013 I did try to at least bound the conversation around customer pricing, in that this is a pretty significant step-down, and we believe that that allowed us to maintain the relationships with our customers, given what was a pricing environment where we were higher-priced than where we needed to be, and that has occurred, and it's baked into the guidance that we have provided you, in terms of the range that we just refreshed. Now, I think to James' point, it's pretty early to speculate on what branded inflation might be next year, and what else might happen with our customer base. But we tried to give you as much visibility as we possibly can. I know you guys are on a short timeframe. Let me close this call, if I can, and let you know that \u2013 I know you share with us the disappointment in today's news. This is not what we had expected, and certainly not what we want. But despite this downward revision to our outlook, we do believe in and remain committed to the value we demonstrate every day to our customers and our manufacturing partners. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, we believe the increased competitive pricing activity does not build sustainable customer relationships or long-term shareholder value, and we are all about sustainable relationships, and creating long-term shareholder value. And we're supported by McKesson's great tradition of customer focus, operational excellence and disciplined execution. And our talented workforce, robust cash flow generation, and strong balance sheet position us for the long-term value creation that we strive to obtain. We remain as committed as ever to our value proposition. And I'll now hand the call off to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig? Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On November 8, we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. On January 10, we will present at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, California. We will release third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you, and good-bye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

I would now like to introduce Mr. Craig Mercer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Craig Mercer : Thank you, Noah. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 6 :00 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the Company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and James will reference adjusted earnings, which excludes four items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Finally, I would call your attention to the supplemental slides, which we will reference on today's call, and those can be found on the Investors' page of our website. We believe the supplemental slides, which include non-GAAP measures, will provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2017 results and the supplemental slides, for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you. And here's John Hammergren. John Hammergren : Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Before I begin my review of our third quarter results, I\u2019d like to take a few moments to share my thoughts on a number of recent topics. During January, we\u2019ve heard from the new administration of the prospect for planned changed to the U.S. Healthcare System as well as potential tax changes. We are all interested in these topics yet it is extremely difficult to provide any kind of assessment on the impact of reform as we don\u2019t have solid details on what those changes will be as we sit here today. We look forward to engaging in the dialogue regarding these issues that may impact our industry, our business and the customers we serve as proposals evolve into real policy positions. There are many moving pieces to reform and we will continue to monitor and assess the potential impacts of any proposals as we receive more information. Moving now, we are pleased to have announced today that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CoverMyMeds. CoverMyMeds mission is to help patients get access to the appropriate drugs for their care. Their service automates and accelerates the prescription approval process known as electronic prior authorisation, which is otherwise manual and time consuming. CoverMyMeds takes administrative cost out of the system which supports patient help through drug adherence, manufacturers by reducing prescription abandonment and providers and payers through automation and appropriate patient access to medications. CoverMyMeds products today streamlined a prior authorisation process for 47,000 pharmacies and 700,000 prescribers in the nation\u2019s largest health plans. The Company has partnered with McKesson\u2019s RelayHealth Pharmacy business since 2010 to expand its reach and offer its capabilities to a broad customer base. As a reminder RelayHealth Pharmacy is a connectivity network providing real time claims, processing and other services to more than 50,000 retail pharmacy locations. Together, CoverMyMeds and RelayHealth Pharmacy can develop even more innovative tools for manufacturers, pharmacies, patients, payers and prescribers and continue to take administrative costs and inefficiency out of the healthcare system. CoverMyMeds, RelayHealth Pharmacy and our other pharmacy technology businesses underpin our strategy to differentiate and add value to our distribution solutions business. As a reminder, RelayHealth Pharmacy will remain with McKesson following the close of the transaction to the Change Healthcare. We are also making good progress on a couple of other important transactions. First on December 20, the Department of Justice closed its review and terminated the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act bringing us one step closer to the creation of the new change Healthcare. Key leaders have been named and they are building up their teams as well as the support structure to allow the new business to meet the demands of its customers from day one. Management expects to raise the necessary financing and close the transaction later this quarter. We will provide additional updates after the transaction closes. Additionally, we are pleased to have closed the Rexall transaction and the integration work is underway. I look forward to working again with Domenic Pilla, who will assume overall leadership responsibility for McKesson\u2019s distribution and retail businesses in Canada, including Rexall Health. Some of you may remember Domenic. He previously spend 10 years leading McKesson Canada from 2001 to 2011 and then built his retail expertise running Shoppers Drug Mart through its successful sale in 2014. I want to welcome the thousands of employees to joining McKesson on this new exciting opportunity. Last we are very excited about the progress we\u2019ve made early on in launching [Claris 1] our sourcing activity with Wal-Mart. That organization is up in running and expanding our capabilities for suppliers. Our objective is to enhance our great partnerships with manufacturers and look for innovative ways to create value for all stakeholders. Turning now to our recent financial performance. In our U.S. pharmaceutical business as a result of the generic pricing actions we began to implement late in our second quarter, we won back units and retained our independent stores. However, our prices were ultimately set at a lower level and our initial expectations that were included in our previous guidance. As a result, we\u2019ve realized a lower contribution in the current quarter from this part of our business. And although branded pharmaceutical pricing trends were weak in the third quarter relative to our expectations, full year contribution from branded pharmaceutical compensation remains on track with our revised expectations that we shared with you last quarter. Additionally, we incurred a few non-recurring charges in our distribution solutions segment that resulted in lower than expected operating profit contribution. James will go through those in a moment. As for our other North America Pharmaceutical businesses we continue to realize strong growth and we are making solid progress integrating Biologics, Vantage and Rexall. Moving onto our international operations despite meaningful U.K. pharmacy reimbursement cuts that we previously discussed I am pleased with the constant currency revenue growth reported in the quarter. Our U.K. business continues to be impacted by reimbursement actions taken by the government. However, our teams are diligently working to offset and grow through these changes. I\u2019d also like to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous contributions by Mark Owen over his past 15 years with McKesson. From leading our enterprise strategy to most recently heading up our operations in Europe. Mark will retire at the end of this fiscal year, so we are preparing for the transition of responsibilities to Brian Tyler a 20 year veteran who has served leadership positions across nearly all of our distribution solutions segment including most recently as President and Chief Operating Officer of Celesio working with Mark. And last in our medical surgical business despite some revenue softness from the termination of a long term care customer and a weaker impact from the flu season, I am encouraged particularly by the progress we are making to expand our presence in the fast growing lab in Homecare businesses. Now for technology solutions, we again posted strong performance relative to our expectations in prior year, even amidst all of the work underway to prepare for the changed Healthcare transaction. I commend the team for their focus throughout these events and I look forward to a strong finish to a very productive year. Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2017. Upside from our share repurchase activity in the quarter combined with a lower effective tax rate more than offset the lower than expected full year contribution from our distribution solutions segment. Based on these updates we now expect our full year outlook for fiscal 2017 to be in a range of $12.60 to $12.90 compared to our previous outlook of $12.35 to $12.85. Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson is a company that has seen a significant change over its more than a 180 year history and we\u2019ve built a resilient company, a business that focuses everyday on the success of its customers and the efficiency of the Healthcare system it serves. As we look to the future, we see significant growth prospects and it put in place the right assets in the right markets to take advantage of these opportunities. For example, McKesson now operates its scale and is highly efficient in every segment we serve. Our diverse set of global businesses are well positioned to take advantage of over arching demographic trends. We believe that retaining control over our global procurement and sourcing capabilities is key and we have built comprehensive capabilities to capture growth in specialty. We have a large and growing footprint in retail. We have a strong value proposition to partner effectively with manufacturers and to service our customers including meaningful pharmaceutical technology solutions. Across McKesson there is an experienced and long tenured management team and finally we continue to expect robust operating cash flow growth that is deployed in a disciplined approach and focused on long term shareholder value creation. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James Beer : Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our third quarter results and discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook. In addition, I will provide updates with respect to our recently closed and announced M&A transactions. Before I get to our results, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational view of our fiscal 2017 earnings or adjusted earnings excluding unusual items. We exclude from this view charges or related reversals associated with the cost alignment plan that we announced in March 2016. This view also excludes the non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge taken in our EIS business within our technology solutions segment during the second quarter, as well as prior-year gains on the sales of two businesses. Now let\u2019s move to our results for the third quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $3.03 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS excluding unusual items was for $3.05 per diluted share as we recorded a $0.02 charge related to the cost alignment plan. Now I will review our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues for the third quarter increased 6% in constant currency versus the prior period. Third quarter adjusted gross profit excluding unusual items was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the increased competitive customer pricing activity we discussed last quarter. The timing of branded manufacturer inflation and the expected weaker profit contribution from generic manufacturer inflation trends partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and organic growth in our specialty and Canadian businesses. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses excluding unusual items increased 2% in constant currency, driven by recent acquisitions, partially offset by our ongoing cost management efforts. Other income was $26 million for the quarter, an increase of 93% in constant currency, driven primarily by our equity investment in [Indiscernible] a pharmacy operator in the Netherlands. For fiscal 2017, we now expect other income to increase approximately 50% year-over-year. Interest expense of $74 million decreased 15% in constant currency for the quarter, consistent with our prior expectations. We continue to expect interest expense for fiscal 2017 to be down by a mid teen percentage compared to fiscal 2016. Now moving to taxes, our adjusted tax rate was 14.3% for the quarter, driven by the beneficial impact of an inter company sale of software, a mix of income and discreet tax benefits. Expanding on this sale, in December McKesson sold various software and ancillary intellectual property relating to our technology solutions segment to a U.S. based McKesson entity. This sale allows McKesson to claim tax deductions for the fair value of the assets and recognize the resulting tax benefit in our P&L over the estimated remaining lights of the assets. As a result of this sale and excluding the EIS impairment charge taken in the second quarter, we now expect a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 2 4.5%. I want to caution you that fiscal 2017s expected adjusted tax rate is not an indicator of our future expected adjusted tax rate. Going forward, I would expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be closer to 30%. Our income attributable to non controlling interest excluding unusual items was $14 million for the quarter. We now expect income attributable to non-controlling interest to increase approximately 20% from fiscal 2016. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations excluding unusual items totaled $677 million. Our third quarter adjusted EPS excluding unusual items of $3.05 decreased 4% versus the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, during the quarter we completed share repurchases of common stock totaling $2 billion resulting in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreasing by 4% year-over-year to $222 million. As a result of the share repurchase activity in the third quarter we now expect our weighted average diluted shares for fiscal 2017 to be approximately $223 million. And we now have $3 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorisation. Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant currency revenues of $49.9 billion were up 6% year-over-year during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter on a constant currency basis, up 10% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $440 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were down 1% for the quarter, driven by the termination of a long term care contract and a weaker impact from the flu season. For Medical Surgical, we now expect low to mid single digit revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 8% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by the increased competitive customer pricing activity we discussed last quarter. The timing of branded manufacturer inflation and the expected weaker profit contribution from a generic manufacturer inflation trends, partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and organic growth in our specialty and Canadian businesses. Third quarter Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 3% on a constant currency basis. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase related to recently completed acquisitions, partially offset by our cost reduction actions. Distribution Solutions third quarter segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 23% in constant currency at $815 million. The third quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 163 basis points, a decrease of 61 basis points on a constant currency basis driven by the same factors as previously discussed As John mentioned, the segment adjusted operating profit results include two non-recurring charges. Together, these total approximately $68 million. We expect our Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated cost alignment charges to be approximately 35 to 40 basis points below the corresponding fiscal 2016 figure of 234 basis points. Now moving to Technology Solutions. Revenues were flat for the quarter at $694 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business, offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Third quarter adjusted segment gross profit excluding unusual items was up 7% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 4% in constant currency from the prior year driven by our ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, increased 25% in constant currency, resulting in a corresponding adjusted operating margin of 23.92%, up 476 basis points versus the prior year. The increase was driven by growth outside of our hospital software business, and lower operating expenses. We continue to be pleased by the ongoing execution of our technology solution segment as we work to close the change healthcare transaction. I\u2019ll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you\u2019ve heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing including which day of the week marks the close of the given quarter. For receivables, our days\u2019 sales outstanding were little changed at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased two days from the prior year to 31 days, and our days sales in payables increased five days from the prior year to 59 days. The increase in payables days sales relative to the prior year is largely due to a steady increase in our generic pharmaceuticals sourcing scale, and the fact that generic pharmaceuticals have longer payment terms than branded pharmaceuticals. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion, with approximately $1.8 billion held offshore. For the first nine months of the year, McKesson paid $4.2 billion for acquisitions, repurchased $2 billion in common stock, repaid approximately $390 million in long term debt and spent $369 million on internal capital investments. We now expect property and acquisitions and capitalized software expenses to be between $550 million and $650 million in fiscal 2017. And earlier today, the board of directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. The cash been generated $3.3 billion in cash flow from operations during the first nine months of our fiscal year. In this quarter alone we deployed more than $4 billion on acquisitions and share repurchases. For the full-year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to increase approximately 15% year-over-year excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments released to the cost alignment plans and the recent settlement with the DEA and DOJ. Now I will focus on our fiscal 2017 outlook. Relative to our prior expectations, our third quarter earnings were favorably impacted by the lower-than-expected tax rates. We now expect a full-year adjusted tax rate excluding the EIS, goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of a 24.5%, a decrease of 3% points from our prior expectation. In addition, we now expect the weighted average diluted shares for fiscal 2017 to be $223 million following share repurchase activity in the third quarter compared to our previous expectation of $226 million.  These tax and share cap items will drive upside of approximately $0.65 of earnings per diluted share for the full-year. As a reminder, during the third quarter we recorded non-recurring charges that are approximated $60 million which will impact our full-year. And as John discussed, while our pricing of generic pharmaceutical in our independent pharmacy channel has helped us retain share, our pricing is now set at a level lower than our previous expectations. As a result, we expect the profit contribution from these customers will be reduced versus our previous guidance. Regarding the brand manufacturer pricing environment, pricing remained weak in the third quarter as discussed at a recent investor conference. However, we have seen activity in January that is in-line with our previous full-year expectation of mid to high single digit brand manufacturer price inflation. And lastly, we expect our distribution solutions adjusted operating margin excluding anticipated cost alignment charges to be approximately 35 to 40 basis points below the corresponding fiscal 2016 figure of 234 basis points. As a result of these updates, we have raised and narrowed our fiscal 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $12.35 to $12.85 to a new range of $12.60 to $12.90. This range excludes approximately between $1.28 and $1.30 from adjusted earnings driven by the combination of the EIS goodwill impairment charge taken in our second quarter and the anticipated charges during the fiscal year for the cost alignment plan. A list of the key assumptions underpinning our updated fiscal 2017 outlook can be found in the supplemental slide presentation on slide 17 and 18. Before I wrap up my comments on our fiscal 2017 outlook, I also wanted to mention the while not yet a material contributor to our current earnings, we are pleased by the progress we are making in establishing Carrollton our sourcing initiative with Walmart. Now, I would like to take a moment to discuss our recently closed and announced M&A transactions. First, we closed the Rexall transaction in late December. As a reminder, for fiscal 2017 we expect the earnings attributable to Rexall Health will be offset by an anticipated charge related to a fair value adjustment of acquired inventory. Now, moving to our announced acquisition of CoverMyMeds. McKesson has ended into a definitive agreement to acquire CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion or approximately $900 million net of incremental cash tax benefits. An additional $270 million will be paid if CoverMyMeds reaches certain performance matrix through fiscal 2019. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including end trust approval and is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2018. We expect the transaction will be funded by a mix of cash and debt. By the third year, following the close of the transaction, we cast an expect attrition of $0.30 to $0.40 to adjusted earnings per diluted share. This transaction will complement our other distribution solutions technology businesses such as a Relay pharmacy and our McKesson pharmacy technology and services business which are both core to executing on our strategy. Given the double digit growth opportunities we see for these businesses, I believe they can drive combined revenues of approximate $1 billion and become a material contributor to McKesson's operation profit growth within three years. Moving now to the pending change healthcare transaction. We expect the transaction will close this quarter and at that time we expect to record a significant one time gain on the contribution of our net assets to change healthcare. This gain will be excluded from our adjusted earnings. In addition, McKesson will receive $1.25 billion of cash at closing. Due to the numerous moving pieces that are involved in the transaction of this kind, we will provide more detailed information following its close. To be clear, McKesson's current fiscal 2017 guidance range of $12.60 to $12.90 assumes a full quarter of MTS earnings. In closing, we are actively engaged in planning for the next fiscal year and we'll provide our fiscal 2018 outlook and underlying assumptions when we announce our fourth quarter earnings in May. Thank you and with that I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others opportunity to participate. Noah? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the question. I guess John I am still struggling on to understand a little bit the magnitude over the last two quarters from the negative impact from branded pricing specifically. If we think about some of the comments previously about 10% to 20% of branded contract being linked to non-fee per service just having trouble bridging the reduction given from the last few quarters. So, I was hoping maybe you could just walk us through a little bit of how we bridge that gap around the EBIT within pharma distribution and the reductions from last quarter and now, this quarters? John Hammergren : Well, I will turn it over to James to start out though, I think we have done some really good work over the last several years to make sure we have the right balance of fixed compensation and variable compensation for the branded manufacturers and that work continues and I believe now the split of our profit from the branded partners is roughly in that 90 :10 kind of a range. So we have reduced the exposure to both the risk and the opportunity here. And but having said that it still remains a material amount of our profitability to your point and we knew that there was going to be some risk in this quarter related to our back-half guidance but we hope that the fourth quarter was going to be stronger than certainly the third quarter in line with the guidance we provided you on the last call. And that's really I think what we are seeing today is that our from full-year perspective based on January we believe we are going to have the back half performance that we had anticipated. James? James Beer : Yes. I just had that in Q3 the profit contribution from branded manufacturer price inflation was really quite weak. That was real holding back in terms of manufacturers taking price increases and that certainly held was a material driver in our Q3 EPS result. As John saying, we are seeing a different situation playing out in Q4 thus far so our expectation is when you look at the back-half and then the full-year, we are able to continue to forecast what we had said previously about branded inflation being in that mid to high single-digit range. So, certainly a soft Q3 but it appears to be stronger in Q4. Robert Jones : Great. And I guess just the follow-up related to the reduction in the quarter or the short form a quarter related to pharmaceutical distribution. It sounds like John if I heard you correctly the pricing on independent ended up ultimately being a little bit lower than what you guys has assumed last quarter? I guess what drove this and is there still what you would describe as maybe outside pricing pressure in the marketplace around that customer segment? John Hammergren : Well, I think you have the first half of that assumption correct. It ended up being a little lower than what we had built into our previous guidance and when the price for our customers was set at the end of the quarter we ended up producing less profitability than we had anticipated but clearly the units we covered and our relationship with our customers improved as we went throughout the quarter. So, I think we have got that issue behind at this point at least today and I think it's just a question of making an estimate early in the quarter when we are still in the process of implementing our reaction to those pockets of increased competition. James Beer : And then the other day I were just -- reinforced the third quarter that impacted the results were these two non-recurring items that I referred to in my text, the total $60 million in profit contribution. So, that was certainly an important drive as well. Robert Jones : Got it, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Velazquez with Bank of America. Steven Velazquez : Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess just for us, you guys absolutely don't normally break out any sort of operating profit by geography but just thinking about the side the distribution solutions was down by 24% year-over-year in the quarter. Share me the comment at sort of high level from when thinking about US versus Europe. Was the decline in the US more or less than that 24% average and then also just thinking about some of the moving parts in a year or two? I guess we're all just curious how geographically things shook out just between those two when thinking about the average. Thanks. James Beer : Well, as you mentioned we don't break out the profit by geography. I think the way to think about it is that we had gone into this fiscal year with a view of what might happen from a reimbursement perspective in the UK and then we very quickly realized that UK reimbursement environment was going to be more difficult. And I think ourselves and others talked about the challenge that put in front of us and I think we have done a really good job of now understanding what that effect is on that business and working hard to offset it to grow and to grow through it. I think the thing that became surprise obviously at the end of the year here for us in the back-half was both these onetime items as well as the view that independent generic pricing environment was going to be a bit difficult for us. I don't, I think other than that it's probably difficult for us to provide you more nuance guidance other than cleanly having two markets that are significant to us being negatively impacted simultaneously and then in addition having the inflation environment and brand being below what we had expected at the beginning of the year both played into it weaker than we had expected certainly quarter end and obviously the year as well. John Hammergren : And I would just add that while obviously we have seen those challenges in the UK market around reimbursement, we haven't seen similar things playing out in other European countries for Celesio, those have been tracking very much along the lines of our expectation during the year. James Beer : Yes. We are happy with the growth in those markets. I think the team is beginning to expand beyond just sort of the retail pharmacy business into other areas of opportunities or encouraged by that and the acquisitions we have made have been well executed and are delivering that real value. So, we talked about the revenue growth on the call but you look under the covers if you take out the UK reimbursement challenge, the business is performing well. Steven Velazquez : Okay. I appreciate, just a color, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Good afternoon. So, just turn to a waterfall app on the prepared comments, you talked about the weaker trends on generic inflation but when we think about these trends, where they environment with what you expected when you provided the guidance at the end of the second quarter or in generic deflation environment deteriorated throughout the quarter as well? James Beer : Well, I'd say couple of things. The way that we have been seeing generic inflation playing out obviously that's on a very small subset of the overall molecule base that has continued to be in line with our expectations very similar, so the story of the last couple of conference calls. John Hammergren : In terms of the generic deflation environment which is obviously the norm in this part of the marketplace across the across the complete sways of molecules. We continue to gain see nothing as normal here that's having material impact on the business model, so very much adequate system with what we have been saying overall this year. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then with all the uncertainties around manufacturer's ability to raise brand prices and questions on whether 2nd July price increase can ultimately happen. Since it's shifting all the revenues, see for service and removing this contingency on price is increasingly more relevant. So, one can you talk about where you are in this process. I know John that you have talked about it in your prepared remarks but if you can give some more details. And second of all, if hypothetic be branded manufacturers are after only one price increase in the calendar year, how should we think about this when we model? Should we then model and I know that I'm stealing into 2018 question but should we hypothetically then think about a September core is where good profits would be down 10% year-over-year if no price increases happen this quarter? Just conceptually how should we be thinking about that and how we can assess that kind of like embedded risk or that bare case scenario? James Beer : Well, I think to your first part of your question, we are working actively with the manufacturers to make sure that we have our line of sight to the economics that are appropriate for the service that we provide. I think the manufacturers very much appreciate the work that we do and certainly have a willingness to fund our business model and to help us manage their business in a way that's more efficient frankly for them. And so, we are excited to continue to play that role. And with many of our manufacturer relationships, our economics have been properly set for a long time in the vehicle that we have been using to be paid. And that is risky as a price increase vehicle might be as the method by which we would be paid the piece that we deserve. And so, to your point, to the extent that we have been dependent on price increases as a funding mechanism with a manufacturer who is no longer on their own taking those price increases will certainly go back to them and because of that behavior change, worked and negotiated a relationship that gives us as I said our compensation. On the second front, it was difficult for us to predict when manufacturers are going to have price increases. Whether they are going to have one or two or more, what the rate of increase will be, are they say going to, if they say they're going to have one and they are going to have all the ones at the same time or are they going to have multiple on these products at different times of year or different products at different times during the year. So, I think it is a little bit of black box to your point. From a modeling perspective, it's probably a little premature for us to give you a view as to how we are going to think about the quarterly progression of our profitability and clearly when we are on our conference call in May to the extend we have better visibility we will try to help you not only understand that the risk we still have in our model which we try to outline at the beginning of every fiscal year with our assumptions but we'll try to also try to help you understand how price increase behavior quarter-to-quarter may create variability or risk. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay, thank you. James Beer : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi. Garen Sarafian : Good afternoon John, James. Following-up on a prior question regarding independent pharmacy price and to further clarify, could you discuss the current market alignment that you are seeing. So, has pricing stabilized, was any of the downside related to additional actions by either the competitors or which was just your only in the midst of the process we made an estimate or any other factor that you could elaborate on, would be appreciated. John Hammergren : Clearly we have great visibility to our customers demand from us and we have a great visibility to the mix of products that they order and just the relationship overall. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, with our customer base, we saw our recovery in both units and frankly added to it related to their long-term partnership with us and we've retained our relationship and our business for those stores. That's an indication that the pricing decision that we made in the quarter and talked about in the previous call was appropriate and then the price that we set at the end of the process in the quarter was the appropriate price otherwise we would have not seen that customer retention or that unit recovery. So, I hesitate to say that pricing isn't a fluid environment but we typically don't see these large pockets of price competition in our basic customers and we seemed to have resolved that with the actions we took earlier in the quarter. And I think lastly what I would say is that I think the estimate we made early was more informed as we got through the process and it was more of an estimate as we started the process and so to answer your question about continued heightened or unusual competition in our independent customer base we believe has largely subsided because of the actions we take. Garen Sarafian : That's useful. And then a follow-up on the branded drug that you mentioned that you are now at 90 ton breakout. So, within that 90% that fee for service, do you typically build in any flexibility into those types of contracts where you be relatively not that to either net or gross pricing or any cause to revisit the contracts, certain situations occur? John Hammergren : First of all, I'd like to maybe clarify a point about the contracts being 90 :10 as opposed to the income being 90 :10. So, when James and I talk about 90 :10 ratio on profit from branded manufacturer, that's really how the dollars result out of those relationships. We shouldn't take it to mean that 90% of our contracts are fixed and 10% of our contracts aren't. Garen Sarafian : Absolutely, I misspoke. Correct. John Hammergren : And secondly, we have an ongoing discussion with our partners as you might imagine. And it is a good relationship and I believe that the dollar value of the service we provide is where our conversations typically are focused. Now it's obviously drive by a multiple of revenue or throughput through our business but the dollars are what fund are activity. And so, if there were to be a dramatic change in the way our partners price their products and your description is going from the gross price to a net of rebates price, we clearly would only be happy if we could cover the same dollar result out of that new matrix as opposed to a different kind of relationship. So, I think that the likelihood of that happening number one is slim and second if it were to happen we currently would actively renegotiate our contracts to create a mirror image result that we have today with the different set of multipliers or factories involved. At least that\u2019s where I would attempt to reconcile. Garen Sarafian : That's very useful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good afternoon, John and James. James let me just start with the first question around the non-recurring items that you called out for $60 million. 1) Did I just miss all the commentary what they are for 2) and if they were included in this quarter does that help to explain the progression as we get into your guidance for or the implied guidance for drug distribution in the fourth quarter? James Beer : So, the $60 million with the two items recorded in Q3, so yes that's the an important element in bridging through to the full-year guide. So, that is something I particularly do want to emphasize. That's correct. Lisa Gill : Can you tell us or give us little more color what they were for? James Beer : One was a resolution of a customer contract that had related to a variety of years going back in time so certainly something that I think of as a onetime type item. And the other was an accounting reserve that we believe was appropriate to take again around receivables in the certain segment of the business within distribution solutions. So we feel as though we are being appropriately conservative around those reserves. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. And then just to think about a topic as we think about going into the fourth quarter John, you discussed a ton around this in your dynamic, in the independent market but I just want to make sure that I understand in the third quarter we saw all the pricing impact so when we think about this progression from the third quarter to the fourth quarter independent stays the same the pricing on branded looks a little bit better because it's coming in within your expectations versus the third quarter was below we don't have these onetime items as we go into the fourth quarter and I think that you commented also again correct me if I am wrong that generic price deflation is also roughly within your expectations, but we also see [Claris 1] start to impact the numbers in that fourth quarter? John Hammergren : Pretty a good bunch of questions Lisa, but let me start, I will have James jump in if I miss something. Clearly there might be a little bit of a tail of continued lap negative on the independent pricing just because as I mentioned our estimate on the last call was slightly higher than where it actually netted when we set the price and that netting process probably left us a month or weeks off in the full quarter effects in Q3 if that makes sense to you. As you go into Q4 there is a little missing hole there on that net price affect on the independent business. The branded price inflation I think that is, what\u2019s early in this quarter to call it but I would say that we believe that on the back half guide for branded price inflation we are going to be in pretty good shape. We didn't have much in our expectations around generic price increases and then we had these onetime items that James referred to a few moments ago. James. James Beer : And in Claris 1, I wouldn't expect that to be material contributor in Q4. I think that will help us in FY 18. Lisa Gill : Okay great. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I know this hasn't come up yet, well it has come up, but James can you quantify or I guess provide any kind of sense of severity around what was the step down in the [selfie] pricing versus what you thought was at the end of fiscal 2Q versus where it came in the end of fiscal Q3? James Beer : I am not again to sort of offer a specific guide around that as John was alluding to the expect, it's going to be at the sort of the full run rate in Q4 and we saw significant majority of that same effect in Q3, but there was a certain movement downward during the quarter after we had last spoken to you on this call. George Hill : Okay. And then maybe just kind of a quick follow-up on just kind of one more on this topic is that if most of the impact was observed in fiscal Q3, I guess fiscal Q2, Q3 and Q4 then there is - there is a little bit of lapping impact that takes place early in fiscal \u201918 and then it's kind of fully behind us from a comp perspective. I want to make sure that I am not missing something either in the contracting methodology or in the pricing methodology or the pricing impact of this is able to be contained and then margins expand again it's kind of the pricing that\u2019s, the pricing is occurred with the segment of the market that those profits have kind of been extracted here and have been passed through the customer. That's not something that returns to us? John Hammergren : So, I would expect the lapping effect that you are referring to in the first half of the year just a little bit into A Q3 as well because system was what I was saying just a moment ago. James Beer : And George, I think some people probably don't fully understand that we priced the generics, every day we are pricing generics. So to forecast where the generic profitability will for our customer base next year is probably difficult. Obviously, Clais 1 will have an effect on us from a buying perspective and we set our sell prices on the generic space so that our customer get a competitive price and a fair price but that is a bit of a moving target I don't want you to think that our pricing has been \u201clocked in\u201d and sometime form us a lake way, it really is responsive to market conditions. George Hill : Okay that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Hi, good afternoon. So I realize you are not going to give us details on 2018 in terms of guidance in general. But, from a methodology standpoint given the volatility we\u2019ve had in results this year and given some of the challenges in forecasting some of the specific factors, is there any thoughts just sort of whether it\u2019s from a transparency or in terms of other things you all give us sort of help understand the trajectory. Any thoughts on sort of the methodology of whether or not you intend to sort of guide as you typically do and provide many of the same metrics or do you think now that with some high data is there other things we should be looking at to get a better sense. Because it does feel like there is a lot going on in the business right now. It's kind of hard to ascertain Q to Q kind of the flow of where profits are going? John Hammergren : I am certainly sympathetic to the difficultly in terms of understanding the dynamics of our business. I think that I will let James jump in here little bit on the whole forecasting and what we might provide you in terms of view as we get into next fiscal year. I will say however that the business is always complex and they are lots of moving parts to it and they always have the lots and moving parts. The challenge that we have this fiscal year in particular is it that the moving parts are moving negative on us simultaneously and usually you have things that are offsetting in the business so we don't end up with as you said the challenge and forecasting because we have generally offset some of the negative things with more positive things and unfortunately this year we haven't had that type of dynamic. James Beer : Yes, I would just add that obviously was still going through however FY 18 planning process. As I think about the discussions we have had on these three conference calls of this fiscal year obviously we\u2019ve ended up having to talk about different things in a more detailed manner to be able lay out the underlying drivers of the results and we will take that perspective into how we think about discussing our guide as well. So I think that does logically expand the variables that we have traditionally talked about when we have done the May earnings calls just because we have been expanding all the discussions during the last three conference calls with you. Ross Muken : And that\u2019s helpful perspective and I guess obviously executing quite a bit share repurchase in the quarter you saw quite a bit outstanding but you also have a lot of cash cutting in and you have the proceeds from change I mean obviously you guys have always done a portfolio approach. Is there any bias to share repurchase medium term still just given where the stock is and how you compare that to kind of the external opportunities or you still see a ton in the pipeline that you feel like it can give you more superior returns than buying your own stock today? James Beer : Well, we certainly continue to light the portfolio approach to capital allocation that we have deployed for a number of years. Obviously in the last quarter, we did a goodly amount of both M&A as represented by the rightful transaction as well as share buyback. Today we have announced the acquisition of Cover my meds. So, I think that's an illustrative we continue to see opportunities to deploy capital to M&A that we believe can generate long term cash flow profit growth and build the strategic capability of the company. That said, we aptly through the cash flow generation and that's of course giving us more flexibility to take advantage as I think we have in this last quarter with a quite large share buyback action. At a time we are not stocks trading at a relatively low multiple. Ross Muken : Great, thanks James. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS. Michael Cherny : Good afternoon guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but I think there was a question while back around your conversations with manufacturers and how that's changing the [indiscernible] changing pricing dynamics. I guess John, overtime you mentioned the relationship you guys have, is a value for value rationale, you guys are true partners. As you think going forward, as you go back to have these conversations, what are the key selling points that you are focused on offering them particularly environment where these manufacturers continue to get questions about their pricing environment and how do you think about the incremental value proposition above and beyond what you guys have done for the last 10-20-30 or 100-80 years with these various different companies? John Hammergren : Well clearly, we are trying to build our capabilities so to your point the value proposition we delivered to them hopefully year in and year out is increasing in value. And frankly the Cover my meds discussion we had in the beginning of this call is a very positive example of where we are deploying capital to help our manufacturers particularly the branded manufacturers the revenue side of their P&L which frankly is probably a lot more important to them then the basis point side of their P&L where they pay us and I think that - the ability for us to get people on their meds to reduce the friction associated with getting prescription filled and to keep people on their meds after they have been prescribed and to reduce the administrative cost associated with payers and pharmacies dealing with patients and physicians who are trying to get prescriptions filled will be very helpful and has proven to be very helpful. And clearly, we have done the same thing on our U.S. oncology business where we are no longer just necessarily a commodity wholesaler trying to sell oncology products, but we are a company that can truly partner with the physician to change the character of their practice and the profitability of their practice. So, you will see us continue to do that and on the specific issue of the fee structure with manufacturers, clearly if we have been working alongside them for years and developed a relationship around being paid through price inflation, I think it's fair for us to go back and ask them when they have changed their behavior not related to us to go back to them and ask them to pay us a different way if they are no longer going to use our price increases as the funding mechanism for their wholesale relationship. So, we are going to be successful as rapidly as we want and we are going to be 100% successful not yet to be seen but that clearly is our objective adding more value and making sure that we strike a bargain where they can feel fair the composition we have asked for is fair. Michael Cherny : Thanks John. I know, it\u2019s odd time, so I appreciate the color. John Hammergren : You are welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Robert Willoughby : Just a quick one for James, you mentioned that you would comment on the changed healthcare transaction upon closing. Is that sometime inter-quarter as you mentioned or will the comments really on the guidance and the contribution come with the May conference call? James Beer : No, I would expect that we will be closing the transaction during this quarter and it will be appropriate to update you at that time. Robert Willoughby : Okay, press release then and call or just press release? James Beer : Well, I am not sort of those details, so it maybe a press release. We will see how things play out in the next three or four weeks. John Hammergren : And certainly, we don't have a public call. Obviously, the IR team is available to help address questions if it's not clear from the press release. Robert Willoughby : Perfect. Thank you. John Hammergren : I want to thank you, I know, for your help today and I want to thank all of you on the call for your time today. We continue to focus on the success of our customers and the value we deliver everyday and we look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2018 outlook when we provide you our fourth quarter earnings results in May. So thank you and good-bye. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Craig Mercer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Craig Mercer : Thank you, Melisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter and full year. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 6 :00 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the Company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, our fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings, excludes four items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition related expenses and adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Also, James will discuss our operating performance further adjusting for the impact of net charges associated with the cost alignment plan that we announced in March 2016, as well as the non-cash pretax good will impairment charge which is related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment during the second quarter. For fiscal '16, we excluded the income sales of two businesses. Consistent with how we\u2019ve discussed our fiscal '17 results in prior earnings calls, which reconcile adjusted earnings to adjusted earnings excluding these unusual items, the supplemental presentation is useful in reviewing the fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016 results discussed today. In connection with the issuance of our fiscal 2018 outlook and in consideration of investor feedback, benchmarking relative to superior companies and in line with management's view of our operating performance, we are revising our adjusted earnings definition. The revision will principally exclude gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments including asset impairments and gains or losses on disposal of businesses or assets. We filed a second 8-K with the SEC today, which includes the full text of our revise definition of adjusted earnings, as well as the recap of quarterly and full-year of fiscal 2017 results. This will allow you to compare our fiscal 2018 outlook to our revised adjusted earnings for fiscal 2017. For reference, slide 14 of the supplemental presentation provides a visual walk from fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS to adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items. Then it bridges that measures to the fiscal \u201917 revise adjusted EPS. We believe the earnings press release, supplemental slides and the recap of 8-K which all includes non-GAAP measures, will provide useful information for investors with regard to the Company's underlying operating performance and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to these materials, which may be found in the investor section of our Company website, for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you. And here's, John Hammergren. John Hammergren : Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I'm pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across both of our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions segments. James, will cover our annual financial performance in greater detail. But let me provide some color on the year just concluded. If we recall, as we entered fiscal 2017, we were working hard to mitigate headwinds resulting from moderating generics inflation and customer consolidation. During fiscal \u201817, we implemented a cost alignment plan to achieve improved efficiencies and realize materials savings across our enterprise. We announced a new sourcing partnership for generics with Walmart. We entered into a plan with Blackstone to create a new scaled healthcare technology business, and we announced several acquisitions intended to, among other things, expand our retail footprint and broaden our specialty capabilities. We successfully executed against each of these major initiatives, which were transformative in nature and better position to Company for long term growth. However, we did not anticipate the sizable additional headwinds we experienced around pricing for branded pharmaceuticals in the degree of sell side price competition for generics, particularly within the independent retail pharmacy channel. Let me take a moment to provide an update on those two topics specifically; first on branded pricing. Throughout the past year, there has been increased pressure on manufacturers in the pricing decisions they make, which led the lower inflation levels than we had originally assumed in our fiscal 2017 outlook. However, it is important to note that in the fourth quarter, the compensation that we earn we earned it from brand pricing changes, was largely in line with the expectations that we shared during our last earnings call. As we entered into a new fiscal year, we\u2019ve assumed a mid-single digit rate of brand inflation, less than what we experienced in fiscal 2017. We believe this level assumed inflation is appropriate given the degree of uncertainty around branded pricing and a reality that we\u2019re not involved in setting drug prices. Switching now to generic pricing, while the rate of price changes in our generics pharmaceutical portfolio has varied from year-to-year, we\u2019ve historically experienced deflation, which we define as a reduction in our cost of acquiring generic drugs from the manufactures. For McKesson, our multiple drivers of generic deflation, which included competition, supply and maturity of launched products and our sourcing efforts, the rate of deflation is specific to McKesson\u2019s generic product mix, customer mix, ongoing negotiations and relationships with manufactures and our specific fiscal year. We consider it to be unique and proprietary and thus do not disclose rated deflation for our generic purchases. An additional factor impacting generics is a sale price environment. We operate in a competitive marketplace and the competitive nature of generics is a function of market based pricing. If you recall that in the first half of our fiscal year, we saw increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes for McKesson. Overtime, we\u2019re able to recapture that loss volume and retain our share after adjusting our sell side pricing. Consistent with our update, last quarter, we continue to see a competitive market for selling generic drugs in the U.S., and less pricing variability within this customer segment. In the end, it was important that we were able to recapture our volume, but is even more significant to retain and build upon on our longstanding relationships we\u2019ve established with customer base. This included expanding our Health Mart franchises past fiscal year, adding hundreds of new stores. Next, we\u2019re pleased with the progress of our -- next, I would like to discuss our relationship with Walmart. It was a year ago that we announced Claris 1, our now operational collaborative generic sourcing initiative with Walmart. I am very encouraged with the remarkable progress we\u2019ve made in the short amount of time. Walmart is largely realizing these initiatives benefits from this initiative. And we\u2019re now progressing on discussions with manufacturers based on our joint volumes from which we expect to realize and share in additional synergies. We are encouraged by the ear success of this initiative, which demonstrates how our sourcing expertise delivers significant value. But we are optimistic that we will identify expanded opportunities to partner with Walmart in the future. Next, we\u2019re pleased with the progress of our multi-year initiative to implement differential pricing for brand generic, specialty, bio-similar and OTC drug classes in line with the services we provide to both our customers and manufacturer partners in all of these five categories. We continue to address these important changes as we work through our contract renewal cycles. Moving on to Change Healthcare, I want to thank the current McKesson teams who worked so diligently to successfully launch this new organization. And I want to also thank our former McKesson employees who recently joined a new Company for their ongoing commitment to a thriving healthcare technology enterprise. This dedicated team of individuals successfully delivered on a challenging fiscal '17 Technology Solutions business plan while simultaneously contributing to the closing of the Change Healthcare transaction. I thank them all and congratulate them on their success. Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss McKesson's role in public policy. Our policy decisions are being evaluated, and McKesson continues to engage as a key stakeholder in educating policy makers, addressing issues that may impact our industry and our business and our customers' business, and helping to drive the necessary change to support access, quality and affordability for a sustainable healthcare system. We continue to engage in dialogue with policy makers as proposals evolve towards legislation. We remain confident in McKesson's path forward, the critical role, the services we provide to the healthcare industry today and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to healthcare systems globally. In closing, our fiscal 2017 was certainly a tough year and we faced multiple material headwinds that impacted our U.S. pharmaceutical business. I was encouraged by a number of things during the year. First, despite industry challenges, the underlying operating performance of the U.S. pharmaceutical business was improved through our focus on operational excellence and best-in-class customer service. This business is growing and is well positioned. Next, absent the material UK reimbursement cuts we've previously discussed, Celesio's business has performed nicely. In addition, we completed multiple acquisitions during the year, which had helped to expand our strong platform for growth. For Canada, the business grew nicely in fiscal 2017. And we completed the acquisition of Rexall, expanding our retail pharmacy footprint in Canada. And in medical surgical, we delivered another year of solid growth and substantially grew in the lab space, complementing our non-acute service platform. Overall, we continue to build the competitiveness of our broad portfolio of businesses, which allowed us to mitigate some of the very material industry challenges we encountered during the year at U.S. Pharmaceutical. I'm extremely proud of this management's team ability to adapt and maintain a constant focus on building the strength of our customer and supplier relationships, which will continue to drive growth and long term value creation for our shareholders. Last, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their dedication, leadership and consistent focus on putting our customer success at the forefront of everything we do. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and we\u2019ll return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James Beer : Thank you, John and good afternoon everyone. As John discussed earlier, we are pleased by our strong results in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $3.42 per diluted share which gives us a solid momentum heading into fiscal 2018. I also want to highlight our record operating cash flow in fiscal '17, which allowed us to return more $2.5 billion in cash to our shareholders during the past year. Today, I will review our fiscal 2017 results and introduce our fiscal 2018 guidance range. Before I discuss our fiscal 2018 outlook, I will spend some time walking you through the changes to our definition of adjusted earnings. Now, let\u2019s move to our 2017 results. As I have a lot of information to cover today and we want to provide ample time for Q&A following my remarks, I will primarily focus on our full year fiscal 2017 results. First, our consolidated results. As a reminder, the fourth quarter and full year revenue and operating results of MTS were impacted by the creation of the Change Healthcare joint venture, as announced on March 2nd, to which McKesson contributed the majority of its MTS businesses. McKesson will account for its equity share of Change Healthcare\u2019s earnings on a one-month lag. Therefore, for the month of March, McKesson\u2019s consolidated income statement contained neither the results of the MTS contributed businesses, nor any equity earnings from the new company. Consolidated revenues for the full-year increased 5% in constant currency versus the prior period, primarily driven by market growth and acquisitions. Full year adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 2% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by increased competitive pricing in our independent pharmacy business and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, partially offset by contributions from acquisition closed in fiscal 2017, antitrust legal settlements, greater global procurement benefits and organic growth. Full year adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 2% in constant currency driven by acquisitions closed in fiscal 2017, partially offset by savings from the cost alignment plan and ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted other income was $101 million for the year, an increase of 63% in constant currency, driven primarily by our equity investment in [indiscernible], a pharmacy operator in the Netherlands. Interest expense of $308 million decreased 13% in constant currency for the year consistent with our expectations. Now, moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate, excluding cost alignment plan charges and the impact to the EIS goodwill impairment charge taken in the second quarter, was 22.6% for the year, driven by the beneficial impact of the on-shoring of our MTS intellectual property in the third quarter, our mix of income and discreet tax benefits. Our income attributable to non-controlling interest or NCI was $83 million for the year, an increase of 60% in constant currency. The increase in NCI was primarily driven by Claris 1, the joint sourcing entity that we have created with Walmart, and the acquisition of Vantage Oncology. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding unusual items, totaled $2.9 billion. Our full year adjusted EPS was $11.61 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $12.91 per diluted share. During the year, we recorded $0.04 charge related to the cost alignment plan and in the second quarter we recorded a non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charge of $1.26 related to our EIS business. Wrapping up our consolidated results, during the fourth quarter, we completed share repurchases of common stock totaling $250 million, bringing our total share repurchases in fiscal 2017 to $2.3 billion. As a result of share repurchase activity, particularly in late fiscal 2016 and during fiscal 2017, our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 4% year-over-year to $223 million. Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant currency revenues of $197.1 million were up 5% year-over-year. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 4% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by brand to generic conversions. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $26 billion for the year on a constant currency basis, up 11%, driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $1.2 billion in unfavorable currency rate movements. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 3% for the year, driven by the market growth and acquisition. Distribution Solutions adjusted growth profit, excluding unusual items, was down 2% on a constant currency basis for the year, driven by competition in our independent pharmacy business and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing, partially offset by contributions from acquisitions closed in fiscal 2017 antitrust legal settlements, greater global procurement benefits and organic growth. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 6% on a constant currency basis for the year. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase related to recently completed acquisitions, partially offset by savings from the cost alignment plans and ongoing cost reduction actions. When removing the impact of acquisitions, adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased year-over-year. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 11% in constant currency year-over-year at $3.9 billion. The segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 200 basis points on a constant currency basis, a decrease of 35 basis points, driven by the same factors as previously discussed. Now, moving to Technology Solutions. As a remainder, our MTS segment for fiscal '17 reflects only 11 months of results for those businesses that were contributed to change healthcare. Revenues decreased 9% for the year to $2.6 billion on a constant currency basis. Adjusted segment gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 5% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 11% in constant currency from the prior year. Despite realizing only 11 months of results from the contributed MTS businesses, adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, increased 4% in constant currency, resulting in an adjusted operating margin rate of 22.33%, up 295 basis points versus the prior year. We're very pleased with the performance of the Technology Solutions segment in fiscal 2017 as the team works simultaneously to execute their business plans and close the Change Healthcare transaction. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our day sales outstanding decreased one day to 27 days. Our day sales in inventory decreased two days from the prior year to 30 days. And our day sales in payables increased two days from the prior year to 61 days. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.8 billion with approximately $2.3 billion held offshore. For the year, McKesson paid $4.2 billion on acquisitions, repaid approximately $1.6 billion in long term debt, spent $562 million on internal capital investments and paid $253 million in dividends. In addition, McKesson repurchased approximately $2.3 billion in common stock in fiscal 2017 and we now have $2.7 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In fiscal '17, McKesson generated $4.7 billion in cash flow from operations, inclusive of the $256 million in cash outflows related to the cost alignment plan and our settlement with the DEA and DoJ. The year-over-year growth of approximately 29% was primarily driven by several working capital initiatives across our U.S. businesses and lower cash taxes. To wrap up my fiscal 2017 comments, while McKesson face significant challenges during the year, I'm pleased with how we were able to manage through adversity, drive strong cash flow and end the year in a solid financial position. Now before I get to our fiscal 2018 outlook, let me take a moment to discuss the revision to our definition of adjusted earnings. After careful consideration, we have made the decision to revise our definition of adjusted earnings effective with our fiscal '18 outlook. We believe this revision will allow us to provide better clarity on our underlying operating performance as it closely aligns with both how we internally manage the enterprise and the definition used by others in our industry. Let me walk you through the changes at a high level. First, the revised definition retains the amortization of acquisition related intangible, LIFO-inventory related charges or credits and acquisition related expenses and adjustments; although, this category has been expanded to include certain fair value adjustments. An example of a fair value adjustment is the expected non-cash deferred revenue haircut in fiscal '18, resulting from the Change Healthcare transaction. Second, the revised definition will now adjust for gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments, which will include impairments, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or assets and the full month standalone category of claim and litigation charges or credits. The restructuring charges that will be excluded are represented by programs such as the cost alignment plan or other restructuring programs that are considered significant. And the other adjustments category will exclude items such as the EIS goodwill impairment charge we took in the second quarter and gains from sales of businesses, such as the two differences we sold in the fiscal 2016. Again, these adjustments are intended to provide investors a better view of the underlying operating performance at McKesson. I encourage you to review the second 8-K that we filed today for the full description of each item included in our revised adjusted earnings definition, as well as the re-cost of our fiscal 2017 results, utilizing this revised definition of adjusted earnings. Before I wrap up my comments on adjusted earnings, I want to confirm that as you would expect we will continue to provide all the GAAP information that we have historically provided, including the reconciliation of our adjusted earnings to our GAAP earnings. Now, let me provide you with the details of our fiscal 2017 results on this revised basis. In order for you to drive the year-over-year performance we expect in fiscal 2018; then I will provide details on our fiscal 2018 outlook. I will point you to slide 14 of the supplemental presentation, as it provides a fiscal 2017 EPS walk, but includes reconciliation from adjusted earnings excluding unusual items of $12.91 per diluted share to our revised adjusted earnings. From the $12.91 per diluted share, we will now exclude the benefit of $144 million or $0.39 per diluted share in antitrust supplements recorded in fiscal 2017, and $15 million or $0.04 per diluted share in gains on asset dispositions. We will also exclude two headwinds; first, $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share in fair-value adjustments; and second, $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share in restructuring charges. These adjustments result in revised adjusted earnings of $12.54 per diluted share for fiscal '17. Now, turning to our fiscal 2018 outlook. In fiscal 2018, McKesson expects adjusted earnings per diluted share of $11.75 to $12.45. This guidance range reflects a decrease of 6% to approximately flat adjusted earnings year-over-year. To be clear, the fiscal 2018 outlook excludes the negative impact of the non-cash deferred revenue hiccup from the Change Healthcare transaction, which is now expected to be approximately $200 million, as it will be excluded from adjusted earnings based on our revised definition. In lieu of outlining each of the assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2018 outlook, I will refer you to the list of the key assumptions included in the press release we issued today. Instead I will walk you through the key items included in our outlook. First, I\u2019ll start with the overall market environment. We expect Distribution Solutions revenues, which are primarily derived from North America, to grow in the mid-single digits year-over-year, driven by market growth and recent acquisitions. In the U.S. market, branded pharmaceutical manufacturer prices are tuned to increase by a mid-single digit percentage in fiscal 2018. This is a more conservative assumption than the results from fiscal '17. As we do not make these pricing decisions and because there may be variability in the timing, frequency and magnitude of pricing actions taken by manufacturers, we believe our assumption of mid-single digit price increases is prudent. On the generics side, we expect a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals with increase in price in fiscal 2018, consistent with what we experienced in fiscal '17. We also expect the profit contribution from the launch of new oral generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S. market to be nominal year-over-year. As John mentioned, our overall basket of generic pharmaceuticals generally declines in price overtime, reflecting competition, supply, the maturity of launched products, and outsourcing efforts. And for the sell side pricing environment, we see the marketplace was competitive or with less pricing variability, consistent with our remarks on our last earnings call in January. Moving onto Rite Aid, as mentioned in our press release, our guidance range assumes a full year revenue contribution from Rite Aid of approximately $13 billion, and an estimated annual adjusted earnings per share contribution of between $0.20 and $0.40. Given our understanding of where things stand today with the pending merger agreement, we feel confident that we would not see volumes transition in this calendar year. If Rite Aid\u2019s volume were to transition in early calendar 2018, this will only have a small impact on our FY18 adjusted earnings per diluted share; although, we would expect a material one-time transition impact to our cash flow, driven by the mix of our business with Rite Aid. It is worth noting that our ongoing domestic and international sourcing scale is such that the potential loss of Rite Aid's volume was not meaningfully hold up our sourcing economics with manufacturers. Now, let's move to our expanded sourcing agreement with Walmart and the mechanics of Claris 1. We announced our joint souring relationship with Walmart in May 2016. Since that announcement, McKesson and Walmart have worked to build out the new sourcing organization, Claris 1. This new organization first, focused on harmonizing pricing across our respective sourcing arrangement. This was completed late in fiscal 2017. Walmart is likely realizing the benefits from this initiative, and we are now progressing on discussions with manufacturers based on our joint volumes from which we expect to share additional synergies. That being said, because McKesson has control of Claris 1, we consolidate the results of the entity. You will see the full results of Claris 1 in our consolidated P&L, including revenues, gross profit, operating expense and operating profit. We then remove Walmart\u2019s portion of Claris 1 earnings via the non-controlling interest line, which appears below net income in our P&L. However, it is important to note that the economics from Claris 1 included in the NCI line represents only a portion of the overall value of the expanded relationship with Walmart, as a majority of the joint sourcing value is realized in the cost of goods sold line. This COGS value is directly recognized in the accounts of McKesson and Walmart, and is not a part of the Claris 1 accounts. The non-controlling interest line now removes three items from our net income; Walmart share of Claris 1's earnings; the retail dividend; and partner income associated with other smaller non-wholly owned subsidiaries. We expect our income from non-controlling interest to increase approximately 200% from fiscal 2017. Now moving to our international segment. We expect percentage revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. In addition, we expect the international business to be impacted by additional UK reimbursement cuts; although, at present, the announced incremental cuts that will impact fiscal 2018 are materially smaller than what we experienced in fiscal '17. We will keep you up-to-date on this as the year unfolds. Based on the assumptions outlined, we expect our Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin to be between 198 and 208 basis points. The way to think about our fiscal 2018 adjusted operating margin is that our adjusted operating profit will benefit from our organic growth, the impact of FY17 acquisitions and the profits of our joint venture partners, such as Walmart in the case of Claris 1, which have consolidated in our results in accordance with GAAP. The margin rate is further aided by our revised addition of adjusted earnings and the inclusion of RelayHealth Pharmacy. Partially offsetting these positive items on margin rate will be impacted by our growing mix of higher priced specialty pharmaceuticals, assumed weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends and the lapping effect of increased competitive sell side pricing. Moving now to McKesson\u2019s equity investment in Change Healthcare and other MTS considerations. We expect the adjusted equity earnings contribution from Change Healthcare to be between $370 million to $430 million, which reflects our 70% ownership. To be clear, we\u2019re assuming that our equity interest in Change Healthcare will not be diluted by the impact of a potential IPO. The MTS segment also reflects the contribution from our EIS business, which is expected to generate full year revenues of between approximately $450 million and $500 million, has an adjusted operating margin rate in the single digit range. We continue to make progress on reviewing these strategic alternatives for this business. Now moving to corporate expenses, taxes and our share count. Corporate expenses are expected to be between approximately $435 million and $465 million in fiscal 2018, primarily driven by our technology investments and incentive compensation programs being reset to target expectations. The guidance range assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 27%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. This rate is reflective of the ongoing beneficial impact of an inter-company sale of software in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Our mix business and the impact of minority interest earnings that are included in profit before tax, but are not taxable to McKesson. We expect the weighted average diluted shares for fiscal 2018 to be $213 million, which reflects the impact of share repurchase activity completed in fiscal 2017. In addition, we expect a negative foreign currency impact of up to $0.05 in fiscal 2018. Switching to cash flow, our operating cash flow is expected to decline by approximately 10% relative to the prior year. This decline is primarily driven by the loss of the majority of MTS' cash flow following the creation of Change Healthcare, as well as very strong cash generation at the end of fiscal 2017. And last, as you think about the quarterly progression of our results in fiscal '18, we expect our results to be waited to the second half of the year, primarily driven by the anticipated strength of fourth quarter results, given the seasonality of branded manufacturer pharmaceutical price increases. And for the first half of fiscal '18, we expect the second quarter will be stronger than the first quarter. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Melisa? Operator : Thank you [Operator Instruction]. And we\u2019ll first take a question from Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher : I'd like to go back to, John, your comments on differential pricing. And I don\u2019t think that was called out as one of the elements impacting the MTS or profit. I know there are quite a few puts and takes there. But has that been a material factor, and could you give us some detail on what you\u2019re trying to do both upstream with the manufacturer and downstream with your customers? John Hammergren : I do think it is certainly an important factor. I'll leave the materiality to the accountants, but it's certainly been important part of our businesses as we look at it, and we've made significant progress. And in our conversations with both our manufacturing partners, as well as our end user customer partners; so we're excited about the progress. I think people understand that the cost of handling certain of these items is different than having them all blended together. And certainly the services we provide are different and the economics associated with and when the products is different and we're pleased with the progress. We\u2019ve more work to do, we do that systematically as our contracts are revised. But I feel good about the progress, Eric. Eric Percher : The key driving services that are unique, or is it segmenting fees and charging separately for what you\u2019re providing? John Hammergren : It's probably a combination of both. clearly, to the extent that our previous discounting didn\u2019t reflect the true cost of handling the products that needed to be modified, and to be extended that customers or manufacturers are asking us to perform new or different services, we\u2019ve taken that on as well. So I think it's simple to mention that. And I don\u2019t think in the past with the way we used to price our contracts, we segmented enough. And as obviously these other categories begin to grow, it's important that we price them in a more discreet fashion than as we\u2019ve attempted to do. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Lisa Gill with J. P. Morgan. Lisa Gill : John, I just want to go back to some of your comments on Claris 1. As I truly understand where you are with the manufacturers, obviously today, we saw bad time with Express Scripts and increased the size of their procurement entity. Is there any push back around the manufacturers in the anticipation of potentially losing Rite Aid we\u2019ve had -- I mean how do we think about the contracting from that perspective? John Hammergren : I think, James in his prepared remarks, made a specific comment related to Express and we don\u2019t see any impact related to the potential loss of our Rite Aid business -- and he made a comment about Rite Aid not about Express, so to be clear. And I don\u2019t think that when we get to a certain scale on the certain amount of materiality with the manufacturers, I don\u2019t think there is much of the difference in the way that the manufacturers behave with any of us. I\u2019ve said this before. I believe we\u2019re extremely well positioned and I think our contract is very competitive. I think Walmart has benefitted significantly from the relationship. And as to where we stand in it, the normalization of the agreements between McKesson and Walmart and our respective partners help drive a lot of very quick incremental value to Walmart. And I believe that this next phase as we complete our negotiations the contracting with the manufacturers, we\u2019re already beginning to see a reflection as a combined value of us putting our business together and committing it to these partners for a long period of time. And clearly we have the ability because our customers tell us whether our pricing in the marketplace is competitive or not. And with that customer feedback, we\u2019re constantly adjusting our perspective on what prices, a fair price to sell at and what a fair price to buy at is. And through that intelligence I think we remain very confident in our scale and approach to doing the job it needs to do. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : So one question that I have, John, obviously 2017 was a challenging year, but here we are. And you made some changes to how you revise the definition of adjusted earnings you moved some business to distribution. If we think about the operating market guidance to 198 to 208 -- to 2.8 is this, in your base that you feel that you can extend margins from? And along the same lines, now you talk about mid-single growth rate for distribution for the revenue line. How should we think about the growth algorithm for the operating income? Should we think about mid-single digit as well, if you can just give more color on that? John Hammergren : Well, I\u2019ll have James jump in here in just a moment. I think that the principle drivers of our challenge in the previous year was the brand price inflation came in obviously below what we expected it to be. And then the very significant issue related to generic pricing that took the sell side of generics in the marketplace. And I think that we would expect that we will get up margin growth, going forward. And so I obviously always think that, and last year we had a surprise, a couple of surprises. But this year, you can see that we really don't have built into our guidance inflation on the generic side beyond nominal; and the branded inflation, we've guided, I think to a responsible range and the underlying operations of our business continue to perform very well; and the generic pricing challenges we face last year in the independent segment, as we've commented in the past, have been somewhat transitory in their nature; and recently, we have to continue to be competitive in the marketplace. Those kinds of dislocations don't happen on a frequent basis. So having said all of that, our expectation is that our margins will expand from here. James Beer : And in terms of the Distribution Solutions\u2019 operating profit, there are few items in through there; first of all, obviously, as we're going to benefit from the acquisitions that we entered into in fiscal '17; then we have these lapping effects of last year's headwinds, both the brand manufacturer price increase situation, as well as on the generic side the sell side environment, particularly through to the independent pharmacists. But setting those headwinds aside, I'm pleased to see U.S. pharma getting back to operating profit growth. And then you add to that the ongoing operating profit growth of remainder portfolio of businesses, which as you know, is quite diverse. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Just to go back and follow-up on the Distribution Solutions operating margin. If I look back in the guidance you guys provided, I mean, if I think back to October when you guys lowered guidance on competitive pressures and in the moderating inflation. And I think about that in the back half of '17. It seems like the negative impact from those changes would have certainly had your operating margins for fiscal '18 pointing to something down you, and yet here you are giving very encouraging operating margin guidance. So other than something like Claris 1 being an incremental positive year-over-year, did anything changed in your underlying assumptions as far as those two specific pressure points that you talked about last year, competitive pressure and moderating inflation. And I guess you -- one just kind of follow on to that, I know you don't guide to gross profit within Distribution Solutions. But would we anticipate, John, that gross profit would also be growing specifically in North American distribution? John Hammergren : Yes, we certainly would expect gross profit in North American distribution to grow. And I would say, further, we\u2019ve made significant progress in the operations of our Company last year. And continuing this point that progress was largely overshadowed by the significant headwinds that we faced as we went into the back half of last year. And obviously, coming to this year, we\u2019re taking the remainder of those headwinds. But if you actually look under the covers, the rest of our Company is performing quite well and I am pleased with the fact that we can continue to show progress in our business. And clearly, some of the changes James mentioned in terms of the definition of adjusted earnings make our operating performance more clear. And we try to re-cash last years\u2019 and this years\u2019 so you can see how they would have compared. But James jumping here with some other color you\u2019d like to provide\u2026 James Beer : Yes, it's just kind of say for example two things about that change in the definition of adjusted earnings. And in the second 8-K we have broken out the FY '17 data in line with that new definition. So you'll be able to see the year-over-year type effects there. And then also just to reemphasize that because of the way the accounting looks, remember that our profit from our joint venture partners, such as Walmart's profit as a part of Claris 1, that actually gets counted in our operation profit line and therefore benefits of our operating margin rate lower down at the bottom of the P&L, we have to extract that out in terms of the non-controlling interest. So there is complexity there, and that's very much how GAAP requires us to do things. And again in the 8-K, we've tried to break out in the last of the schedules that we have there both the operating margin on a growth basis, if you will, then also net of that MCI effect. So there are few steps to move through there. But hopefully, we lay things out so you can sort through that. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Steven Velazquez with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Steven Velazquez : Just regarding the Rite Aid EPS contribution of $0.20 to $0.40 in fiscal '18, I heard that right. I think most of us have seen that EPS ruin rate could then -- it would have been a little bit a higher than that at 13 point of revenues. I guess if you compare that number for FY18 to Rite Aid contribution of the past couple of years. We've been in that same range, or has that come down perhaps from various reasons? Thanks. John Hammergren : I think it's probably fair to say that when our margins dropped across the Company, and typically in the U.S. pharmaceutical business, I should and know the focus on U.S. pharmaceuticals is a result of the phenomena's we've been talking about that same kind of degradation in the performance of every one of our, probably every one of our customers in the U.S. pharmaceutical business was effected. And it just becomes a question of mix. And so it's fair to say that most of our customers in U.S. pharma are less profitable today than they were a couple of years ago, and you\u2019ve seen it in our overall margin rate in that business\u2026 James Beer : And you\u2019re correct it was $0.20 to $0.40 of contribution from Rite Aid for the full year. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Garen Sarafian : Point to your generics assumption, setting aside the down street pressures in this past year, that's now less variable. Have you changed the underlying assumptions in any way that net out to nominal contributions for fiscal '18? And maybe related to that since we\u2019re talking qualitatively and not quantifying, does the lower end of guidance capture worse than expected trends in generics. So that if there were say no contributions from generics increasing in price or maybe the overall generics basket deflating more than your base case. Would you still be in the serious EPS range? John Hammergren : Well, on the generics guide, we talked about a nominal contribution, economic contribution from generics with increase in price; so very much the same guide that we offered this time last year. And then also similarly a nominal economic contribution from brand to generic conversions; we expect to see in fiscal '18. Now, as to the range of the guide, that\u2019s always going to be driven by a mix of all of the variables that we\u2019ve been talking about and have led out in the press release. So it we wouldn\u2019t want to particularly so spend drop on one. But clearly that was nominal for both generic price inflation and generic conversions, I think, appropriately set out very modest expectations. James Beer : And I would follow on to the last part of that question related to generic deflation. We\u2019ve talked about it in the past; it's not having much of an effect on our business; and part of our normal operating model when you think about the overall way we manage our generic portfolio; and the fact that we\u2019ve had deflation historically on a basket basis for a long time. And the deflation on our purchase of generics doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a deflation on the way we sell our market generics, and so that the two are distinct. And the challenge we faced last year was not the rated deflation on what we paid for generics, the issue we faced last year was acceleration in the normally competitive market on generics to become even more competitive on the sell side. And that\u2019s what we faced in the back half of last year that we tried to discuss on previous calls. And to be clear, we don\u2019t anticipate that level of price erosion on the sell side of our generic portfolio. Going back to what we experienced in the last half of last year, we expect it to continue to be competitive, and not as volatile as we experienced. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Two part question, so probably the most common thing in my inbox is sort of trying to tease out the comparability of the updated guidance with what was expected versus discreet. And I could ask you to comment on street estimates. But if you can, James, maybe just help us think through the few components that most materially changed and just maybe repeated in terms of the prior year as we think relative to the updated guidance would be helpful. And secondary, a few of the assumptions you are talking about prior, like the deferred revenue piece. Is there anything else aside from that that changed materially that you communicated before? And then if you can help us just figure out what's the most sensitive point here. I mean there is clearly a ton of assumptions. And so when you think about which one you probably have -- not the least confident in, but may be as the widest interval of the outcome. What would you point to one or two things that maybe could be a little bit causing upper end or lower end of the range, more so than others? James Beer : Well, obviously, there are a few moving parts here in the guide. I think about some of the bigger economic drivers that would -- to be a real different -- have some of the expectations out there. I point to our assumption around mid-single digits for branded manufacturer price increase. Yes, that is a lower assumption than that that we experienced in fiscal '17. But we think that\u2019s the prudent thing to do for the reasons we talked about in the prepared remarks. Think about the contribution from Rite Aid that we've been quite clear on. The change in the adjusted earnings definition, there's a material impact there because up until today, we've been talking about that deferred revenue haircut that would impact the Change Healthcare income. And so now, we don't have to deal with that in adjusted earnings. And then the other thing I would say is our tax rate is probably at 27% lower than perhaps some expectations, because we've got a variety of drivers there that we're continuing to benefit from as we look forward into fiscal '18. So in terms of user variability, while we'll obviously see what the branded manufacturers actually do during the year; and one of the other important assumptions we've made is around the lapping effect on the generic sale side, the lapping effect of what happened in the independent space last year; as John has been indicating, we're seeing less volatility there. Obviously, the hopeful situation we'll see how things play out in that part of the marketplace. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Michael Cherny with UBS. Michael Cherny : I know you provided a lot of details, particularly on the change in the non-GAAP adjustments. But I want to just make sure everything is level set again on that front just there are a lot of moving pieces. In terms of the change, specifically, related to the deferred revenue adjustments. I know a lot of companies that in the tax based exempts in the past. Is this just the way you guys are recognizing it going to be a one-time adjustment and then you\u2019ll go back to normalized margins for the Change business. Or is this going to be now part of the base as you take for interest in terms of thinking of how that's going to continue to flow through into your P&L given the 70% ownership structure? James Beer : So in essence, we will not take that one-time decline in what would flow off the balance sheet into revenue. So we will not be impacted by what we now quantify as $200 million deferred revenue haircut effect. Obviously, that's part of the GAAP books, but that will not be showing up in our adjusted earnings. John Hammergren : That's related to the transaction of McKesson and Change Healthcare, so it's not a comment on Change Healthcare's treatment of deferred revenue. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to David Larsen with Leerink. David Larsen : Can you please just clarify, on the buy side of generics, are you seeing an inflationary environment or a deflationary environment. And then can you also comment on the hospital market, like Cardinal has evolved a lot of new capabilities, especially on the medical side. Are you seeing any sort of more aggressive competition within the facility space or not? Thanks. John Hammergren : Well we, I think in the previous comment, I talked about generic deflation and how we believe it will continue and has for a long time. We don't really comment on the rate of deflation, because it's not a big factor that plays into the way our economics or our P&L operates. The deflation is typically not an issue that we have to guide on or that we miss or make on, it's something just part of our business model and we attempt to manage it. And this is the deflation as it relates to what we buy at. We don't necessarily comment on what we price the product at unless there's some kind of unusual circumstance, like we faced last year when we talked about generic price erosion in the marketplace, that's the sell side comment, that\u2019s not what we will be buy the product for. The second part of your question was related to the hospital market. And we certainly have competed in the hospital market for a long-term and we used to be in the medical supply business and hospitals. And frankly found it difficult to compete with the likes of currently in the hospital market. But as it relates to the business that we retain in the hospital business, it's really in two categories. One, is in the physician office part of medical supply purchases in the hospital segment, where they own the doctors and ask for us to provide shipment to the smaller physician office facilities and practices that they own, we\u2019re very strong there and continue to be strong. And clearly in the pharmacy business of hospitals, we have a very strong value preposition and remain very strong there. And I never take competition lightly, but I don\u2019t believe the continued investment that Carlos is making in the medical surgical business necessarily will correlate to some change in competitive dynamics on the pharmacy side. But that's yet to be seen. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : I wanted to ask John like as we think about the competitiveness of the sell side that we saw last year. Where does your confidence on part of this lag and recur this year, especially as we had saw what rebate did this morning with bringing on Express Scripts? John Hammergren : I can only speak from 20 plus years now, the experience here at McKesson in watching how the market pricing that has evolved and how our customers have come to us overtime. We continue to build out a very significant value proposition for our customers, particularly independent customers. They always get a competitive price from us, they always get a good deal from us, and our ability to source products, I think, is second to none. Having said that on occasion in the past and infrequently, we\u2019ll see a period of deflation on the sell side that has accelerated or price competition is accelerated and that\u2019s what we faced last year. It may have been seven or eight years between the last year that we experienced in the last time we experienced an event like that. So could it happen every year, we sure it could happen and eventually you raise to the bottom and there is nothing more to give. But I don\u2019t forecast that just based on historical activity. As it relates to rebates activity, certainly, I can't speak to what incremental buying power they may garner as a result of bringing Express Scripts together with them. I don\u2019t feel we've been in a disadvantage, I don\u2019t feel we will be at a disadvantage. And I would also say it's not necessarily a direct correlation that if someone buys better that they determine that they will increase their level of discounts and pass it all back into the marketplace. So if that were to occur, if they bought better and their partners ended up buying better and then they decided to put it into the marketplace, we would have to respond and it would be a year similar to this year. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Charles Rhyee : John, obviously you've given us an outlook here for fiscal '18, and it looks like that things are started to normalize. When we think about the future, you look at some of your peers here and they\u2019re deploying capital into areas of growth outside of let's say of the pharma distribution business. And here we are divesting as a chunk of our technology business into Change Healthcare. Can you talk about how you look at the longer term outlook for McKesson in terms of -- where do you think you\u2019re going to be looking to find growth in? And what should we think about the long term outlook for growth? Thanks. John Hammergren : We like the pharmaceutical business and we like it globally, we certainly like in U.S., and we like in Canada and we like the medical supply business and the option side markets. We believe those markets and also inside medical are growing fast and will continue to grow at a nice pace as people move out of less convenient, more costly settings for their care and have a more value orientation and a more physician centric relationship perhaps. And we like the pharmaceutical business. You can see, as an industry, the pharmaceutical business continues to grow propelled by innovation and bio-similars and new treatments coming out. Clearly, the demographics in pharmaceutical usage is improving and we see that trend globally as well. So I think we continue to feel good about our position. And you see us deploying capital, I think, in a very intelligently in high growth areas, not only in new markets where we can, I think, be a consolidator and a new service provider but also in our specialty acquisitions, you saw us buy Biologics last year -- and then Vantage, which are good acquisitions for us. We made a technology acquisition, called CoverMyMeds, which comes in with a different profit profile. And certainly now it is a good business on it' own that provides significant service to the pharmaceutical manufacturers, the pharmaceutical payers and the patients who are dependent on getting the drugs at the right time and at the right place at the pharmacy counter. And clearly, we continue to make Canadian acquisition, another one of which was announced today. So I think we are well positioned; I think we\u2019ve got a right assets; I think these assets have a correlation across borders and across boundaries in our business; and we have synergy that we can take advantage of that in the end that delivers better value for our customers. So they can do a better job of clinical care and clearly do a better job of the economics associated with delivering that care. I think that was our last question. I want to thank you operator and thank all of your on the call for your time today. We\u2019ve got a very solid operating plan for fiscal 2018. And I am certainly excited about the growth opportunities across McKesson. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Craig to answer a few questions about our upcoming events. Craig Mercer : Thank you, John. We will participate in the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference in Southern California on June 15th. We look forward to seeing you in the new fiscal year. Thank you and good bye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to the McKesson Q1 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead. Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, Anthony. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2018 first-quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 9 :30 AM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the SEC, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and James will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2018 results for further information, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you, and here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, Craig. And thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today we reported a solid start to fiscal 2018. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues in excess of $51 billion, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.46, consistent with our expectations. Combined with our share repurchases we completed in the first quarter, we are raising our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook to $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. Before I dive into the details of the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the progress that demonstrates our continued commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. First, we continue to proactively develop our portfolio of distribution businesses. In the past quarter, we announced the signing of three acquisitions primarily in the specialties space. We closed four acquisitions, including CoverMyMeds, in early April and we started the important work to integrate Rexall and other recent acquisitions which are beginning to contribute to our earnings growth. Each of these acquisitions that we've announced or are in the process of integrating, highlight our commitment to expand our specialty capabilities, enhance our leading technology solutions for our Distribution Solutions customers and grow our retail pharmacy footprint internationally. Second, we continue to make progress on the strategic shift to realign our businesses to focus on distribution and retail pharmacy solutions following the creation of Change Healthcare. This quarter represents the first time we include the results for our equity investment in Change Healthcare; the new company was created to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower healthcare costs, improve patient access and outcomes, and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care. Change Healthcare is now a focused and scaled enterprise executing on this mission. Additionally, I'm encouraged by the recent developments in our pursuit of the strategic alternatives for our Enterprise Information Solutions business, and I expect we will have more to announce in the near-term. Turning now to our business results for the quarter. Our North American pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, and our recently formed McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, had revenue growth in the first quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a few matters specific to our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business met our expectations in the first quarter driven by organic growth. Next I want to provide an update on the pricing environment as we've transitioned into fiscal 2018. We entered this year with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid-single-digits and our first quarter experience was slightly ahead of this assumption. Additionally, you'll recall that during fiscal 2017, we saw increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes from McKesson. Over time we adjusted our strategy and we were able to recapture that lost volume, retain our share, and build upon our longstanding relationships. Consistent with our update over the last two quarters, we continue to see a competitive market for selling generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S., albeit, with less pricing variability. We expect to lap the independent pharmacy sell-side pricing impact by the end of our fiscal 2018 second quarter. Next I'd like to discuss ClarusONE. We are pleased with the progress we've made so far in our manufacturer discussions and we are in line with our plan. McKesson continues to be encouraged by our partnership with Walmart and we are looking at opportunities in which we can expand the relationship. We're also pleased with the progress of our multi-year initiative to implement differential pricing for brands, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC drug classes, in line with the services we provide to both our customers and manufacturing partners in the each of the five categories. We continue to address these important changes, as we work through contract renewal cycles. Turning to Rite Aid's recent announced asset purchase agreement. Based on public comments made by Walgreens, they indicate an anticipated six-month regulatory review, followed by a six-month phased transition period. Therefore, we continue to anticipate a full-year contribution from Rite Aid in our fiscal 2018 guidance. I would also like to call out our recently announced acquisition of BDI Pharma, which allows us to provide our customers with broader plasma and related offerings and complement our current health system in alternate site channels. We also expect to bring more value to our manufacture partners through increased scale and customer penetration. Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health. We recently announced the closing of our acquisition of intraFUSION which further strengthens our multi-specialty offerings and through our commitment to the transition to value-based care, we support approximately 800 physicians who participated in the CMS Oncology Care Model over the last year. This represents greater than 1/3 of all participating providers being supported by McKesson Specialty Health, an unparalleled commitment to value-based oncology. Moving to our Canadian business. We had nice growth in the quarter, which results \u2013 with results that were in line with our expectations. Our Canadian operations represent a diverse collection of businesses, similar to those in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on full-line distribution, specialty and infusion services and owned and banner retail pharmacies. We're making progress on the Rexall integration, which further enhances McKesson's retail pharmacy capacities, procurement scale and leading pharmacy care for patients across Canada. We've also broadened our specialty offerings upon closing the acquisition of GMV Distribution. GMV is a leading provider of specialty pharmaceuticals and expands our multi-specialty presence across Canada, while further strengthening our current physician and manufacturing relationships. Finally, our recent CoverMyMeds acquisition is now part of the newly formed McKesson Prescription Technology Services business. CoverMyMeds automates and accelerates the prescription approval process, known as electronic prior authorization, which is otherwise manual and time-consuming and therefore takes administrative costs out of the system. CoverMyMeds allows us to support patient health through drug adherence, manufacturers by reducing prescription abandonment, and providers and payers through automation and appropriate patient access to medications. We're excited about the meaningful improvements this technology represents for these stakeholders. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter was $6.4 billion, up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and operating performance from Celesio was in line with our expectations for the quarter. While we continue to monitor reimbursement developments in the UK, we remain encouraged by the growth delivered by the rest of the Celesio enterprise. And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year, driven by market growth, including strong performance from our recent investment in laboratory distribution. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the first quarter and as I noted in my earlier remarks, we are encouraged by the progress made by management of Change Healthcare, since its creation just over a quarter ago. Now to wrap up my comments, McKesson's first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments, and we are raising our full-year outlook for fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings to a range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. We believe we are well-positioned to drive future growth with our scaled global sourcing capabilities, expanded global retail footprint, growing specialty business in the U.S. and overseas, and our leading technology solutions for our Distribution Solutions customers. We're extremely well-positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and we'll return to address your questions, when he finishes. James? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John discussed earlier, we are raising our fiscal year 2018 adjusted earnings outlook to $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share which reflects our first quarter results that were very much in line with our expectations and the positive full-year impact of incremental share repurchases completed in the quarter. Please note the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter press release are being reiterated today, unless stated otherwise. Now let's move to our results for the quarter. My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.46, which excludes the following items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments. You may recall that when we provided our initial guidance and further commentary at our Investor Day, we noted the quarterly progression of our fiscal 2018 performance, being back-half weighted. This timing reflects, in part, our ongoing contract renewal work with our customers and manufacturer partners, where we are reflecting the differential economics of brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC products, as John mentioned previously. These ongoing contract renewals, also reflect reduced variability in our compensation, resulting from manufacturer pricing actions. Our ongoing success with these contract renewals did however create a timing headwind for our Q1 earnings. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2 and Schedule 3. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 4% in constant currency. First quarter adjusted gross profit was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the planned lapping effect of increased competitive pricing in our independent pharmacy business, weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, some timing items driven by our ongoing contractual renewal progress with certain manufacturer partners, and lower profit in our Technology Solutions business driven primarily by the contribution of the majority of businesses to Change Healthcare, partially offset by acquisitions and organic growth including the ClarusONE joint sourcing entity. First quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 5% in constant currency, driven by acquisitions, partially offset by the Change Healthcare transaction and ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted other income was $13 million for the quarter, a decrease of 43% in constant currency. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare, was $70 million for the first quarter. We are pleased with the progress of Change Healthcare; the management team has come together to cohesively lead the new organization and begin the work of both identifying opportunities to further expand our customer relationships, and realizing meaningful synergies. I'd like to reiterate our prior guidance, that Change Healthcare will generate between $370 million and $430 million of pre-tax earnings, reflecting our 70% ownership of the joint venture. At the same time, we have made a refinement to our estimate of the way tax expense is attributed to the joint venture's profits. Including tax expenses, now expected to be accounted for within Change Healthcare, we project our adjusted equity income from the Change Healthcare joint venture will be between $250 million and $310 million in McKesson's fiscal 2018 P&L. Again, this reflects no material change in our full-year expectation for pre-tax earnings to be generated by the Change Healthcare joint venture; rather, it is a refinement in where taxes are reflected in our income statement. Our full-year tax rate for McKesson is now estimated to be approximately 25%, down from our original estimate of 27%. The net effect of these two updates is neutral to the original guidance for fiscal 2018 that we provided in May. Also note that we do not expect a cash tax impact to McKesson as a result of this refinement. Now, continuing down the income statement, interest expense of $68 million decreased 14% in constant currency for the quarter, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate was approximately 26.5% for the quarter. Our income attributable to non-controlling interests or NCI was $56 million for the quarter, an increase of 217% in constant currency. As a reminder, the increase in NCI year-over-year was primarily driven by ClarusONE, our fully operational, joint sourcing entity with Walmart. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $523 million, with our first quarter adjusted EPS at $2.46 per diluted share, down 22%, compared to $3.15 in the prior period. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 213 million, down 7% compared to the prior period. Let's now turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were $50.9 billion. On a constant currency basis revenues were up 5% year-over-year. Revenues were impacted by approximately $400 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by brand to generic conversions. International Pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.4 billion for the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, revenues were up 6% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $300 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. In mid-July, the UK government announcement further reimbursement cuts. We are assessing both the economic impact of these changes on McKesson and potential business initiatives to help mitigate these government actions. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 4% for the first quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit was up 7% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter, driven by acquisitions and organic growth, including contributions from ClarusONE, partially offset by the planned lapping effect of increased competition in our independent pharmacy business and the expected weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends. Let me, for a moment, touch on branded pharmaceutical price increases. The June quarter has traditionally included modest brand price increases and our first quarter experience was slightly ahead of the assumption included in our plan. I would remind you that in addition to timing, frequency and magnitude, the mix of which manufacturers initiate price adjustments has an important affect on our overall compensation. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses increased 18% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase driven by acquisitions, partially offset by ongoing cost management efforts. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit was down 10% in constant currency year-over-year at $887 million. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 173 basis points on a constant-currency basis, a decrease of 28 basis points driven by the same factors as previously discussed, as well as our growing mix of higher priced specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the beneficial contribution from ClarusONE. We continue to expect our full-year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin rate to be between 198 basis points and 208 basis points. Our operating margin rates will be supported by organic growth, including the contribution from ClarusONE, recent acquisitions and the lapping of previously discussed headwinds as we proceed through the year. Now moving to Technology Solutions, as a reminder, in fiscal 2018 MTS segment revenues, adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses contain only the results of our Enterprise Information Solutions business. Revenues were $120 million, while adjusted segment gross profit was $61 million. Adjusted segment operating expenses were $44 million and adjusted operating profit, excluding the equity contribution from Change Healthcare was $17 million. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding decreased 1 day from the prior year, to 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased 1 day from the prior year to 29 days and our days sales in payables was flat to the prior year at 59 days. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion, with approximately $1.7 billion held offshore. And in the first quarter, McKesson generated $741 million in cash flow from operations. We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach in fiscal 2018 priorities. In the first quarter, we spent $118 million on internal capital investments, and we paid $541 million in long-term debt. We also repurchased $250 million in common stock in the first quarter. We now expect our weighted average diluted shares to be approximately $212 million for the full year. And we now have approximately $2.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We also paid $1.5 billion for acquisitions during the first quarter, which included the closing of CoverMyMeds as previously announced on April 3. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.34, an increase of $0.06 or 21%. This dividend will be payable to shareholders in October, and reflects our commitment to the dividend as a part of our portfolio approach to capital deployment. Now let me briefly touch on Rite Aid. While Rite Aid has announced a new transaction with Walgreens, our guidance range continues to assume a full-year full year revenue contribution from Rite Aid of approximately $13 billion, and an estimated annual adjusted earnings per share contribution of between $0.20 and $0.40. Based on Walgreens' public comments, that they expect the regulatory review of this new transaction to take approximately six months, and that if approved, the stalls involved would be transitioned over a subsequent six-month period, we feel comfortable with our fiscal 2018 assumption. And as you think about the cadence of our earnings in fiscal 2018, I'd like to reiterate my previous comments that our results will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. Consistent with our historical experience, we expect the fourth quarter to be the strongest. Also, in our second quarter, we will continue to be impacted by a lapping effect from last year's increased competitive pricing in our independent pharmacy business. Throughout the remainder of the year, we will benefit from the increasing contribution of ClarusONE, additional organic growth and our recent acquisitions. In closing, McKesson delivered first quarter results that were in line with our expectations. In addition, our cash flow generation allowed us to address each of these four pillars of our capital deployment strategy, and our Q1 share repurchases are driving our updated fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS outlook of $11.80 to $12.50. Thank you and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Thanks very much and good morning. James, let me just start with trying to understand the cadence of the earnings. I understand you were talking about it being more heavily back-half weighted, but given where the Street was in this quarter versus what you delivered and where you said this was in line with your expectations, I just want to make sure that we have this lined up correctly, especially as we think about next quarter and think about having to lap some of the pricing issues; is there anything more that you can give us directionally as we think about the second quarter? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, obviously a few factors driving the quarterization of the fiscal 2018 guide, in particular, Q1 was impacted by that lapping effect of last year's activity, enhanced pricing activity around the independent pharmacy space, and then also, as we had assumed going into the fiscal year, we did see lesser brand manufacturer price increase activity than we've seen in some other years. And also made note at the start of my remarks, as to in Q1 in particular, there were two contracts with the manufacturers as we went through our renewal process, that is focusing our activity on the relevant economics for each of the five categories of our work, that both John and I referred to, namely the brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC, but also those renewals focused on our interest in seeing less variability to the branded manufacturer pricing actions. Of course, we don't take those decisions, so it's helpful for us to have a little less variability to pricing. And so that issue in particular, those two contract renewals did have an impact on Q1 and there will be a beneficial impact later in the year. Not surprisingly, we always see Q4 as the strongest of the quarters, given that that is traditionally when branded manufacturers take the majority of their price increases. And then the other factors to really think through is, as the year proceeds, we'll continue to see nice organic growth across the businesses and also, obviously, we invested substantially in acquisitions over the last 12 to 18 months. So, as those new parts of our company progress against their business cases, I'm expecting that we'll see additional earnings benefits from them as the year progresses. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay, great. And then, just my follow-up would be for John. John, in your prepared comments, you made a comment that you feel that things have stabilized, and they're (28:15) competitive when we think about the independent market for generics. Can you just maybe give us a little more color as to what you're really seeing in the market and what gives you that confidence? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the question, Lisa. I think at the time that we talked about this unusual activity in the prior year, during the prior year, I made the comment that we had \u2013 we don't see that type of activity frequently, and when we've seen it in the past, it tended to stabilize or revert back to competitive, but less variable over time. And I think that, that prognosis or forecast in terms of where we thought things would go has proven to be accurate, and obviously, things can change at any point in time, but I would say that we've gone back to an environment which is competitive, but certainly not out of line with the kind of competitive activity that we would have typically seen prior to fiscal 2017. So I would say that that's the best way I could characterize it, is it's back to competitive and less variable. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS. Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the color. Maybe thinking a little bit and building off of Lisa's question a bit more, as you think about some of the other moving pieces that get better into the back half of the year, particularly the pricing environment, I guess, how do you check the growth points along the line to make sure that what you think about relative to brand inflation which I think you said came in little bit better, generic deflation, all against the backdrop of some of the contract changes are falling in line with your plans? And I guess, how much visibility at this point, do you have into some of those changes? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think it's fair to say that when we had our guidance discussion at the end of our fiscal year and again at our Analyst Meeting, we talked very specifically about how we saw the year playing out and I guess what we're seeing today is it's playing out as we had anticipated it would play out. We may not have done an effective job of messaging it to you given where the Street has been in the quarter, but clearly it's in line with our expectations and we typically have pretty good visibility throughout the year. And as James mentioned, if you think about our renewal cycle of both with our customers and our large manufacturing partners, you can clearly see how the changes in those relationships will be reflected in future financial results. And so, I would say, on those dimensions, clearly we have better visibility and perhaps less variability than we would have had in an environment where we were more dependent on price increases as a piece of our business model. Clearly, we can't entirely forecast acquisitions with 100% certainty, but we have a pretty good track record of getting the synergies out of the capital we deploy and giving the returns to our investors that are appropriate given the risk that we take and the other alternatives like buying our stock back. So, if you believe the three principle drivers are the sort of the calenderization of our earnings with manufacturers, the impact of acquisitions as they get closed and integrated, and things like NorthStar, our private label products and the higher growth and our higher margin businesses frankly, we can see that with pretty good, accuracy. So, I think that we would not have confirmed our guidance here and the raise, as James mentioned, was related to the share repurchases. We would not have done that, if we didn't believe that it was an accurate representation of our belief going forward. Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it at one. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. Maybe just a quick update on how some of the recent acquisitions are sort of trending, particularly some of the maybe the newer businesses to you, like Rexall or Biologics, so just love to understand how they're doing versus sort of their base M&A case when you bought them? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Right. I think that as I said earlier, we have a pretty good track record in realizing the synergies that we forecast and I would say that we're generally in line on these acquisitions in terms of their performance. Biologics might be performing slightly ahead of its acquisition case and we've been very pleased with that acquisition, and Rexall is really in line with this \u2013 I'd say a little bit newer than Biologics is. And then the rest of our acquisitions like CoverMyMeds, et cetera, are all performing at or above our expectations. So, I'm quite pleased with not only the performance financially, but the strategic position that these acquisitions put us in. As you can imagine, we are investing in higher margin businesses in the case of Biologics and CoverMyMeds, et cetera, and we're investing in businesses that in the case of Rexall that are not only higher margin, but they're also allowing us to have more control over the selection of product, and that control allows us to deliver more value to the manufacturers that we do business with. And so, it's part of a long-term strategy, frankly, on both of those fronts to be more exposed to specialty, because of its higher growth and be more meaningful to manufacturers. James, you might have something to add. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: And while we don't look at this in our business cases that underpin the acquisitions themselves, I've been pleased so far with the opportunities that are starting to evolve for groups like CoverMyMeds to work with other parts of our business, Relay Pharmacy for example on the Rexall side, the discussions that are really ongoing now with other parts of retail across our organization. So that's not a short-term synergy opportunity. It's not something that's part of the business case, but I'm encouraged that there's quite an opportunity I think over the longer-term for us to really benefit from this portfolio of assets that we've built up over the years. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: And I also mentioned, Ross, in my comments about Med-Surg and our exposure to laboratory and our entrance into the lab business, principally in the physician space, but also in the smaller hospitals where they've been underserved from a laboratory supply perspective, and that business is growing nicely for us and it's higher margin and higher growth than the baseline businesses. So, we think we're well positioned. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : And maybe just as a follow-up, historically you guys have been tremendous stewards of capital and M&A has always been a hallmark, and I always think of you as being a pretty creative and value-based buyer. I guess, in an environment with where we are with multiples, et cetera, how would you sort of characterize more the mid-to-small size tuck-ins that you guys typically do? What does that environment look like? Is there a pretty ease in pipeline or valuations still amenable in certain areas? How are you sort of thinking about just the overall backdrop? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: First, thanks for the compliment, and we appreciate the fact that we've represented good stewards of capital, and that we have a track record of executing. And clearly, if you overpay, there's no ability to create value and so, that discipline upfront is extremely important. But, I'd say, as evidenced by the frequency of our acquisitions in the last year and already into this year, you can see we find creative spots to deploy capital and to your point about sort of innovation and creativity, we're typically not (35:51), that are all chasing the deal or chasing an opportunity. We have our teams focused on building relationships with potential sellers long before they're interested in selling, and then we create a positive environment for those transactions to be completed. And for their teams to continue to come to McKesson and deliver not only value to us, but careers for themselves, and that combination makes us an attractive partner. When many times these companies are privately owned or certainly heavily influenced by the entrepreneurs that may own them, we're a good place for people to continue to grow and develop and be rewarded for their performance. And I think that makes us a preferred alternative in many cases. So, obviously, when multiples start to trade up, it makes it more difficult, but we're patient, and we'll wait for the right opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, John and James. I guess more of a big picture question on procurement. So, distributors have clearly gained share and enlarged the pie, in terms of level of generics purchased through you for a variety of reasons. But from a high level, could you describe what that does to the marketplace from a procurement perspective? So, for example, in North America, you've completed signing contracts with the new retail client via ClarusONE and now one of your peers is embarking on adding a PBM, and then incremental retail line. So, does that cause any disruption in your contracting or does that impact your assumptions in terms of generic contributions, as maybe pricing deflates at a different rate or other factors investors should think about as these types of events occur? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think it's a good question and a complex question. I would say that as a backdrop, I believe that the large buyers of generics are relatively comparable in terms of what we're attempting to do, and the results that we're achieving. I would say that clearly incremental volume plays a role in all of this, but I think that the difference between any of us at any one time is not significant, and I think McKesson and certain molecules with certain manufacturers would be superior and in other cases, others may beat us. But if you put it all together as a basket, I'm pretty confident we buy as well as anyone. As it relates to the deflation environment related to our activity in the procurement side, clearly we're trying to get the best deal we possible can for ourselves and for our customers, and we want to make sure that our customers are receiving a competitive price for the service and value that we deliver including the product price. Having said all of that, the deflation that occurs through better sourcing is not an automatic pass-through into the marketplace. We want to make sure we are competitive, but at the same time, obviously the investment to create a ClarusONE needs to be appropriately funded, and provide us the appropriate returns. And so we're focused on making sure that we are responsible for returning to our investors against those investments and that'll continue to be our focus. So, I think we're optimistic that our procurement activity will continue to be best-in-class and we will continue to add capabilities there over time and maybe new product categories and obviously new customers et cetera, but I feel pretty comfortable we're managing it appropriately. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: And perhaps just to add on to that from a more technical perspective, as we look at the economic drivers of our results, our ability to flow through effectively on the generic side in this deflationary type environment has net-net been supportive to our results. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And changing gears a little bit, on Rite Aid, you mentioned you're using public Walgreens comments and your assumptions for the year on the portion that Walgreens is taking over, but how do you think of the rest of the business where there's also a part of that deal, some pricing terms for the reminder of Rite Aid. Should they continue to or would they want to use Walgreen? So, the rest of the business, how you're thinking about it, as to what the realistic options are? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, clearly, we're pleased for both Walgreens and Rite Aid, that they've been able to find a new deal that they believe, they'll be successful with and obviously, we're also pleased that that new deal has some remainder of Rite Aid, not only the corporate side of the entity of Rite Aid, but certainly a large portion of their stores that will remain. And that we've been a long-term valued partner with Rite Aid. And I certainly would hope and expect that relationship would continue. Clearly, the economics for both Rite Aid and McKesson change with their smaller enterprise and we've attempted to reflect to you, what the full enterprise is worth to us, in terms of revenue and earnings. So, at least you have some boundaries as to how valuable the business is to us, and what it might be to us going forward as you describe. So, I think we believe, we can compete very well with anything that our competitors would provide, and we compete very well with anything that our other sourcing entities can provide from a value perspective, and we're hopeful that we'll continue a long-term relationship with Rite Aid well past the transaction with Walgreens. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Good morning, John and James. So just based on simple math, I mean the SG&A seem to be pretty high in the quarter with distribution gross profits growing 4% to 5%, but distribution EBIT down about 10% year-over-year, and just based on your comment, it seems like the biggest delta on getting that gross profit growth and EBIT growth is closer to each other for the rest of the year is mainly acquisition, integration, is that an accurate assessment or are there other key factors there? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I would say that there are more variables that are at play; it's really the combination of the opportunity for organic growth right across the businesses, as well as the impact of acquisitions. And then obviously, we've discussed the ebbing of this lapping effect around sell-side independent pharmacy space. In terms of the expense side of the ledger, we've talked about how we've been looking to invest some in expenses, particularly focused around information technology investments in the coming year. On the other side of the coin, one of the attributes that I was very pleased about in terms of the U.S. Pharma, our performance in Q1 was the productivity efficiency that they were generating out of that part of the business as a result of our ongoing capital expenditure investments and other process improvements that they've made in that business. So we'll continue to invest in process improvements that we think can improve the competitiveness of our cost structure that will take some incremental expense in the short run, and we think that that will be worth it in the longer run. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And just a quick follow up on that, just on the M&A. You mentioned that some of the recent acquisitions were higher margin, it might be tough to answer this on the fly, but when we do look at that 4% to 5% gross profit growth in Distribution Solutions in the quarter, do you know how much of the acquisitions contributed to that growth versus what that growth might have been organically in the quarter, is there any just rough assessment of that? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, we don't bring that out specifically, but obviously those acquisitions are going to build gradually, so I wouldn't want to overstate the impact of those acquisitions in the first year or so. When we've announced acquisitions like CoverMyMeds for example, we noted that come year three, we'd be driving between $0.30-$0.40 of accretion from that acquisition. But that builds gradually particularly in that first year, where oftentimes there is some additional investment spending that goes into the equation for us to be able to really drive that accretion in the second year and third year and so forth. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for the questions. I guess just want to go back to the SG&A, James, I guess I'm still just a bit confused. I think everyone was anticipating the headwinds in the quarter coming from the things that arose in 2Q last year, the branded pricing and the competitive environment, but really relative to expectations the short fall this quarter was from SG&A and in particular it looks like from Distribution Solutions scope. Can you just go back and maybe explain a little bit more what exactly happened in the quarter relative to operating expenses and how should we think about those as we progress through the year? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, another item that is relevant on the expense side of the ledger is obviously, that we've reset our assumptions around various variable compensation programs, and so forth. So that becomes an element of the equation and in certain of our geographies, there were some additional expense resets around salaries and so forth. So, a variety of different factors, but overall, we feel comfortable with the level of spend, as I say, the focus on the investments to drive down expenses over time and right across the management team, we're very focused on improving our spend performance quarter by quarter. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: And I'd also say, Robert, the spend level in the quarter was not something that was a surprise to us. It was factored into our planning when we gave you the full-year guidance. So, I would say that the way the P&L has played out for us in the quarter is in line with what we expected it to be when we gave you the original guidance months ago and that's only the additional cover I give you. It may be surprising to you, but we had factored this in because we could see the investment in the mix changes and the acquisitions et cetera, as we looked at the quarter. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No, that makes sense, John. I think, we, obviously, were focused more on the headwinds that had come up last year, and I think that's where it probably differed in the model. But I guess, James, just if I could go over to pricing, I wanted to get a better understanding of what you guys are seeing on generic pricing, and in particular I'm thinking about the buy side part of the equation; how has that trended relative to expectations? And then probably, more importantly, as you guys look forward given some of the FDA's recent statements and goals of accelerating generic approvals, how do you foresee generic pricing playing out into the future? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, on the generic manufacturer side of things, we went into the year assuming a very nominal benefit from those molecules where we would be seeing price inflation and that's very much as things are playing out, very limited effects there. On the broader generic molecule spectrum, we've been talking earlier in one of our responses about the deflation environment, and net-net, I observed that for our sourcing capacities, or our in-house capabilities as such that we see this environment as a net driver of our overall economic, so we're happy with the situation there. In terms of the FDA and there a part to drive more approvals and therefore potentially put greater numbers of manufacturers into a specific molecule, obviously, you've got an overall supply-demand balancing equation there that will impact the pricing environment net-net, it is a generic type marketplace after all. But I would just offer also that in some of those circumstances the FDA is focused on a molecule where there's any one manufacturer today, and so they're interested in having two or three manufacturers and that can actually provide a helpful environment again for our sourcing capabilities to be able to drive better value for our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, good morning. So, first of all, just a follow up on the question on the SG&A. So just to clarify going forward now that these acquisitions are part of the business. Is that the state that we should model between COGS and gross profits versus operating expenses? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think it's fair to say that, as John was alluding to, these figures were very much in line with our plan and so, as we're bringing on acquisitions in the year-over-year expense base, you're obviously going to see step function increases commensurate with bringing on those acquired expense basis. So I would again rest assure that we'll continue our ongoing focus on cost management, but directionally, yes, you'll see some step function increases as the likes of Rexall come into the P&L for example. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: And I think also, Ricky, one of the challenges from the P&L perspective is that the incremental profit delivered by the acquisitions even in the first order before we realized the synergies was vastly offset by the year-over-year lapping problem that James mentioned earlier related to independent price effects in the prior year. So when you think about why didn't we see a margin lift in terms of the acquisitions and all we saw was the expense lift is, because the margin lift from the acquisitions could easily be offset by the two dimensions that James mentioned. One is the lapping effect of independent pricing last year, and the effect of our continued work from the manufacturer contracting perspective that we talked about previously. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So what would be really helpful for us is if you can just help us quantify what's the magnitude of these headwinds that we're reaping (50:55) when we think about just the combination of the price competition and independent and (51:01) pharmaceutical pricing. So we can kind of in fact normalize that it sounds like run rate as we think about second half? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. I don't have that for you on this call. We would certainly think through how we might articulate that effect going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with Needham & Company. Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Question on ClarusONE; is there a cadence declarence for ClarusONE in terms of the profitability over the course of the year? I'm assuming it will grow and become more profitable as the year progresses. That's the first question on ClarusONE. The second one is, you talk about other opportunities with Walmart and with ClarusONE, is this the kind of relationship where you could get in and help the medical side of your business as well? Are you going to be able to get into products and the like there? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I'll let James talk about the cadence, and I'll talk about the product portfolio. James? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: In terms of the cadence, you're right, I would expect that to build profit contribution as the quarters of the year go by, and obviously, in the last few months, we've really just been getting started and we're very pleased with the momentum that, that team is building around sourcing results. So, yeah, I'd be absolutely looking for a steady build as the year goes along. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: It's difficult for me to perhaps articulate what opportunities would be in front of us like Clarus, because we have a partner there that needs to engage in that opportunity as well. So I'm not speaking that behalf of Walmart. But if you wanted to look at opportunities, you certainly could think about everything that a Walmart store in the U.S. purchases today, and think about what McKesson would also be purchasing for our clients and non-Walmart clients, and all of those would provide opportunities for us to move them to ClarusONE in a way that would be perhaps productive for both companies and our combined customers. I would also say that ClarusONE is specifically focused on U.S. so there might be other U.S. Walmart opportunities as well as global opportunities that both companies could bring together. And last, I would say on the medical side, we clearly are heavily focused on our medical business in private label and our global sourcing activity, which is outside of ClarusONE has been very effective at driving value for us on the medical products that are typically used in the alternate site settings that we focus on. And that, I consider that separate and distinct for medical products that are sold at retail pharmacies like over-the-counter items, which would be closer to home to Clarus, but both are opportunities for us. Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And if I can do one quick follow-up. I'm a little confused on the impact of the manufacturer contracting and sort of how that works; why would something like that become more profitable over the course of the year? Is there an exclusive on a product launch or a generic or something like that? I just don't really understand how that would work? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I won't be able to get into the specifics of these two particular contracts with some of the larger manufacturers, but it did create in essence a headwind for Q1 and we would look for a smoother introduction of contribution for us in the quarters remaining in the year, Q2 through Q4. So, in the net result, which we're pleased about is less variability around a manufacturer's pricing actions. Obviously we don't take those decisions. So, we're interested in smoothing out the impact on our P&L from the actions of others. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. I think that's absolutely accurate, and once again, we had anticipated the outcome of these relationship changes when we provided the original guidance, and I think if there's a reflection on the disconnect, it really is our ability to articulate what we were doing in our business. At the two major points, we had an opportunity to articulate them apparently, was not as clear as it could have been and that's why you guys look at this quarter and say, gee, it seems odd compared to what we expected. But I want to once again confirm and reaffirm what James said is that it's certainly in line with what we expected and we expect that the following three quarters will be in line with what we expect as well. Operator : Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. I think you mentioned that North American pharma revenue was up organically year-over-year. Can you talk a bit more about that? How much of that is being driven by price versus volumes and if you're winning share in the market, any color around which channel it's coming from; hospitals, retails, independent doc offices? Any more color on that growth would be very helpful. Thanks. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the question. Clearly, we're pleased with the growth of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business and our position in the marketplace. As we've said in the past, we typically focus on gaining share of wallet within our existing customers where they're buying product that they're not buying from us or in some cases, entering product categories or expanding their presence in categories where both of us are finding incremental revenues. I think clearly there's just flat out market growth. So, I would not \u2013 I don't think our revenue growth in our business is that far outside of what the market is growing, if you think about specialty and just straight out demographics. So I think that clearly whatever price happens in the market flows through our business, and the volumes are probably pretty typical with what the volumes are from a growth perspective at a baseline. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. And then you also mentioned tech pharmacy solutions. Is that like a new entity within your organization and like what is in that? And did that get classed in the distribution division and is that like, I guess, group of assets driving up operating expenses in the quarter relative to last year? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: So the business you're referring to is the coming together of three previous sub-businesses if you will. One that focuses historically on distributing technologies to pharmacists to help them manage their business, then the Relay Pharmacy business, which is a switch business, across which so many transactions between the pharmacy and the payer move, and then also the new acquisition of CoverMyMeds. So, I was alluding, earlier in one of my answers, to the opportunities that we're seeing for new improvements across these businesses and I'm pleased that we've been able to bring them together under a single preservant to really drive the full opportunities that we think these assets provide. I think they can be higher growth. John mentioned, they're higher margin, so there will be a particular focus on these businesses going forward. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: But as it relates to the change period-over-period, the biggest change is the movement of CoverMyMeds into McKesson and the movement out of MTS of our Relay Pharmacy business, and these businesses will carry a higher expense rate as it relates to revenue, but they carry a much higher margin as well, and once again, the margin impact to the segment was probably muted by the year-over-year lapping of the previous discussed independent pharmacy price challenges that we face. So you have a situation where the expenses come in, and the incremental margin got absorbed in the lap, and that's why you have a more difficult compare. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just digging deeper into branded pricing, especially since we're in July for mid-year. So you talked about it being slightly above expectations. Would you mind just giving some color on, are we seeing that on the rate or is it the number of price increases? And then, if you don't mind just also giving us what percentage of your gross profit dollars are still tied to pricing. I think before you've said it's around 10%. Thanks. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. I'd say the contribution from our branded manufacturer partners is still around 90% on a fixed type basis around 10 points of it coming from more variable measures around price increases, so the manufacturers take. In terms of what's going on around the branded manufacturer pricing environment, we are seeing little bit less of a frequency, it's fair to say, but also as we said in our text, the mix of which manufacturers take the price increases is important to our economics, because obviously we have a blend of contract structures some are entirely fixed and others offer us a portion of the economics that we can earn as a result of a price increase activity. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I think we have time operator for one last question. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Unknown Speaker : Hi. It's James (01:01:19) on for Charles. You mentioned earlier in the call that you're encouraged by recent developments in the pursuit of strategic alternatives for EIS. Can you elaborate on that, what new developments? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thanks for the question. Clearly, we've been focused on making sure that we think about the strategic alternatives for our EIS business. We believed there were other places where that business might be able to grow more rapidly than inside of McKesson and we've been pursuing evaluation of those strategic alternatives and my comments were nothing more than to reinforce the fact that we \u2013 the process continues to be underway and that we're encouraged by the level of interest in alternatives that we're seeing and we hope to have more news here in the short term. I want to thank you, operator, for helping us today, and thanks to all of you on your call \u2013 on the call for you time. McKesson is off to a good start for fiscal 2018 and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities to make better health possible. I'll now hand the call off to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig? Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On September 12, we will present at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference in New York. We'll release second quarter earnings results in late October. Thank you, and goodbye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

LLC Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good day, and welcome to the McKesson Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir. Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, Jessica. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 9 :00 AM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and James will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2018 results for further information, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you, and here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, Craig, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid operational performance across our business as we make continued progress towards a strong finish to our fiscal 2018. For the second quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $52 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.28, and we are reiterating our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. Before I dive into the details of the quarter, let me briefly touch upon today's announcement that Paul Julian will be retiring at the end of the calendar year. I'd like to acknowledge the tremendous contributions by Paul over the past two decades. Paul's business acumen and strategic leadership have helped us expand our market reach as well as the breadth of services and solutions we offer to our customers. His dedication and tireless commitment to our people, our customers and the industry set him apart. Starting in McKesson Health Systems, the company's distribution business for hospitals, he led many of the businesses that now comprise our Distribution Solutions segment. Paul has had a four decade career in healthcare. He has received numerous awards and throughout his career have been recognized for his many contributions. He has demonstrated exceptional character, accomplishment and leadership in the industry and in the community. I worked closely with Paul for many years and he is my friend as well as a close colleague. His perspective and insights are critical to the growth and success of McKesson, including building a deep bench of talented leaders to carry McKesson into the future. On Paul's retirement, the presidents of these businesses within Distribution Solutions will report to me. I will miss working with Paul and wish him the very best in this new chapter of his life. Turning now to our business results, our North American pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada and our recently formed McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, had year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to discuss a few highlights in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. We are recognized as a leader in delivering novel solutions to the market. We find innovative ways to expand our value proposition across the entire supply chain. For example, AccessHealth continues to successfully partner with independent pharmacies, enabling improved financial performance and broadening access to narrow patient/payer networks. We also recently closed the BDI Pharma acquisition. This business complements our existing plasma offerings and allows us to expand plasma and biologic distribution into specialty pharmacy and homecare with differentiated expertise. And ClarusONE, which is performing in line with our plan, leverages our scale and our unique in-house sourcing capabilities. These examples demonstrate our ongoing strategy to build scale, expand our pharmaceutical offerings, enhance our manufacturer value proposition, and enable our customers' continued success. Next, we're pleased with the progress of our multiyear initiative to implement differential pricing for brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC drug classes as we work through our contract renewal cycles. Finally, Walgreens' asset purchase of a number of Rite Aid stores was approved by the FTC last month. Based on Walgreens' public statements that they began last week to transition stores and will carry through the spring of 2018, we expect to be impacted in our fourth quarter as stores progressively migrate to Walgreens over the transition period. We've been having constructive dialog with Rite Aid on how we can continue to support their success, during the transition period and beyond to the mutual benefit of both parties. And as I've mentioned in the past, Rite Aid has only a modest impact on our P&L. We are comfortable that our sourcing scale and capability will not be impacted by this transition. Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health, with the closing of the intraFUSION acquisition earlier this quarter, along with the BDI Pharma acquisition I spoke about a moment ago, I'd like to highlight how we continue to enhance our specialty capabilities across the organization. We provide manufacturers with an integrated solution set starting from clinical research and development to drug launch and distribution services, and from patient reimbursement and access solutions to real world evidence-based capabilities. Biologics and biosimilars continue to represent an emerging opportunity for the industry. We are proud to be a leader, supporting clinical trials for these and other innovative new therapies for many years. And I'm excited about the opportunity that CoverMyMeds provides across our businesses with the e-Referral platform for specialty prescriptions, connecting providers with specialty pharmacies and payers and improving care coordination and care management for complex health conditions. I'll move next to our Canadian business, where we saw a nice growth in the quarter with constant currency results that were in line with our expectations. During the quarter, McKesson Canada closed the Uniprix banner acquisition, where we will continue to offer Uniprix owners retail banner management expertise and best-in-class supply chain network, designed to ensure patient safety and reduced costs. All of these services help strengthen independent pharmacies. Uniprix integration activities are progressing well as are those supporting the GMD Distribution acquisition. And our McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business continues to make progress on the CoverMyMeds integration. We are encouraged by the level of collaboration we are already seeing between CoverMyMeds and our other businesses. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services, on our last earnings call, we mentioned that recently announced reimbursement cuts in the UK were in excess of historic levels and also greater than what we planned for in fiscal 2018. After studying the nature of the cuts, we decided it was necessary to take action to position the business for sustained long-term growth by initiating a plan to rationalize our store footprint and streamline our back-office operations. As a result, we recorded certain charges within our UK retail operations. James will provide more detail on these items. We see our global retail presence as a way to stem the tide of growing healthcare costs as we anticipate more services migrating from higher-cost locations into the lower-cost pharmacy setting. And we believe that pharmacist plays an important role in providing the range of healthcare services. And finally, our Medical-Surgical business continues to deliver consistent results, benefiting from the shift of care to lower-cost sites. In summary, I was pleased with how with our Distribution Solutions segment performed in the quarter. Turning now to our Technology Solutions segment, we reached another milestone on October 2 with the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions or EIS business. This represents another important step in the strategic shift to realign our business focus on Distribution Solutions, following the creation of Change Healthcare earlier this calendar year, is a testament to the team at EIS when we consider the results they achieved for the first half of the year, given the uncertainties around the extended strategic review process that is now complete. In addition, I have confidence that EIS customers have a partner committed to their success. And for Change Healthcare, we continue to see encouraging progress against the execution of the business case and the realization of the anticipated cost synergies. And to summarize, McKesson's fiscal second quarter results represent solid execution across the enterprise, and we are reiterating our adjusted earnings range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share for our full year fiscal 2018 outlook. We are extremely well-positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mix of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends. Before I hand the call over to James, I'd like to spend a moment on a topic of national importance, the opioid epidemic. This is a crisis that has touched many Americans, and including many Americans that live here at McKesson and are part of our family. McKesson takes our role in the supply chain very seriously. We've invested considerable time and resources to help stop diversion at a time when diversion tactics are constantly changing. We've implemented sophisticated analytic tools, hired experienced diversion investigators, and enhanced the effectiveness of our controlled substance monitoring program. We work collaboratively with the DEA to better understand diversion trends. This working relationship is critical, since the DEA has singular line of sight into the total volume of opioids sold to any licensed pharmacy or hospital. The trends in this crisis continue to evolve, and we are regularly enhancing our programs to further limit the misuse and abuse of prescription opioids while simultaneously protecting the availability of the appropriate treatments for patients with serious illnesses and injuries. But our company's, and our industry's, commitment to public health and safety was recently called into question by certain media outlets. Those outlets sought to place blame for the tragic opioid epidemic on distributors and elected officials who, with bipartisan Congressional support and after consultation and input from the DEA and the Department of Justice, enacted a clarifying enforcement bill that was signed into law. As recent Congressional testimony indicated, since the passage of the law, the quantity of opioids distributed has decreased, and the number of enforcement actions by the DEA has increased. Many press articles have since corrected the misinformation that resulted from those earlier media stories and subsequently, there has also been more attention put on the need to control the annual production of opioids, on the illicit opioids entering our country from other sources, and on the critical role of healthcare professionals who are at the frontlines in dealing with patients and ensuring that only patients with legitimate medical needs receive the appropriate amount of these medications. McKesson is also committed to helping promote forward-looking solutions to this public health problem. That's why over a year ago, we convened a taskforce of policy and clinical experts to help create a public policy white paper, which outlined a set of proposals to help combat the epidemic going forward. These proposals include changing the medical community's approach to prescribing opioids, requiring e-prescribing to avoid modification or manipulation of the prescription. It created a national patient safety network that provides real-time patient information to pharmacists while they're directly interacting with the patients seeking these drugs. We look forward to continuing to work with all parties; federal, state and local governments, manufacturers, insurance companies, pharmacies, and the medical profession, to implement practical and effective solutions. And last, let me touch upon the tragedies that recently unfolded across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. McKesson was fortunate to have avoided material impacts to our operations or to our facilities from the devastation resulting from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the recent fires across Northern California. We are proud to have played a role in the emergency efforts, providing pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to the affected areas. Our employees in the McKesson Foundation have been extremely generous with their support for displaced coworkers and other residents, contributing more than $700,000 in relief efforts. We continue to aid in the recovery of our affected employees, customers, and communities. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.28, which was slightly better than our previous expectations, and we are reiterating our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. Unless stated otherwise, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 press release, and on our first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call, are being reiterated today. I will talk in more detail about our outlook, but first let's review our results fourth quarter. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations equated to $0.01 for the second quarter. These earnings include impairment and restructuring charges of $2.60 per diluted share related to our retail pharmacy business in the UK. As we discussed on our last earnings call in July, the UK government announced additional reimbursement cuts, which were incremental to their more typical annual reimbursement reductions and to those assumed in our plan. Primarily as a result of these cuts, we have identified and started to implement initiatives to partially offset the impact of these cuts, which include approximately 190 store closures and divestitures. The resulting savings from this program are expected to more meaningfully benefit our fiscal 2019 performance. The program's total asset impairment and restructuring charges are expected to be between $650 million and $750 million. Specific to the second quarter, we recorded goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment and restructuring pre-tax charges totaling $586 million. As a reminder, these charges will impact our GAAP financial results. However, they will be excluded from adjusted earnings. Now let's turn to our second quarter adjusted earnings, which exclude the following items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges, and other adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2 and 3. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 4% in constant currency year-over-year. Second quarter adjusted gross profit was up 2% in constant currency from a year ago, and second quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 6% in constant currency year-over-year. Adjusted other income was $27 million for the quarter, an increase of 8% in constant currency. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $75 million for the second quarter. We are encouraged by the progress of Change Healthcare and continue to expect our adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare joint venture will be between $250 million and $310 million in McKesson's fiscal 2018 P&L. Interest expense of $69 million decreased 12% in constant currency for the quarter, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate was 23.6% for the quarter, driven by our mix of business. Our full year tax rate for McKesson is now estimated to be approximately 24%, down from our previous estimate of 25%, reflecting our mix of business. Our income attributable to non-controlling interest, or NCI, was $55 million for the quarter, an increase of 218% in constant currency. As a reminder, the increase in NCI year-over-year is primarily driven by fee income from ClarusONE, a joint sourcing entity with Walmart. We now expect income attributable to non-controlling interests to be between $210 million and $230 million in fiscal 2018, reflecting ClarusONE's ongoing success at sourcing generics at prices lower than we originally expected. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $689 million with our second quarter adjusted EPS at $3.28 per diluted share, up 11% compared to $2.96 in the prior year. Our second quarter EPS growth was driven by organic growth across multiple business units, including ClarusONE, a lower share count and incremental profit contribution from acquisitions, which more than offset the year-over-year lapping effect of increased price competition in our independent pharmacy business in fiscal 2017 and the impact of reduced reimbursement in our UK retail pharmacy business. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 210 million, down 8% compared to the prior-year period. Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were $51.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 5% year-over-year. Reported revenues benefited from $344 million in favorable currency rate movements. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by brand-to-generic conversions. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.8 billion for the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, revenues were up 4%, driven by acquisitions and market growth. Reported revenues benefited from $237 million in favorable currency rate movements. As a reminder, our previous full year assumption was that foreign currency exchange rate movements would have a net unfavorable impact of up to $0.05 per diluted share year-over-year. During the quarter, foreign currency rates trended favorably versus our original assumptions. As a result, we now expect foreign currency exchange rate movements will have a net favorable impact of approximately $0.10 for the year. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 2% for the second quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit was up 15% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by acquisitions, organic growth across multiple business units, including strategic sourcing benefits from ClarusONE and increased branded compensation, more than offsetting the planned year-over-year lapping effect of increased competition in our independent pharmacy business in fiscal 2017 and the impact of reduced reimbursement in our UK retail pharmacy business. As we discussed previously, following the close of the second quarter, we have now fully lapped the impact of increased competition in our independent pharmacy business and the sell-side pricing environment continues to remain competitive with less pricing variability. Now, let me turn to branded compensation and branded pharmaceutical price increases. As noted on our first quarter earnings call, based on our previously discussed differential pricing effort, we renewed contracts with two large branded manufacturers during the first quarter. These renewals drove lower compensation in the first quarter and a resulting step-up in compensation in the second quarter. Additionally, in the second quarter, we also benefited from a pull forward of certain branded compensation that we had expected in the third quarter. That said, our expectations for the full year contribution from branded compensation remain unchanged. I'd like to remind everyone, however, as is typical based on our historical experience, that the majority of manufacturer pricing activity is expected to occur in our fiscal fourth quarter. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses increased 18% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase driven by acquisitions and the increased mix of retail business in the segment, partially offset by our ongoing cost management efforts. Going forward, we expect our full year adjusted operating expenses as a percent of revenue to be at levels roughly consistent with the first half of this year. As we diversify our Distribution Solutions businesses, our adjusted gross profit margin rate benefits from our recent retail pharmacy and technology acquisitions. Similarly, these acquisitions are increasing our adjusted operating expenses as a percent of revenue. Now, to our adjusted operating profit. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit was up 12% in constant currency year-over-year, at $1 billion. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 201 basis points on a constant currency basis, an increase of 13 basis points driven by the same factors as previously discussed, partially offset by our customer and product mix, including the growth of higher-priced specialty pharmaceuticals. As a result of this revenue mix and the pressures on our UK business, we now expect our full year Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin rate to be at the lower half of our previously guided range of 198 basis points to 208 basis points. Now, moving to Technology Solutions, as a reminder, in fiscal 2018, MTS segment revenues, adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses contain only the results of our Enterprise Information Solutions business, or EIS. Revenues were $120 million, while adjusted segment gross profit was $60 million. Adjusted segment operating expenses were $44 million and adjusted operating profit, excluding the equity contribution from Change Healthcare, was $17 million. Additionally, following the close of the quarter, we completed the sale of our EIS business. As a result, there will be no contribution from this business in the second half of fiscal 2018. As a result, going forward, MTS operating profit will represent only the equity contribution from Change Healthcare. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 1 day from the prior year to 27 days. Our days sales in inventory increased 2 day from the prior year to 31 days, and our days sales in payables increased 2 days from the prior year to 61 days. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.6 billion with approximately $1.9 billion held offshore. And in the first six months of fiscal 2018, McKesson generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations. We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, we spent $255 million on internal capital investments and repaid $545 million in the long-term debt. In the second quarter, we repurchased $400 million in common stock. The FY 2018 EPS impact of this buyback approximately offsets the loss of EIS' earnings in the back half of this fiscal year. Share repurchases during the first six months of fiscal 2018 now totaled $650 million. And we now expect our weighted average diluted shares to be approximately 211 million for the full year, reflecting share repurchases completed in fiscal 2018. We have approximately $2.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We spent $1.9 billion on acquisitions during the first six months of fiscal 2018, which includes the second quarter acquisitions of intraFUSION, BDI Pharma and Uniprix, all of which we discussed at Investor Day. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the next quarterly dividend of $0.34. Now, let me briefly touch on Rite Aid. Our original guidance range assumed a full year revenue contribution from Rite Aid of approximately $13 billion and an estimated annual adjusted earnings per share contribution of between $0.20 and $0.40. We also noted that should Rite Aid be acquired by Walgreens, we would expect a material one-time cash flow impact driven by the favorable working capital terms associated with our generics business. In September, Walgreens announced it had received regulatory clearance to purchase approximately 40% of Rite Aid stores and that some store transitions would begin this month and all impacted stores would be a part of Walgreens operations by the spring of 2018. We will keep you updated on the earnings and cash flow impact of the eventual store transition program during the next two quarters. While our relationship with Rite Aid will be smaller going forward, the performance of ClarusONE continues to illustrate the competitiveness of our global sourcing scale and operations. Now, let me provide more detail on our fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS outlook. We are reiterating our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. This reiterated range includes the earnings headwinds of the recently completed sale of our EIS business, an estimate of the effect of the Rite Aid store transition and our projection of the challenges expected in the UK during the remainder of FY 2018. Offsetting these headwinds, our guidance range benefits from share repurchases completed in the second quarter, the anticipated favorability to results driven by foreign currency exchange rate movements, and the new estimated adjusted tax rate of approximately 24%. The various items that I've just mentioned largely offset one another, resulting in our reiteration of the previously-guided range. Each year, as we develop our annual plan, we contemplate a range of possible outcomes. Based on our performance year-to-date, I continue to be comfortable with the midpoint represented by our full year guide. As for our quarterly progression, let me remind you of my earlier comments regarding the pull forward of branded compensation that we had originally expected in the third quarter. And, as in most previous years, we expect our fourth quarter to be our largest in terms of EPS contribution in the fiscal year. In closing, our second quarter results were somewhat ahead of our expectations, driven by timing. And I'm pleased to be able to reiterate our full year guide in the face of the sale of EIS, the transition of the Rite Aid stores, and the UK headwinds. And as a reminder, our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share excludes the following items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.40 to $2.70 per diluted share, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $0.90 to $1.10 per diluted share, LIFO inventory-related charges of $0.20 to credits of $0.10 per diluted share, gains from antitrust legal settlements of up to $0.10 per diluted share, restructuring charges of $1.10 to $1.40 per diluted share, and other net charges of $1.40 to $1.60 per diluted share. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Jessica? Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And we'll first go to Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the question. James, lot of moving parts, but wanted to make sure I understood what was factored into the full year guidance today versus the previous update. So just, is it correct to assume that guidance now contemplates roughly an additional $30 million from additional UK reimbursement cuts that weren't in the previous guidance? And then, with the EIS divestiture or sale intra-quarter, is that about $35 million that you're absorbing into the full year range that's unchanged? Are those the two biggest new things that we should be thinking about in the full year guidance range? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, in terms of the three headwinds UK, EIS, and Rite Aid, so in the UK, I would say the figure is higher than what you were mentioning there. So, we'll update you as time goes by. With EIS, as I mentioned, feel as though the EPS impact in FY 2018 of the buyback roughly offsets what we would have benefited from EIS in our back half of the year. And for Rite Aid, you can think about the original guide that we put out of $0.20 to $0.40, effectively, we're going to have about a 10% effect of that in the balance of the fiscal year. So, hopefully that helps give you a little bit of direction around that. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No, it does. I guess just ultimately trying to get a better sense that, there really was not a change to the core drug distribution outlook then, as we think about the previous update relative to this update? Is that a fair statement? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: That's right, because, again, the three items, the UK, the EIS, and Rite Aid, obviously, two of those are embedded within the Distribution Solutions business. Those are, in essence, being offset by share count, tax rate, and FX assumptions. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just, John, a quick follow-up, two significant management departures announced this week. Can you talk about the process, as you think about backfilling, big shoes to fill, with Paul and Mark's departures announced this week? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Sure. As you might expect, the management team and the board have a very rigorous process of, not only talent development and talent review and sort of talent planning, but also a lot of work is done, particularly at the higher levels, in terms of succession planning. So yeah, Paul and I have worked together for an awfully long time, and one of the priorities we've had together for that entire tenure together has been the development of a very strong bench. We announced very quickly a replacement for Mark Walchirk upon his departure, and we're really pleased at, not only the contribution he's made to us over his career, but the fact that he landed in an important job, and it shows that McKesson executives are sought after and that they're well-trained and that they can take on big responsibilities. So, I think that's the good part of that news for him certainly, and we're excited that we are able to replace him, in the new combined responsibility for both our U.S. Pharmaceutical business and our Specialty business, with Nick Loporcaro. You probably met Nick on occasion on our Investor Days. Nick runs our Specialty business now, and will also have the combined responsibility for our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. And frankly, I think Nick is very well-suited for this job. He ran all of our Canadian distribution and operations businesses in Canada. He knows retail pharmacy well. He knows hospital pharmacy. He knows independence and chains. He understands the manufacturing environment. He certainly understands what we think is a significant going-forward opportunity in Specialty. So, we're excited about his leadership and what he can do for us. And as I said, it's not as if Paul was going to be here forever and we've been always thinking about how are we going to make sure that we're well positioned in the event that he decides to pursue retirement. So, I'm excited for Paul, excited for Mark and especially excited for Nick. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for that. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Operator : And we'll now go to Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to follow up on the cadence in the guidance. So James, is there any \u2013 you talked about the pull forward \u2013 I'm sorry, the step up in 2Q from the manufacturer contracts. Are there any kind of step-downs in the back half of the year that we should be aware of? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I would say, as you think about the progression of Q3 and Q4 and the relative contribution of those quarter to the full year, I would see Q4 generating a number of percentage points more than Q3 will. And, indeed, I commented on that, that trend pull forward into Q2 from Q3. So, I think that, hopefully, helps a little bit on the sequencing of the quarter. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That does. And then, John, you talked about moving into differential pricing. Can you comment on the progress that you've seen so far? And particularly, are you seeing any kind of pushback from clients, maybe from some of your larger ones? And maybe can you help characterize what those discussions look like? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the question, Charles. We have been in a consistent process with our renewals of our agreements with our customers and I think we've been quite successful. Our customer base understands that the pricing that we used 20 years ago, which were basically a brand and generic and even mostly brand if you go back that far, just doesn't work in today's environment. And having a more specific approach to pricing categories of products that are more similar to one another, we think, is better for us and, frankly, better for them as well. You're not mixing discounts between different types of products and different revenue and margin characteristics, and this provides better clarity for both of us. So, I think we've been almost universally successful in getting this accomplished, and we feel confident we will continue to do so as we finish this contract renewal cycle over the next several years. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll now move to George Hill from RBC. George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions, and if Paul is listening, I want to wish him well, John, because I know he served you a long time. I guess, James, I would ask, is there any chance that you can quantify kind of the impact of ClarusONE and the brand drug pull forward in the quarter? And should we think of the brand drug impact is not repeatable in Q3, but ClarusONE should be a more sustainable contribution? Like, I'm just trying to make sure I have a good understanding of the cadence of the balance of the year. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah in terms of the branded compensation, as I mentioned, where \u2013 we do have these timing elements from Q1 to Q2, Q3 into Q2, but for the overall year, we're not expecting a change in the branded comp that we would receive. In terms of ClarusONE and their work around the generics, we've been very pleased with how that has proceeded. I mentioned in my remarks that the NCI line reflects the progress that ClarusONE has been making at sourcing pharmaceutical at lower prices than we had expected at the outset of the year. So, our COGS are benefiting, our Walmart's colleagues COGS are benefiting from the progress that ClarusONE is making. George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Then maybe my follow-up would just be a little bit nuanced. Is that the \u2013 the outperformance in the quarter, I guess, versus consensus expectations was pretty strong. Should we think of that largely as the timing of the brand contribution verses maybe what the Street might have been expecting for the year? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, that's certainly one driver of it. Obviously, tax rates has come down as well. We've updated our full year guide in that regard. And I did note that Q2's results were slightly ahead of where we had planned to be originally at the start of the year. George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning and congrats on a very good quarter. So, two questions. First, John, for you. We're hearing, obviously, a lot of discussion and getting a lot of questions on Amazon. Can you just share with us your thoughts? And also, do you see opportunity for you guys to work together with Amazon if they were to enter the drug supply chain? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the question, Ricky. To some extent, we were Amazon before it was cool to be Amazon. Now, if you think about our business model, largely it is an online order relationship. From an order processing perspective, it is very well functioning that has been in place for a long time, next-day delivery and a complete process from a logistics perspective. But it's also supported by field salespeople, return goods management, sometimes private trucking, and certainly things like controlled substance management, billions of dollars of inventory, and very significant back-office operations that reconcile the significant delta in various pricing strategies that are our manufacturer partners, both in medical supplies as well as in pharmaceuticals, rely upon with us in partnership. So, I would say, in some ways, it's very similar to what Amazon would do maybe logistically. But if you actually think about what's behind the scenes in terms of us taking credit risk, in terms of us processing invoices and processing returns, and then processing pricing on a regular basis, it's quite significant and more nuanced, perhaps, than it would appear on the surface. Clearly, we are also heavily focused on trying to make sure that our customers have the right tools and capabilities to help them with all of their \u2013 particularly in the independent side with all of their requirements in terms of patient relationships to make it more than just a transaction and make it a healthcare experience supported by a professional pharmacist that really understands the nuances of drug-to-drug interaction, understands what it means to dispense things like opioids and other products, and understands certainly the regulatory framework and the larger clinical issues that may be facing the patients that they're working with everyday. So, the easiest thing to talk about in the world of wholesaling is the logistics function. But I would say that that's probably the simplest part of our business. And clearly, we try to excel in myriad of other areas that we think differentiate us. Having said all of that, we don't take the entry of any competitor lightly and we continue to evolve our strategy so that our value to both the manufacturer and to our customers is unique and superior. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you for that. And then, just a follow-up question in terms of the guide and the progression. So, you've tightened the range on your LIFO credits. So, what are you seeing in terms of the deflationary environment? How do you think about the progression for the second half of your fiscal year? And then also, how should we think about that in the context of your Distribution operating margin goals for the fiscal year? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, in terms of generic deflation, as we've discussed before, ClarusONE is doing an excellent job. We're purchasing pharmaceuticals at lower prices than we'd expected when we first put the plan together. Now, again, as we've discussed, that equation of optimizing our cost of goods sold is quite separate to the economic equation on the sell side, where I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, suddenly, the environment is still competitive, but with less pricing volatility than we would have been looking at this time last year. In terms of our Distribution Solutions operating margin guide, I felt appropriate to really direct you to the lower half of that original guided range, based on the UK situation that we've been discussing at some length. And then, of course, there'll be some effect on the P&L that will impact the Distribution Solutions operating margin from Rite Aid as well as those stores transition at a yet-to-be-determined rate. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : We will now go to Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. I also want to add my congratulations to Paul on his retirement and we'll definitely miss him, John. First, just trying to reconcile a number of the statements that have been said today. James, you just talked about sell-side pressure continuing being less volatile, you talked about the benefit to COGS on ClarusONE. Is the expectation, as we move throughout the rest of the fiscal year, that you have to share some of that ClarusONE savings back with customers? I'm just trying to understand how do we think about ClarusONE, specifically, as we're thinking about the cadence of the quarter? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think the best way to think about it, as James mentioned a moment ago, is really in two distinct buckets. Our ability to manage our costs across the board are an important aspect of what we do, whether it's a cost of our operations and the productivity improvements we get or whether it's a cost of the goods we purchase, driving those costs down to market levels or below should be our priority, and our focus has always been to buy right and to manage right and to be efficient. The second priority is to make sure that our customers are getting the deal that they need to continue to be competitive in the marketplace. And largely, that's determined on what the market price is for products. So, we have a completely separate team that decides what we're going to sell products for from what the team is that does the buying of our activity. And we're focused on making sure that we have the right data on both sides of those operations to assure ourselves of market competitiveness, and that's what we're attempting to do and that's where the margin comes from is our ability to manage those operations with, hopefully, solid execution. So that's the way we think about it. So, the more we overachieve the ClarusONE and the more stable the market can be, then more likely it is for us to get margin expansion over time to grow our business, and that should be our priority for it (50:21) to create value. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, John, you did mention in your prepared comments, talking about the opioid issue in the U.S. and talking about these media reports, over the last several years, the drug distributors have had several settlements around DEA issues, et cetera. Can you maybe just talk about what your anticipation is around opioids? Would you expect that there will be some cash flow impact, we'll see incremental settlements? Or do you think that that's largely behind you at this point and this is more of a regulatory issue rather than the states coming back to the drug distributors looking for some kind of settlement? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, in a larger context, not even speaking necessarily about this particular issue, when you're faced with litigation or litigation risk, you usually find opportunities to try to determine whether or not there's any real risk there or any data that would support the alleged activity or risk that you may be facing. And you trade that off against what would it cost for us to not \u2013 to eliminate that risk, and the associated potential liability of that (51:37) if you're not successful. So, I think all of those decisions are made on their own and probably in isolation from one another. Are we concerned about opioid and the continued risk and things that are going on in the marketplace? Certainly, but we're probably more focused \u2013 as I tried to mention in my conversation at the beginning here, we're more focused on solutions that we think can make a difference. Frankly, lawsuits from various parties and settlements don't solve the problem. What solves the problem is thinking in a broader context and putting the solutions in place that can actually prevent this from happening. And when I mentioned physicians at the start of this, it really is related to how they think about the prescriptions they're providing to their patients and the quantities that they're writing in those scripts. Clearly, whether the script is legitimate or not when it shows up at the pharmacy, if we use electronic prescribing, that can make a difference. And third, if we have information about the patient real-time in the workflow at the pharmacy when they're doing the rest of their adjudication of the claim if they understood that the patient recently had four other scripts filled in the last two weeks from five different pharmacies across state lines, it might give them a little bit of a pause before they yet fill one more script. And that's certainly a portion of the problem and we think those solutions can be easily implemented. We think the technologies are available today and it will make a material impact, certainly on that source of the opioid diversion epidemic challenge. There's a whole other source. If you watch the news today, they talk about coming over borders. They talk about it being imported from other countries, and online ordering of these kinds of drugs that are packaged in different types of packaging to avoid detection. There's all kinds of sources of these products. And clearly, at the very start of this whole thing is, how do we help prevent people from becoming addicted to these drugs to begin with. So, it is a much larger problem. We're trying to focus on solutions. And some people ask me if this is going to be a tobacco overhang, and I don't think that's what we're going to face as an industry. Clearly, we have a role to play, but we don't see the patient. We don't prescribe the drugs. We don't dispense the drugs. We don't have all the data on the care, and I don't know how we can be responsible, solely, for this challenge. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I agree. I appreciate your comments. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Kevin Caliendo from Needham & Company. Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks for taking my call. So, another question on ClarusONE. Looking at the non-controlling interest line, it was sort of flat sequentially and for the year, your guidance implies not a significant amount of growth in that number over the course of the year. I guess my question is, is ClarusONE a growth opportunity sort of going forward, or are we sort of peaking? Is it something that can grow as we get into fiscal 2019? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think when we talk about ClarusONE, it's important to think about the two places on our P&L where it drives the benefit. So, the first place is the cost of goods sold. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: And maybe I can jump in there, because the NCI is really not an indication of ClarusONE's opportunity and its growth. It is an accounting-related matter that James will address here in just a moment. But we see a great opportunity with ClarusONE, frankly. Today, it's focused primarily on generics. And as James mentioned, we actually overachieved our objectives, in terms of the results of our sourcing activity, and it's being reflected in our cost of goods. And obviously, we're pleased with that. But beyond just generics, and beyond just generics in the U.S., we think ClarusONE can grow. Walmart is very satisfied with what we've done thus far, and our ability to expand into other product categories and other geographies in partnership with Walmart, we think, will be continued opportunities for us to grow the ClarusONE relationship and thus, the impact on ClarusONE's cost of goods into our businesses and other categories. And that may or may not affect the NCI line. The NCI is really an artifact of the current construct of the generic relationships we have and the JV partnership that we have. And it's an output, basically, from that relationship, as opposed to something else will be put into this category, OTCs or something else, may not have an NCI component to them. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: So, think of the cost of goods sold line as the line that receives the primary benefit from the work of ClarusONE, then the NCI line is \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's fee income. So, think of that as the fees earned by ClarusONE, which is a contracting entity, in many ways. And so again, in the text, I mentioned that the future guide for the NCI line is really underpinned by the fact that, as ClarusONE continues to have more success than we originally planned for in its sourcing capabilities, then there'd be a lesser level of fee income enjoyed by ClarusONE. So, I think that's an important distinction to make between COGS and the NCI line, and then focusing on the NCI line as fee income from a contracting outfit. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: And there are other things in NCI that aren't related to ClarusONE at all. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, yeah. There are multiple other drivers in the NCI line. So, those can drive volatility in any one particular quarter. Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: That's incredibly helpful. One just quick follow-up. You spent about $1.9 billion in acquisitions. You've highlighted them to us already. Is there any potential impact from these acquisitions in the second half of this year, or will the benefits be mostly a fiscal 2019 type of event? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think it's most likely going to fall into FY 2019. We contemplated the closure of some of these acquisitions as we provided the original guidance, and we knew that certain of these transactions were going to close. But I don't think they'll have any material impact on our FY 2018 guidance. And whatever impact we do anticipate is embedded in our reaffirmation of that guidance today. Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys, so much. Operator : We will now go to Eric Coldwell from Baird. Eric, your line is open Hearing no response, we'll move to Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. A follow-up to the last question, I guess, can you give us an update on the performance and where we stand with some of the potential synergies and contributions from some of the recent acquisitions, like CoverMyMeds and Rexall and Biologics? And can you also speak to maybe the profit profile of some of the more recent acquisitions that you've done? Thanks. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. I'd say that our approach to the integrations of those various transactions that you note are going along nicely. We're hitting our synergy cases and so forth. So no, we're pleased. We feel as though those acquisitions fit very nicely with the strategies that we're pursuing across our organization. So, in terms of... John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: The margin profile... James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. That... John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: As I say, that was going to follow more aligned with the kind of businesses that they are. So, the distribution-related businesses will have more of a distribution margin and the technology businesses, like CoverMyMeds, will have a margin rate that's much higher and much similar to the rest. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. And one further thing that I would note, going back to how we were talking about operating expenditure for the full year, multiple of those transactions, those acquisitions fall into either the retail arena or the technology arena. And in those types of businesses, you tend to have more operating expenditures as a percent of revenue than would be the norm for our traditional business. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: That's in the OpEx line. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. And then, I guess, a follow-up to that one as well. I mean, as you think about your capital deployment strategy and the priorities there in terms of acquisitions, I guess, do you see sort of a healthy pipeline out there, opportunities potentially in tangential businesses? And what sort of annual deal spend are \u2013 do you continue to expect at this point? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: It's probably difficult to speculate on what the annual deal spent would be. I think what's best for us to sort of reaffirm here is that we do prefer M&A. But as you know, we do this in a portfolio way. We're not afraid to do share repurchases. We talked about our share repurchases in the quarter and we clearly talked about our dividend again in this press release and we talked about M&A. The critical thing, from my perspective, is that the M&A has to make financial sense. And we focus on our long-term cost of capital and making sure that these acquisitions come in well above our cost of capital and that we get the kind of returns that are appropriate on these investments. And the answer to the other part of your question, we do have a pipeline of acquisitions that we actively work almost seemingly all the time. And sometimes, they come to be and sometimes they don't, for various reasons, but I think we're pleased there are still opportunities for us in various markets. I think we have time for one more question, Jessica. Operator : And we'll go to John Ransom from Raymond James. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Oh, boy, I get to be last. That's better than nothing. So, thank you for squeezing me in. I'm sorry that was \u2013 I didn't mean that to be serious. Just one thing in our model that there seem to be a big sequential drop in depreciation from the second quarter. So, the EBIT number was better, but the EBITDA number was a little below our number. Can you provide some help on that number? Is this the new normal given some of the portfolio changes that you've made? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, perhaps, one thing to note is that as we proceeded to be close to the sale of EIS to Allscripts, that transaction closed on the first day of Q3. But in terms of the way our accounting runs, we put it as held-for-sale in Q2. So, that might be one of the items that you'd want to focus on. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: But I mean \u2013 so you are running about, what, $27 million or something in depreciation in the third \u2013 it was (1:03:05) like a $70 million drop. I'm just asking on a go-forward basis, is this the right depreciation number for the back half of the year? James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I wouldn't expect anything material in terms of the rate and pace of change in depreciation. But we can certainly follow up with you... John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: ...John, on the specifics. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thanks so much. John H.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead sir. Craig Mercer : Thank you, Ciciliya. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson\u2019s fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Britt Vitalone, McKesson\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and then Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt\u2019s comments we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end to call promptly after one hour at 9 :00 AM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the Company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the Company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2018 results for further information, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you, and here's John Hammergren. John Hammergren : Thanks, Craig, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid operational performance and we have raised and narrowed fiscal 2018 guidance range of $11.80 to $12.50, to a new range of $12.50 to $12.80, driven by a lower tax rate and lower share count. First the third quarter we generated total company revenues of more than $53 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.41.  Before I delve into the details of the quarter let me briefly touch on a couple of recent developments. We are excited to have just closed the acquisition of RxCrossroads. We are committed to broadening and deepening our portfolio of solutions and services to better serve our pharmaceutical and biotechnology or biopharma manufacturer partners\u2019 needs. Our vision is to be the partner of choice across the product life cycle by creating a comprehensive, best-in-class, differentiated set of services. RxCrossroads expands and improves our existing services and third-party logistics, reimbursement access and health and pharmacy solutions. It also compliments our offerings to include upstream plasma logistics and specialized field support. The integration of this business with our existing biopharma facing solutions will enhance our ability to provide turnkey solutions for our manufacturer partners. To assure patients get access to innovative therapies to enable rapid market penetration of products and help manufactures create value. And for payers, we can provide evidence in a value-based way to highlight the best solutions for the patients they server. In summary, we have a unique set of capabilities that bring a superior value proposition to our bio pharma partners. In the third quarter we made the decision to bring the capabilities of our Specialty Health and businesses under Nick Loporcaro\u2019s strong leadership, which will allow us to more closely coordinate and optimize how we provide service and solutions to our manufacturer and provider partners across the health care landscape. Many of you have met Nick at prior Investor Day events. He brings extensive experience to leadership positions he has held at McKesson Canada and McKesson Specialty Health. As some of you may recall when we were beginning to build our specialty franchise more than a decade ago, we made the decision to carve out these assets from our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in order to incubate high growth opportunity to maturity. Now that our specialty franchise is well established and a leader in the market, a decision to combine Specialty Health and U.S. Pharmaceutical under Nick\u2019s leadership is a natural next step in the evolution of these businesses. And for retail pharmacy customers with our recent acquisition of acquisition of Well.ca, we have strengthened our ecommerce capabilities hopping to provide an omni-channel presence in serving our customers in a way that works for them. In addition to leveraging digital capabilities, our suite of retail pharmacy services extends beyond simply filling the prescription. For instance, we connect the patient digitally with the pharmacists for medication education, treatment protocols and medicine scheduling reminders, which drive adherence across our global retail footprint. Turning now to our business results, our North American pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada and McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, had year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 7% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to discuss a few highlights in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Health. The business is now headed by Nick. I'm extremely pleased with the progress of ClarusONE and its strong contribution to our results this year. We have contracted a diverse range of manufacturers delivering benefits to our partner Walmart and more broadly, with all of our customers who purchase generics through us, helping them to be more successful in a competitive and dynamic market. Next we continue to implement differential pricing for brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC drug classes, as they work through our contract renewal cycles. We are pleased with the results and remain focused on receiving fair compensation for the services we provide for each drug category. Finally, we are working closely with Rite to ensure the successful transition of the allotted stores to Wallgreen. We continue to deliver exceptional value to Rite every day and we remain comfortable that our sourcing scale and capability has not been \u2013 will be impacted by this transition. In addition to my earlier comments on the RxCrossroads\u2019 acquisition, and the breadth of our capabilities we are building and the support of biopharma companies, the intraFUSION acquisition enhances our muti-specialty footprint with the focus on neurology and rheumatology. I\u2019m happy to report that the team is executing the integration plan and we are doing well relative to the business case. Additionally, the BDI Pharma business we acquired last quarter is a solid compliment to our existing plasma offering that allows us to expand plasma and biologics distributions into specialty pharmacy and homecare with differentiated expertise. We\u2019re also pleased with the progress on integrating this transaction. I\u2019ll move next to our Canadian business, where we saw nice growth in the quarter with constant currency results that were in line with our expectations as we passed the one year mark, following our acquisition of Rexall. We\u2019re also encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making on integrating and executing against the business cases of our Uniprix and GMD Distribution acquisitions. Before I move on, I wanted to comment on the recently announced generic price initiative by the Canadian Provincial Government. The initiative, which is effect of April 1, 2018, will reduce the pricing of approximately 70 commonly used generic drugs. We have a broad range of businesses in Canada which are growing strongly. While certain of our businesses will be affected by this initiative, we are evaluating the economic impact of these reductions. We are engaged in the dialogue with the governments around ensuring fair compensation for the wholesale and retail services we provide to drive better health. And within our prescription, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, which has demonstrated excellent revenue growth, CoverMyMeds is honored with Frost & Sullivan's 2017 North American Visionary Innovation Leadership Award, recognizing our prior authorization solutions. While this award highlights the innovation and solutions we bring to the market, more important it demonstrates how we deliver value to pharmacists, manufactures, providers and payors. Turning now to our results for International Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services, we made progress on addressing the challenges facing our UK retail business that we announced in conjunction with our second quarter results. We are actively in the process of either closing or selling approximately 200 retail pharmacy locations. Although we have concerns with the current UK reimbursement environment, we remain committed to supporting our pharmacy customers. We do this by making it easier for patients to get what they need, whether they are through services like Click and Collect, Lloyds Online Doctor or the ability to consult with a pharmacist when you visit a store. Additionally, we collect data and provide analytics which helps retail pharmacies manage individual patients, drive adherence and deliver better health outcomes. When we put these assets together, it demonstrates how our investments provide pharmacies with a comprehensive offering to reduce time and administrative activities, while improving the focus on patient care. And finally, our medical surgical business continues to be one of the fastest growing businesses in our portfolio, reflecting strong market growth, including the benefits from a shift to lower class sites of care. We continue to expand our services to medical surgical manufactures. I\u2019ll highlight our success in the last business where we serve as a sales team for certain manufactures that focus on the physician and community hospital labs. This is a great example of the unique value we will bring to the manufacturers for expanding the range of services our customers can provide to diagnose and treat patients for a variety of clinical conditions. In summary, I\u2019m pleased with how our Distribution Solutions segment preformed in the third quarter.  Turning briefly to our Technology Solutions segment, beginning with this quarter, this segment consist solely of our 70% equity investment in Change Healthcare following the successful sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business in early October. We continue to see progress against the execution of the business case and a realization of the anticipated cost synergies. Next let me take a moment to provide our perspective on the recently enacted federal tax reform. We\u2019re a supporter of the tax reform and believe that it will allow U.S. companies to make new investments and to improve their competitive position. Our complex, and scope and nature we recognized a net benefit from the tax changes. Any cash realized from the reform will be deployed using our portfolio approach with the goal of delivering value for our shareholders through mix of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.  In addition, we expect Change Healthcare to benefit from the recently enacted tax reform, given it is predominantly a U.S. focused business. Britt will provide you with more detail on the impact of tax reform. And to summarize, McKesson's fiscal third quarter results represented continued execution across the enterprise, and we are raising and narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 from $11.80 to $12.50 to a new range of $12.50 to $12.80 per diluted share. Before I turn the call over to Britt Vitalone, our new CFO, I want to take a moment to thank James Beer for his contributions. I appreciate the support over the past four years. Some of you have already met Britt and know his background. But for those of you who don't, I'm happy to share some details with you. During his 12-year tenure with McKesson, Britt has led the corporate FDA and M&A finance functions, was CFO of our Medical-Surgical business and most recently served as CFO of our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Health businesses. He also has deep operational experience, which included the creation of the ClarusONE joint sourcing venture, which is delivering material generic sourcing benefits. While I'm pleased to have worked alongside James Beer over the last four years, our ability to immediately name a successor reflects our deep bench of talent. I look forward to continuing to work with Britt in his new role. With that, I'll turn the call over to Britt and return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt? Britt Vitalone : Good morning. And thank you for your kind remarks, John. As this marks the first time I'm addressing our investment community on an earnings call, I want to take a moment to make a few opening remarks. I'd also like to start by thanking James Beer for his leadership over the past four years. He's had a tremendous impact on the company, and I've enjoyed working closely with him. I wish James all the best. I've been in the role a few weeks now, and I'm excited about the opportunities have in front of us, and the opportunity to serve as McKesson CFO. I look forward to working with our investors and the analyst community. Finally, I'm going to briefly mention our current segment reporting. With Paul Julian's retirement as of the beginning of the calendar year, we are currently evaluating our operating structure. I anticipate that this review will result in a change to our existing segment reporting structure beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We'll provide an update and additional details on our fourth quarter earnings call in May. Turning now to the results of our fiscal third quarter. Today, we reported third quarter adjusted EPS of $3.41, reflecting solid operating results, a lower tax rate driven in part by discrete tax benefits and a lower share count. And as a result of a lower tax rate and lower share count, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook to $12.50 to 12.80 per diluted share. Let me start with a review of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We believe the new tax law is positive for business and for McKesson. As noted in our press release this morning, our third quarter GAAP results reflect material benefit stemming from the tax act. Both McKesson and Change Healthcare recorded net benefits related to the tax act in the third quarter. These nonrecurring benefits are excluded from our adjusted earnings. In December, McKesson recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $370 million, which contributed $1.78 to our third quarter GAAP EPS. This net tax benefit results primarily to the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities, principally related to LIFO due to a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, partially offset by the impact of transition taxes and foreign retained earnings. In addition, Change Health recorded a net benefit, driven primarily by the re-measurement of its deferred tax liabilities at a lower tax rate. McKesson's 70% equity interest of that benefit is expected to be approximately $70 million to $110 million, which will be reflected in the equity investment in Change Healthcare line. However, given the 1-month lag in McKesson's reporting of our equity share of Change Healthcare, that benefit will be reflected in our fourth quarter GAAP results. Next, let me discuss the impact of federal tax reform on our adjusted earnings. For McKesson, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect a lower rate driven by the new U.S. federal tax rate. We expect a tax run rate range of 22% to 24% driven by our mix of business. That said, each fiscal year's tax rate may be impacted by its pre-tax charges or benefits during the year from items, such as tax planning initiatives and examinations of our tax returns by the tax authorities. We anticipate our fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate will be approximately 21%. I would remind you that are anticipated fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate has been positively impacted by the intercompany sale of software related to our Technology Solutions segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. That P&L benefit is expected to end at the close of fiscal 2018 driven by a change income tax accounting rules. To summarize, we expect our fiscal 2019 adjusted tax rate to be above our fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate, driven the by lapping of discrete tax items and the full year benefit related to software amortization realized in fiscal 2018. We'll provide an update on adjusted tax rates for fiscal 2019 and will provide guidance in May. For Change Healthcare, as I previously mentioned, we report these results in a one-month lag. And as a result, their fourth quarter will include the effects of the lower run rate for two months of Change Healthcare results. Specific to fiscal 2019, we'll provide additional insight on McKesson's expected adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare when we provide guidance in May. Finally, as a result of the tax act, we anticipate modestly favorable cash flows over time. We expect to deploy these favorable cash flows in line with our portfolio approach to capital deployment. While some of the items I've just discussed have an immediate impact, there are certain items within tax reform in which companies have up to a year to finalize. As such, we may have true-up's in future quarters. In our 10-Q we filed later today, you'll find additional information about the impact of federal tax reform and the provisional amounts recorded in the quarter. Now let me turn to financial results for fiscal third quarter. The results that I provide this morning will be on an adjusted basis, unless I specifically call them out as GAAP. We provided a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and our 8-K filed this morning. As a reminder, our adjusted earnings exclude the following items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments. Starting now with a review of our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2 and 3. For the third quarter, consolidated revenues increased 7% year-over-year. Adjusted gross profit dollars increased 2% from a year ago, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year and adjusted other income was $22 million for the quarter. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $55 million for the third quarter, which was adversely impacted by a lower-than-expected contribution in Change Healthcare's imaging business due to deferrals of customer purchases. We now expect adjusted equity income from the Change Healthcare joint venture to be in a range of $265 million to $295 million in fiscal 2018. Interest expense of $67 million, decreased 9% for the quarter, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 11.5%, driven by discrete tax benefits of approximately $54 million in the quarter, which primarily relates to the conclusion of certain tax audits. We now anticipate our fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate will be approximately 21%, down from approximately 24%, driven in roughly equal parts by our expected mix of business, lower adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter and the discrete tax benefits recognized in the third quarter. Income attributable to noncontrolling interests, or NCI, was $58 million for the quarter. As a reminder, the year-over-year increase in NCI is primarily driven by fee income from ClarusONE, our joint sourcing entity with Walmart Adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $712 million, with third quarter adjusted EPS at $3.41, which is up 12% compared to $3.04 in the prior year. Third quarter year-over-year adjusted EPS growth was primarily driven by a lower share count, organic growth across multiple business units, including the company's strategic sourcing benefits through ClarusONE, incremental profit contribution from acquisition and a lower tax rate, which included discrete tax benefits, which are unrelated to tax reform. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower profit driven by the contribution of the majority of the Technology Solutions businesses of Change Healthcare, the sale of our EIS business and the impact of reduced reimbursement in our UK retail pharmacy business. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were $208 million down 6% compared the prior year. Next, I'll review our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were $53.6. Revenues benefited from $663 million in favorable currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis revenues increased 7%, year-over-year. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 8%, driven by market growth and acquisitions partially offset by brand to generic conversion. International pharmaceutical distribution resources revenues were $7 billion this quarter. Revenues benefited from $530 million in favorable currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Our UK team continues to make progress in the retail pharmacy initiatives we outlined on our second quarter earnings call. To date, we've identified approximately 200 store closures and divestitures, which approximately 90 stores are expected to be divested. We continue to expect meaningful savings from this program in fiscal 2019. And finally, Medical-Surgical revenues increased 9%, for the third quarter driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted profit was up 20% for the quarter, driven by acquisitions and organic growth across multiple business units, including the company's strategic sourcing benefits through ClarusONE, partially offset by the impact of reduce reimbursement in our U. K. retail pharmacy business. Brand compensation for the third quarter was in line with expectation. Additionally, January brand manufacturer pricing activity was in line with our expectation, and we continue to see results slightly above our full year assumption of mid single digit brand manufacturer price inflation. I would point out that while the overall brand inflation rate is important, it is less important in prior years as we continue to evolve our brand compensation arrangements, reduce the variability from branded inflation. As it relates to the generic market environment, generic deflation on the buy side continues to be in line with our expectation. The sell-side pricing environment remains competitive yet less volatile than the year-ago period. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses increased 18% for the quarter. Segment operating expenses required an increase driven by acquisitions and the mix of retail business, partially offset by an ongoing cost management output. As a reminder, in fiscal 2018, our year-over-year growth for adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses are impacted by the shift of business in the segment, including our larger owned retail footprint and technology businesses. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit increased 23% to $991 million, driven by the same factors as previously discussed. In constant currency, segment adjusted operating profit $982 million. As a remainder, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the McKesson's adjusted operating profit was negatively impacted by two nonrecurring charges showing approximately $60 million. The third quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate was 185 basis points an increase of 22 basis points. The adjusted margin rate was also impacted by our customer and product mix, including the growth of higher-priced specialty pharmaceuticals. Due to the mix shift, we now expect our full year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin rate to be slightly below our original guidance range of between 198 basis points and 208 basis points. McKesson recorded $109 million in adjusted corporate expenses for the third quarter. We now expect adjusted corporate expenses to be between approximately $410 million and $430 million in fiscal 2018. I\u2019ll review our balance sheet metrics. Our receivables day\u2019s sales outstanding decreased one day from the prior year to 27 days. Days sales in inventory decreased one day from the prior years to 30 days. Days sales in payables decreased one day from the prior year to 58 days. It's important to point out that our working capital metrics may be impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.6 billion and to the first nine months of fiscal 2018 we generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations. We continue to efficiently deploy capital. For the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we repaid $545 million in long term debt and we spend $392 million on internal capital investments. We now expect property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures in fiscal 2018 to be below the previously guided range between $650 million and $750 million. And we spend $2 billion on seven acquisitions during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. In the third quarter, we repurchased $250 million in common stock. Share repurchases during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 totaled $900 million. We now expect our weighted average diluted shares to be approximately $210 million for the full year. We have approximately $1.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization and yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the next quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share. Now, let me provide more detail on our fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS outlook. As mentioned earlier, we have raised and narrowed our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings from a range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share to a new range from $12.50 to $12.80 per diluted share. As a remainder, our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook exclude the following items. Amortization, acquisition related to tangible of $2.35 to $2.65 per diluted share, acquisition related expenses and adjustments of $1 to $1.20 per diluted share, LIFO inventory-related charges of $0.05 \u2013 credits of $0.05 per diluted share, gains from antitrust legal settlements of up to $0.05 per diluted share, restructuring charges of $1.25 to $1.45 per diluted share and other net credits of $0.50 to $0.70 per diluted share. Unless stated otherwise today, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 press release and on our first and second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings calls are being reiterated. We continue to expect foreign currency exchange rate movements will have a net favorable impact of approximately $0.10 for the year. In closing, our third quarter results were operationally in line with our expectations, and we're pleased to be able to raise our fiscal 2018 outlook to reflect the lower tax rate and share count. We are well positioned for a strong finish to fiscal 2018. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of I\u2019d ask to limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Glen Santangelo from Deutsche Bank. Pease. Glen Santangelo : Hi, thanks and good morning. Hey Britt I just want to sort of follow-up on the comments you just made about the operating profit assumptions within the Distribution Solutions segment. I think you sort of suggest that you now expect to come in slightly below the range, and I'm just kind of \u2013 could you give us a little bit more color? Because it kind of sounds like price inflation is sort of in line with what you thought, maybe a little better. Generic deflation is kind of what you thought. We're not seeing any sort of strange activity in terms of the competitive landscape. So could you maybe just landscape. So could you maybe just give us a little bit more color? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes, sure. Thanks for that question. Yes, we did note here that we're going to be at the low end or slightly below the range. And I would attribute the to mix. As we talked about from quarter-to-quarter, we have a variety of mix between both products and customers, and I think that's really driving that comment. As we noted, it was an in-line quarter, but I would just point out to the mix of both product and customers. Glen Santangelo : Maybe I could just ask one follow-up. John, you talked about differential pricing, and you're sort of going through repricing all your contracts sort of one by one. Any sort of takeaways from those repricings? Any impact on the margin that sort of worth calling out as we look on a go-forward basis? John Hammergren : Well thanks for the question Glen. Clearly, we've talked about the importance of our work in this area. And I think our customers clearly understand that the mix changes going on in our industry is more and more as these specialty products are coming to the marketplace. And so I think in the short term, it has little impact on us or our customers, but as we reposition in advance of what we see is a cycle of a lot of specialty product, into the marketplace, we think these adjustments are appropriate for us. And frankly provide better line of sight to our customers related to all these products flow through the supply chain. So we're making good progress, and we would expect to be complete with this, as you noted, these final contracts renew in the last section of this work. Glen Santangelo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and good morning. Let me start on the drug pricing side. Clearly, there are still a lot of debate in Washington around drug pricing, Trump coming out the other night and talking about it. John, can you talk about how you expected to impact your business going forward. You talk about stabilization here. You know talking about mid-single digits, what are the things that you potentially could see? I know you spent some time in DC, so let me start there and then I just had a follow-up as well. John Hammergren : Well, I think you can break the drug pricing discussion into probably three large categories. Clearly, we continue to believe generic pricing and the related deflation we've experienced recently in that marketplace makes a generic product price very competitive. And certainly, as a percent of the total spend in health care, the price for these kinds of drugs or the treatment cost for patients continues to drop. And we think that, that phenomenon some of the pressure off the drug spend debate in this country and clearly, providing people with continued drug benefits also helps diffuse this. And for many folks that are on these drugs, the cost is somewhat immaterial to them on an annual basis. On the branded drugs, you've seen a significant drop in inflation, if you think about the trend in that indicator over the last several years. And likewise, we think that the level of brand inflation that we have now is acceptable and defendable by these companies as they continue to use the remaining product they have under patent to fund their increased R&D work. And the last category I'd point out is \u2013 are some of these new specialty drugs. And clearly, these drugs can be expensive, but, once again, when pressed, I think there's easy arguments to be made for how the use of these drugs and an analysis would show a decrease in the cost of health care for the patients that are on these treatments. And so in a value-based way, if people are thinking about health care spend and how to control it, I still think the use pharmaceuticals is the first and best place to go and get people on their treatments, get them to stay on them and adhere to the treatment and stay out of the hospitals. Lisa Gill : So even though \u2013 the rhetoric is still there, and from your perspective, it doesn't sound like things have really changed from what they were one year ago. Is that the right way to think about it? John Hammergren : Well, you obviously have continued to see deflation in the generic side, and like I said, we've seen a significant reduction in the amount inflation on the brand side. And I think the area that continues to get some scrutiny are some of these specialty drugs that have a small population that are very expensive to bring to the marketplace and a more value-oriented request as pharmaceutical companies price these to compare what the other treatment might have cost our society or a payer. And so I think that there will be continued value-based discussions, but, frankly, I think the evidence will show that the spend on pharmaceuticals is an investment that's well made and one that pays a return compared to other alternatives. So I think, obviously, people that are in some of these categories, particularly the specialty categories, as a patient may find the debate interesting. But I think that as it relates to overall drug spend as a value, it continues to be one of the best values in health care today. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. And then, Britt, just going back to your comment about the mix and talking about specialty. But I'm just curious around flu and what the impact of flu will have in your projections for the fourth quarter. I generally think of that as being a little bit of a lower-margin product. Is that having any impact on the way you're thinking about the margins for the fourth quarter? Britt Vitalone : I'd say that we've had a pretty strong flu season, I would say, as part of the product mix that I've talked about, along with specialty products. So that would be a part of the range that we provided you. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of questions here. John, you mentioned the changes in reimbursement in Canada. I'd just kind of like help to frame the potential impact. Can you just walk through kind of what would be the profit contribution of Canada overall? We have it at around 7% of EBITDA. And any additional color on how these reimbursement changes compare to what you've seen in the past? Because there have been periods in the past where we've seen these generic price initiatives, and you were able kind of like to manage through them. John Hammergren : Thanks, Ricky, for the question. As you point out, the Canadian business is significant to McKesson and important and has continued to grow nicely. And in the past, we have been impacted negatively from reimbursement changes that have sort of rolled through various provinces at different periods in time. It's probably early to size the impact of these most recent changes or what work we might be able to do to find reimbursement channels for the services we provide in retail or wholesale from the government or other offsets that we might find in the business as we continue to grow in the wide variety of businesses that we are in, in the Canada market. I would say the difference this time compared to the other types of reimbursement events is that this one is across all provinces, all at the same time, effective April 1, and not insignificant in its impact on that portion of our business, the generic business. So I think it's important for us to point it out. We'll talk about it more as we get into our guidance for next year and think about it as we work through the discussions we have with the Canadian government related to what services they want to reimburse us for, et cetera. So I think it's important, but it's something that we are used to, to the extent that we've had to deal with this in the past. Ricky Goldwasser : And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the tax benefit and kind of like how you're thinking of investing back into the business, you talked about acquisitions, buybacks and dividends. But when you think about kind of like the capital initiatives, is there any kind of like way that you can help us kind of like think through it and quantify it as we're kind of like thinking about the pull-through to fiscal year 2019? John Hammergren : Well, I think Britt has already outlined sort of his expectations from a tax rate perspective. We, I think, provided a range, and that should be helpful to you. As it relates to the use of the incremental cash produced by this very favorable tax law change, I think our comment was we will continue to follow a portfolio approach, and that's probably the most color I can provide you. You know that we do have a great track record of making intelligent acquisitions and not overpaying for them and doing a great job of integrating the acquisitions. And so that continues to be one of our top priorities, but you also notice that we've done relatively significant share repurchases this year. And we will probably continue to use both of those, along with our dividends, as a strategy to grow. I do think that we are beginning an innovation phase at McKesson that we're excited about, that is more than just the M&A side of things. And so although acquisitions have played a role in the past, I think that we will find a way to provide innovation and opportunity to grow organically inside of McKesson, and that's some of the investment that we plan to make. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brian Tanquilut : Good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask a question on the ClarusONE comment. So how do we \u2013 how should we think about the remaining opportunity there in terms of either expanding the relationship with Walmart or expanding the client base and product lines? And what's your outlook on incremental margin opportunities with ClarusONE? Thanks. John Hammergren : Well, thanks for the question. It's great to have Britt here at the table, given that he was the one that built ClarusONE and got it implemented on time and produced results that were not only at our expectations but perhaps beyond, and it's the same thing for our partners that have benefited. Britt, maybe you can talk a little bit more about the opportunities we see. Britt Vitalone : Sure, John. We're very pleased with the progress that we've made at Clarus, and we're very pleased that our partner, Walmart, and our customers are benefiting from that. And we have quite a bit of opportunity as we go forward, whether that be geographic opportunities outside of the U.S. or as we look at other product opportunities. And certainly, we have those discussions with our partners all the time. So we believe that we've really got a great foundation in place. We've been able to partner with a number of manufacturers and really develop a beachhead around generics in the U.S., and we think we have tremendous foundation to take that further, whether that be, again, additional geographies or additional product categories. So we are quite excited about the potential that we have there, and we'll continue to explore that over the coming quarters. Brian Tanquilut : All right, got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : We will now take our next question from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Please go ahead. Eric Coldwell : Hey, thanks very much and good morning. Medical, I know it's not your biggest segment, but 9% growth is pretty impressive, especially on the heels of a peer's pre-announcement last night, realizing that there are channel differences. I'm just curious if you can give us a little more detail, parse out product categories that are growing quickly. Maybe talk about share capture or specific initiatives leading to this 9% growth rate. And then maybe give us a sense on how comfortable you are with that level of a growth rate going forward, if you are so. Thanks, John. Thanks very much. John Hammergren : Thanks for the question and thanks for recognizing what we think is really outstanding performance in our Medical-Surgical business. We have built a tremendous asset there that has been entirely focused on growing with our customers as they grow outside of the acute care health care system. And whether it's large health systems that are buying physician practices or whether it's long-term care centers or home care, we think we're extremely well positioned. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are expanding the product portfolio and the value that we deliver to our customers each day. And an example would be bringing lab and diagnostic into the physician office space. The \u2013 increasingly, technology is allowing us to do things right then and there in the physician office with the patient. The patient gets immediate results. The physician gets immediate results. Treatment decisions can be made immediately. And all can happen in a way that delivers better value for the patient, better care for the patient and, clearly, improved economics for the physicians. So there are several examples where we've extended our reach into these important markets, which expands our footprint. We've maintained and grown our business even through the acquisitions of doctors in the health systems market because of the value proposition that we deliver and our unique capabilities to service these disparate facilities in a low-cost, high-quality way, and we think the business is going to continue to grow. As mentioned earlier by Lisa, obviously, the flu market has been something that has also benefited us. Albeit not as profitable, it's an important part of the value proposition both in retail as well as in the ambulatory or physician office setting. So we benefited from some tailwinds relative to flu season. But I think our focus on the business and our great people there has also enhanced our performance. Next question please. Operator : Next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore. Please. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys. Maybe, John, could you just give us a little bit more color on some of the more recent acquisitions or some of the new segments you've formed have kind of trended? It feels like you sort of did a number of deals that kind of aided your core growth rate and maybe also margins. So a little bit of color on some of those would be helpful. And then maybe a comment on sort of the RxCrossroads deal and sort of what that brings capability-wise to the organization. John Hammergren : Well, thanks for the question, Ross. You've followed the company for a long time as well as some of your colleagues on this call. And if you watch what we do, it typically is arraying a set of assets in advance of opportunities fully materializing so that we can capitalize on the right strategic positions in advance of growth. We like things that are growing in an accretive way to the base. We like things that are providing margin opportunities that are accretive to our margin, and we like to be positioned in markets where the total available market is significant and where we believe it's going to grow rapidly and where we can win. So whether you think about our movement into the generic marketplace or our movement into alternate-site Medical-Surgical, we try to think about a go-forward where the growth will be. Similarly, you've seen us array a set of assets beginning with OTN against the oncology business years ago, probably over a decade ago, than the acquisition of U.S. Oncology and a string of other things that have positioned us for the specialty market, the most recent being RxCrossroads, as you just mentioned. So I think it is important for us to continue to grow our businesses and the value we can deliver to specialty manufacturers, not just in the supply chain but also in the ability for their product to be launched effectively, to be reimbursed effectively and quickly. And for the patient and the physicians and the pharmacies to be supported as these products are taken up by the patients is an important aspect of what we're trying to do. And clearly, working on the revenue side of specialty pharma provides a lot of incremental value to our manufacturer partners. And so anything we can do to get the script in the appropriate hands of a patient and properly filled and taken and adhered to is delivering tremendous value to the patient to begin with, but also delivering tremendous value to our partners in the supply chain. So we're excited about the value proposition that we're creating. Ross Muken : Thanks, John. And maybe a quick one for Britt, and welcome to the call. I guess, on just cash flow, a decent drain so far both year-to-date on working cap and deferred taxes. What is the updated view on sort of what the free cash number could kind of look at for the year? I am not sure I caught that. Britt Vitalone : Yeah, I would say there is no change to our expectations on cash flow at this time. It's, as I mentioned in my remarks, it's \u2013 where the end of the quarter finishes in terms of the day also has a big impact, and it's not unusual to see us have a strong fourth quarter for cash flow, and so for that \u2013 those reasons, I would say that we're not changing our expectations on generating free cash flow for fiscal 2018. Ross Muken : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Thanks for taking my question. John, just want to go back to the public focus on drug pricing. One of the recent initiatives that we saw was led by hospitals with this idea of building out their own generic drug company to drive better accessibility and drive down price, obviously, with specific generic drugs. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that initiative specifically, how you think it could impact the industry? And then maybe just more generally, kind of what you're hearing and seeing from your hospital customers around drug pricing. John Hammergren : Well, I certainly read the announcement with some interest. We've been in the Generic business for a long time, and we've, obviously, built our NorthStar product line and great collaboration with the pharmaceutical manufacturers and delivered significant value back into the marketplace. I think that my interpretation of what's going on there is really related to availability, to a large extent; and to some extent, perhaps pricing. And probably those are two \u2013 those two things are tied together to some extent. I'm not sure that another manufacturer will necessarily dramatically improve the availability. If it's a raw material-related issue or just a capacity-related issue. It's difficult to bring capacity on and it's, obviously, difficult to get through all of the regulatory challenges associated with standing up a brand-new company. Having said that, there may be opportunities for these large and important customers, some of which are ours to work in a collaborative way with others in the supply chain to avail themselves of better product availability or supply and certainly to take their buying power and aggregate it in a way that gives them some price leverage in the marketplace. So we look forward to exploring opportunities, as you said, on these limited number of generic products that have been difficult to our customers and for the market and anything we can do to help them. I would say that I'm a little suspect of the ability to ground up a generic manufacturing company that's owned in a collaborative way and to compete with our largest generic manufacturing partners in a material way. I just don't see that as being a simple task. Robert Jones : Yeah, understood. I guess just one quick follow up, John, with one quarter left in the fiscal year, I know you guys will be getting formal guidance at a later time. But any initial thoughts as you look out to next year as we think about the major drivers? You talked about branded, generic pricing, volumes. Anything that you would foresee kind of stable, down or up as we look out into fiscal 2019? John Hammergren : Well, as we have said in the past, we go through periods in these markets that sometimes can be a little bit difficult to predict. But as we see it now at least, the markets remain competitive but relatively stable. We've, for a long time, dealt with a deflationary generic market with spots of inflation and the clearly those dynamics seem to have settled into a pattern flat that at least for the last few quarters, have been pretty similar in their compare. And I think the biggest change we see coming in front of us, as I mentioned earlier, is an innovation cycle, particularly in specialty drugs that will be important. And the support of those manufacturers that need to get access to the product and access to the market, I should say and speed to delivery to the patient will be important. And I talked a little bit earlier about things that we try to do to make that simpler. CoverMyMeds will be another great example where we try to reduce the friction associated with getting somebody approved to begin to take one of these drugs in an automated prior authorization format. So that's the longer-term change I continue to see coming, which is a mix change into these more difficult to take \u2013 or difficult to pay for, difficult to get access to and difficult disease states that these new drugs are going to be marketed to. Robert Jones : Great, thanks for the thoughts. Operator : We will now take our next question from Kevin Caliendo from Needham. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks, guys, a couple of questions. First, you've done a lot of acquisitions on the manufacturing services, specialty side. Is there any capabilities or verticals there that you don't have yet that you feel you might need to sort of provide everything you can possibly provide to the manufacturers? John Hammergren : Well, clearly, there is all kinds of things that the manufacturers either do internally or are already sourcing from partners, and that list of activity is pretty long and significant and probably changing. We do think that the assets that we put together are important. It gives us important scale, it gives as existing customer relationships and it gives us a foundation in services that may not be entirely complete if you think packaging and outsourced manufacturing and some of those kinds of capabilities. But we think that parts of the manufacturer requirement, particularly, as I said, on the revenue and adherence side, are important. And we believe that our focus in that direction has been an appropriate one, and we can benefit our partners as well as ourselves by being world-class in our ability to make that happen. So I think we remain disciplined and vigilant as it relates to opportunities, but I don't think we feel like we are at a disadvantage in terms of what we have today and we will be opportunistic to evaluate other alternatives that may come along. Kevin Caliendo : Okay. And one question just on foreign exchange and the benefit. Is that \u2013 you mentioned it's $0.10 \u2013 you still expect it to be sort of a $0.10 impact to earnings this year. But is it \u2013 what does it do to the actual margin of the business? I'm guessing it's a negative impact to the margin overall then. As you look at the reconciliation\u2026 John Hammergren : Yeah, as I would just point out that it\u2019s \u2013 as we talked about, it's about a $0.10 impact. So it's a pretty modest impact on our operations at this point. Kevin Caliendo : No, what I meant was you're taking an extra revenue. I'm just wondering has any material impact on your margin at all, the optics around it. I understand your\u2026 Britt Vitalone : Yeah, it\u2019s not a material impact. It's not a material impact. Kevin Caliendo : Great, okay, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. Glad to hear that you\u2019re considering financial segment and how that might change. But my question is actually maybe John your comments early on around the operational segmentation under Nick, how much of that is driven by simply these are now similar growth businesses versus change in what a manufacturer or dispenser needs from their wholesaler kind of the go-to-market strategy that you have. Is that changing as well and how does that fit into the operational change? John Hammergren : Right, I think that clearly many of the manufacturers that we do business with that would be selling product through our specialty channels or into the physician office or clinic setting are the same manufacturers that are in our full-line wholesale business going to hospitals or retail pharmacy. The service requirement is significantly different, and the structure of our relationships are usually significantly different. So I think that what we'll be able to do here is benefit from the relationships we have on the various sides of our business. Frankly, we'll go to leverage some of the structure we have, whether it's some of the functions that we have in these businesses that have been specifically focused on one business versus the other. And I think that the most important thing for us to do is to continue to think the needs of our customers whether it\u2019s a pharmacy or the physician or the pharmaceutical manufacturer and make sure that we array the set of assets to them in the best possible way and frankly also keep our cost and our overhead down so that we can be quick and efficient. So it's probably a combination of many things. Obviously, underneath Nick are some very talented executives, and their line of sight focus on U.S. Oncology or some of the other ologies and businesses that we're focused on will remain. So I don't see a collapsing, so to speak, of the people that are selling things to hospitals into the same group that's servicing our U.S. Oncology network is an example. Eric Percher : And as you look at the segmentation, is there more room to run with the corporate efficiency program [indiscernible] in the innings of \u2013 I mean do you expect that to continue on into next year? John Hammergren : I\u2019ll let Britt jump in here. Yes I would say, Eric, we have certainly, as John mentioned, as we think about a ring, our business is under a leader like Nick, as we look across all of our businesses. We've made great progress against our corporate expense in our segment expense initiatives. I think we still have tremendous opportunity, and we always focus on efficiency and looking to take cost opportunities so that we can better service our customers. So I think those are things that we'll always do, and I think we've made great progress in the last 18 months, but you should see us continue to focus on as we go forward. Eric Percher : And just relative to the next year, as we look at this year, has the management incentive plan been at \u2013 fully funded? Is there any catch-up that has to occur as we go from 2018 to 2019? John Hammergren : Why \u2013 we don't \u2013 I don't \u2013 to be frank, I haven't looked at the management incentive plan accruals recently, but I don't think there's a huge delta last year to this year or this year into a fully funded or less than kind of funded basis. So it's not something I think that will be something you have to focus on, Eric, as we think about FY'19, yes. Eric Percher : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from George Hill from RBC. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yes, good morning guys. John, as we think about the differentiated pricing model, what should we think of is the key drivers of profit growth going forward? Is it underlying volume? Is it price? Is it business mix like it business mix like the growth in specialty business versus generic growth? I guess any color here would be helpful. John Hammergren : Thanks George for the question. Clearly, volume, price and mix are all important elements as we think about our business. And clearly, we're fortunate to be participating in an industry that is continuing to grow, both through innovation but also through demand, and the combination of those factors make us positive about our outlook. We are excited to be in health care and excited about our position in it and our focus on pharmaceuticals we think is an important one. I think that the biggest change that we've talked about today and even Britt was talking about it related to the third quarter is the evolving mix of our business. And these higher-priced, more specialty products that we believe deliver tremendous value and frankly, take cost out of the health care system, do have a negative mix or margin experience on us as we think about our overall P&L. And so what we've been attempting to do and been very successful at it as we find these five categories of pricing is to position our value proposition to the customers in such a way that they're \u2013 we're getting properly paid for the service we provide and that our business is evolving. Our business strategy and our business financials are appropriately evolving as our mix evolves. And that's probably the biggest change you'll see this continued mix shift towards specialty products. George Hill : Okay. And then I guess just a quick follow-up then. I guess just one last one on generics would be, as we think of the profit pool that's generated off of the sales of generic drugs, is that profit pool generally concentrated in a smaller number of products or even in half of the number of products? Or is it more broad-based? And I'm just thinking about this in comparison to when we saw profits concentrated in a smaller number of profits from the period of generic drug price inflation. John Hammergren : Well, I think that the \u2013 you all have access to the data that tells you which molecules are selling with greater volumes, and you also have pricing data not from us, but from an industry perspective, so you can kind of volume weight the mix of the industry and get some kind of overall view of where the dollars are spent. As it relates to the margin effect on the company like McKesson, that's difficult to discuss, given that there \u2013 that some of these molecules, even though they might be big and dollars, may have many, many competitors and, therefore, the profit opportunities may be reduced because of the competitive activities associated with those molecules. But I think we continue to see the generic market as attractive to us. Our position is very strong, and we're continuing to grow our portfolio of generics, not just in line with the market, but in some cases, we further penetrate our existing customers by taking on more and more of their generic sourcing and spend requirements. And so when Britt talks about the success of ClarusONE, part of the \u2013 of our value is taking our scale into the marketplace with all of our customers and giving them an affordable alternative to buying from some of these telemarketers and others that may have chipped away at our overall share position. And then, obviously, the launch cycle is less favorable today than \u2013 in terms of new products than it might have been a year ago. I think we have time for one last question. Operator : We will now take our final question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Charles Rhyee : Yes, hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess most of my question has been asked. Maybe, Britt, on Change Healthcare, you made a comment contribution was down sequentially, and you said there was some issues in the imaging business. You called out a deferral in purchases. Does that mean we would expect those to come back in the next quarter, or maybe give us more thoughts on \u2013 inside on what's going on the part of the business and what we kind of expect even beyond just the updated contribution? Thanks. John Hammergren : Well, thanks for the question Charles. This is John I\u2019m probably going to help Britt on this one given that he's pretty new to the team's health care activity, and we've just recently put him on the Board to replace James. We've had the imaging business inside McKesson for a long time. It's a great, great business with a very large franchise and a great market position and really a competitive product line. That business now is a, in whole, part of Change Health are and so our visibility to it has been reduced to some extent, given that we don't manage that business directly. It's managed by the Change Healthcare executive team. But I do \u2013 obviously, the McKesson people that are there, we talk frequently. And I would say that the biggest thing that we've seen is a change in the purchase cycle of our customers, and we would have expected them to continue to be buying new equipment and up \u2013 and refreshing their imaging work, and that usually provides us an opportunity to win the software that goes along with it than what we've seen is that \u2013 is significantly flatter market than we would have anticipated in the replacement cycle for some of this equipment, and, therefore, we see a flatness in our revenues in our imaging business. So, I think it's really driven more by market characteristics related to the use of capital by our largest customers and that capital being either not deployed at all or deployed in other areas. Having said that, we believe a lot of this imaging equipment is going to have to be replaced. It's just not contemporary any longer and when that replacement cycle comes back, the Change Healthcare imaging business, we believe, will begin to grow nicely again with its leadership position. John Hammergren : So, it's time for us to end this call. I want to thank you, Cecilia, for this work as an operator, and I want to thank all of you on the call today. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication to our customers and partners in line with our eyecare value of putting the customers first in all that we do. To underline this point, McKesson is once again ranked number one in our industry by Fortune Magazine in its 2018 World's Most Admired Companies survey. This annual survey measures corporate reputation and performance against several key attributes. While we are honored to be recognized for the second year in a row with this award, I'm deeply humbled by the work of our more than 75,000 employees whose unwavering focus on our customers will ensure our continued success as we move forward. In closing, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. McKesson continues to execute against our fiscal 2018 plan, and we look forward to updating you with our fiscal 2019 outlook when we provide our fourth quarter's earnings results in May. Thank you, and goodbye. Operator : Thank you for joining today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

Welcome to the McKesson Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead sir. Craig Mercer : Thank you, Nicole. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson\u2019s fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Britt Vitalone, McKesson\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and then Britt will review the financial results for the quarter and full year. After Britt\u2019s comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 9 :00 a.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I will remind the listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company\u2019s periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the forward-looking statements slides and text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, free cash flow and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. Please note, McKesson will no longer provide forward-looking GAAP earnings per diluted share guidance. The company is unable to provide this information without unreasonable efforts given the inherently uncertain factors impacting forward-looking GAAP results. Many of which are beyond the company\u2019s control, such as LIFO inventory related adjustments, gains from antitrust litigations and certain impacts from federal tax reform. We filed the second 8-K with the SEC today, which includes supplemental historical statement financial information for fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 results as well as quarterly information for fiscal 2018. This will allow you to compare our fiscal 2019 outlook to our historical results on the same segment basis. Finally, I would call to your attention the supplemental slide presentation that we will reference on today\u2019s call which maybe found on the Investors page of our website at mckesson.com. We believe the earnings press release, supplemental slides and the supplemental historical segment information 8-K filing, which I will include non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors with regard to the company\u2019s underlying operating performance and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to these materials which maybe found in the Investors section of our company website for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you. And here is John Hammergren. John Hammergren : Thanks, Craig and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. I am pleased to report our fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $12.62 representing a 1% growth year-over-year. These results were consistent with what we communicated a month ago which included a lower tax rate, stronger operational performance, and our $100 million contribution to create the new nonprofit foundation. And our fiscal 2019 outlook for adjusted earnings of $13 to $13.80 per diluted share represents low to high single-digit percentage growth year-over-year. This outlook reflects a competitive, but more stable market environment and effective capital allocation, while including the anticipated headwinds in our European and Canadian businesses. I would also remind you that our multiyear strategic growth initiative is not expected to materially impact our financial results in the coming year. We are in the preliminary phase of implementing the strategic growth initiatives and efforts are well underway across the organization. We will provide more details on our progress as well as our growth initiatives at our Investor Day, which is scheduled for the end of June. Turning back to our operating performance, I am pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across multiple businesses. And for the year, we were able to deliver results that were largely in line with our expectations outlined at the beginning of the year. Britt will cover our annual financial performance in greater detail, but let me provide some color on the year just concluded. During fiscal \u201818, we demonstrated our sourcing expertise and shared significant benefits with our partner, Walmart. We are excited about what we are able to deliver as well as the potential for expanded opportunities through this partnership. We bring new value to health systems customer relationships and renewed our extended contracts with all of our major independent buying groups in the past 18 months. We recorded the first full year of operations of Change Healthcare and scaled healthcare information technology business, which began integrating the combined businesses, realizing targeted cost synergies and preparing for the future initial public offering. And we made changes to our leadership team, including optimizing our management structure and combining our U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty health businesses. We made several important acquisitions during the fiscal year and we recently announced the acquisition of Medical Specialties Distributors, or MSD, which is intended to, among other things, expand our manufacturer value proposition in specialty capabilities. We successfully executed against each of these operational and organizational changes, which are aligned with our strategic growth initiatives and help positioned the company for the long-term. However, we did not anticipate the sizable additional government-driven headwinds in the UK and Canada. Let me take a moment to provide more details on these two topics specifically. First, the UK government initiative has not only impacted our current year performance, but will continue to have an impact going forward. These actions are on cost containment and medicine optimization among other things resulted in the designation of some prescription drugs as over-the-counter. While each year we modeled typical reimbursement cuts, we saw incremental cuts that drove a greater headwind than we had anticipated. As we entered the new fiscal year, we have assumed the mitigation efforts will fully offset anticipated government actions. We believe this assumption is appropriate given actions we announced in our second quarter earnings call to close or divest underperforming stores in the UK market. Switching now to Rexall, in many ways, the impact of the government initiatives in Canada are similar to what we saw in the UK. And while the reimbursement and minimum wage headwinds impact the entire Canadian supply chain, retail pharmacy operations are more impacted significantly. We do, however, had clear line of sight into generics reimbursement environment, for the next 5 years. And as I mentioned on our April call, we remain committed to retail in delivering high-quality care in a way that works for patients. In response to these government actions, our Canadian business has begun work on mitigating their impact, which includes advancing revenue diversification opportunities and additional reimbursed pharmacy services driving increased operational efficiencies, while ensuring consistent high-quality patient care delivery and taking on the leadership role and industry efficacy with governments on a sustainable reimbursement model. Next, we are pleased with the progress of our multiyear initiative to implement differential pricing for brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC drug classes in line with the services we provide to both our customers and manufacture partners in all of these five categories. We continue to address these important changes as we work through our contract renewal cycles. We remain confident in McKesson\u2019s path forward, the critical role of the services we provide to the healthcare industry today and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to healthcare systems globally. In summary, fiscal 2018 represented a year of stabilization, while providing a solid platform for our multiyear growth initiatives. I was encouraged by several developments during the year. First, despite the ever competitive environment we operate in, the revenue growth of our combined U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty health businesses was in line with our expectations, with higher growth being from the Specialty Health. We expect low to mid single-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2019 reflecting continued strong organic growth in this business. Additionally, RxCrossroads acquisition further expands our broad range of solutions throughout the lifecycle of the drug for biopharma companies. This transaction aligns squarely with our growth priorities supporting manufacturer programs and specialty solutions. Next, looking past the UK government actions we previously discussed, Europe\u2019s businesses performed well. We began realizing synergies from prior acquisitions, which provide a foundation for our retail pharmacy growth initiative. We anticipate revenue to be flat to growing by mid single-digits driven by market growth in fiscal 2019. In Medical-Surgical, we delivered another year of solid growth and we are well positioned to support the growing alternate-site opportunity with the announced acquisition of MSD. This acquisition complements our alternate-site service platform and in combination with strong organic performance is expected to deliver revenue growth in the low double-digit range for fiscal 2019. McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, or MRxTS, is a fundamental part of our strategy to help manufacturers and retail pharmacies to be successful. We are excited by innovative solutions like Express Coverage, a collaborative new solution, leveraging the expertise of McKesson\u2019s Health Services and RelayHealth Pharmacy and CoverMyMeds, vast healthcare network and we believe we can do much more to benefit patients with the complementary capabilities we have built. And in Canada, while the government actions will create a near-term headwind, the business grew nicely in fiscal 2018. In addition, the acquisition of Well.ca provides patients with another channel to connect with us and forms part of the platform for future growth as we execute our retail pharmacy of the future initiative. Before I wrap up, our Board of Directors welcomed Brad Lerman as a new independent director in late April. Brad brings with him extensive compliance government relations and corporate strategy experience further strengthening the diverse backgrounds and perspectives we have on our board. I am extremely proud of this management team\u2019s ability to adapt and maintain a constant focus on the patient in building our value proposition to help make our customers and suppliers more successful, which will continue to drive growth and long-term value creation for our shareholders. Last, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their dedication, leadership and consistent focus on putting patients at the center of everything we do. With that, I will turn the call over to Britt and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt? Britt Vitalone : Thank you, John and good morning. Today, I will review our fiscal 2018 results, discuss our new segment reporting structure, provide a brief update on our multiyear strategic growth initiatives and provide details around our fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $13 to $13.80 per diluted share. As a reminder, we provide guidance on an annual basis due to both the seasonality in quarterly fluctuations inherent in some of our businesses. In this context, an annual view of our financial results can be more meaningful and provide more insight into key trends. Therefore, my comments today will focus primarily on annual results. Let me begin with a review of our results for fiscal 2018. Today, we reported fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS of $12.62 reflecting a lower tax rate and share count as well as solid operating results partially offset by the fourth quarter, $0.31 per diluted share contribution to create a nonprofit foundation to combat the opioid epidemic. Turning to Slide 6 of the presentation, our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings exclude the following GAAP-only item. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.60 per diluted share, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $1.20 per diluted share, LIFO inventory related credit of $0.31 per diluted share, restructuring charges of $2.82 per diluted share, including long-lived asset impairment charges and other adjustment net charges of $6.01 per diluted share comprising the non-cash goodwill impairment charges for our European and Rexall businesses and the early repayment of long-term debt that we disclosed last month, which was partially offset by benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business in third quarter. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment testing that takes place in our fourth quarter, we recognized non-cash after-tax goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, principally related to McKesson\u2019s European and Rexall businesses, which were driven primarily by government actions in these markets. The European charges were driven by a weakening script growth outlook in our UK retail pharmacy business and a more competitive environment in our French wholesale distribution business. The Rexall charges relate primarily to the reason we implemented generics reimbursement reductions across Canada and minimum wage increases in multiple provinces. As it relates to our fiscal 2019, these two items, the reimbursement reductions and the minimum wage increases represented gross pre-tax headwind of between $100 million and $120 million. As John discussed, the Canadian team is working to mitigate the impact of these actions and we are confident that these initiatives will reduce the negative impact to our results in fiscal \u201819. Now, let\u2019s turn to the details of our consolidated full year fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings, which can be found on Slide 8. Consolidated revenues for the full year increased 4% in constant currency versus the prior period primarily driven by market growth in acquisitions partly offset by the contribution of the majority of our technology solutions businesses to Change Healthcare in late fiscal \u201817 and the transition of Rite-Aid stores in the second half of fiscal \u201818. Full year adjusted gross profit was down 2% in constant currency year-over-year, primarily driven by the Change Healthcare transactions and the year-over-year effect of increased price competition in our independent pharmacy business in fiscal 2017, which we fully lap during fiscal 2018. These drivers were partially offset by organic growth, including contribution from our joint sourcing entity, ClarusONE and contributions from acquisitions closed in fiscal 2017 and 2018. Full year adjusted operating expenses increased 3% on a constant currency basis driven by acquisitions partially offset by the Change Healthcare transaction and ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted income from operations was $3.9 billion for the year, a decrease of 4% in constant currency. Interest expense of $283 million decreased 8% in constant currency for the year driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates and net long-term debt repayments, which is partially offset by short-term borrowings. Now, moving to taxes, our adjusted tax rate was 19.6% for the year driven by our mix of business, a lower U.S. tax rate from recently enacted federal tax reform, the beneficial impact of the onshoring of our technology intellectual property in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and discrete tax benefits. Additionally, income attributable to non-controlling interest was $230 million for the year, an increase of 173% in constant currency primarily driven by fee income from Clarus. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $2.6 billion for the year, with full year adjusted EPS at $12.62 per diluted share, up 1% compared to $12.54 in the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, during the fourth quarter, we completed $750 million of share repurchases bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to approximately $1.7 billion. As a result, share repurchase activity late in fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2018 our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 6% year-over-year to $209 million. Next, I will review our segment results, which can be found on Slide 9 and 10. Starting with our Distribution Solutions segment, revenues were $208.1 billion for the year. Revenues benefited from $1.6 billion in favorable currency rate movement. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% year-over-year. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 6% driven by market growth in acquisitions partially offset by brand to generic conversions, lower revenues due to the transition of Rite-Aid stores and 2 less sale days in our U.S. pharmaceutical business. International pharmaceutical distribution services revenues were $27.3 billion for the year. Revenues benefited from $1.3 billion in favorable currency rate movement. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 5% driven by acquisitions and market growth. And finally, Medical-Surgical revenues increased 6% for the year driven by market growth, including a stronger than anticipated flu season. Segment adjusted gross profit was up 12% on a constant current basis driven by acquisitions in organic growth across multiple business units, including strategic sourcing benefits from ClarusONE. These gains were partially offset by the year-over-year lapping effects of increased price competition and our independent pharmacy business in fiscal 2017 and the impact of reduced reimbursement in our UK retail pharmacy business. Segment adjusted operating expenses increased 14% on a constant currency basis. This increase was driven by acquisitions in the midst of retail and technology businesses partially offset by ongoing cost management efforts. Full year segment adjusted operating profit increased 8% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis to $4.1 billion driven by the same factors as previously discussed. The full year segment adjusted operating margin rate was 196 basis points, an increase of 3 basis points. Turning to our Technology Solutions segment, revenues for the year of $240 million reflects the contribution in the first half of the year from the now-divested Enterprise Information Solutions business, which also contributed $32 million to adjusted operating profit. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $272 million for the year, which was in line with our expectations. Next, McKesson reported $527 million in full year adjusted corporate expenses, an increase of 30% year-over-year primarily driven by the previously discussed fourth quarter $100 million contribution to create a nonprofit foundation. I will now review our working capital metrics and cash flow which could be found on Slide 11. For receivables, day sales outstanding decreased 2 days from the prior year to 25 days. Day sales and inventory was flat at 30 days and days payables outstanding decreased 1 day from the prior year to 60 days. I would remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow maybe impacted by timing including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. These working capital metrics, along with our continued focus on cash generation, results in $4.3 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2018 above our original guidance. In addition to our outstanding execution, a portion of the gains we made in fiscal \u201818 were related to timing. Approximately $500 million of the operating cash flow performance was driven favorably by the fiscal year ending on a Good Friday and the early receipt of a customer payment that was anticipated to be received in fiscal 2019. Outside of year end timing impact and the transition of approximately 1,900 Rite-Aid stores late in the fiscal year, we had solid focus and execution on cash generation. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. For the year, McKesson repaid approximately $765 million in net long-term debt and $580 million on internal capital investments, a $2.9 billion for acquisitions repurchased approximately $1.7 billion in common stock and paid $262 million in dividends. And yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization. We now have a total of $5.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our new segment reporting structure effective in fiscal 2019. As previously disclosed we began an evaluation of our management and reporting structure. As a result of this review, we will now report our financial results in three reportable segments : U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, which included our now joint U.S. pharmaceutical and McKesson Specialty Health businesses, European pharmaceutical solutions and Medical-Surgical solutions. All remaining operating segments and business activities are included in other primarily comprised of our McKesson Canada business, our MRxTS business and the equity method investment in Change Healthcare. We believe this new segment reporting will provide increased transparency and visibility for the underlying operating performance of the businesses within McKesson. I encourage you to review the second 8-K that we filed today provides historical supplemental information on the basis of this new reporting segment structure and will help you frame our 2019 outlook. Before I get to our fiscal 2019 outlook, I\u2019d like to briefly update you on the multiyear strategic initiatives we announced in late April. As we have discussed, we are focused on driving growth by improving the alignment of our operations to support the key growth pillars that we have discussed with you in April. Specific areas of operational focus over this multiyear period through delivering efficiency, driving cost out functional areas such as informational technology, finance and human resources. Additionally, we are focused on investing and developing world class data and analytics platforms and building solutions to become more efficient and agile. These efforts are expected to yield increased productivity and operational flexibility. I am sure that our operations have the right operating and financial rigor and generate meaningful cost savings for the organization and fiscal 2019 will help fund the growth pillars that we have outlined. As part of preliminary phase of this initiative, we continue to expect to incur GAAP-only after-tax restructuring and other charges of approximately targeted $150 million to $210 million in fiscal 2019. I will remind you that these GAAP charges are not included in our adjusted earnings outlook. Now, let me provide context to our fiscal 2019 outlook. As described in our press release issued today, McKesson will no longer provide forward-looking GAAP guidance. We will continue to provide transparency around our GAAP results, including the reconciliation of our adjusted earnings to GAAP results. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13 to 13.80. This guidance reflects low to high single-digit growth in adjusted earnings year-over-year. As a reminder, our fiscal \u201819 adjusted earnings outlook excludes the following items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments; LIFO inventory-related charges or credits, gains from antitrust legal settlement, restructuring charges and other adjustments, which may include gains or losses from divestitures, asset impairments or adjustments to claim and litigation reserves. I refer you to the list of assumptions included in the press release we issued today, which are also on Slides 14, 15 and 16 rather than go through each assumptions, said walk you through the key items in our outlook. On a consolidated basis, we expect revenue growth in the mid single-digits year-over-year driven by market growth and previously closed our announced acquisitions. Adjusted income from operations anticipated to be down slightly to up mid single-digits. For the U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment, we expect low to mid single-digit revenue growth year-over-year reflecting market growth and acquisitions partially offset by Rite-Aid and adjusted operating profit is anticipated to be flat to down mid single-digits driven primarily by customer losses partially offset by organic growth and accretion from acquisitions. In the U.S. market, we anticipate branded pharmaceutical percentage price increases in the mid to high single-digits consistent with fiscal 2018. As I noted on our third quarter earnings call, while the overall brand inflation rate is important, it\u2019s less important to McKesson as we have evolved our branded compensation arrangements to reduce the variability associated with brand inflation. And for the generic environment, all of our customers will continue to benefit from our strategic sourcing through ClarusONE. And on the sell side, we see the market environment as competitive, but stable. Last, in terms of new oral generic pharmaceutical launches in the U.S., the profit contribution is expected to be nominal. For the European pharmaceutical solutions segment, we expect flat to mid single-digit revenue growth year-over-year reflecting market growth and flat to mid single-digit adjusted operating profit growth, which is anticipated to be driven by organic growth partially offset by the lapping effect of the UK government initiatives I mentioned earlier. This outlook assumes typical reimbursement cuts in the UK market. As we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we initiated a cost savings program in response to the UK government announcement of additional reimbursement cuts, which were incremental to their more typical annual reimbursement reductions. This initiative included identifying and implementing actions to offset the fiscal 2019 impact of reimbursement cuts, which included approximately 200 store closures or divestitures. The program is substantially completed in fiscal 2018 and we anticipate realizing savings of fiscal 2019 as a result of the program. For Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we expect low double-digit revenue growth year-over-year, reflecting the anticipated close of the MSD acquisition and market growth and mid to high single-digit adjusted operating profit growth which is anticipated to be driven by the ongoing shift of care to lower cost alternative-site care we serve and modest accretion from MSD, which we expect to close in the first half of fiscal 2019. For other, we expect low single-digit revenue growth year-over-year reflecting market growth and flat adjusted operating profit, which is anticipated to be primarily driven by growth in our MRxTS business offset by the negative impact of Canadian government initiatives, which I mentioned earlier. For Change Healthcare, we anticipate the equity contribution to grow in the low to mid single-digits primarily reflecting progress against the cost synergy target partially offset by anticipated higher interest expense. As a reminder, the equity contribution from Change Healthcare maybe impacted by the tax rates applicable to the underlying businesses, which includes a mix of pass-through and taxable income. Corporate expenses are expected to decline year-over-year primarily driven by the fiscal \u201818 contribution to create a nonprofit foundation partially offset by incremental technology investments planned in fiscal 2019. We expect both interest expense and NCI to decline year-over-year and the guidance range assumes an adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 23%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. This adjusted tax rate reflects our mix of businesses and the benefit of a lower federal tax rate partially offset by a changed accounting rules no longer allows the company to reduce its tax rate for the amortization benefit related to the intercompany sale software with Technology Solutions segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect weighted average diluted shares for fiscal 2019 to be approximately $200 million, which reflects the impact of share repurchase activity completed in fiscal 2018 and the benefit of share repurchases anticipated in fiscal 2019. In addition, we expect the positive foreign currency impact of up to $0.10 in fiscal 2019. In terms of fiscal \u201819 earnings progression, we expect the first half quarterly EPS progression to be similar to last year and that the second half will have a stronger relative EPS constitution. Turning to cash flow, beginning in fiscal 2019, we plan to provide guidance on free cash flow as we believe this non-GAAP measure provides a more useful metric as the company\u2019s ability to generate cash. We defined free cash flow as cash flow from operations, less property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $3 billion in fiscal 2019, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures estimated to be between $600 million and $800 million. In closing, I am pleased to reiterate our fiscal \u201819 adjusted EPS outlook of $13 to $13.80 and introduced our new segment reporting structure, which we believe will provide you with more insight into our performance. And I am confident that the efforts underway to transform our operating model will drive increased efficiency and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Let\u2019s turn the call over to our operator. Operator : Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Hey, thanks. Good morning, John and Britt. Thanks for all the extra segment details. I guess just drilling in a little bit deeper on the U.S. pharma segment with the operating profits expected to be flat to down a little bit in fiscal \u201819 you mentioned Rite-Aid as the key factor, but I am curious just two other quick questions around that. First, are there any material customer contract renewals also baked into that assumption and also is there any quantification of the acquisition contribution into that U.S. pharma segment EBIT expectation as well? Thanks. John Hammergren : Thanks for the questions, Steven. This is John. Our assumption around customer contract renewals is pretty consistent with what we have experienced in the past. So as you know we typically renew our customer contracts when they come up and we do a pretty good job of making sure that value is delivered to our customers and then we continue to drive efficiency in our organization. So I think the time that we have really come up on the negative end of customer contract renewals has been related primarily to consolidations where sometimes we can\u2019t predict which way a customer might land or certainly the acquiring company might weigh more heavily in those decisions. So I think our forecast clearly would expect us to continue to renew our contracts and they have the normal kind of cadence of those renewals. Britt, perhaps you can help with the second question? Britt Vitalone : Yes, thanks for that. As it relates to M&A and the impact that we expected to have, as you know last year, we completed a number of acquisitions and in the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of RxCrossroads and I would remind you that we provided you an accretion estimate by the end of year three of about $0.25, but we completed a number of acquisitions that we are excited about, we think that they are going to add to the overall excitement and RxCrossroads is a good example of that. Steven Valiquette : Sorry, it\u2019s future acquisitions though is there any assumption for that in there or is that not in there? Britt Vitalone : No, we have outlined for you the acquisition of MSD which we announced in our April call. John Hammergren : Which is in the medical segment. Steven Valiquette : Okay, got it. Okay, thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. John, I just want to go back to your comment though about renewals on existing customers, can you just remind us are contracts generally renewed exactly at the date that they expire or is the anticipation that perhaps you give up some pricing prior to that expiration date, because that\u2019s an important relationship? John Hammergren : Well, that\u2019s a good question, Lisa. I would say, our history is that we maintain these relationships for very long times. The contracts might have duration of let\u2019s say an average 3 years, but many of their relationships go decades and our typical pattern is to renew those relationships or extend those contracts in a form that\u2019s very similar to what it\u2019s been in the past. So, I\u2019d say most of them don\u2019t renew exactly on the expiration date. They usually sort of a rolling process of renewals before they expire to the standard to move forward with the relationships. So, your point is accurate. I can\u2019t give you specific time, but these things would renew usually in advance of their expiration date. Lisa Gill : And so I think what we just want to understand is that, that\u2019s included in the guidance you gave, your anticipation is that you are going to renew the relationships that you have and that there could be some element of renewed pricing in the guidance that was given today? John Hammergren : Absolutely. I mean, our guidance fully reflects what we anticipate will happen in fiscal \u201819 and reflects the contracts that are expiring in our anticipation of not only the renewal, but also likely financial impact of those renewals. So, that\u2019s fully included. Now, clearly, we could be surprised and we don\u2019t anticipate that we are going to lose our customer base and that our assumptions are built into this forecast. Lisa Gill : And then as a follow-up to that, when we think about incremental opportunities, we should think about those renewals and I think about ClarusONE, what are some of the incremental things you can add to that platform, over-the-counter products is one thing that comes to mind for me. Is over-the-counter an opportunity, do you think of other things that you can put into your purchasing procurement as you think about those renewals with some of these larger contracts that you have? John Hammergren : Well, Britt helped us build ClarusONE, I will let him address ClarusONE specifically, but obviously one of the things we are trying to do also is to get more and more of our customers to buy all of their generics from us and that compliance to our generic purchasing requirements continues to expand. So that\u2019s part of the value that we derived both for our customers and for ourselves is getting more and more people into sourcing all of their generics from McKesson. As it relates to going beyond just generic purchases, Britt, maybe you can talk about future opportunities. Britt Vitalone : Sure. Thanks for that question. With ClarusONE, we are certainly working with Walmart, but also our other customers to understand where we have opportunities to leverage our scale collectively with our customer base. OTC is certainly an opportunity for us and it\u2019s one that we have discussed among other, many other opportunities at Walmart. So clearly looking at how we can help our customers and how we can leverage scale across ClarusONE and our customers to deliver across multiple categories is certainly something that we are talking about and considering as we move ClarusONE forward. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. Glen Santangelo : Yes, thanks and good morning. John, it\u2019s pretty clear that your pharmaceutical and specialty solutions business is going through a pretty significant evolution here with respect to specialty and the generic tailwinds seemingly are largely in the rearview mirror. In your prepared remarks, you talked about your differential pricing strategy for brand and specialty and generics, could you talk about maybe how some of those contract renewals have gone with respect to this new pricing strategy? Is that having a near-term dilutive impact on your margins or how should we think about that? John Hammergren : Well, thanks for the question. I think as we have indicated and we began this process several years ago and as our contracts have renewed we have been very successful in working with our customers to provide specific pricing to the five categories of product purchases that I described. I think we have been quite successful and I would anticipate we will complete this process throughout this fiscal year and perhaps slightly into next fiscal year. I think what you are seeing in our business is a continued focus on driving value for our customers on many dimensions. Certainly, the specialty business is focused on the clinics, the U.S. oncology business, the things we do outside of the hospital continues to perform very well and grow rapidly, but there is also a growing portion specialty that\u2019s inside of our standard U.S. pharmaceutical business. That mix change continues to be reflected in some margin pressure in our business and that\u2019s what we have been attempting to alleviate when we renegotiated these contracts, having said that, there is incremental profit being derived from the sale of the specialty items even in these hospital settings. So I think the margin expansion opportunity that we have achieved in the past has been partially driven by the move to generics, it\u2019s certainly been driven by the efficiency in our operations and now it\u2019s going to increasingly be driven by our ability to become more efficient in our operation to offset a little bit by the mix change that we are seeing. Britt Vitalone : I would add to that, John, that, clearly the focus is not just on the customers as we think about the growth of specialty we work very collaboratively across our customers and our manufacturing partners to find the value not only for our customers, but our manufacturer partners if you think about our specialty business which we have invested in, we have a range of services and capabilities that we can help provide our manufacturing partners as well. So our focus here is obviously to get the right compensation for all five categories, but we do that looking across collaboratively on manufacturing partners and our customers. Glen Santangelo : Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up and I apologize if I missed it on Change Healthcare, have you given us an update on the timing for the IPO? John Hammergren : We haven\u2019t been very specific on the timing, I think because we are continuing to evaluate when the best time is for that company to go public. It\u2019s going to be dependent on our view of the synergy and the flow of the synergies that we outlined at the beginning of the business case, obviously, the revenue projections for the business and then clearly market conditions. So I think stay tuned as we get closer to picking a date, we will certainly advise you, but the plan remains as it has been to take the company to an LDO \u2013 or excuse me an IPO process. Glen Santangelo : Thanks for the comments. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, this is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. Just sort of following up on Glen\u2019s question, can you touch more broadly about the opportunity that you see in specialty today versus in the past, I know that there has obviously been some changes and commentary from HHS about shift of Part D. The Part D is sort of, how would that impact U.S. oncology or sort of your thoughts more generally on the topic would be very helpful? John Hammergren : Well, certainly, the exposure we have in specialty continues to grow and we have put the company in a position where we think we can benefit through this new growth cycle. A lot of the innovation that\u2019s coming from the pharmaceutical industry is coming as you mentioned in the specialty categories in particular in oncology. And as Britt was talking about a few minutes ago, some of the acquisitions we have done on the internal development we have done has been to provide incremental services to pharma manufacturers, particularly those that are focused on specialty launches and what can we do to support them. So we have an increasing revenue and profit stream coming from the manufacturer services part of our business both in medical and in pharmaceutical products and we continue to increase the exposure the company has and the opportunity we have to support those launches with the manufacturers. As it relates specifically to reimbursement, clearly, we are following that very closely. We do, our customers in particular, had some exposure to what type of reimbursement models the government might put in place, but I think clearly everyone would agree that service provided by community-based physicians provides not only better access and convenience at people, quality, but it also does it at a much lower cost. And so I think that certainly ourselves and other people that are involved in the channel would clearly recognize and the payers as well recognize that community-based services of these specialty products is the place that people should go. So I am pleased with our footprint and I think we will continue to grow nicely as these products come to market. Elizabeth Anderson : Alright, that was helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up outside of specialty, what are your, sort of organic and inorganic priorities given your general shift towards higher gross margin business segment? John Hammergren : Well, you can see some of it played out in the acquisitions that we are doing. And as we have talked about the acquisitions in last year and the years prior, we are obviously trying to increase our exposure to specialty in the manufacturer services which we have talked about. We would see us continuing to invest in our Medical-Surgical business, MSD is a good example of that and you have seen us continue to expand our ability to attract customers through innovation from a technology perspective. So I think you will see us continue to invest across some very good dimensions and we obviously have done some acquisitions in our U.S. pharmaceutical business as well that have performed very well. So, I think it remains opportunities for us to continue to expand our service for our customers. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Hi, good morning. John, as we think about these contract renegotiations and you have been talking about the services that you can offer to manufacturers, so how are you thinking about the ability to leverage some of these wraparound services and capabilities that you have and how that could help you, so as we think about the contract renegotiations? John Hammergren : Well, you mentioned manufacturers in the middle of it, so we do have obviously contracts with providers. Brian Tanquilut : I am sorry, I mean contract with the providers, but do the services that you provide the manufacturers and the wraparound, I mean, does that help you at all as you look at negotiating your contracts with the clients \u2013 with the providers? John Hammergren : Well, I certainly think on many dimensions it will. In some cases, we have exclusive access to products that we might be shipping to do our specialty pharmacy businesses. Clearly, in the medical side of our business, we have special arrangements with lab supplies and others, so that our customers would have a difficult time finding the complete set of solutions from another source and so that would be part of it. I would say that the services we provide to our customers in our biggest business, our U.S. pharmaceutical business continues to be driven by our ability to innovate and help them deliver value beyond just the cost of goods that we provide. So you have seen this grow our business significantly, for example, with Health Marts over a decade now, over close to 5,000 stores and that\u2019s driven largely not just by the price of our generics as an example but by the value we can deliver to the store, improving their profitability, improving their access to patients and putting them into these narrow networks and making sure that they are getting a consistent supply of customers and new customers and growing the way the relationship can become over time through a more fulsome set of capabilities and we are doing the same thing on many dimensions with our largest customers. And that\u2019s why our renewal rate with our customer basis has been so successful. We mentioned in our prepared comments that we have renewed or continued or expanded or pushed out our date of expiration on these large independent GPO customers. So, almost all of those now have been renewed and have been expanded. That happens because of the total value that we are able to deliver to our customers. I mean, if you back and look at our customer retention across even our largest most sophisticated customers, we largely retain those customers unless there is something disruptive that happens in the marketplace. So I think we are quite confident that we will continue to build these relationships and continue to expand in it. That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have price pressure in it. We don\u2019t have to renegotiate and get back some of the efficiencies we have derived over years in serving the customer, which will provide obviously some downward pressure on our margins, which is reflected in our guidance. I think we remain pretty committed to adding value to our relationships and expanding them. Brian Tanquilut : Now, appreciate it, John. Just my follow-up since you have touched on generics, as we think about your guidance for 2019 and then you talked earlier about the stability or 2018 was the stabilization year, what are you expecting in terms of generic pricing, what are you baking into the guidance at this point? Thanks. John Hammergren : Well, we don\u2019t talk specifically about generic pricing. I would say the way we think about generics, that was when we want to be the best buyer of generics in the marketplace and we believe we are today or currently equal to everyone that\u2019s sourcing generics, our scale is quite significant. ClarusONE has performed exceptionally well and our customers benefit from the scale that we provide and certainly the manufacturers do from the share we are able to deliver consistently to them through these relationships. On the sell side of our relationship, we are committed to making sure that our customers retain or I should say obtain a competitive price and we know where the market price is for our customers on a molecule by molecule basis and we are committed to making sure that they remain competitive. And in the middle, between those are the spread or the return that we get for the work that we do. So, I think we see a more normalized generic market as compared to the recent past and we are confident we continue to manage that business on both the buying side and the selling side appropriately. Brian Tanquilut : I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I just wanted to go back to the U.S. pharma and specialty business and how you are thinking about growth over time, I know you have mentioned Rite-Aid, we have talked about contract renewals, obviously M&A is always going to be a part of the algorithm, but John, if you take a step back you know the guidance for flat to down mid single-digit EBIT in that segment obviously a lot of moving pieces in \u201819, but if you take a step back, how are you thinking about growth in that business? I mean, is it flat to down the right algorithm or do you think that there is things based on even some of the things you just discussed, is there ways that could expand EBIT, grow EBIT as we look forward maybe even beyond \u201819 in the U.S. pharma and specialty segment? John Hammergren : Robert, I want to turn this question over to Britt in just a moment, because he has spent some time thinking about it. But I would \u2013 my earlier answer related to the total value proposition we delivered to our customers is part of the way we begin to grow profitability in the direction of revenue growth and clearly, that\u2019s a priority for us. There are some near-term headwinds partially driven by mix, partially driven by our anticipation of contract renewals, I would say for the most part that the business is positioned to perform well and we really have a foundation setting year going on in our U.S. pharma and specialty business, but Britt maybe you can add some color? Britt Vitalone : Yes, thanks for the question. I would say that our \u201819 guide is really reflective of some of the customer loss activity in transition, but Rite-Aid stores that we mentioned during our prepared remarks, but as we think about that business, specialty has been outlined for us as one of the key pillars. We think we have a lot of services and capabilities that we can provide not only our customers, but our manufacturing partners. And we think that\u2019s going to position us well to participate in the growth of specialty from a dollar profit growth perspective. We have also made a number of acquisitions that we outlined through FY \u201818 that we believe are going to continue to strengthen our position in not only specialty, but the manufacturer services component of that business. While we have some near-term headwinds as John outlined, the business we believe is well positioned to take advantage of growing specialty marketplace. Robert Jones : That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just to follow-up, you guys mentioned a multiyear cost initiative, can you share anything just as far as how much of that is expected to impact \u201819? And then I guess more specifically where within the segments and the corporate line should we be expecting to see a lot of those initiatives start to take hold? Britt Vitalone : Yes, sure. As we mentioned in our earlier remarks, we are in the preliminary phase of our operating model work. We have outlined for you an expected set of restructuring charges for that preliminary base and we have also outlined for you that we expect that these savings that will generate will be modest in FY \u201819 as we build through some of these capabilities and some of these cost programs that we are looking at. So, we are in early phases of it. In FY \u201819 you should expect to see some investments and some savings that will help fund those investments that will really benefit us as we go into \u201820 and beyond. Robert Jones : Alright. Thanks so much. Operator : We will take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, good morning and thank you for taking my question. The narrative out of Washington is very focused on the middleman and we are getting a lot of questions from investors about what a potential shift away from gross to net pricing model could impact you guys? So, John, can you just kind of like help us think through that and also how does \u2013 how and does this is being reflected in the some of the conversation that you are having with the manufacturers? John Hammergren : Well, thanks for the question, Ricky. Clearly, there is \u2013 unless the government decides to impose some type of price methodology and price fixing or some type of price controls like we have in other socialized countries, but the gross to net discussion is really one that is in some control with the pharmaceutical manufacturers. And as we analyze what\u2019s being said and we think the question of middleman is primarily focused on people outside of the pharmaceutical wholesaling business, the people that are heavily involved in receiving and/or processing rebates, incentives etcetera. So, we don\u2019t think the focus and the discussion is really wholesalers\u2019 business model and so that will be a part of my reflection on the question. And the second is that you can imagine that at the net price it\u2019s realized by pharmaceutical manufacturers is a derivative of all of the discounts that they are providing and rebates they are providing to many, many different customers. And if you were to think about how they would move to a single price and what effect that would have on their profitability, it will be quite dramatic. I don\u2019t think the manufacturers would be inclined to move to a single price for all of their customers and to not use \u2013 to go forward without using some type of rebate in their incentive programs to recognize the various discounts that are required to obtain business from different players in the industry. Having said all of that if they were to pursue some type of an environment where our business model has changed and the economics would change for us, we would do what we have done in the past, which is to sit down with the manufacturers. I reflect to them what their change in behavior has done to our profitability or could do to our profitability and we recoup that profitability by reorienting our agreements in a different fashion. We did this in the past when we went from a purchase process where we were focused on price inflation to a more stabilized environment through fees and we would do a very similar process with the manufacturers in this environment where we attempt to recapture the dollars that are involved here through a different mechanism. And I think we will be successful as we were before. No one in the supply chain has indicated an interest in getting rid of wholesalers and no one is focused on taking away our slim margins. No one has talked to me about the fact that they can find better utility in some other fashion. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite. Our provider customers are using us more and more. They are relying more and more on our service. They order more and more of their products through shutting down their own warehousing. They are dismantling their own purchasing activities. So, they are focused on partnering closely with us. And on the manufacturer side, they are doing the same. They are more and more dependent on our national redistribution center and more focused on our manufacturer services in fact going more and more away from their own operations and using McKesson as a valued partner. So, although there maybe some disruption certainly concerns in a process of the transition that would be significant, I think we would emerge on the other side where we are today are better. Ricky Goldwasser : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then Britt just one follow-up question on the guidance, I mean, obviously there is a wide range in guidance for U.S. North America operating income, it\u2019s somewhere between flat to $150 million. You highlighted Rite-Aid, it\u2019s about a third of the impact. So when we think about the low end of the guidance when we think about the swing factor, what is the biggest factor there outside of Rite-Aid, is it the sell side contracts renegotiation that you highlighted earlier in the call or is it something else? Britt Vitalone : No, well, thanks for the question. As John mentioned, we fully factor in all of the upcoming renewals into our guidance. So that\u2019s already in there. I think what we are reflecting here is as we talked about before we have a couple of customer losses through consolidation in transition with Rite-Aid that is providing a little bit of a near-term headwind for us, but we continue to invest in the business through some of the acquisitions that we have outlined before and we believe that those acquisitions will continue to add value and be accretive to us over the longer term. So I think our guidance on the flat to down mid single-digit as you identified is really reflective of couple of customer losses that we talked about earlier in the call. John Hammergren : And perhaps, Ricky, what folks have missed is that there was a very large acquisition in the grocery business that affected us negatively and we don\u2019t typically talk about specific customers or contracts and maybe some people measure that transaction and its effect on us as well in other grocery operators. We had a couple of transitions last year that we had not anticipated and really do largely to consolidation and we don\u2019t anticipate that going forward, but you see it reflected at least partially in our guidance in addition to the loss of nearly half of those Rite-Aid stores. Britt Vitalone : And I would just reiterate as I talked about the generic environment, we do see a continuing competitive environment, but a more stable environment. I think that\u2019s an important factor to just remind you of. Ricky Goldwasser : Which basically means that it might be a headwind, but it\u2019s a stable one, so as we think about that range we should factor that as well, is that fair? John Hammergren : I think as I mentioned the sell side environment is competitive as it always has been, but it\u2019s a very stable environment now as opposed to what we saw in fiscal \u201817. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. I wanted to go back to the question on pharma and specialty and maybe you could put more simply, what is your view of the organic growth rates top line as well as the type of margin leverage de-leverage you would see on an organic basis kind of taking away the noise that we are seeing at the moment? John Hammergren : Well, thanks for that question, Eric. I will start off with that as we have outlined in our guidance here, our revenue is expected to grow low to mid single-digit. Now, that is reflective of some of the headwinds that we have already identified in our U.S. pharma business. Specialty is clearly the fastest growing product category in the marketplace today and while it has an impact on our margin rate, we are still participating well in growing margin dollars as a result of that specialty growth. And add to that, some of the things we have already talked about our position in specialty and some of the investments that we have made in specialty, it helps us to really leverage and capitalize on those opportunities to grow with specialty. So I think what you are seeing in our overall segment guide is a reflection of the headwinds from the customer losses, but specialty continues to grow nicely and we are continuing to participate in that op profit dollar growth. Eric Percher : I was just going to say is it fair to say that in a normal \u2013 given mix shift, the op profit growth would be modestly less than the revenue growth that\u2019s reasonable, the investments that you are making are to drive op profit growth at or better than the top line growth rate? Britt Vitalone : I think that\u2019s a fair way to characterize it. John Hammergren : Thanks, operator. I think we have time for one more question. Operator : And we will take our final question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thanks for the details so far. So one last question on the U.S. EBIT growth rate, you talked about some of the potential headwinds as you think about the bottom end of the range, if we get to the top end of the range in terms of the flattish number, where are the biggest drivers of that, is it better branded pricing that you expect, is it a push-out of some of the renewal pressure that you may or may not be feeling just trying to understand the full range of outcomes there to understand where the numbers could shake out as you are thinking about the various moving pieces in your business over the course of the year? John Hammergren : Thanks for that question. I think as we think about the range, there is a number of factors that can drive it. I have given you an idea of what our assumption is on branded pricing environment, which we expect to be similar to FY \u201818. So, certainly if the branded pricing inflation environment is different that could certainly impact it. We are very excited about the contributions from ClarusONE we think that we are making great progress there. We certainly have a lot of other opportunities in other product categories as we have talked about today and so that certainly is an element for us that we think that can help us continue to grow and to help our customers grow. And as specialty continues to grow and we continue to position ourselves well with some of the investments that we have made, I think that we are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of that. So, these are few of the factors that I would point out that could help us to get to closer to the top end of that range. Michael Cherny : Thanks. That\u2019s all I have. John Hammergren : Well, I want to thank you operator for your help today and thanks also to all of you on the call for your time. We have a clear strategy and a solid operating plan for fiscal 2019 and exciting growth opportunities across McKesson. Please enjoy the holiday weekend. And now, I will hand the call off to Craig for a review of his upcoming events for the financial community. Craig? Craig Mercer : Thank you, John. We will participate in the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference in Southern California on June 13 and we will be hosting an Investor Day event on June 28 in Boston. We look forward to seeing you in the new fiscal year. Thank you and good bye. Operator : Thank you for joining today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

Ross Muken - Evercore ISI Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to the McKesson Q1 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir. Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you. Thank you, Lynette. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and Britt Vitalone, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and then Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 9 :00 a.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic Current and Annual Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release and forward-looking statement slides for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin, free cash flow and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2019 results and the supplemental slide presentation for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. The supplemental presentation is useful when reviewing the fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 results discussed today. Thank you, and here is John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, Craig and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we reported a solid start to fiscal 2019. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues in excess of $52 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.90, consistent with our expectations. Given our recent update provided at our Investor Day in late June, I will focus my attention on a few topics and will let Britt go through the quarter financial results in greater detail. I'd like to take a moment to discuss the progress we've made against our multiyear strategic growth initiative. First, we continued to proactively execute against our priority growth areas namely the manufacturer value proposition, specialty pharmaceuticals and the role of retail pharmacy. In the past quarter, we closed the Medical Specialties Distributors or MSD acquisition. We accelerated the commercialization for a recently approved specialty prescription medicine with the reimbursement hub in specialty pharmacy support services representing one of the largest programs launched to-date. This is one example of a number of planned future commercializations with this partner and many others. We are executing against the business cases for other recent acquisitions such as CoverMyMeds, intraFUSION, Well.ca and RxCrossroads that also support our priority growth areas, which are beginning to contribute to our earnings growth. Second, we launched a program designed to optimize and drive an efficient operating structure that supports our prioritized growth areas. Britt will discuss these initiatives in more detail shortly. Next let me touch on our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. You'll recall in our year-end earnings call that I outlined a series of initiatives we took in Q2 of last year. These were in response to certain UK government actions. We have substantially achieved the results we outlined, generating savings and efficiencies from the plan we initiated in Q2 last year, rationalizing the store footprint and streamlining our back-office operations. On June 29, the government announced additional cuts to retail pharmacy reimbursement. Although helpful, the restructuring program we put in place in fiscal 2018 will not fully mitigate these new cuts. We will continue to respond to event-driven government actions through company-specific mitigation efforts. We also remain committed to continued policy and education discussions with the health ministry to ensure patients have ongoing access to care in low-cost and convenient settings. We have spoken previously about how retail pharmacy would help to ensure the sustainability of the health system in the UK and elsewhere as more services migrate from higher cost locations into the lower cost pharmacy setting. And the pharmacist plays a critical role in providing a range of personalized healthcare services to the patient. Now, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss our perspective on the recently-announced Health and Human Services blueprint request for information or RFI. The current administration is focused on fostering an affordable, accessible healthcare system that puts patients first, and we fully share this goal. We were also encouraged by the broad scope of the RFI, solving a myriad of healthcare issues is not a simple task and it requires a comprehensive evaluation of the challenges and opportunities. While policy decisions are being evaluated, McKesson continues to engage as a key stakeholder in educating policy makers, addressing issues that may impact patients, our industry and our business partners, and helping to drive the necessary change to support access, quality and affordability for a sustainable healthcare system. We remain confident in McKesson's path forward, the critical role of the services we provide to the healthcare industry today, and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to the healthcare system globally. We can help drive the stated objectives of the administration. Today, we support patient access through affordable generic medication. We do this by leveraging our global scale and efficiency. We're proud to be a leader supporting clinical trials to help bring innovative specialty therapies to market through an increasingly optimized path and to partner with manufacturers and other stakeholders to help bring these new drugs to the patients who need them. We have extensive experience in supporting value-based care with tools, processes and expertise for both commercial and government payers and many of you will recall that through partnership with manufacturers almost 15 years ago, we were able to transform our business model by introducing inventory management agreements and distribution service agreements that significantly improved transparency across the supply chain. Many of you know that distribution service agreements compensate distributors for the fair value of the services provided. These agreements appropriately consider the requirement to maintain an efficient, secure and safe supply chain, high service levels, as well as substantial working capital investment made when taking title to inventory or collecting customer receivables, which together represents tens of billions of dollars on our balance sheet. To the extent changes are made to the current model, we are well-equipped to facilitate the change and to again partner with all stakeholders to ensure a smooth and effective transition. The value we deliver has been validated over the past 15 years through contract renewals, and expanded relationships both upstream and downstream in the supply chain. We remain confident we will continue to demonstrate the value of our highly-scaled and efficient distribution network, our services and capabilities, far into the future. McKesson has the patient at the center of how we think and we want to continue to be a leader in bringing real solutions to the debate that helps to lower cost while improving access and quality. Now to wrap up my comments, McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent an in-line performance across our segments. We believe we are well-positioned to drive future growth with our scaled and efficient foundation, our clear focus on several priority growth areas and improving the efficiency of our operating structure, our leading Technology Solutions for our partners and of course our strong financial position. We are extremely well-positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and to deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Britt and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, John. As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2019 first quarter results were in-line with our expectations and we're reiterating our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings outlook of $13 to $13.80 per diluted share. Please note that unless stated otherwise, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter press release are being reiterated today. I'll start with the results for the first quarter. Turning to slide 6 of the presentation, first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.90 represents an increase of 18% year-over-year driven by a lower tax rate and share count, and growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, partially offset by previously discussed headwinds in our European and Canadian businesses, and a negative $0.05 foreign currency impact. Our first quarter adjusted earnings results excludes the following GAAP- only items : amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $0.74 per diluted share; acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $0.22 per diluted share; LIFO inventory-related credit of $0.07 per diluted share; gains from antitrust legal settlements of $0.13 per diluted share; restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.42 per diluted share; and other adjustment net charges of $2.41 per diluted share, largely comprising a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, primarily triggered by the recently-announced UK government reimbursement reductions as well as a change to our segment reporting structure. As detailed on slide 7, as a function of our segment reporting change in Q1 of FY 2019, our European business is no longer considered a single reporting unit. Following the change during the quarter, the segment was split into two distinct reporting units : Consumer Solutions and Pharmacy Solutions. We're conducting impairment testing of this new reporting unit level. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge during the quarter. Given that impairment testing is now being performed at a more discrete level for this segment, future negative events will trigger additional evaluation and we may be required to report impairment charges in the future. As John discussed, on June 29, the UK government announced additional reimbursement cuts to retail pharmacy. The cuts reduced our estimation of future cash flows resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. We responded to prior government action through our previously announced divestiture of closure of approximately 200 retail stores and, as a result of these recent actions, we are evaluating the effects these measures will have on our business. We will engage in discussions with the UK government to articulate the critical value pharmacy plays. We also recorded restructuring and other charges in the first quarter. These charges primarily relate to the ongoing execution of our multiyear strategic growth initiative. We're making solid progress to restructure and reshape our operating model and investment in strategic growth initiatives we have previously communicated. We're executing against the operating model framework we previously discussed. As one example, after a comprehensive review, we've expanded our strategic partnership with a business process outsource provider, which will allow us to continue our transformation of key supporting functions. This important step will allow us to swiftly move select functions out of our operations into our business process service provider, reducing costs and increasing productivity. We're making progress against our enterprise spend program. We've identified several cost categories that will leverage the scale of McKesson. We're confident these initiatives will generate meaningful and sustained savings. We expect to provide quantification of the operating model and cost-out targets next quarter. And we continue to expect to incur GAAP-only after-tax restructuring and other charges of approximately $150 million to $210 million in fiscal 2019. I'll remind you that these GAAP charges are not included in our adjusted earnings outlook. Now let's turn to the details of our consolidated first quarter adjusted earnings, which can be found on slide 8. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 3% versus the prior period, primarily driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously disclosed customer losses in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segments. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 2%. First quarter adjusted gross profit was up 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by market growth including the timing of branded pharmaceutical compensation in the prior-year and acquisitions, partially offset by customer losses. First quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year primarily driven by acquisitions. Adjusted income from operations was $796 million for the year (sic) [quarter] (13:36), an increase of 1%. Interest expense of $61 million decreased 10% for the quarter driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates, partially offset by short-term borrowings. Now let's move to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, driven by our mix of business and a discrete tax benefit. We continue to assume an adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 23% for the year, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Additionally, income attributable to non-controlling interest was $58 million for the quarter, an increase of 4%. For fiscal 2019, we continue to expect income attributable to non-controlling interests to decline year-over-year. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $589 million with first quarter adjusted earnings of $2.90 per diluted share, up 18% compared to $2.46 in the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, our first quarter diluted weighted average shares were 203 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we completed approximately $300 million of share repurchases, and we continue to expect diluted weighted average shares of approximately 200 million for the year. Next, I'll review our segment results which can be found on slides 9 to 12. As a reminder, effective in fiscal 2019, McKesson revised its segment reporting structure. We now report results in three main segments, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, European Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions. All other businesses which primarily include McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions or MRxTS and our equity investment in Change Healthcare are included in Other. We believe that this segment reporting provides increased transparency and visibility of the underlying operating performance of the businesses within McKesson. In addition, in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2018, contribution from Enterprise Information Solutions or EIS is included in Other. EIS contributed $17 million in adjusted operating profit for both the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 for a total contribution of $34 million. We start first with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $41 billion for the quarter, up 2% driven by market growth partially offset by previously disclosed customer losses in branded to generic conversion. Segment-adjusted operating profit for the quarter was up 2% to $540 million, driven by market growth, the timing of branded pharmaceutical compensation in the prior year and growth in our Plasma and Biologics distribution business, which is partially offset by customer losses. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate was 132 basis points, an increase of 1 basis point as increased branded compensation was offset by our mix of business. We continue to see a growing mix in specialty pharmaceutical and we continue to benefit from the dollar contribution of these products, although it is dilutive to the margin rate. Moving now to European Pharmaceutical Solutions, revenues were $6.9 billion for the quarter, up 9%. Revenues benefited from $487 million in favorable currency rate movement. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 1% driven by market growth and acquisitions, largely offset by the previously disclosed increased competition in France, as well as a reduction in owned retail pharmacies in the UK following the closure and divestiture of approximately 200 stores. Segment-adjusted operating profit was down 12% to $74 million. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was down 18% to $69 million driven by the impact of reduced reimbursement and the reclassification of certain prescriptions of over-the-counter products in our UK retail pharmacy business and increased competition in the French wholesale markets. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate was 107 basis points on a constant currency basis, a decrease of 25 basis points. As a result of the first quarter segment performance, as well as the incremental government cuts I mentioned earlier, we now expect segment-adjusted operating profit to be at the low end of the previously provided range of flat to mid-single digit growth. Moving to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 11% driven by market growth and one month of contribution from the MSD acquisition. Segment-adjusted operating profit for the quarter was flat at $125 million driven by market growth offset by timing of certain events. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate was 734 basis points, a decrease of 81 basis points, reflecting our mix of business. Finishing our business review with Other, revenues were $3 billion for the quarter, up 5%. Revenues benefited from $111 million in favorable currency rate movement. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 1% driven primarily by market growth across the businesses in the segment and acquisitions, largely offset by the impact of government actions in our McKesson Canada business and the prior-year sale of the EIS business. Other adjusted operating profit was down 8% to $213 million. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was $204 million driven by the impact of previously-disclosed government initiatives on our Canadian business, the prior year's sale of the EIS business and a lower equity contribution from Change Healthcare, partially offset by growth in MRxTS. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $64 million for the quarter. Next, McKesson reported $95 million in adjusted corporate expense, a decrease of 16% in constant currency year-over-year primarily driven by timing and lower incentive compensation. We continue to anticipate that adjusted corporate expenses will decline in the low double-digit percentage in fiscal 2019. I'll now review our working capital metrics and cash flow, which can be found on slide 13. Our receivables days sales outstanding was flat at 26 days, days sales in inventory increased 1 day to 30 days and days payables outstanding decreased 1 day from the prior-year to 58 days. I would remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion. For the quarter, McKesson paid $826 million for acquisitions, repurchased approximately $300 million in common stock and paid $71 million in dividends. In the first quarter, McKesson used $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations, which was in line with expectations. As a reminder, our operating cash flow can vary significantly depending on timing. As we discussed on our Q4 conference call, in the fourth quarter, we received a customer payment that had been anticipated for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. After deducting $145 million for internal capital investments, McKesson had negative free cash flow of $1.2 billion, again in line with our expectations. For fiscal 2019, we continue to expect internal capital investments of between $600 million and $800 million, and free cash flow of approximately $3 billion. And yesterday, our board of directors approved an increase of $0.05 for our quarterly dividend or 15% to $0.39, which will be payable to shareholders in October. The increase to our dividend reflects our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders as part of a balanced approach to capital deployment. We also have a total of $4.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Before I wrap up, we continue to expect a positive foreign currency impact of up to $0.10 in fiscal 2019 and, in terms of fiscal 2019 earnings progression, we continue to expect that the second half will have a stronger relative EPS contribution similar to our fiscal 2018 results. In closing, I'm pleased with the progress being made on our operating model and cost-out initiatives, which will drive increased efficiency and productivity in our operations and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. We had a solid start to fiscal 2019 and we're reiterating our fiscal 2019 outlook with adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13 to $13.80. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask you to limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Take your first caller, Glen Santangelo from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks and good morning. Thanks for taking my question. John, I just wanted to discuss two pretty high-level issues that I think are on everyone's mind and just sort of get your take. There's been a lot of rhetoric in the market around branded price inflation. You've seen some activity by a number of the manufacturers and so I'm kind of curious, have you had conversations regarding that and how you think that could ultimately impact the balance of your fiscal year? And then secondly, my follow-up would be around the administration's criticism around the current rebating system and the potential push to move from gross-to-net pricing and so both those issues in aggregate could have at least a meaningful near-term impact on your business and I'm sure there will be some type of mitigation efforts, but could you just give us your updated thinking on both those issues? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the questions, Glen. Clearly, both of these issues are not new to the discussion. I think obviously the concerns or the comments around it have increased in frequency in the last several months, but several years ago, people began to talk about the widening spread, the use of rebates, the transparency or lack thereof of those tools and clearly, we've dealt with the changes in branded inflation for many years. I mentioned in my opening comments about the transition 15 years ago that the company I think helped lead to a more stabilized, more transparent relationship with the branded manufacturers in particular, focused on making sure that our model was not fully dependent on price inflation as one of the key drivers to our economics and over time, we've discussed with our shareholders that the view that we maintain some exposure to price increases in our P&Ls, but that exposure is significantly less than what it would have been going back in time and our relationship with manufacturers continues to be extremely productive. We have not only renewed all of those relationships time and time again over 15 years, but the conversations with the manufacturers have broadened in their context to include not just Distribution Solutions, but also go-to-market solutions as I highlighted also in my opening comments, helping people with product launches, helping them handle specialty products that require a lot of additional attention, and clearly helping them get better take-up on their new launches as well as better adherence to the prescriptions being written by physicians and reducing the friction, things like CoverMyMeds, those tools, allow patients to get access to these drugs faster, better economics and clearly without having to wait sometimes weeks to get authorization to take the meds. So, we've been evolving the model with branded manufacturers and specialty manufacturers, and I'm quite pleased and positive about my future outlook of our evolution of services focused on those manufacturers. As it relates to the impact of the year, I think Britt and I continue to evaluate how much value we expect in our guidance relative to branded price inflation and obviously we provided a range at the beginning of the year with an expectation of where that branded inflation would likely come in. Clearly, the month of July we believe is running at a rate that's less than what we would have normally expected, but I think several of these manufacturers have talked about delaying their price actions until later in the year, as they see how this transition or this model change progresses or doesn't progress. So, I think we're committed to continue to work with manufacturers and to make sure that we mitigate whatever negative impacts might occur as a result of their change. As it relates to the rebating that goes on, clearly, we are students of this industry and have some awareness of the to-ing and fro-ing of the manufacturing relationships with those that are negotiating formularies with them. We don't participate in the rebate structure that goes to the payers and the debate on gross-to-net is a very interesting discussion because as I've described I think in the past on conversations with you and others that although there obviously is a financially net price or average price that's realized by our manufacturing partners, that's not a single net. It's an aggregation of multiple nets and I don't see necessarily the ability or the desire of the industry to have a one-price for all type of a strategy. Now, we don't control what the manufacturers do and we don't have any input on how they set their prices, how much inflation they have or how much rebate they provide to the people in the channel, but what I would say is that if there is a significant reduction in the list price of these products where most of the driver of our economics is derived from, then we will be in discussions with manufacturers to make sure that we get the appropriate reimbursement for the fair value of the services we provide and our rate of return on a lower sell price would have to reflect the recoupment of that value so that we come out at a similar place to where we are today. We clearly agree with many others in the channel that cash payers of these drugs are being forced to pay list price and other abnormalities as they have risen over decades of these types of business models need to be addressed and Americans should get a fair price for the pharmaceuticals, but at the same time, a system like this that has been developed over decades can't be completely reengineered in a matter of weeks and months, and so I think it will take some time as we evolve to whatever model the manufacturers and the payers believe is appropriate going forward. Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for the thoughts. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Operator : We'll hear next from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking the question. So staying along those same lines, John, it's been about a year since you outlined the initial attempts and discussions to work with your manufacturer partners on the contract shifts on how you contract with them. Clearly, there's a lot going on as Glen had asked regarding the overall market. Can you talk about how those discussions have continued to go and maybe just give some hypothetical examples or some big picture examples of what some of the evolution has been in any of the contracts that may have changed structure or changed how they're contracted between the two sides just to give us a sense of as we think about the go-forward what we could expect to see with those changing negotiations? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thank you for the question, Michael. The manufacturers obviously all of them are in different places in terms of how they price their products, the level of innovation that they're delivering to their marketplace, the productivity of their R&D activities, et cetera. And so I think, I can't speak with any specifics with any of them related to our relationship. What I can say is sort of a reinforcement of what I said to Glen and that is that the relationship between McKesson and our manufacturer partners has never been stronger, and when we've had conversations with them about their strategies related to price inflation or their strategies related to their list price of their product, never in those conversations do they indicate a desire to reduce the economics to McKesson because they recognize the tremendous value of the services we provide. So albeit, it may be a time and a process change that goes on between us and our partners related to how we're reimbursed and how these mechanisms might evolve over time, nowhere has anyone said to me, gee, we need to change this model because we believe the economics that we're paying for the value you deliver isn't fair. In fact, it's quite the opposite. They talk about not wanting to do what we do and the fact that we provide great utility value both to our buying customers as well as the manufacturers that we're both trying to serve. So, I think that I'm very confident that we will continue to make progress and as individual decisions are made by individual manufacturers related to their pricing strategy, we'll sit down and have individual discussions with them to make sure that we're properly reimbursed for the value of the service we provide and clearly, we always are trying to expand that discussion to include more than just our distribution services and go beyond into some of the other services that I described. And I'm probably the only remaining CEO in the distribution channel that actually went through the process 15 years ago and helped lead the process of providing better visibility to the manufacturers around the value of we do, providing better stability around our reimbursement, and in those leadership discussions, I think set a standard for how McKesson would move forward and I believe that standard still exists today. Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Mike, maybe what I would add \u2013 this is Britt, I would add that over the last couple of years, the conversations have really become around focusing on the value for the services and expanding the services that we provide, whether that's special handling for certain new products that are being launched and as you've seen us over the last couple of years, you've seen less of a reliance on the variable component of compensation with manufacturers and really focusing on what are the services that we're providing and what is the value for those services and what additional services can we provide to those manufacturers, whether that's distribution services or those are other capabilities that we can help them with launching a product. So I think that's one of the ways that you've seen the conversations change over the last couple of years. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks Michael for the question and I want to also congratulate you by the way on the birth of your new daughter Reece (33:54). I was just told that recently, so congratulations on starting a new era. Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much, John. Operator : And at this time, we'll move to the next caller in the queue, Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. John, last night, CMS proposed that we move to a new competitive acquisition program for Part B drugs. The way that it reads, it comments that they're looking to use private vendors to negotiate Part B drugs replacing ASP. Can you talk about it from two sides? One, the role that you think McKesson could play as a private vendor and two, any impact that any new pricing could have on your existing business? I'm thinking specifically U.S. oncology? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thanks for the question, Lisa. As you point out, U.S. oncology is the part of our business that has the greatest exposure to Part B reimbursement, and we are probably one of the largest purchasers of specialty drugs primarily focused on oncology. And we certainly have experienced over time our ability to work closely with the manufacturers to make sure that we've got the right economics on sourcing those products and making sure that the patients are getting access to the best available treatment regimes, and we believe that role is extremely important. In addition, I think that folks in the administration that I've chatted with when we've discussed this particular issue understand clearly that the best value for them as payers for cancer care continues to be in the community setting, and their view of our quality is as good or better than anyone else in the provider network. So I don't think there's a desire in specifics to focus on community-based physicians in any category let alone community-based oncologists in an attempt to destroy the economics of practicing in that venue. What they are focused on is making sure that the economics are maintained perhaps in a different way than just or just primarily on the drug's reimbursement characteristics. So we've had an open dialogue for some time. Like I said, there may be a transition here in terms of how oncologists are paid for the services they provide. And clearly as a very large buyer of these Part B drugs, we think we're in a good position to be a private vendor who negotiates the purchase price of the Part B drugs because we have the pull through characteristics attaching great formularies that utilize those drugs and provide market share to the manufacturers as a result of them providing us with the right economics and that's a role that we already play today with our buying activity. So albeit this could be another transition point for our business that may take some time to straighten out, but I think at least from my experience, having the best value from an economic perspective and the best quality aligned creates a position for you to be able to negotiate a model that makes sense for both the payers as well as for us and I might end my comment on the relative scale or meaningfulness of this as it relates to McKesson's overall financial characteristics. Clearly this is important to our physician partners and their viability is a top priority for us, and the ability to continue to treat patients in that setting is a top priority; however the economics that actually flow through to McKesson's P&L as a result of our relationship with the U.S. Oncology doctors in particular is relatively insignificant. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Operator : We'll hear next from David Larsen from Leerink. David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Can you talk a little bit about the operating income growth rate in the Other division? It looks to me like it's actually down year-over-year. Is that correct, Britt maybe, and then how is Change Healthcare progressing? Thanks. Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for that question. As we pointed out during our Q4 earnings call, we did expect it to be impacted by the headwinds in our Canadian business. We outlined for you the changes in the generic reimbursement rate would have a gross headwind of $100 million to $125 million for the year, so that certainly is part of it. We are seeing really good growth in our MRxTS business as I mentioned in my remarks and then the third piece here is while we did see a decline year-over-year in Change Healthcare in the quarter, we still expect that Change Healthcare will meet the full year guide that we gave. We're seeing good operating performance. We're seeing good performance and progression against synergy targets. We're pleased with our performance, so I think the overriding impact here in the first quarter is really two-fold. One, the Canadian headwinds that I mentioned and then secondly, last year, we did have about $17 million of operating profit from EIS, which we have divested. David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then just any comments on generic deflation trends both on the buy and sell-side? How are those relative to your expectations and how did ClarusONE perform relative to expectations? Thanks. Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for that question. We haven't seen any change from what we guided at our Investor Day. On the sell-side we still see a competitive but relatively stable market so no change in our view on the sell-side component of that. ClarusONE continues to perform quite well ahead of very strong first quarter. We're very pleased with the progress there and the partnership and the opportunities that are in front of us. From a buy perspective, the dynamics on the buy side, as we've talked about we've seen more of a stable environment from a deflation perspective, so this is running in-line with what our expectations were, really no supply disruptions that are of any material either and ClarusONE continues to drive great value from a buy side, so we're continuing to focus on building out ClarusONE and additional opportunities and taking the ability that we have on ClarusONE to create a spread for us that we can deliver great value to our customers on the sell-side. David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Steven Valiquette from Barclays your line is open. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, John and Britt. So just on staying on the topic of brand inflation, we keep getting asked by investors how to triangulate the collective commentary from drug distributors overall, then brand inflation doesn't matter that much anymore because of the fee-for-service agreements, but then the industry still has this large spike in profits in the March quarter each year that obviously seems pretty closely tied to the January annual brand price inflation cycle. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that and maybe just the follow-up question tied to that would be, should we probably assume that McKesson is going to maintain a fairly wide EPS guidance range for most of fiscal 2019 because obviously your fiscal fourth quarter may be the most critical in relation to brand inflation. Thanks. Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for that question. I would point to a couple things. First of all, you are right. Historically we have seen the manufacturers take the majority of their price increases in our fiscal fourth quarter. There is an impact from seasonality. We have our highest volumes in the fourth quarter, so the impact we would see from those would be higher just given that seasonality, and I would also point out that while we are more fixed than we have been historically, there is still a variable component to our compensation. So I would expect that that trend would continue. It is more of a seasonality component than anything else. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. As far as the guidance range then for the year? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: I think as we've talked about previously, we're not adjusting our guidance at this point. We have seen lower price inflation as John mentioned in the July month. If we see some changes to that that are significant, then certainly we will update you on that but we would expect to still be in the guidance range that we provided. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Moving next to Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. So, obviously, pretty disappointing developments in the UK business. I guess that business obviously has been trending lower and we felt we were getting to kind of the bottom of margins and then obviously the UK has a lot going on economically right now. I guess how are you thinking about sort of the pushes and pulls there in France and some of the other countries where there's sort of uncertainty around your ability to kind of adjust the cost structure as these kind of sea changes occur and the ability to kind of balance that versus kind of the long-term you see in those markets? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thanks for the question, Ross. Clearly, we are disappointed with the continued actions that the UK government has been pursuing, primarily focused on the retail pharmacy business there to your point. At some point there's going to be diminishing returns for this to be a source of their budget gap solved, and our dialogue with them is continuing. We don't want to be in a position where we find that the government puts us in a place where the entire retail industry is at risk and clearly, the more cuts that come down the line, the more likely that is to be a possibility, and perhaps a reality. So we are working to be more efficient in that market. We talked about the changes we made in our back-office in the fourth quarter. We continue to take cost-out, and the store closures have helped and if they push more stores into a lack of profitability, we may have to continue with that strategy. As it relates to France, we're obviously a very large provider of services in France. We've got great customer relationships. We've got a great strategy there. It's one of the markets where we have really delivered an omni-channel capability with online, in-store pick up et cetera, experiences for our partners to take to their patients and I think our presence in the market is really second to none. We have recently in the last 18 months or so experienced more significant price activity by our competitors probably in response to our superior value proposition and we've been forced to react to that in certain parts of the French market, but as we have in the UK and other markets in Europe, we'll continue to expand the value proposition and at the same time try to become more efficient and in particular in France, we did develop a national re-distribution center, similar to what we have in the U.S. that is performing at exceptional levels and allowing us to take out cost and capital in that market and deliver superior service and our scale frankly allows us to compete in a much superior way to others in that marketplace. So we're not going to lose market share there. We're going to match the price that our competitors put into the marketplace and maintain the volumes through our business and we hope that the pricing environment will stabilize over time. The larger backdrop of Europe is we're continuing to expand our services in many different areas, and begin to evolve our model so that we can provide services outside of retail pharmacy into specialty and hospital and home care like we've done in the UK, so we're still focused on expanding that business. Thanks, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Thanks, John. And maybe just quickly, a lot of debate on biosimilars. Obviously the government is very focused on it. There's some new developments with new labs and a few others, I guess what's sort of your updated thoughts on how that market is kind of changing and the like and kind of your opportunity set there? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, we obviously are very encouraged as well not only in the government's focus on the biosim opportunities and getting these products into the marketplace but the manufacturer partners that have come to us in particular are looking for McKesson to help them build a channel into the marketplace, in particular in biosims focused on oncology. As you know, Ross we have a world-leading clinical trial capability inside of our U.S. oncology network that provides value to all oncologists across the country. We help get products to the market faster and more efficiently and we have done that over and over again as it relates to branded product being launched. We think the biosimilar market provides a similar opportunity because of some of the characteristics of these products and a requirement to prove clinical equivalency to the original products and our doctors are very keen on helping make that happen and making sure the patients get the best product at the most value and that helps produce market share for the biosim manufacturers and improved profitability for their practices and a lower-cost for the patient. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Excellent. Thanks, John. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Eric Percher from Nephron Research, please go ahead. Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC : Thank you. A question on U.S. Pharma and Specialty. Last year, when you spoke to brand pharma compensation and the fact there was a tailwind in the quarter, I think there was an evening out over the course of the year. So when we look at this quarter I understand it sounds like that was a bit of a benefit to Q1. How does that progress over the next couple quarters and any other commentary on the cadence within that segment? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for that question, Eric. My comments really relate to that timing event that happened last year between Q1 and Q2. Our compensation or the value that we've earned from brand compensation in the first quarter of this year is in-line with what our expectations are and we wouldn't expect that there'd be any variability as we saw last year between first quarter and second quarter. Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC : And last year, was that a headwind in Q1 that's been evened out over the course of the year, and I guess my question is should we expect that things get a little bit tougher in that comparison? And I'll add-on to that, the follow-on question which is among the other headwinds you expect this year, how many of those are reflected now in Q1 versus building over the course of the year? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: First of all, there was a headwind in Q1 of last year. It was really between the two quarters, so we wouldn't expect \u2013 and that was related to our continued evolvement of our agreements with manufacturers. As we think about the quarters this year, we wouldn't expect there to be any headwinds from types of evolvement of agreements like we had last year, so I think as you think about the first quarter of this year, we did have that timing event between Q1 and Q2 of last year. We also had customer losses that we talked about in our numbers in Q1 this year, but we still had some growth overall. Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Moving next to Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So just to clarify on Eric's question, Britt, when we think about the second half acceleration, in your prepared comment you said the second half acceleration is similar to last year. To give us some context, in 2018, what percent of second half acceleration can be attributed to the March quarter inflation? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Well, first of all, thanks for the question. I don't believe I used the word acceleration. I used the word relative contribution, and as we think about our second half, we would expect the same types of contribution in the second half would be the same this year as it was last year. What Eric asked about was a very specific event in Q1 of last year that was timing between Q1 and Q2, and that was related to our continued evolvement around our branded contracts become more fixed, so we would expect the dynamics of our quarters in the second half of the year to be very similar this year as they were last year. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: On a proportional basis. Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Relative contribution basis. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the second question, John. Many, many factors are suggesting moving the payment model to a fixed price system, which is not really benchmarked to a metric that's impacted by price. You operate in Europe where the model is a fixed fee based. So can you maybe kind of give us some color or some observation about what you see in Europe? Is it where you could potentially draw some similarities to how the markets here in the U.S. will evolve? Maybe what are the differences in terms of the economic value between the two regions? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: While I appreciate the question, Ricky, I think it has several nuances in it. In Europe, there's not really a single model or a single reimbursement mechanism. I would say though in certain markets, the reimbursement is more dictated by the government and can sometimes be different based on brand versus generic and who the payers are for generic and whether they've outsourced the payments for generics and contracted for generic to other parties et cetera, et cetera, including we talked about the Canadian environment where the price of generic is set by government but it's a percentage of the branded price for the non-generic. So there's all kinds of different ways people have set up pricing regimens. We believe \u2013 it was my interpretation of the administration is that they're looking for the market to set prices and the conversation that Lisa had a few minutes ago where she talked about the government looking for private vendors to negotiate the price of drugs is another indication of the fact that the government does not want to play a role, in my view at least, the government doesn't want to play a role in price setting. This idea that Part B drugs are set by the government and not through some type of a process is something that they appear to be wanting to change. So I think, frankly, there is not going to be a coming together of the way drug reimbursement happens in Europe and the way it's going to happen in the U.S. It's more likely that market forces will shape the way U.S. drug prices are set. There'll be more transparency to consumers who are increasingly paying more and more of a portion of their drug spend through their benefit plan designs that companies like ours and others have put in place for their employees. And so, I frankly am encouraged by that move and I believe it allows McKesson to continue to work with the manufacturers and to negotiate reimbursement based on the fair value of what we deliver every day for them and in my view it can't be disconnected from the dollar value of the product that we are putting through our channel. Unlike a \"shipper\" of a product that would charge a fee for a box at a certain weight, McKesson's financial model is much more dynamic and much more significant and much more dependent on our ability to buy inventory, use our balance sheet, provide tremendous service levels to our customers, collect receivables, adjudicate prices, thousands of prices every day through our chargeback systems on behalf of the manufacturers and to manage contracts with GPOs and to do all kinds of things that go far beyond what a logistics provider is prepared to do. And because of our use of our balance sheet and the use of our financial systems and our knowledge of this industry built over 185 years, I think it's highly unlikely that we would go to some type of a fixed fee or per-unit fee model for McKesson. It would have to reflect the use of our financial tools and our role in the entire supply chain for pharmaceuticals in a fashion that's very similar today. So what's more likely to happen is the rate that we receive on the price of the product, however that price gets set, would be reflective of the value in dollars that we need to receive to be properly reimbursed for those services. So that's the strategy that we think works best for us. It's a strategy we think reflects the value of what we deliver every day and it's a strategy that we think the manufacturers are already used to having with us and that we think can be replicated going forward albeit there may be some transition timeframes that we'll have to work our way through. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yes. Operator : We'll move next to Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. John, as I think about the UK business and the series of price cuts that you've seen, does McKesson have the ability to go back to the manufacturer \u2013 the drug manufacturers for price concessions to pass on some of the cuts? And then I know it's a different business but as we think about your relationship with the manufacturers here, I mean, how does that translate in terms of \u2013 I heard you talk about the value proposition, but if we can't pass price cuts in the UK, where is the confidence that we can pass on some of the price cuts or adjustments here in the U.S. in the future? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thank you for the question. Clearly, the way the UK manages drug pricing both and service pricing for that matter is vastly different than the way it's managed here in the U.S. and the government's activities both on the manufacturer price as well as the retail service price is not established based on what we can at least determine as a market view. It's more of a policy view, and we continue to work with the payers to make sure the payer there, to make sure they understand the value we believe is being derived by using Retail Pharmacy. It's difficult for us to go back to the manufacturers when their economics are preset also by the same regulatory body with perhaps a different regime. So I think we're stuck in a little different place in the UK related to what might be actionable with the manufacturers. Now, clearly, on the services front, we can do a series of different things as a wholesaler to make sure that we're properly paid for the service we provide in those markets. I think as a retailer though because the government is involved in the retail dispensing economics for drugs, it makes it more of a challenge. I don't believe that anything that I'm hearing from the discussions with the administration here in the U.S. or my counterparts in the industry, I'm not hearing any discussion of people wanting to follow a model similar to what's being done in the UK as an example. And as I mentioned earlier, I think it's much more likely to take a market-based approach. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : All right. Guys, thank you. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for the questions. John, I know there's been a lot asked on this call and a lot of focus on branded price increases but I just wanted to make sure if I try to summarize this, is this the right way to think about it? Is this the right message? So if there are in fact less branded price increases over time, as a wholesaler, as the pharmaceutical wholesaler, you need to just adjust the rate at which manufacturers pay you for the fair value that you bring, and ultimately you guys are confident that that will happen over time. Is that a fair summation of kind of the message around the potential change in branded increases? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I think it's a fair assessment of not only that dimension but also the question related to a massive reduction in the retail or list price of the product to a lesser price, whether that is defined as a gross-to-net discussion or a lower list price discussion, or a better value for cash payers, however that's discussed, I believe that we are going to be focused on recovering the economics related to our relationship with these individual manufacturers that allow us to continue to have the same dollar yield as we do today from the same transaction activity because the value we deliver frankly doesn't change based on their activity related to brand inflation or related to a gross-to-net-type of a discussion. So you're absolutely right. Your summary is accurate and we did a very similar transition frankly that was more difficult 15 years ago because the manufacturers at that point were not even really aware of how wholesalers are paid or how we made money and our activity in the channel and we improved our relationships with them significantly. We helped them improve their manufacturing cadence. We gave them better visibility to service levels and inventory levels and that activity really sets the stage for us to more rapidly move our model around to accomplish a net neutral economic impact to McKesson and that will be our objective. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: John, I think that makes a lot of sense. Just one quick follow-up if I could for Britt just around that same topic. As it relates to this year, not to get too tactical but obviously there's some changes going on with branded companies and their desire to take inflation. I know inflation is a factor in the guidance for this year. Is the type of changes you're seeing, is that captured, Britt, within the ranges that you guys have out there for this year? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the question. Our first quarter was roughly in-line in terms of the experience that we saw with the manufacturers. July obviously has been quite a bit lower than we had anticipated and lower than what we've seen in previous years. We do anticipate at this point at least that we'll see the same type of behavior or activity by the manufacturers in the fourth quarter. To the extent that that doesn't happen it will have some impact on our numbers, and we would expect to still be in the guidance for that. So I think what we've seen in July is indicative of something different than what we've seen in the past but as we look at the whole year, we still maintain our guidance that we provided for branded price increases. But to the extent that the fourth quarter, our fiscal fourth quarter is \u2013 we experienced less branded price inflation. We'll have an impact but we would expect it to still be in the guidance. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for that. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I want to thank everybody for your participation on the call this morning. Like always, the questions are sound, they're appropriate, and they're based on your knowledge and experience with our company and I appreciate your objective in trying to get even more information and insight. We are off to a good start in fiscal 2019 and I'm excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us. I certainly want to recognize the outstanding performance of all of our employees and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities to make better health possible. I'm now going to hand the call off to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig? Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. We will participate in the Morgan Stanley Global Conference in New York in September and we will release second quarter earnings results in late October. Thank you for your participation and have a good day. Operator : That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Ross Muken - Evercore ISI Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Operator : Good day, everyone. Welcome to the McKesson Q2 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir. Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; Brian Tyler, our recently-appointed President and Chief Operating Officer; and Britt Vitalone, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, with Brian making some introductory comments. And then Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 9 AM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release and forward-looking statement slide for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit and margin, free cash flow and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2019 results and the supplemental slide presentation for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. The supplemental presentation is useful in reviewing the fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 results discussed today. Thank you, and here's John Hammergren. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. For the second quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $53 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.60. And we are narrowing and raising the low end of our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings range to $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share from the previous $13.00 to $13.80 per diluted share. I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on our board of directors and leadership team. Our board of directors welcomed Dominic Caruso as a new Independent Director in September. As the former Chief Financial Officer of Johnson & Johnson, Dominic brings with him significant financial and healthcare experience, which further strengthens the diverse backgrounds and perspectives we have on our board. Also, I'd like to welcome Brian Tyler to this call, following his appointment as President and Chief Operating Officer reporting directly to me. Many of you are familiar with Brian, as he has regularly presented at previous Investor Day events in Boston and has led nearly all of our businesses during his 21-year tenure at McKesson. I'll now ask Brian to talk about his vision around leading our global operations. Brian? Brian S. Tyler - McKesson Corporation : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Well, I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. Clearly, there's a lot of work ongoing and work to be done. We have an impressive range of capabilities to build upon, combined with a great track record of execution. Having led corporate strategy and business development in many of our business units, I'm very energized about leading our operations as well as our strategic growth initiatives. We have faced and overcome many challenges during my time at McKesson. I continue to be encouraged by this company's resilience, its ability to navigate evolving market conditions and our strategic focus to improve long-term performance. Our enterprise-wide multi-year growth strategy, including priority areas that focus on manufacturer value proposition, specialty pharmaceuticals and the role of retail pharmacy, all supported by data analytics, are promising areas of innovation. And importantly, we already have strong foundational businesses from which to build upon. The anticipated growth in conjunction with streamlined and aligned operations is strategically and financially attractive. This focus positions us well for the changing landscape of healthcare. It allows us to leverage the strengths we've built in our world-class distribution platforms and services businesses, and we see substantial savings opportunities through the improved spend management, centralization of support functions and expanded outsourcing arrangements. Britt will discuss these operating model initiatives in more detail shortly. And with that, I'll turn the call back to you, John. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, Brian, and welcome to your new role. I'm delighted to have you in this important expanded responsibility. Before I dive into the details of the quarter, let me briefly touch upon the evolving landscape across healthcare, primarily around drug pricing and our relationship within the supply chain. When I think about potential new developments, I step back and look at how we've adapted to and driven change in the healthcare industry, how we've broadened our capabilities well beyond the core function of distributing pharmaceuticals, how our services drive affordability, access and quality, supporting the value we deliver and how I think about future drug price changes. To take a deeper dive into these areas, first, all of McKesson's brand pharmaceutical purchases are done in partnership with biotechnology and pharmaceutical, or as we refer to them, biopharma companies; unlike the industry standard practice before we had these distribution service agreements. Our relationships between wholesalers and their biopharma partners are now governed and driven by these agreements and have been for several years. The partnership with biopharma companies has led to increased transparency and a more stable and predictable supply chain with inventory levels that are appropriate to meet customer demands and service levels. We've continued to evolve our relationships, reducing the economic variability in our distribution agreements and reducing our reliance on pricing decisions made by biopharma companies to approximately 5% of our total branded compensation. As many of you know, we have been revising our terms when we renew agreements with our supplier and customer partners to encompass the broad array of services and capabilities we offer. We've implemented differentiated pricing across each category of product we provide services for; specialty, brand, generic, biosimilar and OTC classes of medicine. Our approach is designed to provide our suppliers and customers with transparency into the unique dynamics of each product category as opposed to a blended approach. For almost two decades, we have expanded our capabilities beyond distribution and related services to support our partners at nearly every step in the product lifecycle. Examples include RelayHealth Pharmacy and CoverMyMeds, both technology businesses that help reduce the price of drugs and improve patient adherence. And with our newly rebranded manufacturer solutions business now called McKesson Life Sciences, we are taking another step forward to become the partner of choice for life science industry, driving successful commercialization, launch, and in-market solutions to connect patients to life-changing therapies. While we acknowledge there is more work to do, the nature of what we do every day is aligned with the objectives of the administration, which includes affordability, leveraging our global scale to provide patients with low-cost generics, access, delivering one-third of all prescriptions in North America and quality, ensuring safe and efficient access to prescribe therapies every day. Finally, while there is much speculation around potentially dramatic reform changes, we believe there will be gradual major transitions should there be any changes to supply chain dynamics. In summary, we are confident in our ability to navigate changes to the existing healthcare supply chain because changes to our financial model are not new. As was the case with the changes to the supply chain in the past, we expect our biopharma partners to work with us in collaboration with our customers to ensure a seamless transition to avoid disruption to patients. And we are proactively engaged in ongoing dialogue with our customers and biopharma partners in assessing the existing financial models. We also continue to have broader policy discussions with the administration, policy makers and various trade associations that are important to our business. Turning now to our business results, our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment had year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2%. I'd like to discuss a few highlights in this business. We're pleased with the performance of our McKesson Life Sciences business, as all top 20 biopharma companies utilize a majority of our best-in-class services, and we continue to expand those relationships, providing evidence that our offerings are resonating. The Department of Veterans Affairs exercised their option to extend our agreement for another two years, as expected in our guide. And ClarusONE continues to leverage our scale and our unique in-house sourcing capabilities. Turning now to McKesson Europe; on our last earnings call we mentioned increased competition in France, and that recently announced reimbursement cuts in the UK were in excess of historical levels, and greater than we had planned for on our fiscal 2019 guide. Facing the challenging market in the UK due to reimbursement cuts and declining prescription volumes, we took action last year to rationalize our store footprint and streamline our back-office operations. As these trends evolved in the UK, we continue to evaluate our footprint and cost structure and our UK colleagues remained committed to stabilizing the business and repositioning it for long-term profitability, all led by a newly-appointed president with more than a decade of industry experience. We see our global retail presence as a way to stem the tide of growing healthcare costs as we anticipate more services migrating from higher-cost locations into the lower-cost pharmacy setting, and we believe that pharmacist plays an important role in providing a range of healthcare services. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business; the underlying business continues to deliver consistent results benefiting from the shift of care to lower-cost sites. And of course, our recent MSD acquisition, which will contribute more meaningfully to earnings as we move from the integration phase to realizing anticipated synergies over time. As evidence of further enhancing our value proposition, we recently announced a technology solution that complements our existing connectivity capabilities, provides us with access to a broader customer base, and allows patients to get more control over their care and additional support with products delivered to their home. Allows home health and hospice providers to save time and money, and spend more time delivering patient care, and it allows payers to receive improved accuracy in billing, to facilitate more timely reimbursement. While many have alluded to the threat of new entrance, McKesson has been actively investing in our Medical-Surgical business to better serve patients and ensure we remain the trusted partner in the alternate site markets. In particular, we've made increased investments in home healthcare, adding to our home delivery capabilities, which is driving top-line growth. While this investment is dilutive to our margin rate today, over time these investments will drive increased adjusted operating profit growth as we optimize operations and further leverage our scale. And we are pleased with the response we're seeing from our efforts to improve patient care in the home. Finally, McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions and our equity investment in Change Healthcare all included in other. We saw upside in the quarter driven by a reversal of a contractual liability, partially offset by previously-discussed generic price actions in Canada and the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business in October last year. During the quarter, McKesson Canada made great progress on mitigating the impact of the generic pricing cuts that went into effect April 1. And together with strong organic growth in our Canadian and McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions businesses, we were able to offset a lower-adjusted equity contribution from Change Healthcare. Britt will go into more detail on the performance of these businesses. Based on the McKesson fiscal second quarter results, we are narrowing and raising the low end of our adjusted earnings range to $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share for our full-year fiscal 2019 outlook. Despite anticipated challenges coming into the year, we expect a stronger second half of fiscal 2019. And as I look beyond fiscal 2019, the actions we are taking in our UK businesses are focused on addressing the disappointing reimbursement dynamics we are facing with new leadership to drive improved performance. As we focus on putting patient care first, we're investing in our businesses like homecare delivery. Similarly, McKesson Life Sciences enables biopharma companies to connect their innovative therapies to the patients that need them. And what ties these examples together is our focus on the patient, under our multi-year strategic growth initiative, with the goal of improving care delivery and driving long-term performance. Before I hand the call over to Britt, let me touch upon the recent weather events that impacted the Southeastern United States. McKesson was fortunate to have avoided significant impacts to our associates, our operations, and our facilities from the devastation resulting from the recent storms and flooding. We are proud to have played a role in the emergency efforts, providing pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to the affected areas, despite very challenging conditions. Our employees and the McKesson Foundation have been extremely generous with their support for displaced residents and coworkers. We continue to aid in the recovery of our affected customers, communities and employees. With that, I'll turn the call over to Britt and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. Let's jump right into our second quarter results, and please note that unless stated otherwise, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter press release are being reiterated today. As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2019 second quarter results were ahead of our expectations. Turning to slide six of the presentation, second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.60 was principally driven by a lower tax rate, including a discrete tax benefit, a reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and a lower share count. These benefits were partially offset by incremental challenges in our UK and French businesses, previously announced customer losses, and increased litigation expenses related to opioids. Our second quarter adjusted earnings results excludes the following GAAP-only items; amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $0.75 per diluted share, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $0.27 per diluted share, LIFO inventory-related credits of $0.08 per diluted share, restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.34 per diluted share, and other adjustment net credits of $0.19 per diluted share. Before I continue with the review of our second quarter results, let me take a moment to discuss the increased opioid-related expenses, including anticipated costs for the remainder of fiscal 2019. Earlier this year, the State of New York adopted the Opioid Stewardship Act, which required the creation of an aggregate $100 million annual surcharge that's attributed amongst all manufacturers and distributors licensed to sell or distribute opioids in New York. The first annual surcharge is assessed for calendar year 2018, payable in January of 2019, and measured based on opioids sold or distributed in calendar year 2017. The New York Department of Health notified manufacturers and distributors of this new law in mid-May. Given the timing of this new law, we did not include an assumption for the potential impact in our fiscal 2019 plan. While this newly-adopted law is currently being challenged in court, we have recorded an accrual to account for McKesson's estimated portion of the calendar year-to-date assessment, should we be required to pay the stewardship assessment in January of 2019. This accrual is reflected in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. It's recorded in both our GAAP and adjusted operating results. In addition, McKesson's a defendant, often named with pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacy chains and other wholesalers, in numerous cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances to pharmacies. McKesson's recorded expenses associated with these cases, which have far exceeded our initial expectations and are significantly higher than the charges incurred in fiscal 2018. These expenses are reflected within our Corporate segment and are recorded in both our GAAP and adjusted operating results. Total adjusted operating expenses from both the New York legislation and costs to support ongoing litigation were approximately $34 million in the second quarter and $61 million year-to-date. For fiscal 2019, we now anticipate these opioid-related costs will exceed $100 million. We'll continue to provide updates on these items as more information becomes available. Now let's turn to the details of our consolidated second quarter adjusted earnings, which can be found on slide 9. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 2% versus the prior period on a reported and constant-currency basis, primarily driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously-disclosed customer losses in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Second quarter adjusted gross profit was down 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by customer losses and our sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business or EIS in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by market growth and acquisitions. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses were flat year-over-year, primarily driven by acquisitions, offset by a reversal of a contractual liability and the divestiture of our EIS business. During the quarter, McKesson negotiated a reversal to a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare. As a result, McKesson realized a pre-tax benefit of $90 million in both our GAAP and adjusted operating expenses within our consolidated P&L. Adjusted income from operations was $983 million for the quarter, a decrease of 6% from the prior year. We now expect adjusted income from operations to decline in the low-to-mid single digits year-over-year, versus our original expectation of flat-to-mid single digit growth. Interest expense of $66 million in the quarter decreased 4% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates, partially offset by short-term borrowings. Our adjusted tax rate was16.2% for the quarter, primarily driven by a discrete tax benefit of approximately $42 million and our mix of business. We now assume an adjusted tax rate of approximately 17% to 19% for the full year, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Additionally, income to attributable to non-controlling interests was $54 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $714 million, with second quarter adjusted earnings at $3.60 per diluted share, which is up 10% compared to $3.28 in the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, our second quarter diluted weighted average shares were 199 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. During the quarter, we completed $580 million of share repurchases, and we now expect diluted weighted average shares of approximately 197 million for the year. Next, I'll review our segment results, which can be found on slides 11 through 15. As a reminder, effective in fiscal 2019, McKesson revised its segment reporting structure. We report results in three main segments; U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, European Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions. All other businesses, which primarily include McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, and our equity investment in Change Healthcare are included in Other. As a reminder, in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018, contribution from EIS is included in Other. EIS contributed approximately $120 million in revenues and $17 million in adjusted operating profit in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $240 million in revenues and $34 million in adjusted operating profit in the first half of fiscal 2018. Let me start now with the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $41.6 billion for the quarter, up 2% driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously-disclosed customer losses and branded-to-generic conversions. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was down 5% to $635 million, driven by customer losses and lower branded pharmaceutical compensation than the prior year, partially offset by strong growth across our specialty businesses, including acquisitions. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 153 basis points, a decrease of 12 basis points, driven by a growing mix of specialty pharmaceuticals. We continue to benefit from the dollar contribution of these products, although they're dilutive to the margin rate. Specific to brand compensation, we have lowered our assumption for branded pharmaceutical price increases in the U.S. to mid-single digit percentage from our prior assumption of mid-to-high single digit percentage. I would remind you that our branded pharmaceutical contracts are primarily fixed in nature versus variable, with the fixed component representing approximately 95% of the compensation we receive. I would also reiterate my previous comments at a healthcare conference in September. If in the second half of fiscal 2019, manufacturers do not take any price increases, the impact to our adjusted operating profit would be a range of approximately $75 million to $90 million, or approximately 2% to 3% of our adjusted EPS. We'll provide an update on the brand pricing environment when we report our third quarter earnings in late January. And as a result of our expectation for increased stewardship expenses in New York related to opioids that I discussed earlier and our updated expectations for brand pricing, we now expect to be at the low end of original fiscal 2019 guidance assumption of flat-to-down mid-single digit adjusted operating profit for the segment. Next moving on to European Pharmaceutical Solutions; revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter, down 2%, negatively impacted by $68 million from currency rate movements. On a constant-currency basis, revenues were down 1%, driven by the previously-disclosed reduction in owned retail pharmacies following the closure or divestiture of approximately 200 stores and challenging operating environments in the UK and France. These items were partially offset by strong performance in the other countries that we operate in. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 40% to $53 million. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted operating profit was down 39% to $54 million driven primarily by the impact of the previously-announced additional reimbursement cuts and market conditions in our UK business, and increased competition in the French wholesale market. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 81 basis points on a constant-currency basis, a decrease of 50 basis points. As a result of the weak second quarter segment performance as well as our updated view that mitigation efforts will not materialize as quickly as originally planned, we now expect segment adjusted operating profit to decline year-over-year with a more similar contribution in the second half of the year relative to the first half. While we continue to experience challenges in this segment, we're encouraged by the performance we're seeing in most all the other countries that we operate in; however that contribution is not material enough to offset the challenges in the UK and France. Moving now into Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 17%, driven by the MSD acquisition and market growth. Excluding the MSD acquisition, segment revenue was up 6%. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was up 1% to $138 million, driven primarily by market growth, partially offset by $8 million of higher bad debt expense in the quarter. Segment adjusted operating margin rate was 708 basis points, a decrease of 111 basis points, reflecting our mix of business, including the growth in lower-margin products such as Rx, previously-discussed bad debt in the quarter, and our continued investment in the homecare delivery business, as well as the lower relative margin contribution from MSD. We are very pleased with the progress in integration activities of the newly-acquired MSD business. As we move through the integration phase and to executing on the synergies, MSD, like most acquisitions, will begin to deliver operating profit accretion. This is consistent with our previously-discuss assumption that the MSD acquisition will be modestly accretive for adjusted earnings in fiscal 2019. Finishing our business review with Other; revenues were $2.9 billion for the quarter, down 5%. Revenues were negatively impacted by $113 million from currency rate movements. On a constant-currency basis, revenues were down 1%, driven primarily by the sale of the EIS business, partially offset by market growth across the businesses in the segment and acquisitions. Other adjusted operating profit was up 24% to $300 million. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted operating profit was $310 million, driven by the previously-mentioned reversal through a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and growth in our Prescription Technology Solutions business, or MRxTS, partially offset by the impact of previously-disclosed government initiatives on our Canadian business, the lower equity contribution from Change Healthcare, and the sale of the EIS business. In Canada, our Rexall business faced some challenges in the quarter. Actions taken earlier in the year are not materializing as fast as we anticipated, resulting in a lower performance than expected. We remain confident and committed to this business and will continue to focus on addressing these challenges with an eye on long-term sustainability. Additionally, we previously identified the impact of government actions in minimum wage increases as a gross pre-tax fiscal 2019 headwind of between $100 million and $120 million and discussed our efforts to mitigate that impact. I'm pleased with the work of our Canadian team, who have identified and begun implementing action plans that we anticipate will offset more than half of the $100 million to $120 million gross headwind, the benefits of which are expected to be captured primarily in the second half of the year. Posing our segment review with Change Healthcare, adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $56 million for the quarter. We're pleased with the operational performance of Change Healthcare. Adjusted EBITDA performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter. This solid operational performance was offset by increased investments in growth areas, higher tax expense, and higher interest expense. Due to the second quarter results and our expectation that these below-the-line dynamics will continue, we now expect the adjusted equity contribution from Change Healthcare to decline year-over-year relative to our original guide of low-to mid-single digit growth, and we expect a more similar contribution in the second half of the year relative to the first half. We now expect other adjusted operating profit to increase year-over-year, driven by the benefit from a reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and higher-than-anticipated growth in our MRxTS business, partially offset by the lower equity contribution from Change Healthcare. Next, McKesson recorded $143 million in adjusted corporate expenses, an increase of 55% in constant currency year-over-year, primarily driven by opioid-related expenses and planned technology investments. As a result of the outlook for opioid-related expenses that I discussed earlier, we now expect adjusted corporate expenses will increase year-over-year. I'll now review our working capital metrics and cash flows, which can be found on slide 16. For receivables, days sales outstanding decreased one day to 26 days. Days sales in inventory decreased one day to 30 days, and days payables outstanding decreased two days from the prior year to 59 days. I'd remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.1 billion. For the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson paid $840 million for acquisitions, repurchased $877 million in common stock, and paid $139 million in dividends. McKesson generated $318 million in cash flow from operations. After deducting the $248 million in internal capital investments, McKesson had free cash flow of $70 million, which was modestly ahead of our expectations. In fiscal 2019, we continue to expect internal capital investments of between $600 million and $800 million and free cash flow of approximately $3 billion. We also have a total of $4.2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And finally, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly dividend of $0.39 yesterday, which will be payable to shareholders in January. In terms of fiscal 2019 earnings progression, we expect that the fourth quarter will be our largest in terms of EPS contribution, which is similar to prior years. For fiscal 2019, we anticipate that our higher-than-expected second quarter adjusted earnings per share results and lower full-year adjusted tax rate will be partially offset by ongoing litigation and stewardship costs related to opioids and the lower profit contribution from our European business. As a result, we're narrowing and raising the low end of our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings outlook. We now anticipate adjusted EPS of $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share in fiscal 2019. Let me take a minute to update you on the optimization of our operating model and cost structure. We're focused on the alignment of our operating structure to support the growth initiatives that we have previously outlined. Additionally, we continue to focus on controlling our operating expenses, which will provide the flexibility to make investments into the business and drive operating leverage. Throughout the second quarter, we made progress furthering the priority to evolve our operating structure with particular emphasis in the areas of finance, technology, human resources and on indirect spend. We've made progress in several areas, but I'd like to highlight three. First, we are evolving our operating structure and related spend management. As a result, we've launched more disciplined and rigorous internal spend guidelines across the enterprise to support sustainable spend reductions. Second, we're transitioning several business unit functional and back-office services to a more centralized hub model, leveraging outsourcing and technology. This results in a realignment of functions to report in a more centralized manner, improving service delivery and increasing focus on our operations and on customers and patients. And third, we are accelerating technology adoption, including increasing the use of robotics processing automation, AI and data and analytics to deliver more efficient and accurate service and output. These efforts will generate meaningful savings for the organization, driving increased productivity and efficiency, allowing our teams to focus on higher-value activities for the company and for our customers. These are just a sample of the initiatives that are underway as McKesson transforms its operating model to drive cost savings. And we have line-of-sight to many more initiatives that will drive additional savings. McKesson expects that these initiatives will drive approximately $300 million to $400 million in annual pre-tax savings that will be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2021. I'm extremely pleased with the progress we're making and the change that we're driving at McKesson. And most importantly, I'm energized by the commitment and engagement of our McKesson employees across the globe that are driving this effort. In closing, we're narrowing and raising our fiscal 2019 outlook of adjusted earnings to $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share. We are making solid progress against our multi-year strategic growth initiative. While we faced incremental challenges in fiscal 2019, particularly in our European business, we anticipate that the second half of the year will ramp due to seasonality, organic growth, the realization of synergies from acquisitions and the benefits from mitigation efforts. Our leadership position and ability to execute combined with increased focus on reducing costs across the organization and investing in our priority growth areas, give me confidence in McKesson's future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I'd ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Caller, your line is open. Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning and thank you for all the color so far. I want to tie a little bit into the broader picture of drug pricing. Britt, you reiterated your view on what happens at the beginning of the year, or at least for your guidance, if there's no increases in the typical January 1 timeframe. As you think about what that could imply for the changing dynamics of the market as a whole, especially with news this morning about apparent changes to Part B coming, how do you think about positioning yourself and contracting with manufacturers, contracting with customers in a world where there continues to be a moving target on what that reference rate and what that pricing dynamic could be over time? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Well, Mike, thanks for that question. I think I would reiterate that, again, we have changed our assumption on branded price inflation to the mid-single digits. And I would reiterate my comments, if pricing inflation does go away then we expect that, that range could be $75 million to $90 million. I would also remind you that we have talked about over time, how we've continued to evolve our relationships and our agreements with manufacturers, as well as evolving our relationships and agreements with customers. And we believe that it's important for us to put the economics on each individual product that we service to our customers so that it reflects the services that we provide on those products for manufacturers to our customers. And so we continue to have strong dialogue with both manufacturers and customers. We continue to work with them and partner with them and try to understand the evolving dynamics. And we'll continue to evolve our relationships and our agreements such that we're being paid a fair value for the services that we perform on each of the product categories that we provide to our customers and for our manufacturers. Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks a lot. I'll let others ask questions. Operator : Next we'll go to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Good morning. John and Brian \u2013 John, I appreciated your comments at the beginning, but I want to really try to understand how to think about McKesson going forward. So, we talk about drug pricing, we talk about changes that are happening in D.C. I heard you talk about your Life Science business and maybe make incremental acquisitions there. As you think about the different businesses that you have today, for example, international that hasn't worked quite the way you anticipated when you bought Celesio, how do we think about McKesson over the next few years? Does it make sense to continue to invest in that business outside the U.S.? Are there larger incremental acquisition opportunities you see within Life Sciences? And then, as we think about, for example, your oncology business and this changing dynamic around pricing, are there other acquisitions that you need to make? Are there business model changes that need to be made? I know this is a big question, but I think if we just think about how McKesson is going to be positioned over the next few years, I think it'd be really helpful to hear your thoughts. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thanks, Lisa, for the question there. And clearly that was a big question covering lots of different subjects. I think that if you look at McKesson historically, we've done I think a really good job of managing our portfolio of businesses. So first, as you pointed out, we're not afraid to buy and sell businesses and to react where we see the market opportunities emerging. Clearly, Brian was a big part of that in his previous role in corporate strategy and business development and will play a very important role in his new capacity. We think we are in the right businesses at the right time. You mentioned a couple of times our McKesson Life Sciences business and our continued increased exposure to the biopharma industry and these new product launches that are coming out. We believe there's not only an opportunity for us to make money in our core distribution businesses related to this innovation, but perhaps as important, or maybe more important, a lot of these biopharma companies are beginning to turn to McKesson and our Life Sciences business to provide them with incremental support that helps them get the product to market, improve the adherence and compliance to these products, help the patient get access to both the drug as well as expert advice and support, and also get the right payment structure set up so these patients can qualify with their payers and health plans to be covered for the use of these medications. So, we feel really good about where we are and we think we're positioned properly. When you think about changes to the pricing dynamic, I think Britt did a nice job of outlining for you how much risk McKesson might have related to price inflation. We've tried to bound that risk for investors so you have a sense for how meaningful or how little meaning it has to us at this point in our evolution. Years ago, we began to move our model away from a dependence on price inflation on the brand side to create value, and we think our new relationships continue to evolve nicely in that area. Clearly, there have been people talking about this whole idea of a list price reduction. We believe what we received from manufacturers represents a fair payment for the value that we deliver on an ongoing basis. So we believe very strongly we will continue to have a revenue-based relationship with biopharma, and that that relationship may be modified over time as necessary if we find that the prices change in a significant way. And then you mentioned our oncology exposure. We're really pleased with the growth we're seeing in our oncology business particularly, which is part of part of our Specialty Solutions business. And not only is the U.S. oncology business growing rapidly with a significant increase in the number of physicians and practices that are involved in U.S. oncology, but we're finding that the market in general finds our value proposition compelling and that solutions we bring are very differentiated in the market, and we are gaining significant momentum in oncology particularly. When you think about pricing risk in that market, clearly various reimbursement strategies have been used over decades in community oncology, and our community oncologists have very resiliently moved their business practice and model to reflect the value and the service they deliver to their patients. We don't believe the administration or anyone that's a payer for healthcare would like to see oncology services move away from the community setting. First of all, it won't be as convenient and as accessible for the patients in America. We don't think it'll improve quality, and it clearly will increase costs if these patients and physicians migrate to a more acute setting. So, albeit there may be changes in the way payment structures move, but we've had significant success even recently with the Oncology Care Model experiment that took place with Medicare to help us prove that we can deliver in a value-based way a more all-encompassing treatment process in a way that delivered the quality that was reflected and required in the Oncology Care Model. So it wasn't necessarily drug dependent. So, I think if we see some changes in the way that it's done, it's not clear that it'll affect oncology particularly. If it does, we think our practices and our partnerships are prepared to make that transition and work with the payers to be paid for the service. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Thank you for all the comments. I appreciate it. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, welcome, Lisa. Operator : And next we'll go to Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC : Thank you. Thanks for all the detail on how your expectations have changed during the course of the first two quarters. Maybe one specific question, which is, as you laid out guidance for the year, did you expect that you might see the change benefit occur in fiscal year 2019? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Eric, thanks for that question. As we laid out, this was in connection with our original Change Healthcare transaction. It was not part of our original guidance. It was a negotiated agreement that happened during the second quarter. So we did not have that visibility as we laid out our original guidance, and it was not included in it. Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC : Okay. And, Britt, could you rank order the items that have created headwinds as you entered the year? I want to make sure we have some sense of the magnitude for these moving items. Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, thanks, Eric. I think, as we've called out here, certainly Europe has been a challenge for us. And I think we've laid out for you some of the dynamics that have created that challenge. We did lay out for you in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment that, before the year, we did have some customer losses, and those customer losses were anticipated. They were part of our guide. And from a year-over-year basis, they have created a headwind for us. Beyond that, we also laid out for you at the beginning of the year the Canadian reimbursement or Canadian generics price decline. We laid out for you what the gross headwind was there. We've made tremendous progress in mitigating that. And as I laid out, we believe we've mitigated over half of that and should start to see some of the benefits in the second half of the year. But we obviously have felt the impact on that the first half of the year. And then we've continued to make investments in our business, and I talked about some of the planned technology investments that are running through our Corporate segment. We believe that these are going to help us optimize our cost structure and our model going forward. And while there are headwinds this year from a cost perspective, these are the investments that are going to really give us the type of flexibility that we need as we go forward. And then the last thing that I would point out is I gave more description on it certainly this quarter are the costs related to opioids and the opioid-related expenses. And as I pointed out, we have experienced a significant amount of costs in our first half of the year and I also tried to provide you and what our estimate is going to be for the full year on these opioid-related expenses. So I don't know if that's a perfect rank order for you, but I wanted to really summarize for you the headwinds and how we've made progress against some of these headwinds, particularly in Canada. Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. As I think about the performance during the quarter, U.S. pharma still beat despite brand pricing coming in below expectations. So is that just generics driving that? And then, what are your expectations on generics going forward? And what are you seeing there in terms of pricing trend and contribution to the P&L? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks Brian for the question. I'll ask Britt to talk specifically about pricing trends as we see it both on, sort of, the buy side of generics as well as what we're seeing on the sell side. But speaking at a higher level related to our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, I would say that we are beginning to see a very nice stabilization of that business. We talked about customer churn coming into the year. We believe strongly in our value proposition, and we continue to create great relationships with our customers, and I think we see that business reaching a point of recovery with the potential outlying risks still associated with what happens from a pricing model perspective related to governmental changes or big pharma, biopharma policy changes. But maybe he could talk specifically about generics. Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Sure, and what I would add to that, certainly we're seeing that stabilization in our U.S. Pharma business. We're also seeing really strong growth in our Specialty Solutions business, and John talked about that at the beginning of the call. So that's also embedded in there. In terms of how we think about pricing on the generic side, we've talked about this now for the last couple of quarters. On the sell side, we continue to see a very competitive yet stable environment. And on the buy side, we have seen that the rate of deflation has stabilized over the last several quarters. And in some product categories, we are seeing certain molecules and product categories firming up from a price perspective on the buy side. So the environment overall is in a more stable state than it has been in the last \u2013 or that has been 18 months ago. And we're certainly in a great position with our ClarusONE sourcing operation to continue to create great buying opportunities that we can provide good cost savings for our customers, as well as to really create that spread between the buy side and the sell side. So we're very confident in our ability to continue to source well through ClarusONE with a more stabilized environment, it really sets us up quite nicely. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the questions. Hey, Britt, just to follow up on the back-half guidance specifically on the U.S. business, you're now expecting it to be down towards the bottom end of the range, down mid-single digits. It seems like obviously the declines in the back half would be worse obviously than the front half in order to get to that bottom of the range, and you did share some of the moving pieces and expectations. But could you maybe just break out for us again, of the expected decline in the back half, how much of it is from the anticipated opioid expense versus some of your changes and assumptions around things like branded pricing? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Within the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty segment, we do have certain costs related to the New York State Stewardship. So that will be in a part of our second half. And as we think about branded price inflation, we did give you an updated assumption around our guidance. So at the beginning of the year, we gave you mid-to high-single digit assumption for branded price inflation. We've now updated that to give more of a mid-single digit price inflation assumption. So those would be the two pieces that I would call out that have helped us to clarify for you our guidance assumption around closer to the lower end of our original range for U.S. Pharma. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's super helpful. And then, Britt, just one follow-up on the free cash flow. I think it's about, what, $70 million through the first two quarters? You're still sticking with the $3 billion for the year. Can you maybe just help us understand what bridges that gap? What are some of the timing issues at play as far as cash flow for the back half? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Sure. As I mentioned, you're right. It's $70 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year. Typically, we do see, because of seasonality, also because of just the timing of how certain customer payments happen during the year, that our fourth quarter is our strongest cash flow performance. And we expect that to continue again this year. So our first half of the year, as I mentioned, is slightly ahead of our own internal expectation, and we would continue to expect to generate $3 billion with a stronger second half performance, which is typical to prior years. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, John and Britt. So just in relation to the UK pharmacy operations, the other publicly-traded company with large retail pharmacy operations in the UK seemed to be performing maybe a little bit better relative to your operations. I know there are some differences in revenue and profit mix between pharmacy versus front end when comparing these operations, but the two quick questions I have tied to this is, one, is there any strategic consideration on your part to perhaps diminish your exposure to pharmacy and focus more on front end in the UK? And then just quickly, number two on this, you mentioned in the press release you continue to have conversations with the UK government to discuss the value-added pharmacies, low-cost setting of care, et cetera. It's unclear just from the outside whether or not these types of lobby efforts have really helped to improve any reimbursements. I was just curious to just, generally, have there been any historical examples you can recall where some overly aggressive UK reimbursement cuts were perhaps reversed and there was some relief for pharmacy providers? Thanks. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think those are very important questions, and it's terrific to have Brian on the call given that his most recent responsibility was to run our European operations. And he, in particular, spent a lot of time in the UK both in terms of the operations of the UK, but also the political environment of the regulators. So Brian, why don't you take that question for us? Brian S. Tyler - McKesson Corporation : Sure. Thanks, John. Thanks for the question. So I'd start with the first question of mix, and clearly the model of some of our competitors is quite different than the model we have in the UK. They tend to be much more front shop, health and beauty focused, might comprise as much as 60% to 65% of their overall mix where historically we've been a very healthcare, pharmacy-focused organization with roughly 85% to 90% of our mix from the Pharmaceutical segment itself. As we think about the front shop of that business, we continue to think about how we migrate to an overall healthcare value proposition, which puts retail pharmacy more in the front and center of the provision of care in the community. That could impact the mix of types of products we put in the front shop, and we're actively working through our merchandising strategies in that regard. The second thing you asked about, I believe, was just NHS policy overall, and we continue to be in very active dialogue with the regulators in the UK to champion our view. And we believe it's a view they actually share, that community pharmacy plays an important role in the overall population health of the communities that they serve. And so we continue to evolve our model in that direction. Clearly, the reimbursement landscape has been a challenging one for us, not just in the magnitude of the cuts we absorb, but in the difficulty of predicting when and how those cuts have hit us. I would say we are encouraged by the dialogue we're having, and you would see earlier this week, in fact NHS announced that they are going to keep the reimbursement rates for pharmacy flat for the coming year, where the original intent had been to impose some more decline. So, we view that as certainly incrementally positive news for us. I guess I'd just leave you with the thought that the team there is actively engaged on the policy arena, we're actively engaged with manufacturer partners as we reposition this business. And we continue to believe that it will play an important part in provision of health care in the UK. Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, thanks, Brian. Next question, please. Operator : Next we'll go to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning, guys. Given sort of where the stock is trading today, both on a sort of EBIT, EBITDA or P/E basis and where the free cash flow yield is, I guess, how are you thinking about kind of internal versus external investments? And I guess that \u2013 I know you've always been balanced in how you've done it, but obviously this is really unique time in terms of valuation for your business. And then secondarily, on the M&A side, you had done some things on the technology front. You've moved into a couple of higher growth areas also in Med-Surg, as you talked about at Life Sciences. How would you, kind of, characterize the pipeline for some of those growthier assets and whether you think you're getting paid for some of those businesses you're moving into, kind of getting back to the original question, and the multiple that the market's implying for you overall? Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Ross, thanks for that question. I'll start and then John can certainly add to this. From a capital deployment perspective, I would just reiterate my comments that we did repurchase shares in the second quarter, $580 million. We believe that a balanced approach still is appropriate for us. You've seen us balance our capital deployment during the year. We've made investments such as MSD. We've also returned capital. So we've really been very balanced this year in terms of cash. We like businesses like MSD because they provide good growth opportunities for us. They're in businesses that we know and have operated for a long period of time. They also fit into our strategic growth initiatives, so where there's opportunities such as MSD, we're certainly going to take advantage of looking at those and evaluating those. We also believe, though, that our shares are attractively priced. And we talked about the share authorization that is still outstanding. Our management and board both feel that the shares are attractively priced, and we've continued to execute share repurchases as a result of that. And John, if you want to add to the M&A pipeline? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, clearly, we are in the market. We're always active in the market evaluating transactions, and I think we make long-term bets on where we think the growth is going to be. To your point, some of the \u2013 in fact all of the recent acquisitions are performing very well for us and are producing returns that are significantly above our long-term cost to capital. We look at cash flow generation out of these businesses, and that's an important characteristic. And we can see our path to growing that cash flow. So, we're going to continue to use that combination. We're going to be disciplined. Clearly, the value of our own stock at these rates is, on a relative basis, improving in its attractiveness to us. And we're not blind to that, and we'll continue to be disciplined. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Thank you. I'll look forward to that. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: You're welcome. Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: I think we have time for one more, operator. Alan? Operator : Yes, sir. We'll take our last question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good morning and thank you for all the details. John, both Gilead and Amgen announced their lower WAC for some existing product. Can you share with us your views on what are you seeing the implications are for the industry, and if you had conversations with the manufacturers on what that means to your existing contracts? John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, we have constant conversations with manufacturers, Ricky, as you know, and as we've said earlier on the call and on other calls, we are very focused on making sure we get a fair return for the value that we deliver to these manufacturers. We can't control what they do from a pricing perspective, but we certainly have a significant relationship that delivers tremendous value to the manufacturers and gives them access to our customers, most of which buy only from us, in a way that is really important. We continue to evaluate the economics of these changes from a price perspective, and we plan to maintain the economics that we've realized in the past on these products, certainly regardless of where the price point gets set. So that's our position, and we believe the manufacturers respect that and will continue to provide us with the right payment for the service that we continue to provide. John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I want to thank everybody on the call today for your time. McKesson continues to execute against our fiscal 2019 plan, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities to make better health possible, and especially their commitment to helping their communities and each other during times of need. I'll now hand the call over to Craig for his review on upcoming events for the financial community. Craig? Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On Tuesday, November 13, we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. On Tuesday, November 27, we will present at the Evercore ISI HealthCONx, the conference in Boston. And in early January 2019, we will present at the J.P. Morgan HealthCare Conference in San Francisco. We will release third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you and goodbye. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

And at this time, I'll turn the floor over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir. Craig Mercer : Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2019 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; Brian Tyler, McKesson's President and Chief Operating Officer and incoming CEO; and Britt Vitalone, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will provide opening remarks. Brian will provide a business update. And Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 3 :00 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the next - please refer to the text of our press release and forward-looking statements slide for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, we will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit and margin and free cash flow and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2019 results and the supplemental slide presentation for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. The supplemental presentation is useful in reviewing the fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 results discussed today. Finally, for those who have not yet met her, I would like to introduce Holly Weiss. Holly Weiss was recently appointed Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. My transition to Holly will be completed ahead of our year-end earnings call. On a personal note, I would like to thank John, Brian and Britt as well as the investment community for the opportunity to work with everyone over the last few years. And with that, thank you. And here is John Hammergren. John Hammergren : Thanks, Craig. As you're probably aware, as he just mentioned it, this is his last earnings call. I want to thank you, Craig, for your invaluable service to our team over many years and in various roles, and I wish you the best in your future endeavors. And Holly, welcome as you -- as our new Head of Investor Relations. And thank you all for joining us on our call today. This is my 79th earnings call with our investor community, and this call also marks my final earnings call as the leader of McKesson. I previously announced my retirement that takes effect at the end of our fiscal year. We are making solid progress with our strategic growth initiative. And despite some headwinds, the company is in a strong financial position. McKesson's future is bright. It's been my great honor and privilege to leave this company as Chairman and CEO for nearly 20 years. Together, we've created an organization that plays a unique and significant role in health care. No one is better equipped than Brian to lead McKesson into the future. He is a gifted leader and an innovator, with deep industry knowledge and unwavering commitment to customers' success. He has a strong vision for the future of health care, both in the U.S. and globally, as well as for how McKesson will continue to play an integral role in helping improve efficiency and effectiveness for patient care delivery. Perhaps most important, Brian personifies our ICARE shared principles. In fact, he helped me create them as a member of my leadership team nearly 20 years ago. Throughout his tenure at McKesson, he has always placed the enterprise first, focused on teamwork, collaboration and communication and has consistently made employee engagement a high priority. I know that Brian is a right leader to take McKesson into the future. In addition, I might add, he is a great husband and a father as well as a friend and a trusted adviser of mine. With my retirement, McKesson will be splitting the role of Chairman and CEO. Ed Mueller, our current lead independent Director will become McKesson's new independent Chairman effective April 1 and has developed a thorough understanding of McKesson over his 10 years of service and serves as a respected leader and will provide continuity for our board. Over the balance of the fiscal year, the entire board and I will work closely with Brian and Ed to ensure a smooth transition. And after April 1, I will continue to support McKesson in an advisory capacity, and I'll remain Chairman of the Board of Change Healthcare. I'll be forever grateful for the many things we've accomplished together as a team here at McKesson and for the incredible friendships I had made along the way. McKesson is truly a special place with our rich history, innovation, culture, and most important, our people. Every day, I'm humbled by the opportunity to leave this great organization, and together with our employees, make a positive impact across health care. I might also mention that with many of you I've worked for years, and I want to thank you for your support overall all of these years and your friendship in some cases. You've always treated us with great respect. You've asked tough questions, but fair questions. And we've attempted to be as transparent as we possibly can. So I appreciate the support. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian? Brian Tyler : Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to be the first, probably of many, to recognize and congratulate John for the lasting impact he has had on McKesson. He and I, as he mentioned, have been colleagues and friends for a long time, and I am truly humbled by the opportunity to succeed him as McKesson's CEO. His leadership and vision for the past 20 years have allowed McKesson to achieve the level of success that few companies ever accomplish. I'm excited to build upon his legacy. I've had the privilege of running nearly every major business in McKesson as well as leading our corporate strategy function. I know our teams. I know our capabilities, our markets, our customers, and importantly, our employees well. To lead McKesson at this point in time is energizing, and I look forward to advancing the tremendous culture, solid foundation and global platform established by John and his team. The health care industry continues to undergo change as we focus on addressing affordability, access and quality outcomes for patients. I'm confident that McKesson is the partner of choice for biopharma, providers and pharmacies in all segments across health care to help improve the delivery of health in our communities. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, our strategic growth initiatives are gaining momentum. Most of the top leaders within McKesson were involved in developing our strategy to accelerate growth, supported by cost savings initiatives and operating model efficiencies, like our recently announced headquarter's move to Las Colinas. To succeed in today's evolving market, we will need to find new ways to innovate, speed up decision-making and empower our teams so that we can provide even better value to our customers and patients everywhere. More than 20 years ago, John helped guide our company through a time of crisis and showed us what leadership and resilience look like. Fast forward to today and McKesson's success can be seen both by the financial health of the company and our culture of doing what's right and putting the patient first. I believe our culture truly is a competitive strength of McKesson. We thank you for that culture, John. We thank you for your tremendous leadership and accomplishments. On behalf of all 78,000 employees, we send a very big thank you, a very big congratulations, and of course, just huge wishes for happiness in whatever is next for you. You will be missed greatly. You'll always be warmly remembered and regarded. Now turning to the quarter. For the third quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $56 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.40, which were ahead of our expectations. As a result, we are narrowing our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share range to $13.45 to $13.65 from the previous range of $13.20 to $13.80. We have reduced the top end of our guide to reflect the $0.26 impact of a customer bankruptcy that Britt will discuss in more detail. And we have raised the lower end of our guide based on the solid Q3 results and early indicators of our fourth quarter performance. A few comments on our business results. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment had year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 6%. Last month, Rite Aid renewed their distribution and sourcing relationship with us for another 10 years, as we had contemplated in our guidance. We're, of course, pleased that Rite Aid continues to see the value we deliver in our partnership through our industry-leading service levels, which translates to better experiences for their patients and customers; through our competitive pricing; and through our efficient operating model. All of this helps them to succeed, and their decision further validates our sourcing scale and service levels following Rite Aid's extensive and competitive evaluation process. As it relates to reform, we continue to monitor proposals and share our perspective and collaborate with the administration, policymakers and trade associations. And we've been in discussions with our biopharma partners and customers on opportunities to address the shared concerns of the administration around affordability, access and quality. As the administration implements new strategies that transition from volume to value-based reimbursement, we regularly demonstrate our ability to support our customers and improve patient care delivery. As a recent example, The US Oncology Network received incremental payments from both the Oncology Care Model and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, sometimes referred to as MIPS, reflecting the value we provide to our physician partners. We, at McKesson, continue to believe that community-based care is the best way to address these goals and that value-based care models are important tools to drive improved patient outcomes. We expect that as various reimbursement changes are considered, the value of community-based care will continue to be recognized. Now turning to McKesson Europe. In the third quarter, we appointed Kevin Kettler, a 13-year McKesson veteran, as Chairman of the Management Board of McKesson Europe. Kevin previously was President of Global Procurement and Sourcing. He managed the international team responsible for growing McKesson's private label generics business, which is a priority in Europe. Additionally, Kevin served in multiple leadership roles in corporate strategy in U.S. Pharma over the years. He brings deep experience in pharmaceutical distribution, procurement, marketing and retail pharmacy to the new role in Europe. Let me provide some color on Europe's operating performance in the quarter. Seasonality and market growth in all countries, except the U.K., drove an improved sequential and year-over-year performance. While most of Europe continues to perform well and grow, the U.K. business does face challenges. The actions we took last year to rationalize our store footprint and streamline our back-office operations only partially mitigated the U.K. government cuts. We previously mentioned that prior reimbursement cuts in the U.K. were in excess of historical levels and greater than we had planned for in our initial fiscal 2019 guidance. We're currently evaluating the recently released NHS Long Term Plan and were modestly encouraged by the general increase in health care funding that it proposes. While we're pleased to see the important role of pharmacy in the plan, we believe it's premature to expect a near-term return to growth, particularly given the generally weak retail environment and the uncertainties of Brexit. The U.K. team is working closely with internal and external stakeholders to evaluate the government dynamics and operating environment, making further changes intended to return the business to growth. We remain committed to ensuring the long-term profitability of this business. Now some comments on our Medical-Surgical business. Medical-Surgical continues to be a real good story for us, reflecting strong market growth, incremental scale from our recent MSD acquisition and benefits from an ongoing shift to lower cost sites of care. I'm particularly pleased with the segment's performance this quarter, especially when comparing the more normalized flu season experience so far this year against the unusually strong flu season last year. And looking further ahead, we continue to expect incremental synergies from our MSD acquisition as we integrate operations. This acquisition directly supports our strategic growth objectives of increasing our value proposition for our manufacturer partners and expanding our solutions related to specialty pharmaceuticals. Finally, McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions and our equity investment in Change Healthcare, all included in Other, saw upside in the quarter, driven by organic growth and mitigating actions in Canada to address previously discussed government generic price actions. During the quarter, McKesson Canada continued its progress on mitigating the impact of government-imposed generic pricing cuts that went into effect April 1, 2018. And together with strong organic growth in our McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, we were able to offset slightly lower adjusted equity contribution from Change Healthcare. And specifically regarding Change, as we've mentioned before, to the extent market conditions are suitable, we continue to expect an IPO in the first half of calendar 2019. Before I turn it over to Britt to provide more detail on the performance of each of these businesses, I wanted to spend a minute just to discuss the opioid litigation and epidemic. As it relates to litigation, the timing for conclusion of the myriad of cases remains uncertain. The magnitude of litigation expense is determined in part by the schedule set in these cases and underlying activity, which is not in our control and therefore difficult for us to project. We do take our fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders seriously. We will continue to evaluate the cost of all our options as the litigation in different jurisdictions progresses. We were encouraged by a recent decision dismissing the claims of 21 municipalities in Connecticut, finding the lawsuit to be inappropriate means to recover societal costs associated with addiction. As for the ongoing epidemic, I, as many of you, I'm sure, are deeply concerned about the devastating impact it's having on the lives of so many people, including friends and families of McKesson. Our teams are working on solutions. Last year, Congress passed the SUPPORT Act to address electronic prescribing, electronic prior authorization as well as some provisions related to ARCOS data, opioid production quotas and suspicious orders. Many of the provisions mirror recommendations previously made in our opioid white paper. We also launched an Opioid Foundation that will focus on helping advance solutions to the nation's opioid crisis and is led by a distinguished physician with relevant public policy and addiction treatment experience. I'm very proud of McKesson's efforts to combat this epidemic and to support solutions for the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Britt and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt? Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. Today, my comments will focus solely on our third quarter results and fiscal 2019 guidance. We will provide guidance for fiscal 2020 when we report fourth quarter results in May. As Brian discussed earlier, we are pleased with our fiscal '19 third quarter results, which were ahead of our expectations. We continue to make very good progress on our strategic growth initiatives, operating model and cost optimization program. As a result of this performance, we are narrowing our fiscal '19 adjusted earnings outlook to $13.45 to $13.65 per diluted share in fiscal '19 from the previous range of $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share. Let's jump right into our third quarter results. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $3.40 was flat compared to the prior year, which was primarily driven by a lower share count and growth in our Medical-Surgical business, offset by higher tax rate, lower profit contribution from our U.S. Pharmaceutical business and higher corporate expenses. Let me take a minute to discuss tax as it relates to the higher tax rate compared to the prior year. I'll remind you that our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 of 11.5% included discrete tax benefits of approximately $54 million as well as the cumulative catch-up adjustment related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to reflect the new lower federal tax rate of 21%. In addition, McKesson's fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate was positively impacted by the intercompany sale of software related to our former Technology Solutions segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Now let's turn to the details of our consolidated third quarter adjusted earnings, which can be found on Slide 10. Consolidated revenues for the third quarter increased 5% versus the prior period, primarily driven by the growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment and acquisitions. We now anticipate low single-digit percent consolidated revenue growth. Third quarter adjusted gross profit was up 5% year-over-year, mainly driven by growth in our Medical-Surgical and U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segments, including acquisitions. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses were up 8% year-over-year due to charges related to the bankruptcy of Shopko in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment and acquisitions, partially offset by the reversal of an accrual related to the state of New York Opioid Stewardship Act and ongoing cost management. Let me take a moment to provide more detail on the customer bankruptcy and the reversal of the New York accrual. First, we reported $60 million in pretax charges, principally related to accounts receivable with Shopko, who recently filed for bankruptcy. This amount represents substantially all the exposure related to this customer. We believe this would correlate to an approximate $0.03 impact to the fourth quarter. While we took steps to manage payment terms and we worked closely with Shopko to ensure we were paid for the products and services delivered, we believe there is risk in our ability to secure full payment and therefore recorded charges during the quarter. We'll continue to pursue payment, and we'll provide an update on our progress on our next earnings call. Second, as I detailed on our last quarter's call, while the New York Opioid Stewardship Act was being challenged in court at that time, McKesson reported an accrual in both our GAAP and adjusted results to account for our estimated portion of the annual assessment. In mid-December, District Judge in New York ruled the legislation unconstitutional and thus unenforceable. As a result of this ruling, McKesson reversed all previously reported charges totaling approximately $17 million. We will continue to track this matter following an appeal filed earlier this month. While we benefited from the favorable ruling in reversal of the charge for New York recorded in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, it was more than offset by higher opioid-related litigation expenses in corporate. For the third quarter, we recorded net opioid-related adjusted operating expense of $20 million and year-to-date $81 million. For fiscal 2019, we continue to anticipate that opioid-related costs will exceed $100 million. Turning back to our consolidated results. Adjusted income from operations was $918 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. We now anticipate adjusted income from operations will decline in the low single digit year-over-year. Interest expense of $67 million in the quarter was flat compared to the prior year. And our adjusted tax rate was 15.3% for the quarter, mainly driven by discrete tax benefits of $58 million resulting from tax planning initiatives and our mix of business. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate assumption is approximately 17% to 19%. This guidance takes into account our latest assumptions regarding income mix as well as other onetime items in fiscal 2019 that we do not expect to reoccur. Income attributable to non-controlling interest was $57 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $664 million, with third quarter adjusted earnings of $3.40 per diluted share, which is flat compared to $3.41 in the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results. Our third quarter diluted weighted average shares were 195 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we completed $500 million of share repurchases, and we continue to expect diluted weighted average shares for approximately 197 million for the year. Next, I'll review our segment results, which can be found on Slides 11 through 14. And let me start now with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $44.3 billion for the quarter, up 6%, driven by market growth, including strong growth in oncology-related pharmaceuticals and acquisitions, partially offset by previously disclosed customer losses and branded to generic conversions. The segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was down 2% to $593 million due to charges related to the customer bankruptcy discussed earlier and previously announced customer losses, partially offset by growth in our specialty business and the reversal of a charge related to the state of New York Opioid Stewardship Act. Excluding the impact of the customer bankruptcy-related charge and the reversal of the charge related to New York Opioid Stewardship Act, we would have seen year-over-year growth in segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter. Segment adjusted operating margin rate was 134 basis points, a decrease of 10 basis points. For the third quarter, brand compensation was in line with our expectations. Additionally, based on manufacturer price actions taken in January, we continue to be confident in our full year fiscal 2019 assumption, our brand price inflation in the U.S. to be in the mid-single-digit percentage range. I would remind you that our branded pharmaceutical contracts are primarily of a fixed rate in nature. And as a result, our brand compensation is less impacted by brand price increases when compared to our historical experience. For full year fiscal '19, we now anticipate a low to mid-single-digit percentage decline in adjusted operating profit for the segment. This represents an improvement from our prior expectations, driven by our third quarter operational performance. Next, I'll review European Pharmaceutical Solutions. Revenues were $6.9 billion for the quarter, down 1%, negatively impacted by $228 million from currency rate movements. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 2%, driven by strong performance outside of the U.K., partially offset by the previously disclosed reduction in owned retail pharmacies following the closure or divestiture of approximately 200 stores and a challenging operating environment in the U.K. We now anticipate full year revenue for the segment will be flat compared to fiscal '18. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 19% to $69 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit was down 16% to $71 million. While our U.K. business was lower than the prior year, driven largely by the impact of the previously announced additional reimbursement cuts and market conditions in our retail business, the rest of Europe performed well, reflecting growth on a year-over-year and sequential basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 99 basis points on a constant currency basis, a decrease of 23 basis points. We continue to expect adjusted operating profit to decline year-over-year for the second half fiscal 2019 contribution, similar to what was reported in the first half of the year. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2 billion for the quarter, up 19%, driven by the Medical Specialty (sic) [Specialties] Distributors or MSD acquisition and solid market growth. Excluding the MSD acquisition, segment revenue was up 8%. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was up 21% to $170 million, driven by solid operational performance, contribution from the MSD acquisition, improved cost of goods and operating expense leverage. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 845 basis points, an increase of 12 basis points. We now anticipate that the segment adjusted operating profit for fiscal '19 will be at the high end of our previously provided range of mid- to high single-digit percentage growth. Finishing our business review with Other. Revenues were $3 billion for the quarter, up 1%. Revenues were negatively impacted by $113 million from currency rate movements. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 5%, driven primarily by market growth across the businesses in the segment. We now anticipate that full year revenues will be flat year-over-year. Other adjusted operating profit was up 5% to $224 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit was $226 million, driven by growth in our Prescription Technology Solutions business or MRxTS, partially offset by the impact of previously disclosed government initiatives on our Canadian business. We now anticipate that adjusted operating profit will grow in the mid-single digits year-over-year, driven by the stronger-than-projected contribution from MRxTS. Closing our segment review with Change Healthcare. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $52 million for the quarter. As the company continues to make focused internal investments to expand new technologies, to enhance systems and deliver on synergy realization, we remain pleased with the operating performance of the business, which is in line with our expectations. And subject to market conditions, we continue to expect a calendar first half IPO. Next, McKesson recorded $138 million in adjusted corporate expenses, an increase of 29% in constant currency year-over-year, driven primarily by opioid-related expenses. Due to higher-than-anticipated opioid-related expenses, we now expect adjusted corporate expenses to increase by a high single-digit percentage year-over-year. Now that we wrapped up our results, let me discuss our updated fiscal 2019 outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13.45 to $13.65 per diluted share for fiscal 2019. Our updated outlook reflects the following : stronger-than-anticipated underlying performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, which includes the favorable ruling on the New York Opioid Stewardship Act; outperformance in our Medical-Surgical segment; and continued growth within our MRxTS business. These positive developments are partially offset by the customer bankruptcy I previously discussed, higher opioid-related litigation expenses and an updated assumption that foreign currency exchange rate movements will have a negative impact of up to $0.05 per diluted share. We are well positioned to continue to execute in our fourth quarter. I'll now review our working capital metrics and cash flow, which can be found on Slide 15. The receivables, days sales outstanding decreased 3 days to 24 days. Days sales in inventory decreased 1 day to 29 days. And days payables outstanding decreased 4 days in the prior year to 54 days. I'd remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion. For the first 9 months of the fiscal year, McKesson paid $866 million for acquisitions, repurchased approximately $1.4 billion in common stock and paid $216 million in dividends. During the quarter, McKesson issued $1.1 billion in long-term debt, which will be substantially used to repay an upcoming debt maturity, with approximately $1 billion in short-term borrowings outstanding at quarter-end. McKesson generated $141 million in cash flow from operations. After deducting $405 million in internal capital investments, McKesson had negative free cash flow of $264 million. This result was in line with our expectations. In fiscal '19, we now expect internal capital investments at the low end of our previous range, between $600 million and $800 million, and free cash flow of approximately $3 billion. I'd remind you that typically during our fiscal third quarter, we experience a net use of cash, primarily driven by the build in inventory for the holiday season. In addition, in our fiscal fourth quarter, we typically generate more than 2/3 of our annual operating cash flow, with more than $3 billion generated in our final quarter 2 of the past 3 years. We also have a total of $3.7 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization, which demonstrates the confidence that we have in our business going forward and the conviction that the Board of Directors and the management team have that the company shares are an attractive investment opportunity. And finally, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly dividend of $0.39 yesterday, which will be payable to shareholders in April. Year-to-date fiscal 2019, we've returned more than $1.6 billion to our shareholders in share repurchases and dividends, reflecting our focus on providing returns to our shareholders, while also making internal investments and acquisitions to support our long-term growth. Let me now take a minute to update you on the optimization of our operating model and cost structure. As we announced earlier this month, McKesson has expanded its relationship with Genpact, the global professional services firm focused on delivering process transformation. The expanded relationship will accelerate McKesson's operating model and cost structure program redesign, which will simplify and standardize finance processes, while deploying leading-edge technologies that will drive improved effectiveness, efficiency and savings. This partnership in combination with other finance operating initiatives is expected to contribute up to 1/4 of the previously announced annual gross pretax savings of $300 million to $400 million, which are anticipated to be substantially delivered by the end of fiscal 2021. We expect that these savings will increase gradually over time and that a majority of these savings will flow to the bottom line. In closing, we are very pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter performance and the progress against our strategic priorities. Despite a non-anticipated customer charge, our results exceeded our expectations, demonstrating our commitment to operational execution. Following solid third quarter performance, we now anticipate fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $13.45 to $13.65 per diluted share. We look to build on the momentum of our third quarter and remain confident in our business as we focus on a strong finish to fiscal '19. Lastly, I'd also like to thank John for his outstanding leadership. We're very fortunate to have worked with an incredible leader. John has done a tremendous job leading the company for nearly 20 years. As we now turn the page to Brian, I'd echo John's comments that he made in the press release today. We're well positioned, and I believe we're in very strong hands going forward with Brian. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And from Evercore ISI, we have Ross Muken. Ross Muken : Good afternoon, guys and again John, congrats, it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you over the years. So I know you probably haven't had a ton of time to kind of digest and prepare, but there obviously was a number of things that came out after hours from HHS around rebates and antikickback. And so it looks like they're trying to push forward with some of the proposals we heard earlier in the year. I guess, at a high level, I know this is something you feel strongly, you can sort of recruit the economics that goes into place. But I guess, how are you thinking about that in the context of just a disruptive force potentially, at least in the short term in the business, and how hard the government is going to push at least on this one piece? Brian Tyler : Hey, Ross. It's Brian. Thanks for the question. I didn't see that flash across my e-mail screen as I walked into the conference room here. I thought we might get a question. First, let me say that we support programs that enhance access, quality and cost. And if we think about the wholesaler model and how our economics and the supply chain works, we're not directly predicated on the safe harbor in question. Our economics really come from the manufacturer and revolve around the fair value of the services that we provide to them. We continue to believe that we run a highly efficient distribution and supply chain service and that they, over the years, have reinforced that view. And through various evolutions in our market and our industry, we continue to be paid fair value for the services that we provide, and that's based on the conversations that we've been engaged in today. We continue to believe that, that will be the case. So I might also just comment that we are not just a supply chain company in terms of logistics, but a pretty sophisticated financial operation as well. And on behalf of our manufacturers today, we administer lots of contract prices between manufacturers and hospitals or manufacturers and pharmacies. And millions of -- literally millions of price item customer combinations today, we do it at scale and we do it with great accuracy. And in our pharmacy technology businesses that you heard Britt talk about in terms of their strong credit performance, we have very sophisticated at-scale pharmaceutical-related transactions, over 17 billion a year, connecting directly at the pharmacy counter. So clearly, we will continue to engage in conversations with our manufacturer and other partners as people shift through the implications of what has just come out. But I focus you back on -- we continue to believe that we deliver a very important service in the pharmaceutical supply chain. We continue to be paid for that service that has evolved over the years. We expect it will continue to evolve. But the net-net, we would expect we'll continue to be paid appropriately for the services that we provide. Ross Muken : No, that's super helpful color. And just maybe relative to the quarter, is this -- I feel like all of the segments, sort of relative to your expectations, came in at least in line or maybe even a touch better in some places. Do you feel like this is sort of evidence of, aside from some of these pieces that -- the hiccups that come now, again, like what happened with Shopko, aside from something unusual like that, the underlying trends in each of your businesses that leave sort of that worst or flat and maybe in some cases are certainly maybe even a touch better. And we're starting to see that bottoming that hopefully should be the jump-off for growth eventually in sort of the out years? Brian Tyler : Well, we were certainly pleased with the operational performance of many of our businesses in the quarter. And as we've talked over the past months, we did see brand inflation come in line with where we had expected it to. That was a good development and provides some good underpinning for us. We see the generic market as reaching some point of stabilization. It's always competitive, but it's competitive in the sense we feel confident, are comfortable historically. And we do think that the focus that we've had over the past few months on the operating models and the discipline is beginning to resonate across our businesses. So I think I would say I feel real good about the quarter -- the operational quarter that the business put up. Ross Muken : Thanks so much, Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Ross. Operator : And moving on, we have Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. James Auh : Hi. This is James Auh for Charles. It looks like the MedSurg business performed better than at least we had expected, and the margins improved 12 basis points year-over-year. Can you just talk more about what drove that margin expansion and maybe what gives you confidence to improve the outlook, as evidenced by your revised segment operating profit guidance? Brian Tyler : Thanks for the question, James. And we were pretty pleased with medical business. I would characterize it as pretty solid performance really across the business. Most of our segments performed on or ahead of where we had expected them to. We performed well on the gross profit line. I think we saw them upside from expenses, and this is an environment where we're operating in a normalized flu season, where in a typical year, we would expect a little more tailwind from flu. We're in more normal than, say, last year's really strong season. And I think part of it is just good execution. We're obviously continuing to benefit from the MSD acquisition. And as we progress in the integration of the MSD acquisition, we feel good about the progress we're making, and it continues to be on track. So I look at the medical business and just feel a pretty solid performance really up and down the P&L. John Hammergren : And I might just underpin that as I mentioned in my remarks, excluding the MSD acquisition, which Brian mentioned is performing well in terms of integration, grew at about 8% growth year-over-year. So that's really solid for our growth within the ongoing business really across that business. So 8%, excluding MSD, I think it really underpins Brian's comments about the solid performance of that segment. James Auh : Okay. Great. And also can you maybe talk about the reimbursement environment in the U.K.? Do you get any sense of visibility into any incremental cuts? John Hammergren : Well, as I've mentioned in past comments, we always expect some level of reimbursement headwind. We have experienced in the prior few years abnormally high headwinds, I would say. That's clearly challenged the business. If I think about the current reimbursement landscape, there were -- the NHS typically does a 3-year plan, and this is the third year of the plan, and that plan would have called for them to push through some pharmacy-specific cuts, which they elected to not do, which we took as a mild positive that the NHS in tune with the landscape of community pharmacy in the U.K. Obviously, they've come out with the 10-year -- the NHS England's 10-year plan and community pharmacy was highlighted in that plan as having an important role in addressing cost, access and quality for them. This -- just this week, yesterday or maybe even this morning, in fact, NHS announced some incremental funding into the provision of community health around GPs, but also including other health care professionals, which we think just continues to reinforce their view of the importance of community provision of health and addressing the cost challenges of NHS. We're still digesting a lot of that. And I would not want to ever declare a victory on the reimbursement front, just given recent experience. But we would like to think that we've probably gone through the most significant of that. Now it's really a matter of how we continue to evolve the retail pharmacy model and to be a more integrated part of health care delivery in the communities in England. James Auh : Great. Thank you. John Hammergren : Thank you. Operator : Moving on, from JPMorgan we have Lisa Gill. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. John, I sincerely want to wish you the very best. I hope you enjoy time with your family. I may be the only one on the call today that has been on all 79 earnings calls with you from the beginning. So I will truly miss you, as you know. My question would be, though, Brian, you made a couple of comments. One, you talked about the Q3 being ahead of the internal expectations. Was there anything that was pulled forward from Q4? Because you also made a comment that the early indication of feeling good about where you stand for Q4. So I just want to understand if there was anything, #1, that was pulled forward? And then secondly, as we think about the fourth quarter, if there's any moving parts? Because if I look at the new revised guidance, it does come in kind of towards the lower end of where the Street is on the midpoint. Brian Tyler : Yes, thank you, Lisa. I'll may be make a couple of remarks and then let Britt add some color. Just with regards to the performance of the business in Q3, I think I characterize it as pretty solid and feeling good across many of our businesses. I don't believe there was any unique pull forward, or I think of it as just core solid operating performance. Britt Vitalone : And Lisa, maybe what I would add to that, I agree with everything that Brian said. As we think about Q4 and one of the things that I mentioned in my remarks is really around branded price inflation. And although we've talked a bit more of our branded, compensation is about 95% now fixed in nature and less variable, there still is that contingent part obviously that we've talked about briefly at JPMorgan. We feel comfortable on our mid-single-digit range. And again, we had very strong performance that we believe will continue in through Q4. Lisa Gill : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Moving on, we have Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. Congrats to John and many thanks to Craig. For Brian and Britt, the question on opioids. I think the first part is, relative -- you've given some of the solutions that McKesson has taken part in. I'd be interested, Brian, to hear your perspective on the role that McKesson or a distributor plays and maybe some of the responsibility or limitations of responsibility that distributor should hold? And then, Britt, a $100 million in legal expense, that's a significant number. Is there a lot of early stage work, and will that ever inflow? Or is that where we're going to be for foreseeable future? Brian Tyler : I'll take the first part of your question, Eric. And as you well know, it's -- the health care supply chains are incredibly complicated with lots of actors playing various different roles. I mean, as it particularly relates to opioid, we get the products to DEA-licensed pharmacies. They fulfill those based on scripts written by DEA-licensed physicians. And the DEA itself even controls the overall quantity of opioids in the marketplace. And so while we have a role in that physical supply chain, I would say that we would -- we feel like a disproportionate amount of the attention has been placed on wholesalers to this point. Britt Vitalone : Eric, I'll take your second question. Again, we've updated our guidance on the opioid litigation costs. And again, we -- our best view on it right now is that it'll be in excess of $100 million for the year. I think it's challenging for us to really have visibility on what the cost could be over the longer term. These costs have continued to increase over the balance of this year. And I think as we think about going forward, projecting the cost going forward will be difficult. It will depend on a lot of different things. Decisions that the judge will make in the various cases, how the judge will schedule certain milestones in each of the cases. It is very difficult for us to predict how each of those situations will play out. So we'll continue to update you as we go forward. And what we've given you now is our best projection on those costs for at least for this year. Brian Tyler : And we do take this responsibility in a very serious way. At this point, where we are, we think it's very important that we invest in the legal defense, that we get the best lawyers to represent us in that defense. And as Britt said, it's very difficult to predict where and how and when these things will evolve. But our commitment is to be good stewards of the capital that you have invested in us, and we will continue to keep you updated as the process unfolds. Eric Percher : Thank you. Operator : And next, we have Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Good afternoon, guys. Just a question on CVS on that contract. I mean, what are your expectations around the ability to retain the current services that you provide them? And then what are your thoughts on any additional services that you can provide -- yes, additional services that you can add to the contract? Brian Tyler : Thanks, Brian. I'll start with we have a long-standing relationship with CVS. We've been long time partners. And we think that we service their business to the highest standards and levels that can be found in the industry. So we value and appreciate the relationship we've had with them over the years, and we would fully expect that we will continue that relationship. We are in discussions with them currently around the renewal and extension of that agreement. And like we've said many times, I think if you look at the industry, there's a pretty good track record of renewing these. And certainly for McKesson, we feel very strongly that our track record of renewing and maintaining these relationships is strong, other than the occasional loss from the acquisition-related activity. We think CVS well respects the work their associates do on their behalf. And so we enter into these discussions. We have every full expectation to renew it. Now we often talk about CVS as the big customer for the U.S. Pharma business, and that certainly is true. We also have relationships with them in our RelayHealth and some other parts of the company as well. So it's a pretty big broad comprehensive relationship overall, and we're optimistic that we will continue that relationship. Brian Tanquilut : Thank you. Operator : Next we have Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Great. Thanks so much for the color today. I know it's addressed earlier in terms of the HHS and the rebate rule. I'm not expecting, as you said, a view on this. I think we've asked this question in the past, but when you talk about going back and making sure you get the appropriate compensation, what else goes into the conversation in terms of, is this creating an opportunity with your customers to explore new services, to pitch them on some of these things, whether it's CoverMyMeds and some of the other areas that they haven't passed me over the past? Are there others services that they're throwing back and asking you to try and pursue over time? Just trying to understand if a situation like this with uncertainty around how the pricing paradigms going to play out for pricing as a whole could create incremental strategic opportunities for the company that historically has been pretty active on the M&A front. Brian Tyler : Yes, great. Thank you for that question. As I -- we think about addressing an issue like this. And when I think about health care, it's pretty fundamentally connected upstream, downstream. I mean, whether it's employers, payers, PBMs, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, it's a pretty interconnected system. And we're fortunate in McKesson that really have businesses, solutions and relationships across multiple of those constituents. So we tend to talk on these calls a lot about the dialogues we have with manufacturers, but we certainly have dialogues with those other constituent customers as well. And I think one of the great strengths of McKesson is breadth of reach that we have and the capabilities we have, including some unique capabilities like CoverMyMeds and RelayHealth, which we would think there is good potential for some opportunities. It's contingent, of course, on how this evolves. But when we meet with our partners, whether that's upstream or downstream, we try to bring the fully capability and complement of McKesson into those discussions, not to let it get narrowly focused on just one piece. Michael Cherny : Thanks. Operator : And next from Leerink, we have David Larsen. David Larsen : Hi. Congrats on the good quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the Rite Aid renewal? Are those renewal rates reflected in this quarter's results or the new guidance for fiscal '19? And then can you maybe talk a little bit about the sell-side market environment as it relates to generic pricing? Thanks a lot. John Hammergren : David, thanks for that question. I'll start, and then I'll Brian jump in. As we've talked about before, we were very pleased obviously with renegotiating or renewing Rite Aid for a longer period of time. We think that there's strategic opportunities for both of us. As we've also said, this was renewed within our guidance. So there will be -- with the guidance that we gave you today includes the renewal with Rite Aid. David Larsen : Is it in the quarter? Is it fully reflected in the quarter, this quarter? John Hammergren : Fully reflected in our numbers, in our results, yes. David Larsen : Okay, great. And then can you may be just touch on generic deflation? Like how is that trending relative to expectations without getting too specific? One of your peers said mid-single to high single-digit deflation rates is what they're seeing. Is that what you're seeing as well or... John Hammergren : Yes, we don't give specific ranges on the rates of generic deflation. But as Brian mentioned, we're seeing a more stable or more normalized environment around generics. Again, I think it's important to look at both the sell-side as well as the buy-side. On the sell-side, we are seeing a competitive marketplace, as we've seen for many years. And then we expect that to continue, but we're seeing a very stable environment. And then on the buy-side, we're very pleased with the performance that we have at ClarusONE. We think that, that entity is still performing quite well and it is providing us the opportunity to continue to work very closely with the manufacturers. And we think that the buy-side environment is more normal in terms of historical ranges, and it's a more stable environment than it has been several quarters ago. So we're very pleased with the environment that we're in. It's a competitive environment, but a more stable one. David Larsen : Thanks. I appreciate it. Operator : Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi, good evening and John and Craig wishing you all the best and enjoy your time. And Brian and Holly, I'm looking forward to working with both of you. So Craig, this might be a question for you other than to congratulate you. When you think about it -- I know earlier in the call, you said that you're going to focus only on fiscal year '19. But I do note that starting next week, starting Monday, most of the questions we're going to get will be on fiscal year '20. So just if you can just help us think about this factor that we should consider -- I mean, obviously there is Rite Aid and CVS that you already talked about, which are likely to be headwinds next year. But how should we think about any other factors that we should consider, any other tailwind that you -- we factor in as we think about next year? Craig Mercer : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ricky. Maybe another call, you can congratulate me on something. Ricky Goldwasser : I hope that you have a long tenure going ahead. Craig Mercer : Thanks for that. So I think as we've talked about, we're very pleased with the quarter, and there's a lot of things that both Brian and I outlined and we view as providing momentum as we go into Q4. And certainly, we feel very strongly about as we move forward. We talked about our medical business and we had very good performance in our medical business, not only from the acquisition of MSD, but the rest of the business performed quite well also. We talked a little bit about our McKesson Prescription Technology business, and we were certainly seeing good -- new product growth as well as good revenue growth in that business. And then our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions business, again, as we talked about, we had the customer charge in the quarter. Outside of that customer charge and the reversal from the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act, we would have had growth in the quarter. And so we feel that there's really strong growth underneath in that business as well. So there is a number of areas in our business that are performing quite well. We certainly feel good about the position that we're in as we close the third quarter and as we have momentum going into the fourth quarter. Those will be a few of the areas that I would point out to you right now. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. So nothing in '20. So let me ask you another question here. The -- obviously, the health care market is changing and may be faster than we'll anticipate and we would appreciate heading into this year. So Brian, from your perspective, as you look ahead, as you look at, matter of fact, your first year as a CEO of the business, what do you think is kind of like the one area or maybe the 2 areas that are going to be your top priorities? Or where you think that you're going to spend most of your time on? There's the opioids. There is -- obviously, the relationship with the manufacturers, a number of different things. So from your perspective, what are really kind of like the things that your key priorities will be? Brian Tyler : Yes. Thank you for the question. It certainly is a dynamic time in our industry. And we often, I think in these calls, focus on clouds. And the fact of the matter is, when I look at McKesson and I look at the breadth of the businesses we have, I look at the reach in the channels, I look at the positioning in the community-based channels and the capabilities whether they're supply chain, whether they're software, pharmaceutical transaction or Medical-Surgical related, I think we've got this a tremendously broad set of assets and capabilities, unbelievably talented teams. And that change creates great opportunities for companies like ours that can bring these assets together in unique and differentiated ways on behalf of biopharma partners, on behalf of provider customers. I think to me that's the really exciting part of it, and that's the real opportunity that lies ahead. And so that's where I'll be spending my time, with our partners upstream, downstream and with our teams that are dedicated on delivering the value to those partners in and out every day. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. And congrats, again. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Ricky. Brian Tyler : One last question? Operator : All right. So the final question from Goldman Sachs, we have Robert Jones. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for sneaking me in John. Wish you the best Craig. It\u2019s been a pleasure. I guess, Brian, just going back to this idea that you discussed that there are services that you are the wholesaler, provide for hospitals and other channels that aren't currently being leveraged in the retail channel. I heard something obviously very similar from one of your peers this morning. Obviously, the HSS news seems to be kind of pushing us towards this kind of net pricing world, which seems to play a part in this. Could you maybe just level set us and maybe just elaborate a little bit on what specifically the services are, that changing or current pricing dynamic would allow for a wholesaler to leverage into the core channel? Brian Tyler : I think - the reality is we're going to see how things evolve here and how various constituents respond to the proposal that's been laid out. What I feel good about when I think about the capabilities at McKesson, and I mentioned this in my comments, is the fact that we do financial transactions, we do pharmaceutical transactions today in various parts of our business at scale with high accuracy, with really mature, developed, established incredible reputation for performance around those. And so I do think, as we looked how the markets will respond, how various segments will respond, we are in a good position to be able to provide solutions, kind of whatever that evolution is. Robert Jones : Thank you very much. Brian Tyler : Thanks, Robert. And thank you, Craig. I'd like to thank all of those of you on the call with us for your time today. I certainly look forward to engaging with you and the rest of our investor community going forward. I want to acknowledge John one last time, thank him one last time for just the terrific career accomplishment and the impression he has left on me and that I know he's left all across the teams of McKesson. He'll be greatly missed. I want to thank our employees for their dedication to our customers and partners in line with our ICARE value of putting the patient and the customers first in everything we do. In closing, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. McKesson continues to execute against our fiscal 2019 plan, and we look forward to updating you with our fiscal 2020 outlook in a few months' time. I'll now hand the call back to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig? Craig Mercer : Thank you, Brian. On Thursday, February 28, we will present at Leerink Partners 8th Annual Global Healthcare Conference in New York, and we look forward to releasing our fourth quarter earnings results in early May.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the McKesson Q4 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Holly Weiss. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Holly Weiss : Thank you, Ebony. Good morning and welcome everyone to McKesson\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. Today, I\u2019m joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson\u2019s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today\u2019s press release and our slide presentation, and to the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today\u2019s press release and presentation slides, and is also available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Holly, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we\u2019re going to focus on our fiscal 2019 results and our outlook for fiscal 2020. Britt will cover our financial performance in greater detail, but first let me take a couple of minutes to discuss some of our important accomplishments and why we\u2019re so confident in McKesson\u2019s future. During our fiscal 2019, we saw increasing momentum in our strategic growth initiative, including priority areas that focused on manufacturer value proposition, specialty pharmaceuticals or biopharma services, and the expanding role of retail pharmacy in community health services, all this supported by our ongoing investments in data and analytics. We also continued to optimize our operating model to improve our cost position, and the overall speed and effectiveness of the organization. We recently renewed our CVS agreement. This follows renewal of our Rite Aid agreement and a two-year extension of our Veterans Affairs agreement earlier in the year. We believe our strong value proposition and superior service quality were critical to allow us to continue supporting the success of these customers, and we are very pleased to continue these longstanding partnerships. We made several changes to strengthen our leadership team including the promotion of Kirk Kaminsky as President of our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment; the promotion of Kevin Kettler as the President of our Europe segment; and the hiring of a new leader for our UK business.  More recently, we appointed Tracy Faber as our Chief Human Resource Officer to succeed Jorge Figueredo upon his retirement later this year. In our medical business, we acquired Medical Specialties Distributors or MSD, which has among other things, expanded our value proposition with manufacturers and brought specialty infusion capabilities and services. It is progressing in line with its business case. And Change Healthcare filed its S-1 with an intention to complete an IPO, market conditions permitting. In terms of overall performance for the quarter, I\u2019m pleased with our adjusted EPS of $3.69, up 6% versus the prior year driven by solid execution across multiple businesses. And for the year, we were able to deliver results that were in line with our expectations outlined at the beginning of the year. Our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings of $13.57 represents 8% year-over-year growth. Despite the challenging industry environment we faced in fiscal 2019, as a company, I\u2019m pleased with our results. We have scaled businesses in many good markets and we are a critical resource to providers in the community care setting. Through our 80,000 associates acting together, we successfully delivered for our customers, executed and took decisive action to position McKesson for success over the long haul. Looking forward now to fiscal 2020. Our fiscal 2020 outlook for adjusted earnings of $13.85 to $14.45 per diluted share represents low to mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year growth. This outlook reflects solid growth across our operating segments, a continuation of disciplined efficient capital deployment, investments in the business, increased cost for opioid litigation and modestly improved UK results. I will remind you that this guidance is inclusive of our organic growth and our organic \u2013 and our strategic growth initiatives. Britt will cover this in more detail. I\u2019ll now touch on developments in each of our businesses during the past year, which provide a platform to deliver [indiscernible] organic growth. In our European Pharmaceutical segment, we experienced sizable UK government reimbursement cuts, which we have previously discussed, and we took additional actions this quarter to further rationalize our footprint and back office operations in Europe. Overall, for Europe, we anticipate revenue to be growing by low-to-mid single digits, driven by market growth with no incremental UK cuts contemplated in our fiscal 2020 guide. In Medical-Surgical, we delivered another year of solid growth across all of our customer channels and we are well positioned to support the growing alternate site markets. The acquisition of MSD and our investments in home delivery help us meet the needs of the patient wherever it suits them and further supports our growth in this segment. For the medical segment, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the high-single-digit range for fiscal 2020. Now, turning to other, which primarily comprises McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, or MRxTS, Canada and our investment in Change Healthcare. MRxTS is a fundamental part of our strategy to improve healthcare one patient, one prescription, one partner at a time. We are excited by innovative solutions like RxBenefit Clarity, which provides transparency around prescription pricing at the point of prescribing for any medication and all payors. Physicians and patients are excited about this tool and a fast-growing number of them, currently over 100,000, benefit from information they can really use to make timely decisions. We believe we can do much more to improve transparency for patients and to improve adherence by enhancing the ability of patients, pharmacists to collaborate with their prescribing physicians. In Canada, we made significant progress to mitigate the impact of government actions as we move through fiscal 2019. Our Canadian retail presence combined with Well.ca, which, by the way, was recognized by Forrester as the Number one digital retailer in Canada in 2018 provides patients with another channel to connect with us and we\u2019ve been piloting our future retail pharmacy concept that evolves the patient experience, which is currently being expanded to more sites. We also announced a collaboration with Google Cloud that will able us to accelerate how we leverage our data to develop insights and predictive capabilities that will support better patient outcomes and reduce waste. In combination, we expect other to deliver a flat to low-single-digit revenue decline for fiscal 2020. We remain confident in McKesson\u2019s path forward, the critical role of the services we provide to the healthcare industry today and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to healthcare systems globally. In particular, we have a scaled presence across important community care settings, including community pharmacies, specialty providers, oncology, alternate sites, which are all critical to addressing the nation\u2019s cost, quality and access challenges. Before I wrap up, I want to take a moment to share our perspective on the evolving drug pricing reform landscape and opioid litigation. Given our broad capabilities and the multitude of customers and channels that we serve are sometimes referred to 360-degree view of the supply chain. We\u2019ve been actively engaged with the administration, Congress and industry stakeholders to provide thought leadership on a range of proposed policy changes. The breadth and depth of our enterprise-wide assets provides a platform for developing new solutions that can help the industry adapt. Our MRxTS or our Pharmacy Technology business has been investing in real time benefits tools and cost transparency solutions for patients, prescribers and pharmacies, so they can make informed choices about the cost of therapy. As we move towards the world potentially without rebates, our manufacturer partners and pharmacy customers are interested in exploring new and innovative operating models. We\u2019re committed to being part of that solution. We have differentiated technology capabilities that can help move a solution forward, leveraging our retail health, pharmacy switch, and assets and capabilities like our chargeback platform in our wholesale business. Our unique experience in value-based programs such as the Oncology Care Model optimally position us to support the evolving needs of providers as they adapt to new care delivery models and value-based payment programs. With respect to opioid litigation, you are all well aware of the scope and complexity of litigations facing McKesson and many members of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Last week, we announced a settlement with the State of West Virginia. The settlement resolves all the state\u2019s past claims regarding McKesson\u2019s operations in West Virginia. While we deny wrongdoing, it\u2019s important to us that this settlement provides funding towards initiative intended to address the opioid epidemic itself. We remain committed to resolving other claims and more importantly to being part of the solution to this public health crisis. For example, we have contributed $100 million to a foundation focused on combating the crisis. We\u2019ve been educating our customers to comply with regulations and identify warning signs of prescription abuse and potential diversion. We\u2019ve advocated for solutions identified in our white paper, call to action; execute solutions today to combat the opioid epidemic. These solutions in our white paper include the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which was signed into law last year and the ALERT Act, which, if passed, would establish a prescription safety alert system to help identify patients at risk for opioid abuse. Finally, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their continuing dedication, leadership and consistent focus on a safe and secure supply chain as we strive to improve care in every setting, one product, one partner, one patient at a time. I\u2019m continually inspired by letters I receive from patients who\u2019d tell us about our associates consistently going the extra mile to ensure great health outcomes. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Britt. Britt Vitalone : Thanks, Brian, and good morning. Today I\u2019ll provide an update on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 results, and then I\u2019ll close by providing our fiscal 2020 guidance before turning to your questions. My comments will focus primarily on our adjusted earnings results. However, I want to start by discussing two items that impacted our GAAP-only results. As a result of the dynamic market environment, regulatory headwinds and business performance in our European segment, we recorded an after-tax charge of $1.5 billion in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting non-cash goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and restructuring charges that are largely in our European business. The impairment charges were mainly due to declines in estimated future cash flows, primarily attributable to the effects of UK government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures in the UK. Following this charge, there is no remaining goodwill balance in our European business. The restructuring charges in our European business are related to actions taken to address our performance in the segment. We\u2019re working to reinforce and accelerate our UK restructuring through further closures of retail pharmacy stores and cost management efforts throughout Europe. We anticipate recording additional restructuring charges in future periods as we execute on planned actions. We remain focused on our business performance in the UK and Europe more broadly, and we\u2019ve taken these actions to better position the business for the future. Now, let\u2019s discuss our fiscal 2019 results. As a reminder, our initial fiscal year 2019 guidance called for adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13.00 to $13.80. Despite significant regulatory and competitive headwinds, fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS was $13.57, 8% above fiscal 2018 and above the midpoint of our initial guidance. And fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $3.69 per diluted share were ahead of our expectations. We exit the year with another quarter of solid performance and remain focused on building upon this positive momentum as we enter fiscal 2020. Starting with the details of our full year fiscal 2019 consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 5. Consolidated revenues for the year increased 3% versus fiscal 2018, primarily driven by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, acquisitions, and organic growth in our Medical-Surgical segment, partially offset by Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses, which we\u2019ve discussed previously. Adjusted gross profit was up 2% year-over-year, mainly driven by growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, or MRxTS, Medical-Surgical and contributions from acquisitions. These positive developments were partially offset by Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses, headwinds in our European segment and the fiscal 2018 sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business. Fiscal 2019 adjusted operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year, principally driven by acquisitions, increased opioid-related litigation costs, investments to support growth, including incremental spend on data and analytics capabilities and information security, and charges related to the Q3 fiscal 2019 bankruptcy of Shopko within our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by the lapping of the $100 million contribution to create a non-profit foundation for opioids in Q4 fiscal 2018, the $90 million reversal during Q2 fiscal 2019 of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and the fiscal 2018 sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business. Adjusted income from operations was $3.8 billion for the year, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. Interest expense was $264 million for the year, a decrease of 7% compared to the prior year, reflecting fiscal 2018 fourth quarter refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Adjusted tax rate was 17.8% for the year, mainly driven by our mix of business and discrete tax benefits. Income attributable to non-controlling interest was $221 million for the year, a decrease of 4% compared to the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $2.7 billion and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 197 million for the year, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Next, I\u2019ll discuss our full year segment results, which can be found on Slide 6 through 9, and let me start with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $167.8 billion for the year, up 3% driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously disclosed Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses in branded to generic conversions. Segment adjusted operating profit for the year was down 2% to $2.5 billion due to fiscal 2018 customer losses and the ShopKo bankruptcy, which offset higher growth in our specialty business and acquisitions. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 150 basis points, a decrease of eight basis points. Next, European Pharmaceutical Solutions. Fiscal 2019 revenues were flat to fiscal 2018 at $27.2 billion for the year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 1% driven by solid performance outside of the UK, mostly offset by the fiscal 2018 reduction of approximately 200 retail pharmacies and challenging market environments in the UK and France. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 36% to $219 million, and on an FX adjusted basis, down 35% to $220 million. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 80 basis points on both the reported and an FX adjusted basis, which was a decrease of 44 basis points. The decline in this segment was driven by headwinds in the UK, which included inventory charge of approximately $20 million. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $7.6 billion for the year, which were up 15% driven by the Medical Specialties Distributors, or MSD, acquisition and growth in our primary care business, most notably from growth in pharmaceutical products and lab solutions. Excluding the MSD acquisition, segment revenue grew 6%. Segment adjusted operating profit for the year increased 11% to $605 million, driven by solid operational performance, contribution from the MSD acquisition, and ongoing cost management, partially offset by additional investments to support business growth. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 794 basis points, a decrease of 29 basis points, driven by growth in lower margin pharmaceutical products and investments in our patient home delivery business. Finishing our business review with other. Revenues were $11.7 billion for the year, down 1%. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues grew 1% driven primarily by market growth across the businesses within this segment, partially offset by the April 2018 government pricing actions in Canada and the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business in fiscal 2018. Other adjusted operating profit increased 8% to $1 billion on an FX adjusted basis, driven mainly by growth in our MRxTS business and a $9 million reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare in the second quarter. This was partially offset by the fiscal 2018 sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business and the impact of the April 2018 government pricing actions in Canada. Included in other, adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $242 million for the year. Next, McKesson recorded $555 million in adjusted corporate expenses, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. There are a few discrete items impacting the expense growth, led by the increase in opioid-related litigation costs and investments in technology infrastructure. These items were partially offset by the fiscal 2018 contribution to create a non-profit foundation for opioid, which is detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, we\u2019re executing on cost discipline, an important component to driving leverage, and a key part of our financial model that we have confidence in driving and sustaining over the long term. Turning now to cash, which can be found on Slide 10. Our cash flow remains dependably strong as we remain focused on working capital efficiency and cash flow generation. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.5 billion in free cash flow, which includes $557 million spent on capital expenditures. With the scale of our distribution businesses, there can be variability in our cash flows from quarter-to-quarter, including the day of the week a quarter ends on. A portion of the fiscal 2019 performance was due to favorable timing in our U.S. distribution and European businesses. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3 billion. And in fiscal 2019, we returned $1.9 billion to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, we have a total of $3.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Before turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020, I\u2019d like to make a few comments as it relates to the fourth quarter. Our detailed results are provided in our press release, so I\u2019ll just hit a few of the highlights. Consolidated revenue grew 3% on an FX adjusted basis. Revenue was led by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, and acquisitions, partially offset by the Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses, which we\u2019ve discussed previously. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.69, up 6% for the quarter. This result exceeded our expectation and was led by a lower share count, strong performance in Medical-Surgical and MRxTS, offset by the weak Europe segment results, principally driven by the inventory charge in the UK and a higher tax rate. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, led by strong working capital performance and some favorable timing. In summary, adjusted operating profit performance was ahead of our expectations in our segments with the exception of Europe. Earnings per share were in line with the most recent guidance range, despite increased opioid litigation costs and investments in technology, and we generated strong free cash flow above our target. Overall, we demonstrated progress in many areas, but importantly, there\u2019s room to improve on all metrics. Now let me turn to our fiscal 2020 outlook. The dynamic macro environment from this past fiscal year, which was led by regulatory impacts, particularly in our international retail markets, uncertainty regarding the outcome of several U.S. drug pricing proposals, reimbursement headwinds, and increased opioid-related litigation costs, will continue to confront us in fiscal 2020. We continue to invest in several strategic initiatives and we\u2019re making solid progress against our cost in operating model programs. We\u2019ve attempted to construct guidance ranges that reflect these components. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $13.85 to $14.45 for fiscal 2020, which contemplates adjusted operating profit growth across each of our segments, including our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, and we will continue to deploy capital in a disciplined manner. Please refer to our press release and Slides 11 to 14 in our supplemental slide presentation for our full list of fiscal 2020 assumptions. In lieu of outlining each assumption, I\u2019ll instead walk you through the key items, and I\u2019ll start with the segment. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, we expect low to mid-single-digit percent revenue growth, primarily driven by market growth, including strong performance in our specialty business. Adjusted operating profit is expected to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percent, primarily driven by growth in our specialty business and ongoing cost management. In the US market, we anticipate mid-single-digit percent branded pharmaceutical price increases, consistent with our experience in fiscal 2019. As a reminder, approximately 95% of our contracts with branded manufacturers are on a fixed fee rate for service basis. As Brian noted, we are pleased to have renewed our agreement with CVS Health. Both the CVS Health renewal and the Rite Aid renewal during fiscal 2019 are included in our fiscal 2020 expectations for the segment. Moving to the European Solutions segment, we expect low to mid-single-digit percent revenue growth. Adjusted operating profit is also expected to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percent, driven by solid performance in countries outside of UK and cost management programs, including the benefit from recent restructuring actions. This outlook assumes a modest improvement in our UK business with no incremental reimbursement cuts contemplated. We\u2019re focused on executing against key initiatives to strengthen the business in the UK and bolster the performance in other European countries. Moving to Medical-Surgical Solutions, we expect high-single-digit percent revenue growth, primarily driven by the shift of care to lower cost settings, increased demand in patient home delivery, and growth in pharmaceutical products. We expect high single to low double digit percent adjusted operating profit growth, reflecting organic growth, synergies from the MSD acquisition, benefits from fiscal 2019 investments in the patient home delivery business, and operating expense leverage. For the remaining businesses included in other, revenue is expected to be approximately flat to down by a low-single-digit percent, driven by the exit of an unprofitable customer in our Canadian business, partially offset by anticipated volume expansion and increasing sales in MRxTS. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be down by a low to mid-single-digit percent, driven principally by the $90 million reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare in our second quarter of fiscal 2019. For Change Healthcare, we anticipate the adjusted equity income attributable to our interest to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million, which assumes that our ownership continues at 70% throughout fiscal 2020. As a reminder, Change Healthcare Inc., which owns the remaining 30% of Change Healthcare, filed its S-1 with the SEC on March 15, 2019. It continues to make progress towards a potential IPO. We will not comment specifically on the anticipated performance of the business, I\u2019d instead refer you to SEC filings by Change Healthcare Inc. for further information. Moving on now to corporate expenses. As detailed in our press release, our fiscal [indiscernible] guidance contemplates increased corporate expenses year-over-year. This assumption reflects an increase in opioid-related litigation costs to approximately $150 million, an increase over fiscal 2019 of approximately $70 million related to technology investments, most notably infrastructure, and data and analytics investments, investments related to our strategic growth initiatives, and a decline in other income. As a result of these items, we anticipate adjusted corporate expenses will be in the range of $725 million to $775 million for fiscal 2020. While we\u2019re not providing an outlook beyond fiscal 2020 today, we anticipate that investments related to technology, our growth investments and initiatives, and operating model optimization efforts will be higher in fiscal 2020 than future fiscal years. Now turning to the consolidated view. We expect low to mid-single-digit percent revenue growth and adjusted income from operations is anticipated to be flat to down by a low-single-digit percent. While we expect adjusted operating profit growth in the majority of our businesses, this growth will be partially offset by the higher corporate expenses that I outlined earlier. We remain particularly focused on lowering operating expenses across the organization, in addition to the important progress we\u2019re making on our operating model optimization. As a result of recent restructuring efforts, we\u2019ve increased our annual pre-tax gross cost savings target from approximately $300 million to $400 million to a new range of $400 million to $500 million.  We expect these savings will be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2021 and we\u2019ve made solid progress in fiscal 2019, and we\u2019re tracking in line with our expectations. Moving now to below the line. We assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. We expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2020 to be approximately $185 million, which reflects share repurchases completed in fiscal 2019 and the benefit of share repurchases anticipated in fiscal 2020. We anticipate revenues and results of operations to be currency neutral.  Concerning the cash flow, we expect free cash flow of approximately $2.8 billion to $3 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses between $500 million and $700 million. The free cash flow expectation reflects the favorable timing realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. In closing, we\u2019re pleased with the results of our fiscal fourth quarter performance and the execution against our strategic priorities. While the external environment presents many headwinds, we\u2019re making important progress. Our efforts to drive productivity, execute on initiatives to deliver savings to fund investments for growth, simplify our organization structure and increased accountability are all aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth that creates value for our shareholders. We know we have more work to do, yet we are pleased with the progress. We look to build on the momentum of our third and fourth quarter operating performance and remain confident in our business as we enter fiscal 2020. With that Brian and I would be happy to take your questions. And I\u2019ll turn it back over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Great, thanks for the questions. I guess just to start on the U.S. Pharma business around guidance and specifically around branded inflation, was wondering if you guys be willing to share what the assumption around inflation is that is assumed in guidance? And then more importantly, I was hoping you could provide us an update on how you feel generally around the branded portfolio and renegotiations with branded manufacturers, you have Britt both on the fee-for-service side as you mentioned, but also on that 5% that\u2019s still contingent upon inflation. Britt Vitalone : Well, good morning Bob. And thanks for that question. Let me see if I can answer those in order. In terms of our guidance for the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, as I mentioned, our assumption around branded price inflation is mid-single digit. And that\u2019s really in line with what we\u2019ve been experiencing here in our fourth quarter and it\u2019s really aligned with fiscal 2019. Our conversations with our manufacturing partners continue to be very productive, we have conversations with our manufacturing partners on a regular basis, we feel like we\u2019re very well-positioned in those conversations. And there\u2019s nothing in our conversations today that would suggest anything different from the guidance that I provided you. As it relates to the contingent portion, again, I wouldn\u2019t point to anything new here. We continue to have really constructive conversations with our manufacturing partners and we\u2019re really feeling like that fiscal 2020 sets up pretty similar to fiscal 2019. Robert Jones : Great. And I guess just a quick follow-up, you guys highlighted corporate expense obviously taking a step up, it sounds like in large part because of the ramping opioid litigation. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the visibility you have into what those expenses will be specifically in 2020? And as we think about where we stand in the timelines of some of those larger cases, it seems like, some of them, the bigger ones are poised to go to trial in 2020 and obviously could be in expense for some time beyond that. Any sense you can give us on how you\u2019re thinking about the run rate around these costs as we move, not just in 2020 but beyond 2020? Britt Vitalone : Yes, well thanks for that question. Let me start and then I\u2019ll have Brian add some commentary here. As we were going through last year, we provided you the best guidance that we had for fiscal 2019 and we talked about opioid related costs being in excess of $100 million for FY2019. As we said, our guide, again, what we\u2019re doing is giving you the best visibility that we have to those costs. I outlined that as $150 million for FY2020. It\u2019s very difficult to forecast these out, these really are dependent on the speed of the trials, the decisions that the judges make along these cases and it\u2019s hard for us to predict that. And so what we\u2019ve done here is given you our FY2020 view as we sit here today on how we think those trials might progress and what we think those costs might be to defend in those litigation proceedings. Brian Tyler : Alright, I think, you covered it well Britt. It is difficult to forecast exactly. It\u2019s the little bit of art and a little bit of science obviously. We\u2019re prepared to make the investment we need to make to prepare a proper defense and protect our shareholders\u2019 interests. As information unfolds and judges decisions and schedules and proceedings occur, we\u2019ll be committed to keep this group updated. I would say in general, I think, if you look at the operating expense environment and discipline in the core operations, I\u2019m very pleased with the trajectory and the progress that we\u2019re making. It is being offset by investments in opioid defense and some very specific targeted investments we\u2019re making into the business as part of our strategic growth initiatives. Robert Jones : Great, thanks for that. Brian Tyler : Thanks Bob. Operator : Our next question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. Last year we were talking about a lot of unique headwinds and seen significant that CVS is not considered a unique headwind. Brian, I\u2019d be interested in your perspective on what makes for unique or not and whether there is any change to the scope of that relationship. And Britt, it would be helpful if you have any commentary on the cadence of earnings given some of the renewals, and onetimers and acquisitions that are contributing. Britt Vitalone : Well Eric good morning and thank you for the question. Obviously we\u2019re very pleased to be able to announce the renewal of our CVS agreement this morning. It\u2019s a long time partnership that we\u2019ve enjoyed with them. I would say that I don\u2019t characterize this renewal as really any different than many of the others I\u2019ve been through with CVS, in the years. These are big business relationships, complicated business relationships. And we worked through those discussions in a way that obviously we reached the feeling that it was mutually beneficial for us to continue to go forward. And so we\u2019re really excited about our partnership with CVS and the economics of that renewal as always have been built into the numbers we shared with you this morning. Brian Tyler : Eric maybe I\u2019ll just answer your second question here. As we think about the progression of earnings over the course of the year we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, but what I would say to you is that as we look at the year, you should expect that our earnings will be roughly the same first half to second half is what we experienced in FY\u201919. Eric Percher : Thank you for the detail. Operator : Our next question will come from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, this is Elizabeth Anderson on for Ross. Can you talk a little bit more about your expectations on Europe in the coming year? I know, obviously there are a couple of onetime items there, things that are unavoidable in FY\u201919. But sort of what gives you confidence in the profit growth trajectory for fiscal 2020? Brian Tyler : Thank you, Elizabeth. Well, we obviously did take a charge of approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter in the UK. But I would say if you step back and look at Europe overall, we were really in line with our growth expectations in most of the countries. And we\u2019re pleased with the performance. We feel like with the headwinds we\u2019ve experienced over the past years in the UK and the management actions that we\u2019ve taken, which includes really, building a new leadership team there, a rationalizing our store portfolio, restructuring the operations, is the work we\u2019ve done that gives us, gives us confidence to feel that we can, you know, get Europe back to very modest growth next year. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay, perfect, that\u2019s really helpful. And I also wanted to ask you a question in terms of the upside in your cost cutting program, are there any particular areas that you\u2019re seeing additional dollars coming from or any other color you could provide there would be very helpful? Britt Vitalone : Yes, thanks for that question. I think as we\u2019ve talked about before, there are several areas that we were really focused on as we think about not only cost cuts and spending behaviors and disciplines themselves, but also we\u2019re going through some operating model optimization efforts in our finance operations, in legal HR and our technology and we\u2019ve also talked about investments that we\u2019re making in technology, and data and analytics.  We\u2019ve also talked about some things in our finance operating model like the partnership with Genpact as we\u2019ve expanded that. So I wouldn\u2019t think of it just as cost cutting. Spend discipline is important, it\u2019s important component to that. But we\u2019re also going through some operating model optimization capabilities and we\u2019ve made some really great progress, particularly in the areas of technology and in finance. In the area of technology, we\u2019re in a position now to reinvest back into that, invest in infrastructure and also invest in data and analytics capabilities. Elizabeth Anderson : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks. I want to get back to the U.S. Pharma business and your guidance there. It assumes, if I\u2019m thinking about this right, I think, it assumes margins to be pretty flattish year-over-year. And I understand there\u2019s some synergies from M&A and some other improvements and growth in specialty and the like. If you can breakdown sort of what your expectations are for generic profitability and the spreads there, like what have you been seeing versus maybe margins and some of the other segments within U.S. Pharma? Britt Vitalone : Thanks for that question, Kevin. I\u2019ll start and what I would say to you as a starting point is we\u2019re pleased to be able to provide an outlook for our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions segment which returns to growth next year. And I think that\u2019s on multiple dimensions. We\u2019ve certainly made some advances in our specialty business and continue to see good growth there. As we talked about, we\u2019re seeing relative stability in the manufactured price increase area of our business. And as it relates to generics, we don\u2019t provide specific guidance on inflation or deflation rates. What I would tell you though is that we are very comfortable with the sourcing capabilities that we have through ClarusONE and continue to drive good value out of that. And on the sell side, we have great compliance with our customers. We utilize our capability and scale from ClarusONE to provide really good value to our customers. And we believe that we\u2019re continuing to create an appropriate spread, which is in a market that is competitive yet stable. And so we\u2019re very comfortable operating in that environment. And overall, that leads us to be able to provide you an outlook for the segment that has low-to-mid single-digit growth in 2020. Kevin Caliendo : And just one quick follow-up, speaking of outlook, it feels to me like this guidance is a little bit narrower than we\u2019ve seen recently, especially given the higher number. What would cause guidance to come in at the high end of range versus low end of range, given what you\u2019ve provided us so far? What\u2019s $13.85 versus $14.25, like what needs to happen? Britt Vitalone : First of all \u2013 yes, thank you, Kevin. First all it is narrower than the guidance that we provided last year. We have certainly put together plans and constructed these plans with a lot of really good information and visibility into our business units. I think as you think about the top end of the range, certainly continued growth in our Specialty business would propel us there. We\u2019ve had very strong growth in our Medical-Surgical business, continuing to grow patient home delivery and the investments we\u2019ve made there, we call those out. We think that those are going to deliver some upside in 2020 and beyond. And our ongoing cost management efforts will take hold as we get further into the period to FY2021. On the downside, I think, things that could happen could be the outcome of U.S. drug pricing reform or additional regulatory impacts in our international market, which, again, we called out, we are not contemplating those, but those are things that could happen that drive us to the lower end of that range. Kevin Caliendo : All right, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning. And thanks for taking the question. Brian, you talked before about the CVS renewal and how \u2013 wasn\u2019t that different from previous one. That being said, you\u2019ve recently renewed three of your largest customers, CVS, Rite Aid, VA against the backdrop of some of these drug pricing dynamics. You\u2019ve also talked about your engagement with brand inflation manufacturers. How do you think about the conversations that you went into them and thinking about the trade off of services, versus price, versus volume commitments in this new drug pricing world? And was there anything that given the moving piece on drug pricing you are able to essentially pivot the conversation on. Brian Tyler : Thanks for the question, Michael. Obviously, as we enter these discussions, we are well aware and informed of the regulatory environment as frankly were our customers. And as we have been evolving our model over the past years to think about how we think of different product, classes and the services we provide around those classes and the economics we get with those classes, that kind of all goes into the mix, and is the context in the backdrop for these conversations. As we think about the gross to net environment and things of that nature, I would remind folks that there is a little bit of a natural hedge on the buy and the sell side for us. But at least these are all well considered and well contemplated, frankly, on both sides as we entered into these agreements and we have baked the results of these renewals into the guide that we\u2019ve reviewed to you this morning. And we\u2019re very comfortable in the relationships and excited to extend our business partnership with both Rite Aid and CVS. Michael Cherny : And then just one quick one relative to the share count guidance, it looks like if my math is correct, you are assuming a higher degree of buyback versus previous years of guidance. Does that have anything to do with your outlook on potential M&A targets relative to where you sit on a portfolio basis or the viability of what you see across the market? Britt Vitalone : Well, again, I would just point to, as I mentioned, our share count assumption is 185 million at the end of FY2020. As Brian talked about and we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we look at our capital deployment on a balanced perspective and trying to drive the most value for our shareholders. And as we think about FY2020, we think that capital deployment towards share repurchases is still an important component of that. And we believe that our share price is undervalued at this point, so that certainly is going to be a component of how we think about capital deployment. Brian Tyler : I would just add, I don\u2019t think the message should be that we don\u2019t see good M&A opportunities, or good growth opportunities for this Company. We have had a good track record. And some of our recent deals, I think, have been highly successful for us. But what we are doing is really being very focused on where that M&A might occur and making sure it\u2019s aligned with our strategic growth initiative and the three growth pillars that we have aligned. And we make those decisions, obviously, in the context of where our share price is today and what we think the relative attractiveness of share buybacks versus M&A are. So we do have good opportunities. We are and will continue to be active in looking for growth or capabilities that might come to us through M&A, but doing that in a very disciplined way. Britt Vitalone : I think MSD is a good example of that that we completed in FY2019. Michael Cherny : Great, thanks for the color. Britt Vitalone : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks for the question. I was hoping to get some additional insight into the [indiscernible] of the efficiency program. And can you help us understand how much of the cost savings was achieved in 2019? How much incremental you think happens in fiscal 2020? And then how much of that remains to benefit the numbers in 2021 and 2022? Thank you. Britt Vitalone : Yes, thanks for that question. What we have told you is that we expect to have $400 million to $500 million of cost savings by the end of FY2021 full year. Comfortable raising that target given the actions that we\u2019ve taken here in the last quarter, we haven\u2019t provided specific year-to-year guidance on that. What I have said is that in FY2019 the savings that we generated were largely invested back in the business. We talked about our information technology infrastructure, and data and analytics capabilities. So you should view FY2019 as largely reinvested back in the business. As we progress through the time period over FY2020 and now FY2021, we would expect that those savings will increase over time and then you should expect to see more and more of those hit the bottom line, but we haven\u2019t provided specific year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter guidance on the numbers. Stephen Baxter : Okay, thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, I think, in the past you said of the cumulative program, most of it will drop through. Is there any update to that or is that still kind of the right way to think about it? Britt Vitalone : That\u2019s the right way to think about it. Brian Tyler : And I think about it that we\u2019re in the early phases of our efficiency initiatives are producing, we\u2019re making a calculated decision in some instances to invest that back into the business. As those efficiency efforts continue to grow, the investments will begin to wane off, you\u2019ll see a bigger impact. Stephen Baxter : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question regarding sort of the rebate rule and sort of the role you see the distributors play. And then if I\u2019m not mistaken, in some of the comments that the wholesalers have provided to GCMS here is sort of applying sort of a chargeback system that you have had in place with manufacturers for pharmacies to apply for \u2013 to apply this for the administration of point-of-sale rebates? Can you talk about sort of the capabilities that you currently have to do that today? How that it works for pharmacies and how quickly could that be applied for the use for consumers directly? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Thanks for the question, Charles. So first off, I would remind everybody that the Part D safe harbor does not really impact our business model directly. We are not contemplated in that. So what we\u2019re really talking about in the course of that reform is what are the implications for retailers and manufacturers, and then how might that ultimately impact us. We do think that we have some scaled and significant capabilities to help address the solution for this area. That would be not just the wholesaler chargeback infrastructure and technology, which really operates at big scale and highly efficient today, but also through our relay switch business. We are transacting 18 billion, 19 billion transactions at the pharmacy desktop each and every day \u2013 well, not each and every day, each and every year as we speak. And so while each one of those solutions by itself is probably not what\u2019s going to be required to administer whatever comes out, and we think it will actually come out pretty soon in terms of a final rule. We think the underlying capabilities will be there. And so what we\u2019re really looking for in the rule is what does HHS, say, relative to transparency? What are they going to stipulate in terms of the service providers that can support this? And frankly, what is the time frame for the implementation? And contemplating all those things, we will look at how we bring our capabilities which are unique to us, not all of them. We all have the chargeback capability but relay switch business is a little bit unique to McKesson. And if the opportunity is there for us to play a differentiated role or be part of the solution, that\u2019s something that we would certainly, look to do. But we\u2019ll also approach it with the seriousness that these are massively scaled transactions with big financial implications for all party and so anything that we would roll out would have to be robust, tested and reliable. Charles Rhyee : And just a follow-up, I think one concern is particularly as you think about the application of point-of-sale discounts, this potential that particularly like pharmacies or independent pharmacies could be sort of caught on the wrong end carrying sort of a negative float here until sort of a true up on payments. Is that something where you see distributors potentially playing a role kind of supporting pharmacy customers using a balance sheet to sort of help them on the working capital side? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Yes, really that\u2019s a good question, and that\u2019s one that we\u2019re probably not prepared to answer right now until we see what the final rule looks like. I mean, I will say that we have long been an important part of supporting the independent customer base with a really broad array of solutions from helping on the reimbursement side of the business, helping with the cost, the reporting, obviously, generic procurement programs. And as this rolls out and we see what the impact and evolutions are, we\u2019ll assess our capabilities whether they support the services, our balance sheet, figure out how to best support the independent and retail community pharmacy space. But it would be premature to make any definitive statements. Charles Rhyee : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, Brian and Britt. Thanks for taking the question. Just to come back for a minute here on the cost savings and the segment reporting. And just kind of thinking out loud for the $400 million to $500 million in cost savings, we\u2019re assuming most of that does show up in the operating profit segment results for U.S. pharma solutions and European pharma solutions, but just curious if any material amount of the savings would show up in the corporate expense line over the next couple of years even though corporate expenses are obviously going up a lot in fiscal 2020. So it does seem like as you described some of the sources of savings, it does seem like some of that would fit into a corporate expense buckets. So just curious if there are some savings factored into that guidance in corporate expense for fiscal 2020. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Thanks, Steve, for that question. It\u2019s great question, let me just clarify that. The cost savings programs that we put in place, which include the optimization of our operating models, are enterprise wide. So as we think about cost savings, it\u2019s really disciplined on an enterprise basis which would include our corporate functions. As we think about our operating model optimization efforts, whether that\u2019d be in finance, or technology or HR, clearly those will be enterprise wide as well. So as we think about, these are really holistic programs where we expect the benefits to have an impact not only within the segments, but also within our corporate expense line as well. Steven Valiquette : Okay. One other quick one here just on the guidance. Normally, you guys will give some comments on contribution from new generic launches and I didn\u2019t hear much about that for FY2020. [Indiscernible] have launched recently generic Advair and a few others, but just big picture, any view on profits from new generic launches FY2020 versus FY2019. Britt Vitalone : Thanks for that question. Clearly there will be generic launches in every year. I think as we think about this, we don\u2019t expect a material profit difference in FY2020 than FY2019 from generic launches. So there will be, what we would expect to be, a modest impact from generic launches in FY2020. Steven Valiquette : Got it. Okay, thanks. Brian Tyler : Thank you. Holly Weiss : Operator, we have time for one more. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from David Larsen with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. David Larsen : Hi. It looks like you are guiding pretty good operating profit growth for fiscal 2020 across all segments with the exception of other. Can you just remind me what is going on in other that is going to basically cause the entire enterprise\u2019s operating income, it looks like to decline possibly to low-single digits in fiscal 2020. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question. As I talked about in my remarks, in fiscal 2019 in our other segment we had the benefit from the $90 million reversal of a contractual liability within our Change Healthcare business. And so that, obviously, we will be lapping that in fiscal 2020, that is the primary change. And that is really partially offsetting some good growth and some good expansion that we\u2019re seeing, particularly in our MRxTS business. David Larsen : Okay. And then with the opioid litigation costs, I mean, some of the numbers we\u2019re hearing from these litigator are very, very high. Like, would you expect to include those cost of litigation in your adjusted EPS going forward beyond fiscal 2020 or would you view those as one-time items? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes, thanks for that question. What I would be prepared to say now is our guidance assumes the litigation costs and that number is $150 million. We don\u2019t have any visibility into anything beyond that. So it would be inappropriate for us to really comment on it at this time. As things come up, or there are decisions that are being made, we\u2019ll certainly provide that guidance and visibility to you. But as it relates to our guidance today, it\u2019s the $150 million in opioid-related litigation costs, which are in our corporate segment. David Larsen : Okay and then just the last one from me. You had $23 million of operating income in European Pharma Solutions this quarter. I mean, it looks like we\u2019re expecting a pretty big rebound in fiscal 2020. Just, what\u2019s going to drive that? And I\u2019ll stop there. Thanks a lot. Britt Vitalone : I would just remind you that we took a charge in the fourth quarter related to that business and we\u2019ve also been hard at work in terms of optimizing our store portfolio, rationalizing our back office support functions and we think all of those will begin to yield benefit. David Larsen : Okay. Congrats on a good fiscal 2019, Britt. Britt Vitalone : Thank you. Brian Tyler : Thank you, David. And thank you, operator. Unfortunately, we\u2019re out of time. So I want to thank all of you who joined us on the call this morning, particularly those with questions. And we appreciate your support and interest in McKesson. We have a clear strategy and a solid operating plan for fiscal 2020 and exciting growth opportunities across McKesson. I remain confident in our future. Thanks again for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll now hand the call to Holly for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Holly Weiss : Thank you, Brian. We will participate in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference in Las Vegas on May 14, and we will participate in the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference in Southern California on June 11. We look forward to seeing you in the new fiscal year. Thank you and goodbye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining today. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Please go ahead. Holly Weiss : Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and welcome everyone to McKesson's first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation, and to the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides, and is also available on our Web site at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Holly, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our call today. We're please today to be able to report a strong start to our fiscal year 2020. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues in excess of $55 billion, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.31, ahead of our original expectations. On our fourth quarter call, in May, I discussed that we were entering the fiscal year with positive momentum. And I feel really good about this underpinning our first quarter results. We're seeing healthy growth across many parts of our business, which is a direct result of the actions we have been and are taking to execute on our strategic imperatives, which are enabling us to become a more focused and efficient company. And our balance sheet remains strong, giving us the flexibility to deploy capital that can differentiate McKesson and create shareholder value. As a result of our first quarter performance, combined with our confidence in the business as we look ahead, we're raising our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range to $14.00 to $14.60. This is from our previous range of $13.85 to $14.45. Now turning to the business, I'll summarize our first quarter results, and then turn the call over to Britt to elaborate. The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions had a good start to the year, driven by our broad set of specialty biopharmaceutical capabilities focused on both providers and manufacturers. I'm particularly pleased as this demonstrates the progress we're making on one of our three key strategic imperatives. We continue to see biopharma dynamics that are trending in line with our annual guide of mid single-digit price increases on branded drugs. In addition, given our presence in the provider space and particularly oncology, where we are well positioned as biosimilars continue to become prevalent. Talking about generics for a moment, similar to the last few quarters, our ClarusONE sourcing platform continues to deliver yield in line with our expectations. With its scale, we're able to buy at prices that are competitive with our peers. On the sell side, we continue to see a market that is competitive but stable. A few comments on Europe, our U.K. retail business performance was impacted primarily by temporary wide NHS underfunding which we believe should improve in the second-half, and to a lesser extent volume weakness. Performance in the other European countries was not enough to fully offset these challenges. Britt will speak to the expected full-year impact. Before I address the NHS more specifically, let me remind you of the actions we're previously taken in the U.K. and across Europe to reposition the business for long-term profitability. With new leadership at the helm, we're making solid progress towards further rationalizing our store footprint and streamlining our back office functions. And we continue to evaluate our cost structure as we do in all our businesses. Turning back to the NHS, we're pleased by recent announcements, first, to increase the retail tariff, beginning in August. And we would expect to see further upward revisions in tariff later in the year, which should make up partially for any underfunding. The NHS also announced the new five-year Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework. This framework brings greater clarity and long-term certainty by maintaining the current level of industry funding for community pharmacies for the next five years. While certain elements of the funding allocation are yet to be fully defined and could evolve over the five-year time horizon, we view this as an incrementally positive development for our European business. McKesson remains active in its support of and direct discussions with the U.K. government on the future of community pharmacy and healthcare in the U.K. Turning to MedSurg, our Medical-Surgical business continues to generate above-market strong organic growth with its focus on delivering care and low-cost patient setting, and we have now lapped the Medical Specialties Distributor or MSD acquisition, which is delivering results in line with our expectations. We saw good growth across multiple markets and product categories, including Lab, Pharmaceutical, and McKesson Private Label. The non-acute space continues to be an encouraging area for us. Like others in healthcare, we continue to see care shift to these non-acute settings where we currently operate. With investments such as MSD and our new technology in our distribution centers, we're continuing to expand our services to these providers and to their patients. Turning to the other segment, which primarily consists of Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions or MRxTS, and our investment in Change Healthcare, we see improving prescription trends in our owned Canadian retail business which reflects our focus on the retail customer experience. We've made investments in people and in reconfigured pharmacy formats. With strengthening fundamentals, we believe this can reinforce the role that community pharmacy plays in Canadian healthcare. Within MRxTS, we continue to see good growth in CoverMyMeds and the RelayHealth Pharmacy, driven by unique technology offerings that resonate with both our retail and biopharma partners. We continue to make investments in this business to position us for future growth. Change Healthcare achieved an important milestone with the completion of its initial public offering, in June. Britt will speak more about this and what we can expect going forward. We're also investing in platforms that enhance our data and analytics capabilities. We realized benefits across the enterprise in the first quarter, and we expect to see expanding benefit in the future. I now want to touch upon drug pricing reform and the policy landscape. I had the opportunity recently to spend a few days in Washington, D.C. McKesson continues to engage as a key stakeholder in educating policymakers to address issues that may impact patients, our industry, and community-based pharmacy and medical practices, and helping to drive the necessary change to support access, quality, and affordability for a sustainable healthcare system. These objectives align with the administration's goals, and we're committed to continuing the dialogue with policymakers and industry partners on sound, sustainable, and pragmatic solutions. It remains a dynamic environment, yet we remain confident in McKesson's path forward. The critical role of the services we provide to the healthcare industry today, and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to the healthcare system globally. Let me address two of the most recent developments. The Senate Finance Committee published a package of measures last week. We anticipate there might be further modifications as the package makes its way through the legislative process. So at this point we're not in a position to go into great detail on specific provisions. However, we will continue to engage with policymakers and industry partners to ensure that these reforms support the efficiency, sustainability, and security of the supply chain as we seek to improve cost, quality, and access. Finally, earlier today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, announced a Safe Importation Action Plan. Given how recent this announcement is we haven't yet had the full time we'd like to digest or study this plan, but maybe a few just quick preliminary thoughts. Obviously McKesson's presence in both U.S. and Canada gives us a unique perspective on supply chain considerations and the impact to stakeholders and patients as we navigate this complex question of importation. There are legitimate concerns that importation could potentially introduce counterfeit or fraudulent products into the U.S. Importantly, we have a primary responsibility to maintain a safe, secure, and efficient supply chain, and to ensure that we confirm to FDA safety and efficacy standards in addition to the safeguards put in place by the 2013 passage of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. These objectives are paramount as we evaluate the two pathways announced in today's plan. Before I wrap up, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes on the opioid epidemic. We continue to believe distributors are being disproportionally targeted given our important but limited role in the supply chain. Filling orders from licensed pharmacies who are in turn filling prescriptions written by licensed healthcare providers, any suggestion that McKesson drove demand for opioids in this country would reflect a fundamental misunderstanding and mischaracterization of our role as a distributor. We will continue to fight that mischaracterization in the multiple venues, both state and federal, where lawsuits have been filed by thousands of plaintiffs. These are clearly novel, complex, and unprecedented claims that must be navigated. We remain deeply concerned about the impact of this crisis on families and communities across the U.S., and are passionately committed to using McKesson's capabilities to be part of the solutions. This includes partnering with government, industry, social institutions, and other players to help bring this crisis to an end. I've spoken about it before, but let me remind you of the investments we've made and continue to make in our programs, our processes, our technologies dedicated to preventing diversion, and our corporate initiatives, announced last spring, to help [technical difficulty] the epidemic. Those include educating the pharmacies and hospital to whom we deliver about the importance of compliance with the EA Regulation, creating a nationwide clinical alerts system that uses patient prescription history to identify patients at risk of opioid overuse, abuse, addiction or misuse, and actively advocating for public policies that will help address the opioid epidemic. In addition, we contributed $100 million to establish the foundation for opioid response efforts a foundation dedicated solely to driving solutions to the epidemic. I'm proud of our teams and our team members who ensure the safety and security of our supply chain day-in day-out. With that, let me turn the call over to Britt. Britt Vitalone : Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon. McKesson posted another solid quarter and strong start to fiscal 2020. Slides on reviewing with you this afternoon are posted to the Investors section of our website and include our full-year fiscal 2020 guidance assumptions. Today we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $3.31 per diluted share ahead of our original expectations and we're raising the full-year fiscal '20 outlook by $0.15 to a range of $14 to $14.60 per diluted share from our previous outlook of $13.85 to $14.45 per diluted share. Let's move right to our first quarter results. Our first quarter adjusted earnings of $3.31 per diluted share were up 14% year-over-year driven by strong performance in the U.S. pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions business, Medical-Surgical Solutions and our MRxTS businesses. A lower share count higher contribution from our equity investment in Change Healthcare, a one-time gain from investment activities and expense timing. These items were partially offset by the anticipated year-over-year increase in opioid litigation and technology costs which we outlined with our initial outlook in May. Also had a lower profit contribution from the Europe segment and a higher adjusted tax rate. Let me start with the details of our consolidated results, which can be found on slide four. Consolidated revenues for the quarter increased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Adjusted gross profit increased 2% year-over-year, mainly driven by a few key operational items. Within our Medical-Surgical business, the contribution from the MSD acquisition, which we have now lapped, and above market growth in pharmaceutical products, volume growth across our MRxTS offerings, and growth in our specialty provider solutions business within the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, these items were partially offset by foreign currency effects and lower retail pharmacy margins in the U.K. First quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 1% year-over-year partially driven by the acquisition of MSD in the prior year. Adjusted income from operations was $933 million for the quarter, 9% above the prior year. Interest expense was $56 million for the quarter, a decrease of 8% compared to the prior year primarily due to lower commercial paper balances. Our adjusted tax rate was 22.6% for the quarter, mainly driven by our mix of business. We continue to assume a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter to quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. Income attributable to non-controlling interests was $54 million for the quarter, a decrease of 7% compared to the prior year and in line with our expectations. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $625 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were $189 million for the quarter, a decrease of 7% year-over-year. Next, I'll discuss our segment results, which can be found on slides five through eight, and let's start -- I'd like to start with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. First quarter revenues were $44.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year driven by solid contributions from our largest retail national pharmacy customer's, growth across our specialty businesses and continued solid performance within our health systems segment partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 11% to $600 million primarily due to strong growth in our specialty businesses continued strong performance by our sourcing operations and the lapping of prior year opioid-related expenses. As a reminder, the State of New York adopted the Opioid Stewardship Act in the first quarter of McKesson's fiscal 2019. Although the Act was being challenged in court, we recorded an accrual in both our GAAP and adjusted results of $15 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment which accounted for the estimated portion of the annual assessment. This legislation was later ruled unconstitutional and the approval was reversed in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 136 basis points, an increase of four basis points. Next European Pharmaceutical Solutions, first quarter revenues were down 3% year-over-year to $6.7 billion. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 3% driven by our market growth in the distribution wholesale business. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 50% to $37 million on an FX adjusted basis mainly due to the weak retail pharmacy environment in the U.K. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 50 basis points on an FX adjusted basis, a decrease of 55 basis points. Our first quarter results were lower than expectations resulting from weak retail pharmacy margins in the U.K. due to industry-wide underfunding by the NHS. We anticipate this underfunding will modestly improve in the second-half of fiscal 2020. As Brian discussed earlier in fiscal 2019, we took actions in the U.K. and across Europe to reposition the business for long-term profitability. These actions included further store rationalization and cost actions. We continue to execute against these restructuring actions as we further evaluate our cost position. As a result of the U.K. outlook, we now expect European segment adjusted operating profit growth to be on the low end of our original assumption of low to mid single digit percent growth. Moving now to Medical Surgical Solutions, first quarter revenues were $1.9 billion, 12% year-over-year. Excluding the MSD acquisition which closed on June 1 of 2018, segment revenue increased 4% driven by growth in our primary care and Extended Care business including strength in pharmaceutical products and our home delivery business. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 27% to $159 million driven by organic growth in contribution from the MSD acquisition. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 836 basis points an increase of 102 basis points due to market growth and cost management. Finishing our business review with other, revenues were $3 billion for the quarter down 1% year-over-year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues grew 2% primarily by growth in our MRxTS business. Other adjusted operating profit increased 31% to $279 million on an FX adjusted basis mainly driven by increased equity income from our investment in Change Healthcare and continued strength in our MRxTS business. Included in other, adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $108 million for the quarter as compared to $64 million in the prior period. Let me take a minute and update you on our equity investments in Change Healthcare. On June 27 of 2019, Change Healthcare began trading on the NASDAQ. This was an important milestone for Change Healthcare, well Change Healthcare is now a publicly traded company McKesson will continue to report the equity income from our interests in Change Healthcare based on our equity ownership percentage and we will continue to report Change Healthcare results on a one-month lag. As a result of the IPO, McKesson's equity ownership in Change Healthcare is approximately 58.5% effective beginning with McKesson's second quarter. When taking into account McKesson's new equity ownership percentage as well as Change Healthcare's repayment of long-term debt following the completion of its IPO, we anticipate the adjusted equity income attributable to our interest in Change Healthcare in fiscal 2020 to be unchanged from the prior range of $250 million to $270 million which it assumes 70% ownership throughout fiscal 2020. I would point out that our adjusted equity interest assumption for Change Healthcare as well as our future results and commentary on Change Healthcare will be specific to McKesson's ownership interest based on McKesson definition of adjusted earnings, our equity ownership percentage in Change Healthcare and the period from which we are reporting which again will be on a one-month lag. Any questions related to the operating performance or the outlook for Change Healthcare will be addressed by the change management team. The IPO was an important next step in McKesson's efforts to unlock value for our shareholders as we progress towards exiting our investment and Change Healthcare in a tax efficient manner. As we've detailed in the past, there are lockup periods in other milestones, which must be met prior to our exit, which include first the customary six month lockup period following the IPO, then Blackstone or equity partner and Change Healthcare has the opportunity to do a secondary offering, covering up to a three month period, falling that there would be a three month lockup period. Given all of these factors, our exit could extend to a period of 12 to 18 months. However, depending on the necessity of certain milestones, we may have the opportunity to exit by the end of our fiscal 2020. We will provide updates as we progress through the respective lockup periods then milestones, as we move closer to our eventual exit. Moving out of corporate expenses, McKesson recorded a $137 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the first quarter, an increase of 44% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the increase in opioid-related litigation costs, and the overall timing of technology investments in the fiscal year, partially offset by a one-time benefit recorded in the first quarter of approximately $0.10. As it relates to opioid-related litigation costs McKesson recorded $36 million in expenses in the first quarter. We continue to assume opioid-related litigation costs will be approximately $150 million in fiscal 2020. Based on the one-time benefit recorded in the first quarter, we now anticipate corporate expenses to be on the low-end of the original assumption of $725 million to $775 million. Turning now to cash, which can be found on Slide 9, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion. During the quarter, we had negative free cash flow $162 million. This performance was ahead of our expectations. I would remind you the cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter impacted by timing, including the day and a week that marks the close of a quarter. We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $2.8 billion to $3 billion for fiscal 2020. Investment in growth opportunities remains a key priority for McKesson. During the quarter, we made $111 million of capital expenditures and spent $46 million on acquisitions. We continue to focus on internal investment in areas such as data and analytics and information security. We use cash in the quarter to continue returning value to our shareholders. We repurchase $684 million in common stock, and they have $2.8 billion remaining and our share repurchase authorization. We also pay $75 million in dividends in the quarter. And yesterday, the board approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.02 to $0.41, an increase of 5%, which will be payable to shareholders in October. In closing, we are pleased with a strong start to the year. In the first quarter, we had growth across the majority of our businesses, which more than offset the weakness in the retail pharmacy market in the U.K. Our results for the first quarter, which include an unplanned one-time benefit of $0.10, have given us confidence in our full-year fiscal 20 outlook. As a result, we're increasing our adjusted earnings guidance of $0.15 cents to a range of $14 to $14.60 per diluted share, which represents solid growth of approximately 5% at the midpoint versus fiscal 2019. I would remind you that we do not provide quarterly guidance. However, to better inform your modeling. We continue to expect a percentage of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first-half of the year as compared to the second-half to be similar to fiscal '19. Overall, we're pleased with the focus. The execution of the performance across the company and we are off to a great start at fiscal 2020 and with that Brian and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much, and good afternoon. Congratulations on a nice start to the year. Brian, I know that it just came out, you know, this new safe [ph] importation action plan, but just being in Canada, how realistic is this that the manufacturers are going to allow product to go to Canada, then come back to the U.S., and just given the size of the Canadian market. And what role do you think that McKesson can play as the largest distributor in Canada to make sure that, one, product that meant for Canada stays in Canada? And two, anything that does potentially come to the States is safe? Brian Tyler : Thank you, Lisa, for the question. We do think McKesson is in a uniquely informed position given our business in Canada and our presence here in the U.S., obviously. There were two tracks discussed in the plan that came out today. I will say I was encouraged by the fact that it was an invitation for industry and industry participants to bring their perspectives and knowledge into the discussion. And we will plan to be actively engaged in that. So our first and foremost responsibility and priority will be the safety and security of the supply chain, both in the U.S. and in Canada. Now, you rightly point out the Canadian market, from a population standpoint is less than a 10th of the U.S., and I suppose that various manufacturers will adopt various perspectives on what they may or may not do. We will carefully evaluate with various industry partners what the opportunity may be. But the overarching goal will be safety and security for citizens both north and south of a Canadian-U.S. border. Lisa Gill : And then just as a follow-up, clearly what they're trying to solve first here is overall drug pricing. Can you talk about what we saw in the quarter around drug price inflation on the brand inside as well as the generic, clearly quarterly results coming better and better, especially on the drug distribution in the U.S. component of the business? So just wondering some of the key drivers there, as well as what you're seeing on both inflation and deflation in generics and branded? Britt Vitalone : Thanks for that question, Lisa. I'll start, and Brian can add. As we talked about, in Brian's remarks on the branded side, what we saw from an inflation perspective was right along in line with our expectations. As you know, the first quarter is generally a softer quarter for branded inflation historically. And what we saw this quarter was really in line with our expectations. And as we think about the full-year, we are reaffirming our guidance of mid single-digit inflation on the branded side. On the generic side, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our sourcing operation, ClarusONE. What we've seen thus far in terms of our sourcing performance is right in line with our expectations. And on the sell side, as Brian mentioned, we continue to see a competitive market, but we continue to see a stable market. And so we're pleased with our ability to continue to source very competitively, which is certainly benefiting our customers, and we're certainly pleased with the ability to bring that to the sell side and our customers. Lisa Gill : Great. Thanks for the comments. Operator : And next will be Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good evening. Thanks for all the comments so far. Britt, I want to dive in a little bit more into the U.S. pharma performance, maybe a microcosm for the rest of the business. It seems like just given the sheer magnitude of the performance and the outperformance on revenue, relative to at least your guidance, that a lot of it had to be driven by pharma. That being said, we didn't see a ton of gross margin pull-through. Now I might be splitting hairs a little bit here, but can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics in terms of what was the rationale for the slower gross profit growth relative to the revenue growth? Britt Vitalone : Sure. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in my comments, some of the revenue growth that we saw came from some of our largest national retail customers. And as you might expect, they don't generate as great a contribution to gross profit. We did see broad-based strong performance across the segment, not only with our largest national retail customers, but we saw good performance in our Health Systems segment, and we continue to see very strong performance in our Specialty business, and so we're quite pleased with that. Overall in the segment, while our gross profit was lower on a consolidated basis, within our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions segment we saw very good performance at the adjusted operating profit line. So, we're very pleased with the performance that we saw, very broad-based performance across that segment. And we think that we're well positioned to continue and achieve our guidance for the rest of the year. Michael Cherny : And just on the contribution from Change. The way to think about the fact that the numbers didn't change despite the fact that you had a lower ownership stake versus guidance simply driven by the outperformance contribution for 1Q, or is there anything else that changed in terms of just the methodology, aside from just the pure less ownership stake? Britt Vitalone : I would say that it's a combination of the lower ownership stake being offset by the deleveraging that changed it as a result of raising the funds for the IPO. Michael Cherny : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thanks for taking my call. A question around the guidance, you beat by by $0.30. You only guide it up by $0.15. I know you mentioned the EU business is now expected to be at the lower end of the range. You also mentioned corporate expenses are going to be lower. Is there any other deltas there, is this conservatism. How should we think about the guidance relative to the beat in the quarter? Britt Vitalone : Sure. So, I think there's a couple of things there, Kevin. First of all, we had good performance. We also called out a one-time gain from investment activities that is within our corporate expenses, that was about $0.10. So, while we had strong performance across really a broad base of our businesses, we did see weaker performance in our European business, and we did lower the range for the full-year as a result of that. We had the one-time unplanned benefit. We had some favorable timing in our corporate expense line. Again -- and we called out at the beginning of the year, we intend to continue making investments in our business both on a data and analytic side and in a technology side. So, we had strong broad-based performance across the business. We had a one-time gain within our corporate expense line. And I think it's early in the year, but we feel very confident, and confident enough to raise by $0.15. Kevin Caliendo : Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the Medical segment, you give us the revenues ex MSD they would have been up 4%. What would the EBIT growth have been ex MSD in medical as we're not lapping it, just to give us a little bit of a better view of sort of what that business might look like going forward? Britt Vitalone : Yes, we don't break that down specifically, Kevin, but what I would tell you is we had strong organic performance within that business. And as I mentioned, we had strong pharmaceutical sales performance as well as continued strong performance in our home delivery business. So we're pleased with the overall performance of the segment. We're pleased with the execution against the MSD acquisition. And as I mentioned, across the broad base of that business we had growth in pharmaceuticals, we had growth in our primary care business, as well as our home delivery business, so good organic growth as well as the MSD contribution. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi, good evening. So the first question here on the guidance. Obviously you had a very good performance on the top line. But when we look at your U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions guidance for the remainder of the year, it would suggest that revenues are going to normalize, where we're getting to around plus 4% to negative 1% on the revenue. And on the operating profit as well, kind of like a negative 2% to about 3.3% growth. So was there any kind of like pull forward of revenues this quarter that's going to normalize for the remainder of the year, or what kind of like drove that strength? I understand it is your largest customers, but if you can give us some more color behind that? Britt Vitalone : Sure, thanks, Ricky. There's nothing unusual about the revenue development in the quarter, there's nothing that I would call out as a pull forward, to use your terminology. And we had very strong performance. It was primarily in our largest retail national accounts. But again, as I mentioned, we had a broad base of revenue growth across the business. One thing I would point out about our adjusted operating profit for the quarter, as I talked about in my opening remarks, last year we did have the opioid litigation cost that were included in that segment's results. And as I mentioned, we recorded $15 million last year for the New York State assessment. So I think you should factor that in. We're very pleased with the performance. We continue to expect to see growth in this segment for the remainder of the year. And we're very pleased with the revenue development. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. So let me ask a follow-up on specialty and think this is kind of like the third quarter both you and your peers are highlighting the strength in specialty is benefiting results. So can you just share with us little bit more color on specialty and whether you've seen any contractual changes in the last year that would explain the improvement in benefit because I'm assuming it's not coming from branded inflation. So how should we think about it benefit and how should we think about the sustainability of that benefit. And I think that historically you talked about specialty margin is being below traditional branded drugs. Is that still the case or should we assume that margins have re-rated higher? Brian Tyler : I'll take this one and Britt can jump in if he'd like. So when you think about the Specialty as a segment and obviously the pipeline of innovation continues to be heavily slanted towards these types of products. In full legacy core U.S. pharma business, the margin profiles and structures you'd be accustomed to, I would characterize as still being in place and so while we do benefit from that specialty growth through good volumes and it is beneficial for us on the gross profit line, it does continue to be modestly dilutive to the rate. I would remind you though we also have a very good business in the community setting related to specialty products and that's both our U.S. oncology network and our unaffiliated community provider business. And those are the businesses where we continue to see really good momentum, really good growth and benefit from the pipeline of both innovative products and frankly biosimilars as they emerge and come to market. And we have a very robust value proposition obviously a complete value proposition in the case of U.S. oncology. And then a wide assortment of tools and services we offer to the unaffiliated community providers and we think that that value proposition continues to earn us the right and the ability to grow and to benefit from the Specialty Pharmaceutical pipeline in general. Operator : And next will be Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Good afternoon, guys. So I just wanted to go back to kind of the change in other math again because I don't think I have it straight. So in terms of the $108 million versus the prior year and then and that's for Change and then sort of the full-year guide I'm not sure I understand sort of what caused the up step and cadence and then sort of the notable downside. I know the ownership percentage is changing but it still seemed like a big delta and I'm guessing that's essentially what caused the spike in the other segment profits. I'm just trying to figure out sort of why that cadence was kind of funkier than what I think one would have expected? Brian Tyler : Sure. Thanks for the question, Ross. So let me start with just the other side of the other segment just generally. With that segment we have our Canadian business we have our MRxTS businesses which are very strong businesses and growing very well for us. And we have our Change, our equity investment in Change. First I'd point out that our Canadian business continues to perform well, we certainly talked about the impact from the generic legislation at the beginning of the year. And that team really did a great job in mitigating that. And we're pleased with the performance of Canada, our MRxTS businesses continue to grow very well and we're making invest -- continue to make investments in those businesses. Within our Change asset, we did have the ownership Change from 70% to 58.5% effective in our second quarter. And in that second quarter, you'll also see the impact from the delevering. Within the first quarter though, there are a couple of things that I would point out. First of all Change had as most companies had the implementation of the revenue recognition standard and that created a timing element for the year. For the full-year that's not going to have an impact on McKesson but it does have an impact earlier, favorable impact earlier than year and then a reverse out as the year goes on. And then of course as you think about that business, there's a mix of income between taxable, non-taxable depending on the legal entity. So what I would say is primarily for the first quarter, you see some timing impact from the revenue recognition standard and you see a mix of income between the entities of taxable and non-taxable. Ross Muken : Got it. And then maybe just thinking about sort of, maybe business development activity or the M&A side of things, a lot of things and services, including your own asset, obviously have challenging multiples. And there's a lot of political wins going on, I guess, how do you sort of frame what's the right time to be more active again, on sort of tuck-in M&A and how the risk reward sort of, is there versus just continuing to buy your own equity, which given is cash flow yield seems like a reasonable investment. Brian Tyler : Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question. And I think we would characterize our M&A activity in recent quarters of being relatively light, that doesn't mean that we're out of that space. And then, I think when we think about capital allocation, and we're always very focused on where are the opportunities to deploy capital to build platforms and businesses and services for sustainable growth over the long-term. We are being very diligent to make sure that as we look at this process that is guided by our strategy, that's guided by our focal areas, it's guided by the markets and segments where we think we have good businesses, strong teams, the right to win. And anywhere in those segments, we can find assets that are complimentary and accelerate and an accelerant to our business. We're quite interested in those. We obviously consider alternative use of the capital and return of the capital in making those calculations and final determinations of what's the best way to deploy that capital on behalf of our shareholders. So we continue to be active, we continue to be in deal flow. We continue to look carefully at the landscape with an eye to make sure it's aligned strategically that it's an investment and accelerant. And that it is the smartest way to deploy capital across the various uses of capital we have. Ross Muken : Thanks, guys. Operator : And moving on to Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the sell side environment. You said in the past that in general your contracts last about three years. So it appears to be coming up against some of the independent pharmacy contracts that renewed during 2016. Can you give us, and hopefully give us a sense of what proportion of those contracts have been addressed at this point? And also any color you can write on with the discussions look like in terms of helping your pharmacy partners deal with the pressure they are under would be very helpful, thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes, so typically, as we've talked about, we would renew roughly a third of our contracts in any one given year. We recently got through two big retail national account renewals successfully, which was great news and I'd say, I'd characterize this year is having a fairly normal portfolio of renewals and renewal activities. So I wouldn't point to anything particularly unusual in that regard. You know, we work with our partners over the life of these contracts. We are typically engaging in, day-to-day and discussions; we begin conversations well in advance of any sort of sudden renewal activity. So we really view it as kind of an ongoing dialogue and an ongoing partnership over the course of these contracts. And you'll be well familiar with our track record of renewing these particularly larger deals as it relates to independence in general and what are we doing to help independence? I would say independence is probably long been at the core of McKesson as a company. It's a key part of our commitment that community practices we think being central to addressing the access cost and quality issues this country faces the independence -- continue to benefit from the programs and services that we invest in. They can hence, they can choose to consume that and a sort of all-encompassing way through a relationship with Health Mart and our access reimbursement services that come along with that. But we are constantly looking at how we innovate for them both and how they interact with their patients, how they attract patients and draw footfall to their stores, how they monetize that footfall, both in front and behind the counter, and we work with them, day-in and day-out and then just the efficiency of the operation of their business. Community pharmacy today feels reimbursement pressure, it's felt that pressure every year, I've been in the business and that's almost 23 years now. So we partner with them very closely to help them ensure their position to survive and adapt and innovate and independent community pharmacies do tend to be creative individual business folks who find ways to unmet needs in the communities they serve. Stephen Baxter : Okay, thanks. I appreciate the color. And then just one quickly on capital deployment and the pacing of share repurchase, so it looks like if you carry this magnitude of share repurchase through the balance of the year, you'd end up with something a few million shares below where your guidance is which looks like 185 million shares unchanged versus previous, so I was wondering if you could help us understand the progression of share repurchase and how you guys approach the balance between opportunism and planned activity throughout the year. Thanks. Brian Tyler : Yes, thanks for the question. I would just reaffirm that we've not changed our assumption on our diluted shares for the end of the year. We don't have a set amount that you should think about for modeling to take it from quarter-to-quarter. We think about capital deployment and as Brian mentioned, we think about it opportunities on strategy and where we have opportunities to invest on strategy or invest internally, we do that. And certainly, we've had an opportunity this quarter to return more to our shareholders. So we make those decisions on a regular basis, but in terms of our guide on shares for the end of the year, we've not changed that. Operator : And our next question will come from Eric Percher with Nippon Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. I'd like to go back to the gross margin question and maybe given the comments around independents I know that was one segment that hasn't been driving the same contribution that some of the other areas, the retail nationals and other less profitable accounts maybe as you think about the growth in revenue and what that translates into had a press profit growth level at a period of time where independents aren't driving it and a period of time where generic contributions aren't as high what do you see as the and natural growth rate? Brian Tyler : Well, Eric, what I would point to is if you look at our consolidated gross margin, there is multiple factors to consider in here and one of the things that impacted our gross margin in the quarter was the weak retail results in our U.K. business within Europe. And clearly, we had a large proportion of revenue being driven by our largest retail national account. We have, we had a very broad base of revenue growth across our business and overall I would just say that one of the things that impacted to the negative side was not only the mix of revenue, but the impact from a weak retail environment in the U.K. We think about our independent customers within U.S. Pharma. We haven't seen anything different this quarter from the previous couple of quarters. It was -- I don't know that there's anything really to call out specific about that. Britt Vitalone : Yes, when we look at the kind of reimbursement environment that retail independents are facing, I think we talked last quarter about the fact that we look at our data, we really see an aggregate a very normal headwind there has been established something that's kind of been consistent with prior years. And on average, that is true statement within that average there are based on patient mix and contracts that the government private commercial product mix and the really the patient population in your in catchment area, you can see some winners and some losers. But on a blended way is really feels like a steady the same steady reimbursement headwind we've been accustomed to. Eric Percher : So I think we see that and certainly the headwind in international gross margin is evident, but my question is really where we don't see at a distribution and specialty segment level, what are your thoughts on the ability to drive gross profit growth relative to revenue growth and that's really the question was getting at? Brian Tyler : Well, as we've talked about previously, Eric the growth of specialty products is going to have a dilutive impact on the rate. It's certainly very good for us from a margin dollars perspective as I think about that the U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions business, again, it's a business that is broad-based from a distribution perspective, both in the nature of the products in the customers, but also the specialty businesses that Brian talked about our U.S. oncology asset, our provider base that we have and also the manufacturing life capabilities that the services that we provide to the manufacture those also add to our gross margin profile. So, and I think about our distribution business is very scale certainly is impacted by the product mix, but the fact that it's broad-based in terms of our U.S. Oncology asset or other specialty assets and then our manufacturing services assets, I think that really does give us the opportunity to develop that gross profit over time. Eric Percher : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning guys. Congratulations. Britt just want to follow-up on Ricky's question from earlier clarify that question again. So you put up an 8% growth number in the U.S. for Q1 and yet you're maintaining the guidance calling low to mid single digits. So is there anything we should be thinking about that could drive a deceleration in growth. I mean you've talked about specialty being strong or is there anything to call out there? Britt Vitalone : Yes, I would the thing that I would point out is I think we saw a larger proportion of revenue from our largest retail national accounts in the quarter. We still expect to see very strong revenue growth in the mid single digit range for the year. I think as you just think about the quarterization of that, we saw it a larger proportion of that coming from our largest accounts and that had obviously a very favorable impact in the quarter. Brian Tanquilut : Got it. All right, thanks guys. Britt Vitalone : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question will come from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess similar one Britt on the corporate expense side. You're pointing towards the lower end but just looking at where you ended up in the quarter, it still seems like quite a big ramp through the year to get there. Anything you know of or that you anticipate on the corporate expense side that it would be terribly different than what we saw in the quarter. And then I guess Brian just I'll throw my follow-up out there. I'm sorry if I missed this in the prepared remarks but large proposed generic merger out there. Curious if or how impactful that would be on not only ClarusONE but on McKesson in general if you had a view that would be great. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Brian as we think of our corporate expenses at the beginning of the year, we talked about the things that are driving the higher corporate expense year-over-year. We talked about the increase in opioid litigation costs. We talked about the increased investments that we were making in technology particularly infrastructure and data and analytics. We still intend to make those investments throughout the year. We had a favorable timing related impact in the first quarter but our intention is to continue to invest in those capabilities as we go throughout the rest of the year. We also in my remarks, I talked about our opioid litigation cost projection for the full-year still remaining at $150 million. And then the thing that I did talk about that is included on our corporate expenses was the onetime benefit we had from investing activities which reduced our corporate expenses in the quarter and that allowed us to take our guide corporate expenses down to the low end of the range that we provided at the beginning of the year. Brian Tyler : Robert to your second question, we actually did not comment on this, I think in our opening remarks. So thank you for the question on the Pfizer-Mylan merger. So I would start by saying that these we have strong relationships with both of these organizations and they've been important partners for us. And if McKesson and in ClarusONE the rationale for the merger as I understand it is broadening of the portfolio, there is some cost synergy, some efficiency and frankly at the scale that we operate and by being partners with large scale healthy organizations that are capable of continuity of supply and competitive pricing is it can be a good thing. So we'll evaluate how this merger comes together. We'll continue to be a dialog with them but it wouldn't say it poses any imminent concerns from our perspective. Operator : And our next question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Charles Rhyee : Yes, hey thanks for taking questions. I think you touched on biosimilars being a benefit particularly in the oncology network. Can you talk about sort of your outlook here? I think there's some talks about I think insulin moving over to jurisdiction by the -- I guess with the biologics group and FDA, CIBR and that that could pave the way for interchangeability on at least with biosimilars insulin. Maybe your thoughts on where you're seeing sort of that regulatory landscape right now and how you think about that opportunity and what it means further down the road for you? Brian Tyler : Well, I mean the biosimilar landscape in general, we feel pretty positive about more choices more substitute ability or interchangeability that gives clinician, the more choices hopefully gives it helps addressed cost challenges we see in the marketplace and we think with the footprint of providers that we have in the community, we're particularly well positioned to take advantage of those trends. So, we also continue to work with innovators, first and foremost, as we think about these if the patient outcome is a clinical-oriented decision is what product is best in the formulary to meet the clinical needs to the extent, there are a variety of choices and interchangeability that tends to be good for a company like us with the markets and channels that we serve that choice tends to be a positive thing for us. Charles Rhyee : Is that something that you think is coming close in that you're trying to plan ahead of that or is that you feel there is still a ways off? Brian Tyler : It's really hard to comment on what the regulatory pathways will be and timing and our recent experience in policy arena tells us anything, it's very difficult to forecast. What may come out, lots of discussion what they come out ultimately and what it may look like in its final form it would be, it would probably not be in my best judgment to try to predict that for you. Charles Rhyee : Okay, fair enough. And just one last question, you talked about the FX impact being sort of net neutral but if I look, it seems like, particularly the pound and the euro have been getting weaker relative to the dollar, how are you guys thinking about that or sort of what your expectations around that. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes, I don't want to predict the direction of the pound. On a consolidated basis, it doesn't have a material impact. But as I called out, it did have an impact on revenues within the Europe segment for the quarter. So, obviously we'll watch that very carefully but as we think about it on a consolidated basis, we don't see an impact. Charles Rhyee : Great, thank you. Holly Weiss : Operator, you have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly that question will come from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. Eric Coldwell : Hi, thanks very much and good evening. Most of my main ones recovered but I'll shift gears a bit, I would like your thoughts on generic introductions for the rest of the year if possible, expected to be a good guy or a bad guy to profitability on a year-over-year basis and then specifically if I dare ask Lyrica comes out with roughly 10 manufacturer is a very low initial price. How did that impact pretty big product, how does that impact your thinking on generic profitability in trends in that market seen so many manufacturers launch it such a deep discount to the brand. Brian Tyler : Yes, thanks for that question. Generic launches as we've talked about do not have the size of impact that they used to have -- they have a modest impact on our profitability. So we don't see that having any change from our previous views on that. In terms of Lyrica, we are very fortunate to have a strong sourcing organization like first one where we can partner with multiple manufacturers. We don't see that Lyrica is going to change the direction of our generics profitability will certainly be a benefit for us and it will certainly be a benefit from our customers, but it will have a modest impact at most. Eric Coldwell : Great. Brian Tyler : Well, thank you everyone for your questions, and thank you, Justin for facilitating this call. I want to thank everyone on the call today for your time. McKesson is off to a strong start for our fiscal 2020 and I'm really excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I do want to take a minute to recognize the outstanding performance of really all of the McKesson employees and team members and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities, make better health possible. So thank you team McKesson. Have a good evening everyone. Operator : Well, thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

Please go ahead. Holly Weiss : Thank you, Susan. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our call today. Today, we reported second quarter total company revenues of $57.6 billion. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.60, which was in line with our expectations, and when excluding the $0.33 prior year benefit from the reversal of a contractual liability associated with McKesson's investment in Change Healthcare, second quarter results per diluted share increased more than 10% year-over-year. Our first half fiscal 2020 results give us confidence in our reaffirmed fiscal 2020 full-year outlook of $14 to $14.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share. This continues to reflect year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth in each of our segments. Before I go deeper into our second quarter results, I want to take a few minutes to discuss one topic I know is top of mind for everyone and that is opioid litigation. Last week, McKesson along with two other distributors, reached a collective $215 million settlement with two Ohio Counties, Cuyahoga and Summit in the first track of the multi-district opioid litigation. McKesson's portion of the settlement was $82 million which was recorded in our second quarter results. We strongly dispute the allegations made by these two counties. However, settling the bellwether trial was in our view an important stepping stone to achieving a broad resolution to opioid litigation and to accelerating relief efforts for the people and communities impacted by this public health crisis. Over the next few months, we will be working hard with other parties on the settlement framework that includes States and their subdivisions. While we have made good progress, there are many details and variables that remain open and still needs to be addressed. We are optimistic that a broad resolution can be achieved and that remains our goal. All along, we've said the goal is to ring-fence the risk. However, to the extent the broad resolution settlement framework is unsuccessful; McKesson is prepared and continues to be prepared to litigate and to vigorously defend the mischaracterization that our company drove demand for opioids in this country. The litigation process if necessary will be costly and can take many years to conclude causing a significant and substantial delay to crisis mitigation efforts. I've stated this before, McKesson remains firmly committed to being part of the broader solution to this crisis. And while I appreciate there are many, many questions on this topic, given that discussions are ongoing, we will be somewhat limited in what we can say, and I'm sure you can appreciate this, and we thank you for your understanding. I also want to provide a brief update on our Board of Directors. In mid-October, our Board of Directors welcomed Maria Martinez as a new Independent Director. Maria has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Experience Officer for Cisco since April, 2018. She brings deep experience in customer experience, technology and innovation, which we look forward to benefiting from. Maria's appointment, in addition to Ken Washington joining our Board of Directors in July, demonstrates our continuing commitment to refresh our Board and add valuable expertise and new perspectives. Now let's get to the business results and share why I am so confident in McKesson's positioning and our outlook. If you step back from a macro perspective, trends continue to support growth in healthcare. We have an aging population as well as increase in chronic conditions. We are also seeing growth in innovative specialty medicines. The pipeline is rich with such medicines, including biosimilars. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment reflected solid execution in the quarter against this macro backdrop. Branded pricing is tracking in line with our fiscal 2020 assumption of mid-single-digit price increases. For generics, consistent with prior quarters, our ClarusONE Sourcing venture is performing in line with expectations and the sell-side remains competitive, but stable. Independent pharmacies continue to demonstrate resiliency and remain an important customer of McKesson. Recently our McKesson RxOwnership team partnered with the National Community Pharmacist Association to sponsor it's 10th annual Ownership Workshops Series. RxOwnership supports the future of pharmacy ownership by giving pharmacists the knowledge, the support, and the tools required to achieve their ownership goals. In the past year, RXOwnership assisted more than 725 owners in launching a new pharmacy and since 2008, our team aided in the ownership or transfer process of roughly 6,000 community pharmacies. We are proud of the long-term investments we've made in helping independent pharmacies deliver exceptional care to their patients and communities. I am also pleased with the strength we continue to see from our Specialty businesses where we have a broad array of assets and capabilities. When I talk about our Specialty businesses, I'm largely referring to our Provider Solutions and Practice Management businesses that serve the community setting, primarily in oncology, but also in other ologies like ophthalmology, rheumatology and neurology, and our life sciences business that leverage our provider footprint and differentiated services to drive solutions upstream for our manufacturer partners. These businesses are organized in three strategic areas. First, Provider Solutions which is the largest of the three businesses, includes the distribution and GPO services that are core to McKesson and to the needs of our physician customers. Also in this business, we have technology and tools that enhance value-based care delivery and products and services to help expand practice revenue. Next is the practice management business. We discussed the U.S. Oncology Network quite often. This organization supports more than 1,400 physicians across 450 sites of service. We provide a unique value proposition which allows the physician to remain independent, while utilizing McKesson services and staff to ensure the practice is running efficiently and effectively. This allows the physician to focus his or her time on treating patients. McKesson has 15 practices in the U.S. Oncology Network that are participating in the Oncology Care Model or OCM. The centers for Medicaid and Medicaid innovation recently released results for the fourth performance period related to the OCM. I'm pleased to report that all 15 practices earn high marks for quality performance. The practices improved care and provided an enhanced patient experience and also saved Medicare approximately $35 million during the performance period as compared to the established benchmark. We are committed to ensuring that community practices have access to all the resources necessary, including access to clinical trials to successfully accomplish the challenging practice transformation required by the OCM and the other value-based alternative payment models. The third business is our McKesson life sciences business. This business includes third party logistics, specialty pharmacy solutions for oncology and other rare and orphan products, patient access, adherence and affordability solutions, clinical education services, and a suite of data services providing commercial insights and real world evidence. These services help ensure biopharma manufacturers are successful in the post-launch commercialization of their products. These three businesses are well-positioned as innovative specialty products, including biosimilars are coming to the market and McKesson is often the partner of choice throughout the lifecycle of a therapy. As you can see, two of our strategic imperatives, supporting specialty and the manufacturer services value proposition are underpinned by the strong portfolio of our existing offerings. And we consistently look at ways to expand those offerings and create new value-added services for our customers. We are investing in these businesses, specifically in the areas of oncology and biopharma services. We're making these investments in order to further expand our capabilities and support our future growth. Let me turn now to Europe. As a reminder, last quarter in our UK Retail business, we experienced industry-wide underfunding by the NHS. Consistent with our expectations in July, we did see a nominal tariff increase in the month of August. And we do expect a further upward tariff revision later this fiscal year, which should result in a partial recovery of the underfunding we've experienced year-to-date. Outside of the UK, in Europe, we continue to see in aggregate year-to-date performance in line with our expectations for that segment. Britt will discuss our full-year outlook for the segment in a few minutes. A few words on our Medical-Surgical business. We continue to see above market growth as we operate in strong markets and care shifts out of the hospital to alternate sites of care. McKesson has a full range of products and services for our physician, health system, post-acute and home care provider customers. So we can serve their needs comprehensively and our customer benefit from our enterprise mindset as our MedSurg team partners closely with our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions business to ensure physicians received the pharmaceuticals they need to run their practices. This continues to be an area of growth for our business. And the MSD acquisition, which we fully lapped in the first quarter, is on track with its plan integration as we worked to consolidate the business and position ourselves to effectively scale. Turning to the other segment, which primarily consist of Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions or MRxTS and our investment in Change Healthcare. As we evaluate ways to further leverage the scale and expertise of our businesses. In Canada, we've recently streamlined our leadership team structure into a retail and wholesale operations focus. We've introduced two new Senior Vice President Physicians responsible for leading the core operating businesses of retail, which includes digital and loyalty programs and our distribution solutions and specialty health business in Canada. This strategic change will enable our Canadian operations to work even better together as we deepen relationships with manufacturers and retail partners and drive real value for patients. I believe we have the right talent to move the Company forward and contribute to a better healthcare system for all Canadians. Moving on to MRxTS. The business continues to show strong growth in both new and existing products. In addition, our CoverMyMeds business, which is focused on electronic prior authorization, continues to innovate across the organization. During the quarter, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads by McKesson announced the launch of AMP, which stands for Access for More Patients, a first-in-class technology driven patient support solution that transforms how patients access afford and adhere to their medications. This collaboration brings together the robust technology platform and established provider network of CoverMyMeds with the deep specialty experience and commercialization expertise of RxCrossroads by McKesson and is designed to automate access to specialty medications for physicians and patients. The traditional hub model has had complex requirements and in many times relied on time consuming manual processes, which typically delay treatment sometimes significantly. In our pilot case study, McKesson's AMP solution enabled patients across the U.S. to access their specialty medications 27% faster than traditional hub programs. Fundamentally improving the way patient support is provided. AMP also provides high-touch services for patient cases that need intervention support beyond the automated technology platform, such as proactive clinical support, behavioral coaching and financial assistance, improving adherence and helping to support better outcomes for patients. We're very excited about this cross collaboration as it again exemplifies our mission to improve patient care by providing innovative offerings and demonstrates the value of our McKesson team and our broad set of capabilities. This represents another example of how we're investing in our differentiated businesses. Let's move on to Change Healthcare. Our value-creating transaction with Change Healthcare provided McKesson with a cash payment upfront that allowed us to retain 70% ownership of the new company. It created a scaled healthcare, software and analytics, and technology enabled services company that will unlock the value of our legacy MTS businesses. We have begun activities to exit the investment in the next 6 months to 12 months in a tax efficient manner. This drove certain charges that impacted our results for the second quarter. Britt will walk you through these accounting details later in the call. In the Change Healthcare transaction, we found a way to create value while exiting businesses that weren't core to our McKesson strategy. It's a great example of how McKesson regularly evaluates our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of assets for the present, but also for the future. I'm very pleased by the execution across our businesses in the second quarter. That execution included the impact of our cost savings initiatives across the enterprise. Britt will get into more of the details, but I think from my remarks you can see evidence of not only the savings efforts, but the partnership across the businesses and overall cultural change happening across the organization. For example, we centralize our IT organization, implementing a center-led hub model to increase efficiency. In MedSurg, I talked about the partnership with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment to ensure physicians receive the pharmaceuticals they need to run their practice in an easy way. And in MRxTS, I talked about the partnership with RxCrossroads business to launch AMP. Overall, we're evolving behaviors as it relates to company collaboration and spending and are focused on moving with speed in an ever-changing healthcare landscape. We're building upon our strong culture, leveraging our diverse perspective to make decisions with an enterprise first team McKesson mindset. I feel confident in the execution I've seen across our businesses in the first half of fiscal 2020 and I feel great about the future of McKesson. And with that, let me turn the call over to Britt to go over the financials and some of the details I alluded to. Britt? Britt Vitalone : Thanks, Brian, and good morning. I'll begin with a few comments in second quarter results, including changes to our guidance for you to consider as you update your models. We were pleased with our adjusted earnings per diluted share results in the second quarter, which were in line with consensus and grew 10% over the prior year when excluding a one-time $90 million benefit in FY 2019. Our performance to the first half of fiscal 2020 was solid, and we are pleased with the momentum across the business and we're reiterating our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings outlook of $14 to $14.60 per diluted share. Updated guidance assumptions can be found in our second quarter earnings slides posted to the investors section of our website. Before we get into the details of the results, I want to address two items that impacted our GAAP only results. First, we've concluded it\u2019s the appropriate time to exit our remaining stake in Change Healthcare and we begun activities expected to lead to an exited the investment, which we anticipate will occur within the next 6 months to 12 months. As we previously communicated, we will execute this transaction in a tax efficient manner and we expect that this transaction will continue to deliver value to McKesson's shareholders. We believe that this transaction better positions McKesson to focused on its core set of businesses. As part of this work, we completed a market value assessment and recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $1.2 billion in our fiscal 2020 second quarter. It's important to note this charge in no way reflects the future value of Change Healthcare. Rather, it's an adjustment of the book value to the current market value from one of the necessary accounting activities within the planned exit process. Overall, the Change Healthcare transaction has been and continues to be value creating from McKesson's shareholders. Second, as Brian mentioned earlier, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $82 million after settling all claims against McKesson and the suits filed by Cuyahoga and Summit counties of Ohio in the first track of the multi-district opioid litigation. Moving to the adjusted earnings results for the quarter. On Slide 3 of the presentation, our second quarter adjusted earnings of $3.60 per diluted share was flat year-over-year. As a reminder in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, McKesson recorded a $90 million or $0.33 per diluted share pretax benefit related to the reversal of contractual liability associated with our investment in Change Healthcare. Excluding this one-time item, second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 10% driven by a lower share count and growth in the Medical-Surgical and Prescription Technology or MRxTS businesses. Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.91, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Excluding the previously mentioned one-time benefit in FY2019, year-to-date adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 12% year-over-year. Moving to the details of our consolidated results on Slide 4. Consolidated revenues for the quarter increased 9% year-over-year, due to higher than anticipated growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment in part related to increase Caremark volumes associated with the on-boarding of a new customer. Taking this into account, we are updating our consolidated revenues guidance from low-to-mid single-digit growth to mid-to-high single-digit percentage growth year-over-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 2% year-over-year or 3% on an FX adjusted basis, mainly driven by strong Primary Care pharmaceutical volumes within our Medical-Surgical segment, continued growth in our Specialty Providers Solutions business within our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment, and growth across our existing MRxTS offerings, principally within our electronic prior authorization products. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 5% year-over-year. Excluding the prior year $90 million contractual liability reversal, operating expenses increased 2.5% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. Adjusted income from operations before tax was $859 million for the quarter, 6% below the prior year. However, excluding the one-time prior year $90 million benefit, adjusted income from operations before tax increased 4%. Interest expense was $64 million for the quarter, a decrease of 3% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate was 17% for the quarter, which included discrete tax benefits of approximately $31 million, and we continue to assume a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize in the back half of the fiscal year. During the quarter, we completed $750 million of share repurchases and our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding were $184 million for the quarter, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. As a result of share repurchase activity this year, we're updating our guidance to diluted weighted-average shares of approximately $184 million for the year. Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Slides 6 through 9. I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Second quarter revenues were $46 billion, up 10% year-over-year driven by branded pharmaceutical price increases and the previously mentioned increase in Caremark volumes, which were largely specialty products and were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Based on the revenue development in the first half of the fiscal year, we are updating our guidance to revenue growth of high single-digits. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 1% year-over-year to $641 million due to continued growth in our Specialty businesses led by the Provider Solutions business, partially offset by customer and product mix, which includes the new customer volumes that are flowing through Caremark. Year-to-date, segment adjusted operating profit growth is 6%. As Brian discussed, we have differentiated assets and capabilities in the areas of oncology and manufacturer services. As such, we will be investing an incremental $25 million in the second half of the year to extend these leading positions. Inclusive of these additional investments, we are reiterating our adjusted operating profit guidance of low-to-mid single-digit percent growth for the full-year. Next, European Pharmaceutical Solutions. Second quarter revenues were down 1% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues grew 4% in line with our original expectations, driven by market growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution business. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 23% to $41 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit was $43 million, down 19% due to continued weakness in the UK retail pharmacy environment. As Brian mentioned, we are expecting partial recovery of the underfunding we experienced year-to-date by the NHS, and while we continue to anticipate improvement in the second half of fiscal 2020, we are however, updating our full-year guidance for Europe. Our updated revenue guidance is flat to low single-digit percentage decline and adjusted operating profit growth in the low single-digits. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Second quarter revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year driven by growth in pharmaceutical volumes within our Primary Care business. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 20% to $166 million, primarily reflecting the previously mentioned organic growth and the lapping of $8 million of bad debt expense in the prior year. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 807 basis points an increase of 99 basis points, driven by organic growth and lapping of prior year bad debt expense. And finishing our business review with Other revenues were $3 billion for the quarter, up 4% year-over-year due to organic growth in the Canadian Wholesale business and higher volumes of our prior authorization products within the Prescription Technology or MRxTS business. Our original revenue guidance for Other, reflected the anticipated exit of an unprofitable customer in our Canadian business at the onset of the fiscal year. This transition has been delayed and as a result, we are updating revenue guidance for Other to grow low single-digits in fiscal 2020. Other adjusted operating profit decreased 26% to $221 million driven by the prior year $90 million contractual liability reversal and lower contribution from our investment and Change Healthcare, partially offset by higher transaction volumes in our MRxTS business, principally from our electronic prior authorization products and growth in our Canadian Wholesale business. Excluding the prior year $90 million contractual liability reversal, Other adjusted operating profit grew 5% versus the prior year. And we continue to expect adjusted operating profits to be down low-to-mid single-digits. Year-to-date, our adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $147 million and we continue to anticipate the adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Change Healthcare in fiscal 2020 to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million. Moving now to corporate expenses. McKesson recorded a $146 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the second quarter, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year, resulting from planned investments in technology. McKesson recorded $36 million in opioid-related litigation expenses in the second quarter and $72 million year-to-date. We continue to assume opioid-related litigation costs to be approximately $150 million in fiscal 2020. Based on the progress against our cost initiative program and the anticipated timing of planned technology investments, we are updating our corporate expense guidance through range of $695 million to $745 million for the year. Turning now to cash, which can be found on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion. For the first half of fiscal 2020, McKesson used a $159 million in cash flow from operations. We used $184 million for internal capital investment, resulting in negative free cash flow of $343 million. For the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson also paid $95 million per acquisition and we returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders through the repurchase of $1.4 billion in common stock and payment of $148 million in dividends. Finally, I would remind you that our working capital metrics and results in cash flow maybe impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. I would also remind you we typically generate the majority of our annual operating cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year with more than $3 billion generated in each of the past two years. In fiscal 2020, we continue to expect internal capital investments of between $500 million and $700 million and free cash flow of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment is committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, which underpins our financial flexibility and delivering value and returns to our shareholders. Before I wrap up, we are updating our guidance around the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement to a net unfavorable impact of up to $0.05 per diluted share year-over-year. And in terms of fiscal 2020 earnings progression, we continue to expect that the fourth quarter will be our largest in terms of EPS contribution similar to prior years and the first half earnings progression is compared to the second half will be similar to FY2019. Let me take a minute to update you on the optimization of our operating model and cost structure. Our cost program is called [Venn Smart]. This emphasizes that everyone in the organization must think like an owner and that we will leverage the scale of the enterprise. We are seeing good progress in reducing costs via competitive and lean operator. As we've stated previously, we expected a portion of these savings will flow through profit, as evidenced by our lower corporate expense guide and overall operating expense results, and a portion will be reinvested in growth, such as the investments I discussed earlier in oncology, in manufacturer services. Additionally, we are on track to successfully transition several business unit functional and back office services to a more centralized hub model, allowing us to further increase standardization, gain efficiencies and drive focus to our customers. We've already made great progress in transforming finance and IT and we've seen tangible results from our investments in technology, more specifically data and analytics, and we're confident that our focus in this area will unlock additional benefits. The collective efforts and focus of our associates across the enterprise have resulted in meaningful savings for the organization. In closing, we are encouraged by the continued positive momentum across our businesses through the first half of fiscal 2020, led by the focus and execution of our associates across the enterprise. As a result, we are reiterating our fiscal 2020 outlook of adjusted earnings per diluted share of $14 to $14.60. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interested time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Your line is open. Eric Percher : Thank you. Maybe to begin, it's hard to disaggregate the underlying gross margin trend and for pharma in particular given what has gone on in the EU. Can you give us some perspective on what gross margin is doing and maybe gross margin and absolute gross profit? Britt Vitalone : Yes. Hey Eric. Thanks for that question. As we talked about, we had significant growth in revenues in the quarter. And as I mentioned, specifically in our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions business, we had growth that caused us to raise our guidance for the full-year. And I also pointed to the fact that a great portion of that came from specialty products and in particular from the growth of Caremark through growth of new customers there. And that had an impact on our gross profit rate in terms of comparing that to our revenue growth. We did have a 1% impact from foreign exchange. So when you looked at our gross profit, 3% when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange. But I would point you back to the fact that our revenue grew faster than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. It's largely coming from the onboarding of some customer wins through Caremark and there's a customer and product mix aspect to that where the products are largely coming through specialty products. And that's really what's driving that delta between revenue growth and gross profit growth. Eric Percher : In an absolute basis, you're seeing growth from specialty and is it also reasonable to expect that given the stability you speak to in the generic marketplace and given sourcing that we're seeing generic profitability grow on an absolute basis? Britt Vitalone : Yes. Eric, we are seeing that. As Brian talked about, we continue to see great benefits coming from our ClarusONE Sourcing organization. We're able to generate a good savings there this year. We're seeing stability on the sell-side and that's allowing us to continue to create a spread from a generic perspective. In our Specialty businesses, Brian, I think talked a lot about our provider business, our advances that we have in manufacturer services, and the lead that we have in from a U.S. Oncology as an asset. But we're seeing a lot of growth that is coming through our full line wholesale distribution. And as I mentioned, that's particularly coming from the growth of large customers like Caremark. Eric Percher : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I just wanted to go back to your comments around the opioid litigation and settlement. If I do the math, 38% of the settlement was McKesson. Should I think about that that was the market share in those two counties, or do you anticipate just given your overall market share with the independence in the U.S. that if we think about any settlement, it would be, somewhere in that type of range on a percentage basis? Brian Tyler : Good morning, Lisa. Thank you for the question. You did your math correct. We were 38% of that settlement. Obviously, there is data in the marketplace, the ARCOS data in particular that many of you are aware and familiar with. That data can be cut lots of ways depending on how you look at time periods, and how you look at customer segments, and whether you consider doses, et cetera, et cetera. And so part of the discussions that we had to go through was a methodology and we landed on a data-based methodology, and so you can roughly think of 38% as the McKesson representation of \u201cour share\u201d. Lisa Gill : Okay. That's helpful. And then just as we think about the timeline of this. I know you said that you're prepared to defend and litigate if needed. My understanding is that the next court cases until some time next summer. So does that mean that that kind of gives you this time between now and then for a settlement? And any update that you can give us on where you are on a potential global settlement? Because if I remember correctly, I think that's what you've talked about in the past, right. Ring-fencing those and having a global settlement not doing these one-off\u2026 Brian Tyler : Yes. That's right. Thank you, Lisa. I mean our objective and priority continues to be, we'll call it, sometimes global resolution or ring-fencing and that remains our priority. Our view on these two counties and coming to the settlement agreement we did with them was that that was an important stepping stone or building block or momentum for those, for the more global discussions to progress. And so we're encouraged by the status of the discussions. There is a lot of activity and things that we need to continue to work through, and we are actively working through those. We're working through those with some urgency. But it will take a bit of time to get through those. We're talking about 50 States and we're talking about subdivisions within States. So we've got a framework that we're very optimistic about. The teams are working diligently to address the issues. We'll progress it as quickly as we can, but obviously, we contemplate the two paths we've always talked about. There's a path to litigate, which only can project amount of time and amount of dollars to go down that path. And then there is a path that we think ring-fence is a risk and give us other resolution that it will take the path that we think is most beneficial for our shareholders. We certainly are anxious to find a resolution that takes care of the patients in the communities they serve as quickly as they can. But as we pursue these discussions, we continue to invest in our defense and we think it's only prudent to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Brian, just as I think about your comments about the trends that you saw with the medical side on the primary care physician offices and new supply, how are you strategizing? Or how are you thinking about the emergence of retail-based client care delivery in the primary care side, whether that's Walmart who's your client obviously, or the competitors in the retail space? Brian Tyler : Yes. Great. Thank you for the question. Maybe to frame it my answer a little bit, I'll go back in time. I think the medical business has been very successful at following the emergence of new channels in the alternate site settings. At one point in time that was urgent care clinics. We have a large footprint in the retail-based clinics that are out there today. And so we think as these new models for community-based care emerge, the solutions that we have in the medical business are right on point for the needs that those businesses and services will have. So my view is that's just a continued evolution in a new segment and our team has proven quite adept and quite effective at evolving our capabilities, and really leading the way as these segments emerge. And I would expect that's what the team is focused on today. Brian Tanquilut : And then I guess just my follow-up for Britt. As I think about calendar 2020, is there \u2013 what are your expectations in terms of brand pricing, just for 1-1? Britt Vitalone : Yes. What I would say is that we're reiterating our view that brand price inflations mid single-digit. We don't see anything that has occurred on the first half of the year or this quarter that would change that expectation. So we're continuing to view brand price \u2013 in the mid single-digits. Obviously, January is a usually an important month historically. But at this point, we're not changing our view on branded price inflation. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks for the question. So I'm trying to understand the magnitude of the revenue revision in the U.S. Pharma business. Now I appreciate the color on Caremark, but it sounds like you're suggesting this is coming in a lot better than expected levels. So I guess first, can you help us understand why that is? And then I guess the follow-up will be you're raising revenue guidance here by what looks like roughly 3% to 5%, but not changing your EBIT growth outlook. I get that we're talking about specialty and Caremark, but surprising there isn't really any noticeable drop due to earn ins. So, I guess how should we be thinking about that and is there something about the rest of the business, we should be keeping in mind? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thanks for that question. So let me just step back to the revenue guidance. Our prior revenue guidance was low single-digit to mid single-digit. And so we've updated that to high single-digit, and that's largely reflective of the growth that we're seeing that's coming from Caremark and particularly, Specialty products that are going through that customer. That's really what's driving this. In terms of the drop due to the bottom line. We're really pleased that we're able to make investments in the business. I talked about $25 million of investments in our oncology and manufacturer services capabilities. And despite those investments, we're pleased to be able to hold and then affirm our guidance for the segment on AOP at that low single- to mid single-digit number. So I would call this as a growth from one of our customers that is primarily coming through Specialty. We're making investments where we have leading positions and great capabilities and I talked about that as being an additional $25 million, but we're still holding and affirming the AOP guide or the segment. Stephen Baxter : Got it. And I guess just coming back to \u2013 like what is better than was expected going into the year? Is there any clarity you can provide on that? I appreciate what the driver is in absolute terms, but understanding what is prior expectation would be great? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Sure. Well, I'd just reiterate a couple things that branded price inflation is performing as we had anticipated. We're seeing really good progress out of ClarusONE and so our \u2013 from a generic perspective, everything is performing as we had anticipated, still stable competitive marketplace. I think a couple of things that I would point out that Brian really talked about is our Specialty Provider business is performing quite well. And certainly the investments that we've been making in our manufacturer services capabilities and that we're continuing to make there, that\u2019s also performing well. So I think as you think about our Specialty business, we're getting a lot of growth through customer wins in our Wholesale Distribution business. We're making great advances in our Provider business and our manufacturer services capabilities. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Thanks so much for taking the question. So I wanted to go back to the comment you made, Brian, about the stability of what you're seeing on the sell side relative to generics. And now it's been about three years since we had a shift in the independent market, you also highlighted some of the value that you provide in terms of the independent customers. And so I guess as we go forward, how do you think about the activity and the kind of \u2013 the puts and takes that go on with the independent market, and how they think about negotiating, especially as they all tend to get into their own specific buying groups? Brian Tyler : Yes, sure. Thank you. Thank you for the question. I mean I referenced in my comments the RxOwnership program and the fact that 700-ish pharmacy \u2013 new pharmacy owners, we helped in opening or establishing or transferring into the business. And that's not a unusual number. I mean if you go back many, many years, we often see lots of exits, in the Independent Pharmacy segment. Some of those are family planning and transition exit. Some are script file sales, but we also see as many new \u2013 as many new openings or many new storefronts come into play. And so it's been remarkably stable over the years. And that trend we continue to see today. And we do, over the years we have and we continue to invest in these tools and these services that we think help independent pharmacists stay independent, stay healthy businesses and stay vibrant in the communities and the patients that we serve. But we really haven't seen anything that I would say was a massive trend break in terms of there's always ins and there's always outs in the Independent segment. Michael Cherny : Thanks. And then just one quick question on capital deployments, as you think about the discussions and debates going on relative to the push for a global settlement? Does that have any impact on your cash availability or capital deployment priorities? And I know not from a reserving perspective per say, but do you think about keeping some level of cash to present itself for any type of potential settlements? Brian Tyler : I would say this. I think we've been pretty clear on what our capital deployment philosophy has been in the past, a very balanced approach to that. What I would say is we have not made a change to that for that portfolio approach. We continue to make investments internally that we think will drive future growth. We continue to be open to M&A, where we can find that the M&A that makes sense, balancing obviously valuation expectations, where our share prices, what alternate returns of that capital are. But that was a long answer to give you the short answer that we really \u2013 it really has not impacted our approach to capital deployment. Britt Vitalone : And I think if you look at how we've deployed capital in the first half of the year, it's pretty historical amount of capital that's been deployed. We've returned a lot of capital to our shareholders, particularly in the second quarter. And as Brian mentioned, we'll continue to evaluate, really on a balanced perspective. But we haven't made any changes to the amount or how we're deploying capital at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Hey, thanks for getting the questions. So I just wanted to go back, Brian, about the framework here. You're optimistic about in terms of getting sort of more global kind of settlement here. Just to clarify, with this any kind of discussions, is it clear to you that you\u2019ve encompass all point us you might have mentioned, I just didn't catch that clearly. Brian Tyler : You were breaking up a little bit. Let me \u2013 I think the question was, coming back to the framework, is it going to be all encompassing of all the litigation. And what I would say is that relative to the States and relative to the subdivisions in those States, our goal is to get as comprehensive of a settlement within that framework as we can. And that is the majority of the outstanding litigation. But it is not all of the cases. Charles Rhyee : Is that something mechanically that, you kind of reach this framework and then wait for all the parties to then look at it and say, we're okay with this. And that sort of \u2013 and if there's some type of from your standpoint and you kind of look at them and thanks. This is enough that we will move forward or not enough and we will not agree to this because it's maybe you might have thought, some large percentage, we're okay with that. But in the end, a lot of them subdivisions say, this is not \u2013 we're not satisfied with this. And in this case you go to the - different tracks? Brian Tyler : Yes. So I guess that the easiest way to answer that is to say that, this is a complex legal situation. We have established a framework and had good discussion around that framework. It is very much a process though, and we are very much working through the details of how that process will unfold. And it's really not a lot more I can add to it at this time. Charles Rhyee : Okay. Very good. And Britt, just a follow-up one real quick question on the European segment from the guidance. Is it that you\u2019re still looking for operating profit guidance to low single-digit and really size heavy back half maybe a little bit more thoughts on what's going to get there in the back half? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes, thanks for the question. I think as we've talked about, we expect that the business will continue to improve its performance in the back half, and then Brian also talked about some nominal increases in the tariffs in the UK. And we would expect that there could be additional increases in the back half of the year. So that's really what is driving that second half performance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question here. So I guess this has been touched on a little bit, I guess I'm looking for any update on the ClarusONE progress and tied into that, based on a little bit of the margin compression in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty business, should we assume that the relationship between the procurement price on generics versus your sell-side pricing, it may have fallen off a little bit during the quarter or in your mind, was that relationship still relatively consistent during the quarter? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Yes. Thanks for that question. We're really pleased with the performance of ClarusONE and it's performing in line with what our expectations were at the beginning of the year. We're continuing to see that organization drive great value, which is very helpful. As we think about the sell-side, which is \u2013 as we've talked about now for several quarters. So competitive, but stable environment. We're pleased with ClarusONE. It\u2019s performing as we had anticipated. We think that there's still great value to be gained out of that organization. And we were pleased with the partnership that we have with our partner Walmart as we continue through \u2013 in that relationship as well. Steven Valiquette : Okay. And what about the relationship then between the buy-side versus the sell-side pricing? Was that consistent during the quarter or was there some slight erosion? Just curious to \u2013 just a high level comment on that. Brian Tyler : Yes, sure. No, I say it's consistent. We're seeing consistency over the last several quarters now and again, a good performance on ClarusONE in a stable competitive environment on the sell-side, and that's in line with our expectations and what we've seen now for the several quarters. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bob Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just a couple to go back to Specialty, Brian, if I could. You discussed the three main areas within Specialty, it sounds like generally very pleased with the performance across the board there. And I think most of us get the mixed dynamic that you guys have discussed within Specialty Pharmacy and Caremark, specifically. But I guess if we take a step back, the operating profit for the overall Pharma and Specialty segment was up 1% in the quarter. Just sounds like there's a lot of secular tailwinds there. So I guess just wondering if you could shed a little bit more light on how you think about overall EBIT growth as it relates specifically to what seems like some pretty strong tailwinds within specialty? Brian Tyler : Yes. Great. Thank you. And we reflected on the questions we've had over the last few quarters and that's why we included a little more description or color on the Specialty businesses that we have in the Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. And if you think about the three segments we highlighted, they are all performing very well. And we think in all cases, we have assets that are not only competitive with the market, but probably one of the most robust set of solutions and services when taken in the aggregate. And so those businesses are continuing to perform well. They're delivering good growth and they're performing right in line with where we thought they would for the year. Obviously, there is another segment in specialty that is the more retail mail order oriented specialty products. And Britt talked a lot about the impact we've seen of the growth in the Caremark book of business that has been \u2013 the mix has been slanted towards those specialty products, which tends to be the lower margin profile for us. So when you net all out, that's where you get \u2013 that's how you get to the results that you're seeing today. Robert Jones : And then I guess just to follow-up on that, maybe Britt. I mean, just to maybe understand that a little bit better. I mean these kind of outsized growth within Caremark products. I mean these aren't margin or EBID dilutive I guess I would say. And then just on the $25 million investment that you mentioned in the back half, maybe just a little bit more specificity around what area within specialty those would be pointed out would be helpful too. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes, as we've talked about before and as we think about specialty distribution in our wholesale \u2013 line of wholesale business, they do have a dilutive impact on the rate. We still participate in the profit dollars. It's just grown a lot faster than we had anticipated and that's at a much more dilutive impact on the rate of growth. As we think about the investments that we're making as Brian talked about, we are very pleased with our positions in oncology, our positions that we're developing in manufacturer services, and as we think about this $25 million, it will be largely invested in oncology capabilities and assets. But again, we're continuing to invest in our manufacturing services capabilities as well. But you should think about this investment as investing where we have leading-edge positions and oncology is certainly one of those. Brian Tyler : Yes. Just to build on that. I mean, these investments are tied to our strategy. Our strategy is anchored and where we typically \u2013 we have differentiated capabilities and we have good marketplace growth. And so we're very happy to be able to say we're continuing to make these investments and still delivering on the year as we committed. Holly Weiss : Operator, we have time for one more. Operator : Okay, great. Our last question for today is Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks for getting me in guys. I appreciate that. If we think about the CVS relationship in the fact that it was just sort of re-upped for June, is there some anticipation that over time the margin with them could get better, meaning like are we in a situation right now where the first sort of 12 months of this relationship, the margins from that contract might be worse and over time they could get better? Brian Tyler : Well, first let me say, we are always happy to renew our customers and we're always happy when they grow. We are experiencing a shift in the mix of business \u2013 on our margin rate perspective as you see in our results, I mean great topline growth, but there is a margin rate impact in there. We're never disappointed when our customers grow and we think it's always additive to the business. Kevin Caliendo : One quick follow-up. Can you talk about the performance and impact NorthStar would have had in the quarter? Brian Tyler : We don't specifically talk about NorthStar, but when we think about our generics portfolio, NorthStar is obviously a critical part of that and we're very pleased with the performance of NorthStar, and we're pleased with the progress that we're making there. Britt Vitalone : I think the relationships with the manufacturers in NorthStar have really evolved over the years that are quite productive, and I think that's what's supporting the success that we're seeing there. Brian Tyler : Okay. Well, thank you everyone for your questions, and thanks again for your interest in giving us some of your time this morning. Thank you, Suzanne, for facilitating this call. Just maybe to conclude, I really think the fundamentals inside the business were strong. The macro healthcare environment is supporting a stable market. We executed well in the second quarter. I'm very proud of the teams and the execution. We're continuing to drive cost savings. We're continuing to speed up our decision making. We're continuing to make investments where we think we have opportunities for growth, and I feel good about our fiscal 2020 full-year outlook. My confidence is of course, rooted in the 80,000 employees that come to work every day for McKesson for our shareholders, really embodying our values, including integrity. They do the right thing and our execution and success are a direct result of their contribution. So I want to say thank you to them. None of this is possible without you. And now let me hand the call over to Holly for review of our upcoming events. Holly? Holly Weiss : Thank you, Brian. We will participate in the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco in mid-January and we will release third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you, and goodbye. Operator : And thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

Please go ahead. Holly Weiss : Thank you, Jack. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer, and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Holly. And good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us on our call this morning. Before I get into our third quarter results, I wanted to take a few minutes to provide a brief update on opioid litigation. As you know, we've been engaged in complex discussions with the state attorney generals and others about a settlement framework with the goal of achieving a broad resolution of opioid-related claims. Those discussions continue to narrow what's left to address to achieve resolution on all the items that remain.  However, to the extent our efforts to reach a broad resolution settlement framework are unsuccessful, McKesson continues to be prepared to litigate and vigorously defend the mischaracterizations that our company drove the demand for opioids in this country.  McKesson remains firmly committed to being part of the broader solution to this crisis. Given, however, the discussions and litigation are ongoing, I'll be somewhat limited in what I can say. I do appreciate your understanding. Now, let's get to our business results. Today, we reported third-quarter total company revenues of $59.2 billion. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.81 and I'm pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date execution across the majority of our businesses in our fiscal 2020. Also today, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2020 full year outlook of $14.60 to $14.80 of adjusted earnings per diluted share which we first provided on January 13. This update reflects our outlook for growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, primarily driven by specialty, strength in our medical surgical segment, lower-than-anticipated corporate expenses and the benefit from share repurchase activity in the third quarter. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment performed well in the quarter, reflecting stable macro fundamentals and good execution, and was aided by the continued strong growth across our specialty businesses. Let me walk you through the recent trends from an industry fundamental standpoint. For the third quarter, we saw branded price increases tracking in line with our expectations and we continue to assume mid-single digit branded price increases year-over-year for fiscal 2020. For generics, we remain disciplined in our approach to the market. We're sourcing effectively through our scaled sourcing venture and the sell side remains competitive, but stable. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge how pleased we are that the VA announced in December it had again selected McKesson to be the prime pharmaceutical vendor beginning in August 2020. We've been the VA's prime pharmaceutical vendor for veterans hospitals and the department's mail-order pharmacies for more than 15 years. This is a great point of pride for McKesson and we're dedicated to hiring veterans and helping them build their careers after their service. And  At McKesson, we have many employee resource groups celebrating and leveraging the diversity of our workforce. The McKesson Military Resource Group, or MMRG as we refer to it internally, provides opportunities for all employees to recognize and welcome veterans and their families to McKesson. MMRG offers networking opportunities; facilitates personal and professional development; supports McKesson's recruitment, hiring and retention of veterans; and sponsors events within our communities for active duty military and veterans. I want to thank McKesson's veterans \u2013 and every veteran really \u2013 for their service. We're very proud to serve the VA and we look forward to continuing our long-standing partnership. Moving to specialty, as you've heard me discuss at several recent events, we have a differentiated portfolio of assets and capabilities that was built over time, with targeted internal and external investments. First, we distribute specialty pharmaceuticals via the traditional wholesale model to retail and hospital pharmacies. And although these products are margin and rate dilutive, we benefit from this growth at the top line and in our gross profit dollars. Next, we distribute specialty products that are primarily infused in the community-based setting and typically require special handling, including temperature control. We also provide other services, like group purchase organization activities, data and technology services in oncology and other multispecialty practices. And then, we have our leading practice management business, specifically The US Oncology Network, which now includes more than 1,200 oncology physician, providing 12% to 13% of all community-based oncology care. We handle all aspects of managing the practice, so that the physician can focus on treating the patient. In addition, we're active in clinical trials, research and formulary development. The practice manager business, combined with the wholesale distribution and specialty product distribution and services business, are the scale channels we leverage to provide services and solutions to our many biopharma partners, including commercialization, hub and patient assistance services. We help manufacturers find patients that are appropriate and relevant-for-care, help them get started on that therapy sooner and work to keep them adherent to that therapy for the course of their treatment.  This results in a patient getting the best possible outcome from their treatment. These services not only support better outcomes for patients, but they also provide tremendous value to our manufacturer partners.  We're really pleased with the growth we're seeing across these businesses and we remain focused on specialty as a key tenet of our strategic direction. We're also pleased that we're returning the growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment in fiscal 2020, while continuing to invest in our future. Now, let me turn to Europe. In mid-December, McKesson and Walgreens announced a joint venture agreement that we expect will bring together our respective wholesale operations in Germany. After review of our business in Germany, we believe this is the right course of action as the combined business will have large reach and scale, driving increased efficiency and performance in a market where scale is vitally important. The transaction is subject to merger clearance and approval and that process is expected to take at least six months from the time of the announcement. As such, this transaction will not have any impact on adjusted earnings in our current fiscal year. In the UK, we continue to monitor the retail pharmacy funding dynamics. As we detailed earlier in the fiscal year, the retail pharmacy industry experienced underfunding by the NHS in our first quarter. While there was a modest improvement in our fiscal second quarter, further upward revisions have not yet been implemented. We continue to monitor the situation in the UK closely and engage in active dialogue with the NHS related to industry funding and the role pharmacy can play in managing NHS's overall cost, quality and access challenges. Outside of the UK, we're continuing to see performance in line with our expectations for the other countries in this segment. Next, our Medical Surgical business. Again, this quarter, we had good growth across multiple markets, such as our home care delivery business and product categories, including pharmaceutical sales into the primary care space. Customers are repeatedly choosing McKesson because of our relentless focus on providing what they need to take care of their patients. We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through innovation and a focus on operational excellence, breadth of product and service offerings, along with one of the largest and most tenured sales forces in the industry. We also saw an early start to the influenza season in the third quarter, which we are continuing to monitor for severity and duration. In addition, our results continue to reflect the integration of the MFD acquisition, which we lapped during our first quarter, and our focus is now on driving synergies. This acquisition continues to perform in line with its business case. Turning to other, which primarily consists of Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, sometimes referred to as MRxTS, and our investment in Change Healthcare. In Canada, we're now capturing the benefits of previous actions we've taken, including our investments in people and in reconfigured pharmacy formats as community pharmacy plays an important role in Canadian healthcare.  And market fundamentals are stable, which helped to drive growth in our wholesale operations year-over-year. In addition, McKesson Canada also has broad specialty assets and capabilities and we are well-positioned to participate in the growth of specialty in the Canadian market. Moving on to MRxTS, which is a key area of investment. We're making investments to ensure we have the right product and personnel resources in place to support the growth trajectory of these businesses and are looking to launch new products that leverage our existing technologies and build upon them. As we look at how MRxTS is performing year-to-date, we're pleased with the growth in the business, which is net of several investments we are making to drive and support our future growth. Let's move on to Change Healthcare. As we discussed previously, we continue to take the customary steps toward an exit of our investment in Change Healthcare.  As part of the exit process, registration statements were filed today with the SEC. The previously discussed timing, expectations are unchanged and this is simply a necessary step as we move through the process of exiting our investment in change healthcare. Recently, you've heard me talk about aligning McKesson under one vision, to improve care in every setting, one product, one partner, one patient at a time. We've been transforming and energizing the culture at McKesson. We've got a great collaborative workspace at our new headquarters in the Dallas area. We've rolled out new enterprise behaviors, building on the already-strong foundation of our ICARE and ILEAD values and getting everyone aligned around our strategy on how we want to work together to execute it. We're looking to become a simpler, more focused and nimbler organization. We've centralized some of our functions and are looking at ways to work more efficiently and to utilize technology for day-to-day tasks that can be automated, freeing up time to focus on strategy, a work that drives value for the organization and better leverages our teams.  We're seeing great execution across the enterprise, including cost savings, as we track towards our target of $400 million to $500 million in gross pretax savings by the end of our fiscal 2021. Our organization has rallied around these efforts and it's showing in the culture and the results. I could not be prouder of the McKesson team. And with one quarter to go in fiscal 2020, I'm confident in our reaffirmed adjusted earnings outlook of $14.60 to $14.80 per diluted share. As we look forward, we're in the initial stages of planning for fiscal 2021. Let me walk through some of the things we're thinking about. The timing and impact of the exit of our investment in Change Healthcare as exit activities are currently underway.  For customer renewals, the VA contract goes into effect in August 2020. As a reminder, we've stated that this new contract will not be a material headwind to our fiscal 2021 outlook. We are continuing to progress against our cost savings target with a portion of those savings falling to the bottom line and a portion being reinvested for growth. And finally, from a capital allocation perspective, we would anticipate benefits from share repurchases completed in fiscal 2020. As we think about the market and the macro perspective in the US, we're entering an election year and will make assumptions related to any potential impact we might expect based on our analysis, including related to drug pricing trends. McKesson will continue to engage with policymakers and industry partners to ensure that any reforms support solutions to improve cost, quality and access. The policy landscape remains a dynamic environment and we remain confident in McKesson's path forward. As it relates to the UK, we're continuing to monitor the market environment and NHS funding as well as Brexit activities.  We will review our businesses and expectations, including the impact of external factors, and will provide our fiscal 2021 outlook in May when we report fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2020 earnings. Before I turn the call over to Britt, I want to take just a moment to thank Kathy McElligott who just retired from McKesson. In her role as Chief Information and Technology Officer, she helped McKesson increase its focus on data and analytics and accelerate our technology modernization. Kathy, thank you for your contributions to McKesson. And on the flipside, I'd like to also welcome Nancy Flores, who is succeeding Kathy as CIO and CTO. Nancy has a long track record of success in healthcare IT and we look forward to utilizing her experience as we remain focused on our mission to improve healthcare in every setting by leveraging technology solutions for our company, our customers and our business partners. And with that, let me turn the call over to Britt to go through the financials. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here this morning to talk about a solid third quarter for McKesson. I'll focus on our third quarter results and full-year fiscal 2020 guidance, including changes you could consider as you update your models. Brian walked you through high-level puts and takes as we think about our fiscal 2021 guidance and we'll provide detailed assumptions for fiscal 2021 when we report fourth-quarter and full-year results in May. We're pleased with our adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per diluted share results in the third quarter which were ahead of our expectations and represent solid execution. We continue to see momentum across the business as we execute against our strategic initiatives. As a result of this momentum and based on the confidence in our fourth-quarter outlook, on January 13, we raised and narrowed our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $14.60 to $14.80 per diluted share from the previous range of $14 to $14.60 per diluted share. And today, we're reaffirming that adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance. Updated guidance assumptions can be found in our third quarter earnings slide presentation, which is posted on our Investors section of our website. Before I provide more details on our third quarter adjusted results, I want to address one item that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. During the third quarter, we reported a pre and post-tax charge of $282 million, with a remeasurement to fair value of the net assets from the majority of McKesson's German wholesale business in relation to the expected formation of a new German wholesale joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Moving now to the adjusted earnings results for the quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EPS was $3.81, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year, which was primarily driven by organic growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, the Medical Surgical segment and the European segment. To better understand our third quarter results, let me remind you of two discrete events in our prior-year third quarter, both within our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. First, the $60 million pretax charge related to the bankruptcy of Shopko. And second, a pretax benefit of approximately $17 million related to the reversal of accrued New York State Opioid Stewardship Act charges. If you normalize for these two items, Q3's fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 7%.  Moving to the details of our consolidated results on slide four. Consolidated revenues for the third quarter increased 5% versus the prior period, primarily driven by growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, driven by branded pharmaceutical price increases and higher retail national account volumes. We continue to anticipate mid to high-single digit percent consolidated revenue growth for the full year. Third quarter adjusted gross profit increased 4% year-over-year, principally due to organic growth in our Medical Surgical and U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year, driven by higher corporate expenses which include planned technology investments. Adjusted income from operations was $958 million for the quarter, which was up 4% year-over-year or 5% on an FX-adjusted basis. As a result of this solid performance and our updated outlook, we're guiding full year adjusted income from operations to increase a low single-digit percent. Interest expense of $64 million in the quarter declined 4% compared to the prior year and our adjusted tax rate was 17.1% for the quarter, which included discrete tax benefits of approximately $36 million. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate assumption remained approximately 18% to 19%.  Wrapping up our consolidated results, our third quarter diluted weighted average shares were $180 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. During the quarter, we completed approximately $500 million of share repurchases, bringing our year-to-date total share repurchases to $1.9 billion. As a result, we now expect diluted weighted average shares of approximately 182 million for the year. Next, I'll review our segment results which can be found on slides 5 through 8. Before I start with my review of the segments, including updated full-year guidance, I want to reiterate that we provide full-year guidance and do not provide quarterly guidance. As a reminder, there are a number of items, particularly in our largest segment, U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, that can cause fluctuations on quarter-to-quarter basis. While this can make comparing year-over-year results in a quarterly basis difficult, these items do tend to balance out over the course of the year.  These items include customer volumes, customer and product mix, brand price increases and the timing of discrete tax item. We anticipate that there could be additional fluctuations in our fourth-quarter results. Let me now start with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $46.9 billion for quarter, up 6%, driven by branded pharmaceutical price increases and continued growth by our largest retail national customers, partially offset by branded to generic conversion. Third-quarter adjusted operating profit increased 11% to $658 million, primarily driven by the execution and growth in our differentiated portfolio of specialty businesses.  As I mentioned earlier, there were two discrete items included in our prior-year third-quarter results. A $60 million pretax charge related to the bankruptcy of Shopko and a pretax benefit of approximately $70 million related to the reversal of accrued New York State Opioid Stewardship Act charges. If your adjust for these two prior-year items, the segment adjusted operating profit was up 3.5% year-over-year in the quarter. Also, as a reminder, this is the final quarter in which we are lapping the effects of the lost Shopko earnings, which was approximately $8 million per quarter in terms of operating profit. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 140 basis points, an increase of 6 basis points.  On a year-to-date basis, the segment adjusted operating profit is up 7%. You adjust for the prior-year impact of the $60 million pretax charge related to the bankruptcy of Shopko and the prior-year earnings contribution of approximately $24 million from three quarters of Shopko results, segment adjusted operating profit increased 5% year-to-date. For the third quarter, brand price activity trended in line with our expectation. Additionally, based on manufacturer price actions taken in January, we are maintaining our full-year fiscal 2020 assumptions for brand price increases to be in the mid-single digit percent range. I would remind you that our branded pharmaceutical contracts are primarily fixed fee for service rate in nature. And as a result, our compensation with branded manufacturers is less impacted by price increases when compared to several years ago. To wrap up this segment, given the underlying strength in the quarter and the year-to-date performance, we have confidence that segment adjusted operating profit growth will be on the high-end of the previously provided range of 3% to 5% growth for fiscal 2020. Next, European Pharmaceutical Solutions. Revenues were $6.9 billion for the quarter, which was flat year-over-year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues increased 3%, driven primarily by market growth in the pharmaceutical distribution business. Segment adjusted operating profit was up 16% to $80 million, driven in part by lower operating expenses as a result of actions previously taken to rationalize store footprint and streamline back office functions. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 116 basis points on a constant currency basis, an increase of 16 points. Moving to Medical Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.1 billion for quarter, which was up 6%, driven by organic growth, led by the primary care business, including higher pharmaceutical volumes and an earlier start to the influenza season. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was up 8% to $184 million, driven by organic growth. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 859 basis points, an increase of 14 basis points. Year-to-date, the segment adjusted operating profit growth is 18%. As a result of the organic growth in the segment year-to-date, we now anticipate that the segment adjusted operating profit for fiscal 2020 will increase by a low double-digit percent year-over-year.  And finishing our business review with Other. Revenues were $3.2 billion for the quarter, which was up 6%, driven primarily by organic growth in the Canadian wholesale business. Other adjusted operating profit was down 4% to $214 million, in part driven by higher strategic product investments in our Prescription Technology Solutions business, or MRxTS, partially offset by growth in our Canadian wholesale business. Closing our segment review with Change Healthcare. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $51 million for the quarter. As a reminder, our equity investment ownership in Change Healthcare was approximately 58.5% in our fiscal third quarter 2020 point as compared to 70% in the prior-year. As Brian mentioned earlier, registration statements were filed this morning with the SEC, disclosing our intention to exit our investment in Change Healthcare via an exchange offer. This is the next step in the process to exit our investment in a tax efficient manner. I direct you to today's filing for additional information. Next, McKesson recorded $170 million in adjusted corporate expenses, which was an increase of 29% year-over-year, driven primarily by planned technology investments, which included investments in data and analytic capabilities. For the third quarter, we reported net opioid-related adjusted operating expenses of $36 million and year-to-date $108 million. For fiscal 2020, we continue to anticipate that opioid-related costs will approximately be $150 million. We continue to make solid progress against our cost savings programs, which include a focus on our core operating expenses, by leveraging the scale of our enterprise and the continued transformation of back-office functions. We remain on track with our previously announced annual pretax savings of $400 million to $500 million, which is anticipated to be substantially delivered by the end of fiscal 2021. As we discussed, the portion of these savings will be reinvested back into the business, in line with our growth initiatives and the remaining will flow the bottom line. As a result of our performance year-to-date, we now anticipate adjusted corporate expenses to be in the range of $660 million to $700 million. Now that I've wrapped up our results, let me discuss our updated fiscal 2020 outlook. We feel really good about our steady execution throughout fiscal 2020. The recent narrowing and increase to our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share to a range of $14.60 to $14.80 reflects the following. Solid core performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, driven by continued strength across our differentiated portfolio of specialty businesses; organic growth in our Medical Surgical segment; improved second-half performance in our European segment as compared to the prior year; lower corporate expenses than originally anticipated; and a lower share count as a result of share repurchase activity year-to-date. This solid performance was partially mitigated by continued planned investments in strategic initiatives, including incremental second-half investment in our differentiated oncology and manufacturer services businesses, the investment in our technology products; and investment in technology infrastructure, including data and analytics. We remain confident that we are well-positioned to execute in our fourth quarter. Turning now to cash which can be found on slide 10. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.1 billion. In the quarter, McKesson used $121 million in cash flow from operations. After deducting $154 million in internal capital investments, McKesson had negative free cash flow of $275 million. I would remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of the given quarter. It is not uncommon to experience net use of cash during our fiscal third quarter, primarily driven by the build in inventory for the holiday season. In our fiscal fourth quarter, we typically generate more than two-thirds of our annual operating cash flow. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million of common stock. We've now repurchased approximately $1.9 billion in common stock for the first nine months of fiscal year. The repurchase of our common stock underpins our belief that McKesson shares are undervalued. Combined with the confidence in our execution and our outlook, we view this as a prudent use of capital. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson paid $97 million for acquisition and $222 million in dividend. We now expect internal capital investments to be in the range of $500 million to $600 million and we continue to anticipate free cash flow in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. In closing, we are pleased with the solid operational results of our fiscal third quarter and our performance year-to-date. We will build on our third quarter performance and we remain confident in our business as we focus on a strong finish to the year, which is reflected in our expected adjusted earnings per diluted share range of $14.60 to $14.80 for fiscal 2020. As I look at our performance over the past several quarters and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020, it clearly demonstrates focus and execution against our strategy, as well as continued, steady improvement in our financial results. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Brian, if I start with \u2013 just on opioids real quickly. What are the remaining points that are being negotiated? You kind of said that the negotiations are going well or seem to be progressing and some of the points are being resolved. Maybe you can give us a sense of what are some of the remaining kind of sticking points perhaps.  And if I understand correctly, the framework is being discussed among \u2013 or is being led by four state attorney generals. During these kind of discussions, are the other constituents, let's say, the other states or some of the bigger municipalities that are in this lawsuit or part of this multidistrict litigation? Are they able to sort of see the progress as well and understand what is being kind of negotiated, so that when we get to maybe a final framework, the process with them to review and to accept is kind of in tandem or is this kind of being done in kind of a closed session and then opened up later? Brian Tyler : Thank you for the question, Charles. And I think the way you frame the question, naming the number of parties or counterparties or folks involved in this discussion helps to frame why it's moving at the cadence that it's moving. We do continue to be in constructive dialogue with the AGs. The AGs have broadened their group and they continue to talk amongst themselves.  The good news from my perspective is the basic framework that we've laid out is still the framework that's being discussed and the details for the many component parts of that are progressing well. There is still a long way to go with regard to ultimately getting as broad of AG support as we can and then AGs themselves going to their subdivisions and extending that broad support. So, there is a lot of work that is ongoing. The discussions are really continuous. It would be too early for me to try to project a timeline or where the finish line might be. But I am pleased that the framework that we've been negotiating continues to be the framework, the details are progressing. And I think as we get through the coming months, we'll begin to assess what the various AG and sub-municipality positions are. Charles Rhyee : Great. If I could have a follow-up, just on the core business, obviously, you increased your outlook on the core pharmaceutical segment here. It seems like a lot of things are moving in the right direction. Is there anything you'd point to specifically that is kind of driving the improved outlook here? Thank you. Brian Tyler : Maybe I'll start and then Britt may want to offer a few comments. I think if you think about the general kind of industry fundamentals, the brand price inflation has been in line with where we thought it would be. The generic market is continuing to behave in a way that we had forecast. And by that, I mean our skill sourcing entity continues to produce in line with our anticipation. We are going in the market with a very disciplined approach, reflective of the transition our industry has been in. And we think that the competitive \u2013 the sell side in the generics market remains stable. It's competitive and there's pressures, but it's stable.  I think we're seeing the benefits of a lot of the work and planning that we've been \u2013 for the last several quarters, we've been executing and implementing. And so, combining that I think with the market fundamentals and our really good positions in specialty is driving the results that you see. Britt Vitalone : Maybe I might just add. I think Brian you hit on it here. The focus and our execution against our differentiated assets, particularly specialty, and you talked a lot about that, I think is really driving a lot of this.  And then, I would just reiterate that our cost programs are really driving, not only in our corporate line, but also across our segment. And so, that focus is not only on our core set of differentiated assets, but just disciplined and focus around costs across not only our corporate segments, but our business segments. Charles Rhyee : Thank you. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Charles. Operator : And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Hi. Good morning. And congrats on a good quarter. So, I guess, the question for me, as I think about it, Brian, you talked about the execution and how you guys seem really positive about it. So, how do you think about the runway remaining in specialty as we head into fiscal 2021, without going into guidance specifically, and just how you're looking at the volume outlook from the key accounts because it sounds like that's a volume driver that's been driving some upside as well? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Yeah. We're really pleased with our specially businesses. We talked a few weeks ago about the \"core,\" the distribution of these products to hospitals and retail pharmacies as being our biggest segment. Clearly, we benefit there from the growth that these products have just in general. And the pipeline, if you look at the pipeline of the innovative products coming, they tend to look that way. And as you know, we've got established scale channels across both of these segments. And then, if you think about community setting, oncology, we have a clear leading stake. We're a leader in many of the other multispecialty settings. They're going to benefit from that same pipeline.  And I also think, if you step up from a more macro view, if you think about the challenges that the cost of healthcare represents in this country, we have a fundamental belief that to get access, cost and quality, care needs to continue to shift into the community-based settings. So, that's where our community provider business, I think, from a macro standpoint is well positioned. And then, our US oncology business, we have particular depth and strength in oncology. And if you look at the pipeline there, that continues to be strong. So, I would say all those things are what are giving us our confidence. But at the bottom, at the end of the day, it's really the execution of the business that lets you capitalize on those macro trends and opportunities. Brian Tanquilut : I guess my follow-up, Britt, you mentioned the cost cuts and the opportunities that you've found there. So, do you think there's a lot of runway left as we think about cost opportunities both on the corporate side and also on the operations side? Britt Vitalone : Yeah, our cost program, Brian, what we talked about, we would capture these cost savings by the end of fiscal 2021. So, we're still making progress not only in leveraging the scale of our enterprise across all of our business units, but some of the things that we've talked about previously in terms of back office function transformation, and there's still opportunities there as the size of our enterprise allows us to continue to work across and collaborate and drive additional cost synergy. So, I would say that that program, as we talked about, is \u2013 we expect it to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2021. However, as the business grows and our focus and execution in specialty continues, there's still opportunities for us to leverage our scale and transform our back office function. Brian Tyler : Efficiency is a core part of the way you have to run a business like this at this scale. So, it is a program that we implemented a few years ago. But most importantly, for me, it's a mindset. It's a part of the way we think about how we manage and run the business. Brian Tanquilut : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And next will be Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just to go back to the segment guidance, and specifically the US Pharma segment, it seems like if I look at what's implied with 4Q, at the high end, it seems like you're kind of calling for year-over-year flat EBIT there in that segment. I know there's a number of moving pieces, Britt, but maybe could you just help us think about what the major swing factors are in 4Q because you guys highlighted the business there, in particular specialty seems to be performing well and there're some momentum, but it seems like 4Q, you're implying at least that things could potentially slow a bit? So, just want to make sure we had the moving pieces there correctly. Britt Vitalone : Yeah, sure, Bob. You're right about the implied. What I would just come back to and point out is that I've talked about, in a business the size of ours, with customers that are growing and you have mix that is changing in terms of customer and product mix, we are going to see fluctuations from quarter to quarter. We've seen that historically. I think we're seeing that a little bit more of this year, some of our larger retail national customers are growing a little bit faster. I think what we're pleased with, though, as Brian talked about, there're some stability in the pricing environment, particularly with branded pricing, certainly continue to \u2013 good progress against generics. But what you should expect, as I talked about at the beginning, is that we are going to see some items that are going to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We don't manage our business that way. We manage our business for the long haul. We look at our business on an annual basis. And these items do tend to balance out over the course of the year. We're very pleased that we started the year with being able to guide back to growth in this segment and we're very pleased that, given the momentum and the execution that Brian talked about, particularly in our specialty business, we could raise that guidance today to the upper ends. We're making good progress, but I think you should expect to continue to see some fluctuation in our quarterly results. Robert Jones : No, that's fair. And then, I guess, Brian, you opened the door to a little bit of preliminary 2021 thoughts, and so I know we'll get more detail in May, but if I heard you correctly, it sounds like core drivers playing out in line this year with your expectations. You guys have highlighted the VA is not a material headwind. It sounds like cost savings will continue. It could be a benefit from capital allocation. All seem pretty neutral to tailwinds. Is there any major headwinds you would have us start to contemplate as we start to think about framing 2021 more specifically? Brian Tyler : Well, look, as we come to May, we'll try to be very thoughtful and share with you our view of the thinking. If I think about what could materialize as headwinds, the policy arena has been dynamic probably for most of my career, but certainly for my tenure as CEO. And yet, while the clouds always seem to be gathering, nothing has really materialized. I would suspect we'll hear some commentary tonight. I think as we come into the face of election year, we'll be evaluating not only the policy proposals, but the politics that surround \u2013 that sort of set the framework for the likelihood of any of that really getting done. But to me that's just a normal part of being in healthcare and a normal part of being in this business. I think, though, our European business is coming off of a good quarter, but our experience there, particularly in the NHS, has been \u2013 been challenges around being \u2013 having good line of sight into how the reimbursement mechanisms really play out. So, while we're encouraged that we have a five-year macro agreement with NHS for the pharmacy community there, I think underneath the nuances of the timing and the different mechanisms that make up that framework, we'll have to continue to monitor and evaluate. And those are the two things that first pop to mind. Anything you want to add, Britt? Britt Vitalone : No, I think you captured them correctly, Brian. Operator : And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Good morning. Brain, I just want a follow-up on that last point as you talk about the policy arena. Clearly, specialty has been a growth area. You've talked the whole call about specialty. What are your thoughts around IPI and what it could mean your specialty business?  And then, secondly, as we think about the European markets, what have you learned from the European markets where it is a fixed cost environment versus here in the US? Brian Tyler : Great. Thanks, Lisa. I'll take the IPI business first, the question first. So, IPI is \u2013 I guess there's been a lot of different constructs around getting to part B. There's been discussions of caps or limiting ASP rates, future caps on allowable inflation. IPI would be a proposal to index what the US pays based on a basket of internationally referenced prices for various products. I think there's even been some debate or discussion around MFN or most favored nation type clauses. So, the proposals have really been very wide in the spectrum. And without commenting on any of them specifically, I would say, first and foremost, we think any reform in Part B should be constructed \u2013 and we work with industry, the government and our partners to advocate for this \u2013 in a way that pushes care into the community. It's clearly the low cost, high access setting and we believe it has extremely high quality as well. So, it kind of hits all the three macro principles. And so, any reform that were to happen in our view should move care to the community. Anything that would move the opposite way would be counterproductive really for the US spend on healthcare in general. Now, relative to IPI, if something were to occur, the way I think about this is, in most instances, in our core pharma distribution, in our community provider setting, this is an implication to our customer. So, it'll be a secondary effect really from a wholesaler perspective. The one place we would have some exposure would be in The US Oncology Network, where \u2013 I'd remind you \u2013 through our partnership we share in the practice economics. So, we continue to watch this very closely. I'm not sure there's been a proposal that's had more commentary and more aligned commentary to kind of come out against it because of that impact potentially to patients and patient access and cost of care, but I suppose we'll see what we hear tonight. Lisa Gill : Great. And then, just my follow-up, I just \u2013 Britt, you talked about the Change exit as being one of the key component to 2021. And you said it's consistent with what you've said before. Can you just remind us what you've said before on the timeline of the exit? Britt Vitalone : Sure, Lisa. So, what we've said previously, dating back to our Q2 earnings call, from that point in time, we would expect to exit our transaction in 6 months to 12 months, although it could be before the end of our fiscal 2020. So, I would reiterate that language today. Operator : And next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I had follow-up question on the cost cutting initiative. I think you reduced your corporate expense guidance by about $45 million. Part of it is flow through of cost savings to the bottom line and some timing of investments. By our calculation, it's about $0.18 of EPS. So, as we think about the ongoing benefit of cost cutting, can we just kind of like run rate that $45 million that you said in the fourth quarter? Brian Tyler : Yeah. Let me answer that, Ricky. Certainly, we are pleased with the progress that we're making against our cost initiatives. And I reiterate that we expect to generate $400 million to $500 million of savings by the end of 2021. So, the cost programs are ongoing.  As I called out at the beginning of the year, there were some additional investments that we were going to be making, particularly in the areas of information security management and data and analytics. We continue to make those investments, but we're seeing good efficiency across the organization. So, I don't think you can necessarily take our performance this quarter and just run it out. We're continuing to make investments in the business, but we're also continuing along getting the efficiencies from scale and some of the back office function.  So, what we wanted to do today was to update our guidance based on some of the benefits that we've seen in performance and execution, but we're continuing to make investments along as we generate those savings. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then, one follow-up up on Change. Obviously, I understand that the exit is tax efficient, but can you just remind us, directionally, kind of like the mechanics? Should we expect Change \u2013 what should we expect in term of impact? Would it be neutral to UPS, accretive or dilutive? And same, how should we think about just directionally the impact to cash? Brian Tyler : Yeah. So, let me just remind you that today is the filing that is another step along our exit. We have nothing included in our FY 2020 guidance related to Change. So, there's no additional information that I can provide you on that. And in terms of when we exit, depending on \u2013 regardless of how we exit, there'll be no cash impact. Operator : And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a broader long-term picture on the specialty side, how do we think about the ramp up in sort of additional specialty services you're providing, in particular on the US oncology side, but maybe also in the core business? Are there key moments that cause either providers or other customers to take up those services? Is it something gradual? I'm just sort of looking for a longer term vision of that. Brian Tyler : Yeah, it's a great question and it's obviously an area that we have some excitement about and we have spent really a good part of the last 10 years or 15 years building out, some through internal development and some through acquisition, a set of capabilities that are really oriented around helping manufacturers identify which patients are appropriate and should be benefiting from their therapy, finding those patients and getting them started on that therapy and then ensuring that they stay on that therapy through the full clinically appropriate course, so that they can get the best possible outcome.  So, the first good news in that is that the patient gets the best outcome. We think it's good for the patient, it's good for the healthcare system. Obviously, for our biopharma partners, that can result in more patients benefiting from their products. That has obvious benefit to them and that's a service. Therefore, they're quite interested in paying us for it.  So, as we think about building off of really our 20-year experience in this marketplace, building off of sets of assets that we've required for the commercialization of these products, there's opportunities to both refine and deepen and develop the tools we offer today. A few weeks ago, I shared an example of a program like that, we're calling, Access for More Patients, which fundamentally is getting at the same issue, but it's doing it in a more automated, efficient way that lets us find more patients and get them on those therapies faster. As we look at that as a core, we think there are opportunities to extend downstream and to get earlier stage services to support pharmaceuticals. And as we think about some of our provider segments, there's opportunity to do some integration with providers downstream. So, this is an area that we think, as you look at the pipeline, as you look at the products, as you look at what's happening in terms of \u2013 in the clinical trial space and the fragmentation of population that there's going to continue to be a good opportunity here for McKesson. Elizabeth Anderson : Perfect. That's really helpful. Thank you. Operator : And next will be Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric Coldwell : Thanks. Good morning. So, maybe just focus on the Med Surg segment for a second. You've mentioned the early flu season, consistent with peers. I'm curious if you could carve out for us what you think the incremental benefit of early flu was or heavy flu. And then, I know it's probably a bit early and maybe evolving situation, but coronavirus, any issues with sourcing out of the Asia-Pac region or pricing changes, demand changes in the US as maybe some facilities pre-stock certain gloves, gowns, masks et cetera? Just any questions on interzone coronavirus impact so far would be interesting. Thanks so much. Britt Vitalone : Good morning, Eric. This is Britt. I'll take the first one and let Brian comment on the second. As I talked about in my remarks, we're really pleased with the performance of the medical business. We had good organic growth really across our business, but primarily in our primary care business. And then, I also called out higher pharmaceutical volumes as one of the drivers.  We did see some modest impact from early flu season. I would remind you, though, that typically the flu season has a larger impact on our fourth quarter than our third quarter. We did plan the year for a normal flu season, so we saw a little earlier start than we had anticipated. But, again, I would just remind you that the strong core organic growth across our primary care business, which was inclusive of higher pharmaceutical volumes, was really the driver for the performance. Brian Tyler : I'll take the coronavirus. Maybe before that, we've been around this business for a long time. And we chart every year what the flu season \u2013 influenza season looks like in the US. And every season has its own cycle of rhythm, if you will. And so, I think it's fair to say, we have seen an early start. Ultimately, how that plays out will depend on the duration and the severity and it's probably hard to predict that right now.  Relative to coronavirus, I guess, let me start by first saying, our thoughts and sympathies go out to those, particularly in China, but really Asia, that are obviously dealing with this in a very real time way.  We, at McKesson, have really been working across industry partners, peers, trade associations, government agencies for the better part of three or four weeks. So, we try to jump on these things early and get ahead of them. And so, we're monitoring this very, very closely. I would remind everybody that we don't manufacture these products. We procure them, we sell them and we distribute them. And we do have a domestic supplier base, although the majority of the products, the masks and the disinfectants and gowns are sourced from Asia or China.  I guess, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective, we had some experience with SARS and H1N1. And so, what we're doing is implementing the protocols, the monitoring capabilities that we built up through these prior experiences and working in close coordination with government agencies and industry partners to make sure we can keep the continuity of supply. Now, what that ultimately looks like depends really on how does the virus continue to proliferate. Does it stay contained in a region? So, those are things that we just have to watch. But we wake up every day thinking about the markets that we serve and how we make sure we have products available for our customers that operate in those markets. Operator : And next will be Michael Cherny with BofA Securities. Michael Cherny : Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, a lot of the key topics have been asked.The one thing that did stand out, you highlighted the recent success of the transaction side medical, really rocking it. Pretty low so far from an acquisition perspective, at least in terms of your historical spend year-to-date. As you're heading into fiscal 2021, as you are getting rid of the Change position on the balance sheet and the ownership stake, as you think forward of the portfolio, are there any macro trends that you think would drive some areas or opportunities for you to go and drive inorganic growth or anything from a broader picture perspective where your customers are really asking you to pursue an area that you may not be in or as strong as you would like to be right now? Brian Tyler : Great question. I think we probably, if you look back over the past few years, we came through a cycle of pretty heavy M&A as we really bolstered some of the capabilities and assets that we thought surrounded our specialty biopharma manufacture value prop and our oncology business or ecosystem, however you want to think about that. And as we've done the work to integrate those, and it's a lot of work to integrate these things and to integrate them properly, in parallel, we've really been refining our strategies. And you've probably heard me say this before. All good M&A follows a good strategy. And so, as we've put this strategy together, we've identified the areas that we think we have differentiated capabilities in markets that have good overall growth prospects.  So, when I think about capital deployment, we've obviously got to deploy capital to be invested in efficiency and some client and safe, secure, always-on environments. And then, the second area we'd look for is growth, but those growth investments, meaning M&A investments, have to be closely aligned to the strategy, and I think that that's what you should expect from us. So, we like growth investments. We like growth capital, either extend our capabilities or add scale to the places that we have capabilities. And while we always have to balance, I would say your strategy can't be based on M&A. It takes a buyer and a seller and it takes a price that you can agree on. So, as we've looked at the market and looked at those tradeoffs, obviously, the past 12 months or so, we've been favoring to deploy our capital or buy back our shares because we think those are a great investment, but we continue to be very active in looking for areas we can inorganically help support the growth. Operator : And next will be Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks for the question. So, I wanted to ask about the generics business. You guys have been very clear that gross profit is growing here and that appears to be a pretty different result than the rest of the industry. So, from a macro point of view, it looks to us like the broader market is relatively flat. Just hoping to better understand what's driving your growth here in bigger picture terms. Are you growing generic revenue against the backdrop of stable margins, stable revenue with improving margins, really any color you can add on how you're achieving those results, so we can better assess sustainability going forward would be appreciated. Thank you. Britt Vitalone : Good morning. I'll start and certainly Brian can add on. As we've talked about previously, we're really pleased with a couple of dimensions that lead \u2013 that are around our generics business. First of all, we have a scaled and efficient sourcing operation. We think we source as well as anybody and we continue to find opportunities from a sourcing perspective. We continue to be disciplined in a stable, yet competitive environment. We think that those dynamics are leading to our ability to generic gross profit growth. We are seeing some growth in units. And you combine that with scale in a competitive, but stable market, we think that those are dynamics that are really helping us be very successful in the generics area. Holly Weiss : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. That question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Eric Percher : Thank you. A quick one on Europe. Loud and clear on expense reduction and a little benefit from the UK helping the uptick this quarter on op profit. Is it correct that the German business has not been moved to discontinued ops? So, is that still flowing through? And at some point, would we see that a benefit or maybe a loss might be removed from that segment when the JV is struck or approved? Britt Vitalone : Good morning, Eric. It is true we have not moved it to discontinue operations as it doesn't qualify for discontinued operations. I did talk about a GAAP-only charge that we took in the quarter. And we have the assets as held-for-sale on our balance sheet. Eric Percher : And can you state anything on whether that is in a loss position? Britt Vitalone : I'd just go back to my comments in terms of the loss that we reported from a GAAP-only perspective in the quarter of $282 million. Brian Tyler : Okay. Well, I think that runs us out of time. I want to thank everyone for your great questions and your continued interest in McKesson. I want to thank Jack for facilitating this call.  To conclude, McKesson continued to execute well in the third quarter and we remain confident in our fiscal 2020 outlook. I am extremely proud of how our employees are embracing the team McKesson culture, and I want to thank them for everything they do day in and day out, not only to deliver these results, but most importantly to improve care in every setting we serve.  Thanks again for your interest in McKesson. We will release fourth quarter earnings results in early May. Look forward to talking to you then. Goodbye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.",

Holly Weiss : Thank you, Lashana. Good morning and welcome everyone to McKesson's fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, and Britt Vitalone, our will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today\u2019s release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.meckesson.com. With that let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Holly, and good morning, everybody. Appreciate you being with us on the call today. I sincerely hope that you and your families and your communities are staying healthy and safe as we navigate through these really extraordinary times. Today, we reported a strong finish to our fiscal 2020 with the trends we saw in the fourth quarter prior to the COVID-19 pandemic reflecting a continuation of the momentum we experienced coming into and really throughout our fiscal year.  Throughout McKesson's 187-year history, we've demonstrated time and time again our ability to adapt and swiftly respond to the evolving needs of our customers, particularly in trying times and the resiliency in the long-term strength of our business model. Today, my remarks will echo similar themes. I want to walk you through McKesson's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the essential role we play in the healthcare supply chain, the progress we've made this year against our strategic priorities, and our FY '20 results, including the impact COVID-19 had on our fiscal fourth quarter. I also want to talk about why I'm confident that McKesson remains well positioned now and especially over the longer term. Before I begin, I want to acknowledge and really sincerely thank all of those who are working so tirelessly to keep us healthy and safe during this crisis, including our customers and all frontline healthcare professionals, nurses, physicians, first responders literally around the world. Thank you to each and every one of our 80,000 McKesson associates for their passion, their energy, in many cases, courage these past several months, working around the clock to maintain McKesson's operations and support our customers and frontline caregivers during these challenging times. I want to particularly recognize our colleagues, who are on our front lines, like those in our distribution centers, in our pharmacies in Canada and Europe, supporting community practices and our transportation professionals, your commitment to making it happen, going the extra mile for our customers and rallying around one another in these times, it's -- well, it's just what makes McKesson's culture so special that makes me incredibly proud to be part of team McKesson. As one of the largest healthcare companies in the world we have, and we will continue to play an essential role in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Our response has been guided by the key principles of protecting health and safety for the healthcare supply chain, for our customers and for our employees and the communities in which we all live. Early on, we enacted our business continuity and disaster recovery plans across the organization in order to maintain high-functioning operations around the globe. We assembled a critical care drug task force comprised of our sourcing specialists and individuals with clinical backgrounds in health systems/pharmacy to review guidelines and protocols and to forecast changing pharmaceutical and medical product demand. This task force in conjunction with guidance from our government partners is working to predict, allocate, and extend supply availability to serve the rapidly changing needs of our customers. In addition, our ClarusONE and our global sourcing teams in London are working closely with manufacturers to understand their plans and to create new capacity or scale-up production, so that we can be prepared to swiftly react as a supply chain in the coming weeks, months, and years ahead. McKesson is partnering with government agencies at the federal, state, and local level along with other along with other industry leaders to creatively solve for the most complex and pressing issues this crisis presents. As demand surges for personal protective equipment, or PPE, McKesson is doing everything within our power to identify new sources, manufacturers, and markets for these critically needed products. We are very proud of our partnership with Walmart to produce and deliver medical gowns to the U.S. Our two companies have collaborated in an entirely new way by bringing expert teams together and moving with remarkable speed, which has led to two million additional medical gowns in our country supply to-date, and we expect roughly 10 million will be added by the end of June. In Europe and Canada, our retail pharmacies have remained open, providing the essential community-based care that our customers rely on. We implemented several changes in our retail pharmacies to ensure our customers feel comfortable and safe, including limiting the number of customers in stores, installing protective shields at pharmacy counters, dedicating shopping times for seniors and for first responders, and regularly disinfecting all high-touch areas. We're also expanding our pharmacy services to include virtual health offerings, home delivery in certain markets, and increased online pharmacy capabilities. We've undertaken multiple measures to protect and promote the well-being of our employees. These include comprehensive sanitation protocols for our distribution centers and office facilities, work-from-home technology for our office-based employee, enhanced medical benefits including telemedicine and wellness offerings and emergency paid sick leaves. Some of our very first actions were to recognize the stress that this situation would put on our front-line workers and our communities, so we made special payments to reward the hard work of our associates on the front line and to bring some comfort and sense of calm to their families. We increased funding to our Take Care of Our Own Fund to help with expenses such as child care, groceries, housing, and utilities. And we increased our foundation funding to support our communities in their time of great need, including donations to support local food banks in communities where McKesson distribution centers are located around the U.S. Our approach to address the pandemic underscores our value system and how we carry out our vision to improve care in every setting, one product, one partner, one patient at a time. Turning now to our financial performance. We're going to review our fiscal 2020 results, our fiscal 2021 outlook, and why we're so confident in McKesson's long-term future, despite the near-term uncertainties that are really facing everyone. In fiscal 2020, McKesson delivered strong revenue and adjusted operating profit growth across the business. Our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share result of $14.95, which was up 10% versus the prior year reflects continuing momentum and transformation within our business. Coming into the CEO role a little over a year ago, I focused the organization around three strategic priorities, which I shared during our analyst meeting in December. I'd remind you, these priorities were growing our core U.S. pharma business, investing in the areas where we have differentiated capability and growth prospects and simplifying the business and better aligning the organization. I'm extremely pleased with the meaningful progress we made in executing against these strategic priorities in fiscal 2020. In our U.S. Pharmaceutical Specialty and Solutions segment, we finished the year with the highest level of adjusted operating profit growth in our last four fiscal years. And we again this year successfully renewed large customers while being disciplined in our approach to the market, most recently, having been selected by the VA to continue to serve as their prime pharmaceutical vendor. We believe our strong value proposition and superior customer service quality are foundational to this success. Our cost and working capital efficiencies underpin this growth and further fuel the strategic investments we're making in the business. We view our investments in data and analytics as investments in foundational capability, leveraging our scale to deliver greater value for our customers. We're also making investments into areas where we believe we have differentiated capability and opportunity for growth. In alignment with our strategic growth initiatives, we're expanding our manufacturer value proposition to drive more innovation, better patient outcome, and additional uptake for our manufacturer partners. We're harnessing our decades of experience in patient access and adherence programs and combining it with the connectivity and reach of CoverMyMeds within our MRxTS business to deliver new capabilities at accelerated speed. And we continue to prioritize specialty as a key area of future growth of investments. We have been building and investing in our portfolio of differentiated specialty assets for more than a decade, which gives us great expertise in areas like oncology. Our third strategic priority centered around simplifying the business and aligning the organization. We are becoming a more focused, more aligned and more agile company, a foundation that served us well during our COVID-19 pandemic response. In fiscal 2020, we transformed our operating model through initiatives like our spin smart program and centralizing functional services across North America and in Europe. Evidence of our success in rationalizing costs and streamlining back-office functions is also reflected in our positive European segment fiscal 2020 results. Our Canadian business successfully streamlined its organization structure to better serve our retail and wholesale operations customers. This strategic change, combined with the continued execution of actions taken in the prior year, translated into good profit growth for the Canadian business this year. We also invested a significant amount of time in our culture transformation and leveraged our corporate headquarters relocation to Texas to strengthen our management team. Five new members have joined my management team this year, and I could not new be more pleased with how quickly the team has united together to execute our strategic and cultural priorities. One of the most visible accomplishments we made in fiscal 2020 towards simplifying the business was the completion of our exit of Change Healthcare. This is a significant milestone in our company's history that was nearly four years in the making, and we're pleased to deliver on our commitment to create shareholder value through a tax-efficient exit. Let me turn now to the trends that we're currently seeing on our business and how and how we're planning ahead for fiscal 2021 in light of these near-term macro uncertainties. I'll discuss these trends really in kind of more real-time granularity than we typically would and then Britt will further elaborate on my comments. We really want to help you understand how the rapidly evolving environment impacted not just our FY 2020 results, but also our FY 2021 outlook. I'll start in the U.S. and Specialty Solutions segment. We saw increased demand in pharmaceutical sales during the month of March as consumers prepared for an extended stay-at-home. In turn, pharmaceutical sales declined below pre-pandemic levels in April, coinciding with the start of our fiscal year. More pronounced was the decline in specialty provider volumes, primarily in the non-oncology markets. In Oncology, as evidenced by U.S. oncology practices, despite a decline in routine office visits such as consults and follow-ups, we are seeing relative signs of stability in oncology volumes as patients remain on their treatment regimens. In our Medical business, our alternate site customers are facing significant headwinds, with providers and surgery centers seeing sharp declines in office visits due to shelter-in-place guidelines that have taken effect. In our Technology, our MRxTS business, we're seeing lower prior authorization volume as a result of provider office closures and relaxed and sometimes extended requirements from payers. And in Canada and Europe, our retail pharmacy operations are navigating how to adapt to changing consumer needs as retail traffic is impacted by social distancing guidelines. While it is still early in the quarter, we are currently seeing positive indicators and encouraging signs across all of our businesses that activities are beginning to pick up in the communities where shelter-in-place guidelines are being relaxed. With this as our environmental backdrop, we carefully and thoughtfully constructed our fiscal 2021 outlook based on what we know today. Our fiscal 2021 outlook of $13.95 to $14.75 of adjusted earnings per diluted share factors in several macroeconomic and business-specific detailed assumptions. Britt is going to take you through the detailed assumptions of our outlook, but let me comment on why we remain confident now more than ever in McKesson's future. We have proven our resiliency and natural ability to lead during times of crisis such as H1N1, SARS, recession of 2008-2009. I think the lessons we've learned and the expertise we've gained continue to serve us well. We operate from a position of financial strength. Our strong balance sheet, access to capital markets, strong credit ratings provide us great financial flexibility. Our fiscal 2020 results reinforce the operational momentum we're generating in our business and we have repeatedly demonstrated our willingness and commitment to make the right, not always easy, but right decision is the best position of the business for a long-term growth. Despite the near-term challenges, we remain focused on executing against our priorities and investing in our strategic growth initiatives. The positive energy, dedication, commitment and togetherness of team McKesson is unmatched, and I do believe our future is bright. Again, thank you for your time, and let me now turn it over to Britt. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal fourth fiscal fourth quarter was certainly very different quarter than we were expecting when we last spoke during our third quarter earnings call. The COVID-19 health crisis has impacted the way our employees, customers, partners and communities live and work. We could not be prouder of how our teams across the world have responded. In this new environment, our team supported our employees, customers, patients and communities and demonstrated the resiliency and strength of our business with solid financial performance during these challenging times. Let me start by reaffirming that the fundamentals of McKesson's business are solid. Our strategy is clear, and the prospects for the business remain unchanged and promising. Despite the challenges and uncertainties of the current environment, our businesses continue to play a leading role in the health care supply chain. Our focus, execution and financial discipline remain intact. Today, I'll provide you with more granularity than I typically do to help you understand our view on recent trends and how our business is performing in this uncertain and rapidly evolving environment. I have three primary goals for today's call. First, to provide an update on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results, including the estimated impacts from COVID-19. Second, to provide an overview of the recent trends we are seeing. And third, to provide a detailed fiscal 2021 outlook. Many companies have withdrawn and not provided guidance. However, given the uncertainties in the environment and the wide disparity across analyst models, we felt it was important to provide our assumptions and views on the upcoming fiscal year. I will address our guidance in more detail later in my prepared remarks. However, I'd like to provide a bit of framing as it relates to fiscal 2021. The guidance we are providing today assumes that the first half of fiscal 2021 will be challenging with the most severe fiscal 2021 will be challenging with the most severe impacts from COVID-19 occurring during our fiscal first quarter ending June 30. We anticipate that we begin to see gradual improvement in our fiscal second quarter ending September 30 with continued improvement in our results over the second half of our fiscal year. Let me state at the beginning of this call. We expect the business will deliver growth in adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second half of the fiscal year, as compared to 2020 when setting aside the fiscal 2020 contribution from our prior equity stake in Change Healthcare. Let's turn now to a review of our fiscal 2020 results. McKesson posted a solid close to fiscal 2020 with full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $14.95. This result was 10% above fiscal 2019 and included a return to adjusted operating profit growth in all reportable cycles. Additionally, we're pleased to have completed the successful exit of our investment in Change Healthcare during the quarter through a tax-efficient split off transaction. Our exit resulted in a pre and post-tax gain of $414 million, which impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. With the split-off complete, we are well positioned to move forward with increased focus against our strategic growth initiatives. Our balance sheet remains solid, which underpins our investment grade credit rating. Our financial position provides us the flexibility necessary to navigate current market uncertainty and future growth opportunities. On our February 4 third quarter earnings call, I discussed momentum building across the business. This momentum continued to build through mid-March. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Shortly after, our businesses experienced increased demand and consumer behavior patterns began to change, as the virus continued to spread. Pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the U.S., Europe and Canada, increased, as people stocked up on medications and personal protective equipment. This incremental demand provided a net tailwind to our fourth quarter revenue results. I want to take a moment to provide the estimated impact of COVID-19 on our fiscal fourth quarter consolidated results. There's approximately $2 billion of incremental revenue, resulting primarily from higher customer demand for pharmaceuticals. We expect this reverse in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted gross profit in the quarter was favorably impacted by approximately $65 million, offset by approximately $15 million in variable operating expenses, as a result of these incremental volumes. We also had approximately $45 million of one-time adjusted operating expenses in the quarter, including investments in our frontline employees, higher expenses to support a remote workforce and charitable contributions to support our communities. In summary, the impact of COVID-19 had a nominal effect on our fourth quarter adjusted earnings results, as the previously mentioned impacts largely offset. Let's transition now to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.27, up 16% in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a lower share count in growth in the European Pharmaceutical and U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions businesses, offset by higher corporate expenses, which includes the one-time costs I referenced earlier. Moving to the details of our consolidated results, which can be found on slide four. Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter increased 12% versus the prior period, principally driven by growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. As previously mentioned, the estimated impact of COVID-19 was approximately $2 billion of incremental revenue in the quarter. Excluding these incremental sales, consolidated revenues increased approximately 8% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted gross profit was up 7% year-over-year, led by growth in our Medical-Surgical and U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segments. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year, driven by increased investments to support future growth in our oncology and specialty businesses, technology infrastructure and the previously mentioned one-time expenses during the quarter. These incremental one-time and COVID-driven expenses accounted for approximately 3% of the year-over-year increase. Adjusted income from operations was $1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 1% as compared to the prior year. Interest expense was $65 million in the quarter, a decline of 7% compared to the prior year, due to lower commercial paper balances. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.3% for the quarter, mainly driven by our mix of business and discrete tax benefits. Wrapping up our consolidated results. Our fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares were 174 million, a decrease of 9% year-over-year. Our adjusted earnings results includes a $0.07 benefit from our previously mentioned split-off of Change Healthcare, which lowered our shares outstanding by $15.4 million. Next, I'll review our results, which can be Slides 5 through 8, starting with the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Revenues were $46.3 billion for the quarter, up 13% and driven by branded pharmaceutical price increases and growth from our large retail national account customers, including incremental volume resulting from COVID-19. These were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $772 million, driven by continued growth in specialty businesses, partially offset by previously announced investments in the oncology and manufacturer services. Segment adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 6% to $2.7 million and the segment adjusted operating margin for was 146 basis points, a decrease of 4 basis points. Next European Pharmaceutical Solutions, revenues were $7.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of 6% year-over-year. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues increased 9% driven by growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution business, including incremental revenue as a result of COVID-19. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 226% to $75 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 239%, driven in part by lower operating expenses as a result of actions previously taken to rationalize our store footprint and streamline back-office functions and the lapping of a prior year inventory charge of approximately $20 million. Segment adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 5% to $231 million, driven primarily by expense rationalization and the previously mentioned prior year item. The segment adjusted operating margin for the full year was 84 basis points, an increase of 4 basis points. Moving now to Medical Surgical, revenues were $2.2 billion for the quarter, up 13%, driven by organic growth led by our primary care business, including higher pharmaceutical and flu test kit volumes. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was down 1% to $170 million, driven primarily by higher expenses in the quarter, which included a provision for bad debt in our primary care business, partially offset by organic growth, principally in our primary care business. Segment adjusted operating margin for the full year increased 12% to $679 million driven by organic growth and the segment adjusted operating margin for the full year was 818 basis points, an increase of 24 basis points. Finishing our business review with Others. Revenues were $2.9 billion for the quarter, up 3% and on an FX-adjusted basis revenues were up 4%, driven primarily by growth in the Canadian and MRxTS businesses. Adjusted operating profit was $242 million for the quarter, down 6% on both the reported and FX-adjusted basis, driven primarily by a lower equity contribution from the company's investment in each healthcare, partially offset by organic growth in the MRxTS business. Other adjusted operating profit for the full year was down 4% to $953 million, driven by the lapping of a $90 million contractual liability reversal related to our investment in Change Healthcare in the prior year, partially offset by higher volumes offset by higher volumes in our MRxTS businesses. Included in Other, adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $253 million for the full year. As a reminder, McKesson will no longer record adjusted equity income for Change Healthcare beginning in fiscal 2021 as a result of the split-off. Moving to Corporate McKesson reported $224 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the quarter, an increase of 25% year-over-year, driven primarily by the previously mentioned onetime expenses and higher opioid-related legal fees. These onetime expenses accounted for approximately 8% of the year-over-year increase. For the full year adjusted corporate expenses were $685 million, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year increase was a result of planned increases in technology-related investments and an increase of $36 million in opioid related litigation cost to $150 million for fiscal 2020. Turning now to cash, which can be found on slide 10. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow, which includes $506 million spent on capital expenditures. Fiscal 2020 represented another solid year of cash flow generation, resulting from our continued focus on working capital efficiency, deposit timing impacts in COVID-19. Similar to fiscal 2019, a portion of the fiscal 2020 result was due to favorable timing in our U.S. distribution and European businesses. We also benefited from the previously mentioned demand pull-forward in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which coincided with the end of our fiscal year. We estimate a COVID-19-related benefit of approximately $550 million which is expected to reverse in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4 billion after paying down approximately $2.4 billion of debt in the fourth quarter, net of issuances, which include a repayment of $2.1 billion of outstanding commercial paper. And in fiscal 2020, we returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Wrapping up fiscal 2020 results. Our performance in the fourth quarter highlights the resiliency of our business model and the strength of our financial position. Fiscal 2020 marked a return to adjusted operating profit growth across every business, reflecting improved fundamentals and solid execution. Despite recent macroeconomic headwinds, the company is in a solid and stable financial position. With that, let me turn to our fiscal 2021 outlook. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe it is important to provide our views of the environment, insight into the trends we are seeing across our businesses and to provide an outlook for fiscal 2021. We believe it's constructive to provide you with our view of the business, including our perspective on the economic uncertainties surrounding the potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We take a long-term approach to our businesses. And although the COVID-19 pandemic presents a near-term headwind, we believe this to be temporary. The underlying fundamentals of our business remains stable and on solid footing as evidenced by our Q4 and full year results for fiscal 2020. I'll start by providing a brief overview of the environment we are operating within. After the initial volume spikes following the March 11 World Health Organization declaration, volumes began to trend lower across our businesses. In April, the landscape continued to evolve quickly in state, provincial and local governments issued shelter in place orders. As a result, physician offices and surgery center sites began to close temporarily, meaning fewer patients going to see their doctors and delays in elective procedures. Throughout April, average weekly volumes in our medical and specialty provider business trailed off up to 50% of pre COVID-19 levels. Oncology visits declined, while volumes in our pharmaceutical distribution and retail businesses experienced greater levels of volatility, as customers adjusted to the environment and government orders and recommendations. From the onset of the pandemic in the U.S., elective therapies showed a sharp decline through April, especially within ophthalmology, where declines were nearly 30% versus calendar 2019. In the first couple of weeks of May, we've seen volumes begin to o stabilize and modestly improve in our pharmaceutical and retail businesses. Volumes in our medical and specialty provider businesses have also begun to stabilize, although well below pre-COVID levels. To this point, the relative shape of the curve is in line with our expectations and confirms our view on the progression of recovery over the course of fiscal 2021. I will note that the guidance we are providing today is based on what we know at this time, and I want to be clear that one certainty is that events will occur in the coming days, weeks and months that will cause these underlying assumptions to change from what we present to you today. Next, I'll provide some framing on a couple of key macro level economic assumptions. We are not assuming that a second wave of the virus returns, leading the shelter to home scenarios precluding patient consumption of healthcare services, supplies and pharmaceutical products. We are not assuming any systemic customer insolvency events. We do assume that unemployment peaks in our fiscal first quarter, and gradually begins to improve across the remaining quarters of our fiscal year. We do assume that physician in an oncology office visits and pharmacy interactions will begin to gradually resume in our fiscal second quarter and continue to improve in the back half of our fiscal year. Our view of the environment, in particular, our largest market, the U.S., assumes that the impact, in particular, to our medical, specialty provider and oncology businesses is more significant and severe in the first quarter and that the shape of the recovery gradually improves each quarter with a return to more normal volumes in our fiscal fourth quarter. With those underlying assumptions in mind, let me turn to our fiscal 2021 guidance. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $13.95 to $14.75, which is notably wider than past guidance ranges, given the economic uncertainty inherent in our previously mentioned assumptions. As I discussed in my opening remarks, we anticipate a positive progression of earnings over the course fiscal 2021. We expect Q1 to be sharply down on a year-over-year and sequential basis. We assume modest recovery begins in our fiscal second quarter and that this recovery progresses into the back half of the fiscal year, with the business returning to adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share, growth in the second half of the fiscal year. For a full list of fiscal 2021 assumptions, please refer to slides 12 through 14 in our supplemental slide presentation. Rather than outlining each assumption, I'll just walk you through the key items, starting with the segments. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, we expect 3% to 6% revenue growth, which considers current headwinds in our practice management and provider solutions businesses, as a result of office closures and delays in elective procedures. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be flat to 4% down as compared to the prior year, as a result of the previously mentioned headwinds in our specialty businesses. We expect that the second half adjusted operating profit result will reflect flat to 3% growth, in line with our previously outlined recovery assumptions. In the U.S. market, we anticipate mid-single-digit branded pharmaceutical price increases, largely consistent with our experience in fiscal 2020. As a reminder, approximately 95% of our contracted branded manufacturers are on a fixed fee-for-service rate basis. Moving to the European Solutions segment. We expect revenues to be flat to a 5% decline as compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating profit is also expected to decline between approximately 20% to 25% and driven by anticipated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer behavior patterns over the first half of the fiscal year. We expect that the second half adjusted operating profit results will be flat to 2% growth as compared to the prior year with variability by country as each market opens and begins to return to normal. Transitioning now to Medical Surgical. As we've discussed previously, we have a dynamic and broad portfolio in Medical Surgical. Approximately 60% of our medical-surgical business supports primary care sites, physician offices, ambulatory surgery centers and reference lab locations. These sites of care have been impacted more significantly, as office visits and electric procedures have been canceled or deferred. In constructing our outlook for the Medical-Surgical segment, we developed several potential outcomes to inform the range from the low end to the high end of our estimates. We projected it could take a few quarters for patients to get comfortable returning to physician office sites, and with scheduling an elective procedure, but we do believe this demand will return. Over the past few weeks, we've seen our medical-surgical business begin to stabilize, and we see modest improvements in volumes. We expect the recovery and demand to continue through our fiscal second quarter with further improvements in the second half of our fiscal year. Therefore, we expect a 3% to 8% revenue decline, primarily driven by softened demand in the first half of the fiscal year. As a result of these macro level headwinds. We also expect a 10% to 20% adjusted operating profit decline for the full year. As demand continues to improve, we expect that the second half adjusted operating profit results will grow 5% to 15% as compared to the prior year. For the remaining businesses included in Other, revenue is expected to decline approximately 7% to 12%, driven by expected lower foot traffic in retail stores across Canada in the short-term and lower prior authorization volumes. As a reminder, fiscal 2020 results include our investment in Change Healthcare, which included $253 million in adjusted equity income in fiscal 2020. Excluding the Change Healthcare results in the prior year for comparison purposes, we expect that adjusted operating profit within other will be flat to down 5% for the full year, but it is expected to increase greater than 10% in the second half of the fiscal year as the businesses within other return to normal volumes. Now let me turn to the consolidated view. We expect 2% to 4% revenue growth and adjusted income from operations is anticipated to be a 10% to 15% decline as compared to the prior year. Excluding the results of Change Healthcare from fiscal 2020, we expect that adjusted income from operations will decline 5% to 8% for the full year, but will grow 6% to 10% in the second half of the fiscal year on a year-over-year basis in line with our stated economic recovery assumptions. We expect corporate expenses to be approximately flat compared to prior year, and this assumption reflects opioid-related litigation costs to also be roughly flat year-over-year. We remain focused on our cost savings programs. Our annual pretax gross cost savings target remains approximately $400 million to $500 million, which we are on track to substantially realize for the end of are on track to substantially realize for the end of fiscal 2021. Additionally, we've implemented mitigation efforts in light of the headwinds presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, including an effort continue to reduce controllable spend across all categories. Moving below the line, we expect interest expense in the range of $230 million to $250 million. We expect income attributable to non-controlling interest in the range of $200 million to $220 million. We assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. We anticipate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements be a net unfavorable impact of approximately $0.05. And we expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2021 to be in approximately $161 million to $163 million. Let me wrap-up our fiscal 2021 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. We expect free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses and includes the pull forward impacts of COVID-19 previously discussed. We will use our cash flow to continue to invest internally in our strategic priorities of oncology and manufacturer services. We anticipate property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses to be in the range of $400 million to $550 million. At McKesson, capital deployment starts with our continued ability to generate healthy operating cash flow. We will continue a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment. Our priorities remain clear and consistent. Our demonstrated history of solid cash flow generation provides us flexibility in our capital allocation program. First, we prioritize growth investments in our strategic assets. As an example, in Q4, we continued to invest into our oncology and manufacturer services assets and capabilities to extend our differentiated and leading positions. In fiscal 2021, we will continue to invest in our strategic initiatives to drive further differentiation and position our businesses for long-term growth. The current environment does not impact our desire to invest in M&A opportunities that are on strategy at multiples that offer superior returns on capital and accelerate future growth and cash flow generation. We also remain committed to returning to capital to our shareholders through a modest yet growing dividend and share buybacks. And I would remind you that we currently have $1.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We've maintained our investment-grade credit rating, which underpins our financial flexibility and our ability to access the long-term debt in commercial paper markets. We also have access to $4 billion through our revolving credit facility, which has not been drawn upon. At this time, we have no immediate need to access the long-term debt market nor draw upon our revolver to meet near-term liquidity needs. In closing, we are pleased with the results of our fiscal fourth quarter and proud of how we responded to the extraordinary demands brought on by this pandemic. We remain focused on our employees, customers, partners, and communities. While the external environment presents many unknowns, our businesses continue to show resilient and stable fundamentals along with consistent execution. We continue to have a solid balance sheet and healthy cash generation, which underpin our investment grade credit rating, and we'll continue to deploy capital to invest in growth areas aligned to our strategy, aimed at creating balanced returns for our shareholders. Despite the current macroeconomic headwinds, we remain confident in our business and in our ability to create stability and supply chain through the strength of our sourcing and distribution operations. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I\u2019d ask you to limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Cherny : Good morning. Thank you for all the details. I wanted to just ask a bit of a follow-up clarification, additional question on the pharma EBIT guidance. In particular, you talked about 0% to 3% growth in the second half of the year on an adjusted profit basis, so as you think about the ramping, should we assume that you\u2019ll be exiting fiscal 2021 at a \u2013\u201cnormalized run rate?\u201d, and in jumping into fiscal 2022 on what should be the normalized run rate of profit growth for the Pharma segment in particular? Britt Vitalone : Mike, thanks for that question. I'll start and let Brian add on to that. We're very pleased with our performance in our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions segment in fiscal 2020. We finished the year with full year adjusted operating profit of 6%. We had strong revenue growth throughout the year. And as we talked about, we expect that the first half of the year, we're going to have some more sharp impacts on our Specialty Solutions businesses, which will impact obviously the full year operating profit. As we talked about, we expect that to continue to improve throughout the year. And as we get to the back half of the year, that gradual improvement throughout each quarter will lead us to get back to growth for the second half of the year. And so I think that as you think about this, there's going to be gradual improvement across each quarter. As we get to the end of the year, we're going to be exiting on a growth basis again, and feel good about the prospects from that point forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the question. I guess, maybe, Britt, just to follow-up on that. I mean, coming into fiscal 2020, you guys had thought the U.S. Pharma and Specialty business could grow at 3% to 5%. I'm sure there was a little bit of pull forward in the 4Q. But generally, business performed in line to slightly better than that. I mean, just to follow-up on your previous answer. I mean, is the assumption that the business gets back to those levels as we get through the year, and in particular into 4Q? And then just one housekeeping. I know you mentioned the $45 million of one-time adjusted operating expenses in the fourth quarter. I was curious if that was included, excluded, and then what's the assumption for additional COVID-related costs in 2020 guide? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yeah. Thanks for the question. Let me just step back to your first question. Again, as we talked about, in our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions business, it's a broad business, U.S. Pharma distribution, but also a broad-based specialty set of businesses, which includes our multi-specialty provider businesses, which as we talked about have been more severely impacted in April and early May, and we expect to have a greater impact through the first quarter with just gradual improvement throughout the balance of the year. So as we think about that second half of the year, it's really going to be that continued improvement of not only volumes, but profitability across both of those businesses. And we feel comfortable that getting to a 0% to 3% growth in the balance of the second half, again, with that gradual improvement sets us up well to returning to that 3% to 5% as we go forward. We won't recover all of the volumes this year. We'll recover it gradually throughout the year. But again, I just would point out that our broad-based specialty business, which includes our provider business and our practice management business are more impacted and are going to gradually improve over the balance of the year. The $45 million that I referenced earlier on that was across all of our businesses. It was, as Brian mentioned, to pay bonuses to frontline workers in each of our businesses as well as donations that we made across communities as well as cost to set up remote work environments, again, in our corporate environment, but also in our businesses. That's obviously part of the year-over-year comparison that is included in our FY 2020 Q4 results, and that will be included in for comparison purposes in FY 2021. Brian Tyler : Yes. Those are actions taken really early part of March as we assess the impact this would have on our teams, and frankly anticipated the impact on our communities. And we thought it was just an important part of who we are as a company to take those actions. Obviously, as we look to the year coming ahead, there will be some incremental expense to support social distancing, workplace reengineering, protection of customers, and employees, and will be continued to be committed to make whatever investments we need to, to take care of them. Holly Weiss : Next question. Operator : Your next question will come from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. Eric Coldwell : Thanks very much. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. A couple of just unrelated questions. First one, share repurchase. You expressed interest in continuing with that program, but weighted average shares outstanding, guidance seems a little bit higher than we would have expected given the low share price right now. I'm just curious if you can give us any specificity on what you're thinking about share repos? Second question, unrelated. U.S. oncology. Would be great to get an update on what you're seeing real-time with your practice management business and what impacts you're getting from COVID? Thanks very much. Britt Vitalone : Thanks, Eric. Let me start and take the first one off the table and then turn it over to Brian. As I mentioned, in the fourth quarter through the exit of Change Healthcare, we retired 15.4 million shares. And we've given you a guide of 161 million to 163 million. Our capital deployment program will include broad-based, balanced approaches we always have, and that will include M&A as it presents itself on strategy and with good returns, but it will also include continued to return capital to our shareholders which could include share repurchases, and we do have $1.5 billion remaining on the authorization, and we'll continue to use that to return capital as it's appropriate. Brian Tyler : Yes. Let me maybe take up the U.S. oncology question. So we worked very closely with our partners in the practices to respond to this unprecedented time, and it's impacted all care providers. The U.S. oncology patient visits have certainly declined as social distancing guidelines were implemented, and that impact is really varied depending on what kind of oncology, what kind of answer you're experiencing? You see in the very fast-moving aggressive cancers, patient volume has not fallen off so much and some of the solid tumor cancers where progression is slower, people are more hesitant to go in and get testing, get diagnosis, may feel they had some time to delay. So we have seen a bit of visit decline, but the revenue decline has been less than the visit decline, which is encouraging to us. We've also taken actions to implement things like telepresence or virtual consultation services, and we've ramped up that pretty significantly in the last few months. So overall, I think, I'd say, we feel good about our positioning, oncology of all the ologies or specialties has probably been a little more insulated as you think about diseases that's probably not unexpected. But we continue to work closely with our practices to think about all the ways we can help feel make patients feel more comfortable to returning to their care. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you for the details and for your efforts. A question on MedSurg, the metric on 60% of this being provider focused was helpful. I imagine there's some very different dynamics in the ASC versus the physician office. Could you help us with an understanding of what your distribution business here focuses on? I'm thinking less on PP&E potential benefits there. Are there significant pharmaceutical elements? Is there a number that you can provide us relative to the pharmaceutical component of medical and any expectations for vaccines or experience with the vaccines for children's program? How is that running? And how might you participate in vaccines in the future? Brian Tyler : Great. Thanks, Eric. Appreciate that question. Our medical business does have a significant footprint in primary care, which we include the ambulatory surgery center in there. And within the kinds of practices, and we serve basically all different kinds of practices from general practitioners, OB GYN, even up to special \u2013 more specialty-oriented practices with medical products. And so there's been a pretty wide variation in the way specific specialties or focuses of those practice would have responded. And as you're well aware, we have a very broad offering to these practices. It is PP&E, which is tends to be a pretty small, historically, a very small part of these practices. Obviously, in the last months with social distancing and all the changes we've all experience, the PP&E demand is up significantly. But we're also in specialty Rx, Rx, lab, equipment, reagents, I mean, we've very, very broad business. And what I would say to you is that, we see patients volumes decline, and as Britt reviewed the metrics that we've seen there. I mean, really, all of those various elements have been impacted. And as patients begin to return to the practices, we think we'll begin to see those volumes all rebuild over the course of the coming year. It's obviously, from a vaccine perspective, it's a little early. Vaccines are not on market. But I would remind everybody, we have quite an extensive footprint in the distribution of vaccines today. We do distribute vaccines through the medical business to all of our practice areas. We work with CDC and their Vaccine for Children program as a supplier of those vaccines. Many years ago when H1N1 hit us, we worked with public partners to facilitate a program to manage that vaccine. So we're very engaged with all the various agencies that will have interest in this interest in this with our manufacturer partners to make sure we're availing our insights and our knowledge and our capability. And I suspect that as vaccines come to market, acceptance ramps up, we'll have to look at what is the production, how does that production scale up and how fast? but we would expect to be very engaged in those discussions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and good morning. Brian, can you give us an update on where you are as far as an opioid potential settlement? I know we talked about the framework, which was several months ago. Sitting here today, I would anticipate that states being in a difficult financial position may be more likely to want to move forward. So if you could just give us any update there, that would be really helpful. Brian Tyler : Sure, Lisa. I'd be happy to. I mean, probably goes without saying that our primary focus the last weeks and months has been on responding to COVID-19, supporting our communities and our customers in that response. And I'm sure the same has been true for a lot of the public officials that have been involved, I guess, on the other side of this opioid issue. I really don't think there's a lot to add to the opioid issue. I really don't think there's a lot to add to the commentary we provided last time in terms of the specifics of the settlement discussions. I mean, we continue to be engaged we continue to be hopeful that a broad resolution can be achieved. We do think that one of the drivers has always been for us, the recognition that people and communities have needs, and it would be great to get the resolution for them and those needs are probably greater now than ever. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Hey good morning guys. Brian or Britt, as I think about the guidance, and obviously, I appreciate all the color you've given in terms of your assumptions. But as we stare down a recession heading into 2021, I mean, based on your experience being with the company during the last recession, how are you thinking about just the likely decline in physician office visits and how your business will be resilient through that? Brian Tyler : Great question. We've -- our business has been through many economic cycles over its history. Fortunately, Britt and I have been here for all of them, but we were here for the '08, '09. What I would say in general is, I think our business model is pretty resilient to an economic recession. And I think if you look back over history, you would see that to be the case. I will say this situation is a little bit different, though, because it's an economic recession, but it's really driven by an underlying health pandemic and so in my mind, the way the business will respond is a little bit more about how we respond to the health pandemic than a \u201cRecession\u201d. The faster patients get comfortable being out of their homes, the faster they get comfortable going into health care settings, the faster social policy, testing, tracing, all these things we're talking about in the business and the public community as these comes to place and our confidence resumes, I think that's really what's going to tilt the trajectory. And so for me, it's much more about how healthcare demand comes back than the general economic climate. I mean, there's always puts and takes with are you uninsured with no coverage? Do you go to the Medicaid? But those are -- we tend to be a little insulated from that. So I think it's really all about how quickly confidence comes back in patients consuming health care services. Britt Vitalone : Yes. I might just add that our guidance really assumes that health care demand will return. We've seen that in prior recessions like this. And our guidance really assumes that it's a gradual build over the course of the year. We're already seeing some -- as I mentioned, we're seeing some evidence of modest increases in May that's early obviously, but we do expect that health care demand will return, and we do expect that we'll be well positioned for that and really in all the different settings that we participate in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Stephen Baxter : Hey, thanks for the question. I hope you all are doing well. This is a bit of a follow-up on the prior question about the economy in a more normalized recession. I was hoping you could spend a little time talking about how we should think about the financial healthier customers and how you could see the business being impacted by that in the coming months and years. For example, there are headlines in the news today were even large and well-funded businesses are seeking relief from landlords. So I guess, what, if anything, are your customers asking of you at this stage? Any insight into your conversations with your customers would be helpful? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Thanks for that question. And it's a really good question. And we've been working with our customers since the pandemic really started, and particularly those customers who have had to shut their doors on a temporary basis. We did record a small incremental reserve in our medical business in the fourth quarter, and I called that out. It's really more a mechanical adjustment. We've been working very closely to try to understand when they -- when these customers would reopen, what the demand is in each of their businesses. And to this point, our customers have either been able to go out and get loans or access public funds that are available, we work very closely with us, and we've been able to help them and really understand what their situation is. So we've not really seen a degradation in credit quality to this point. We'll continue to work very closely with those relationships. At this point, I think our customers are very resilient as well, and we're very close in working with them to keep them as credit resilient as possible. Britt Vitalone : Yes. And based on the way we've described our expectation for volume to come back gradually over the course of the year and based on what we see now, you did call out that we built into our assumptions is that there is no major insolvency event now our assumptions play out correctly based on our conversations and what we are seeing, that will continue to be true. So risk, we'll monitor very closely over the course of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning, Brian and Britt, I hope everyone is staying safe. So I just have two interrelated questions on the European business. First, I guess, I'm curious how the German JV transaction with Walgreens impacts the FY 2021 guidance for the European segment. Germany generally included or excluded from the European guidance. And then second, I guess, whether Germany is in there or not, I guess, what really sticks out to me is that the magnitude of the expected decline in operating profit in Europe, minus 20% to minus 25% relative to the revenue guide, 0% to minus 5%, 6% out a little bit, suggesting some notable negative operating leverage in Europe versus some of the other segments. Any color on the dynamics there would help as well. Thanks. Brian Tyler : Generally. So start with the German JV. I don't think this will be material to our fiscal 2020 -- fiscal 2021. It is in competition review right now. We think it's continuing to progress on the timelines we expected to. So not really a lot to add to that. As it relates to the fiscal 2021 impact on Europe, I mean, obviously, we're dealing with 13 countries that are going to have \u2013 have had 13 different kind of degrees of challenge and reaction with associated social policy to that challenge. And so, when we look at an aggregate level, it's going to depend a little bit on how these countries open and what their response will be. I will say that in the U.K., our largest country in Europe, I mean, they have been one of the more severely impacted and have had some of the more severe social restrictions implied, and that's what you're seeing really flow through our numbers. Britt Vitalone : Maybe if I would just add on. Our German business, as we talked about previously, is relatively immaterial to the overall European results. It is included \u2013 we did include Germany in our FY 2021 plan. But again, it's relatively immaterial. I would just point to the fact that our second half European results in FY 2020 were quite good and we exited the year with pretty strong performance. And as we think about FY 2021, really gets back to what we've talked about with many of our other businesses, that there is a temporary shock that is more severe in the first half of the year. And as Brian mentioned, mix matters a lot. How do countries open, one by one, they'll open at different rates in different times. And that mix is really what you're seeing flow through our business and our 2021 outlook. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. My question is focus on generic pricing. We're hearing that manufacturing in India is below historical levels and obviously, freight costs are seeing some step up. So what are you seeing on the buy side environment. How are you thinking about return to generic inflation in mid or fiscal year 2021? And then also along the line of manufacturing yesterday, HHS gave some funding of manufacturing of drugs in the U.S. Any thoughts of whether we will see generic manufacturing coming back to the U.S.? And what role would you play in that type of a scenario? Britt Vitalone : Thanks, Ricky, for that question. Let me start with your first question and then let Brian take it from there. From a generic perspective, we continue to have a very strong sourcing organization, which has really benefited us well as we've gone through this period. The relationships that we have with manufacturers, our ability to continue to secure supply in a very stable and consistent manner has played well for us. On the sell side, we continue to see a relatively stable environment. And so there's competition, but pricing has continued to be stable and competitive. And so that's allowed us to continue to earn a spread on our generic products. And I think it really \u2013 it starts with our ability to secure that supply in a consistent manner, and because one been able to do that very well over the last several years, honestly, and we expect that to continue into FY 2021. Brian Tyler : Yes. I think from an overall perspective, I mean, it's been pretty good performance industry-wide in terms of supply availability. And obviously, we began monitoring this very closely. I mentioned we set up our critical care task force in really the end \u2013 very end of our fiscal 2020 to continue to monitor this, frankly get very detailed updates every week on that. So I think, generally, we still feel okay. I would say we've seen anything, I would describe the material change in pricing or ability to supply and things of that nature. I mean, to your last question about will generic supply come back to the U.S. or will \u2013 I think the broader question is, how will diversification and how will the supply community think about being a little bit more buffered for future events that may look like this. And that \u2013 those are \u2013 it's very early. I think there will be a lot of good questions asked, a lot of good work done. We do think anything done diversifies, availability of supplies creates kind of a insurance mechanism if you will.  We are supportive of that. We also have to recognize their trade-offs in that. I mean there are cost trade-offs and figuring out how that cost gets funded and whether that's working capital or cost of the product. We'll have to navigate ourselves through, but we're involved in many of these conversations, but I'd characterize them all as very early stage right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I really wanted to delve into the cost side a little bit, understanding that there's an ongoing larger cost savings plan. But going through the businesses, if you would, talk about how much variable spending you have in each and really what the plan is just thinking and looking at the margins and backing into sort of what you're saying, the margins versus the revenues definitely look like, and I'm just trying to gauge how much variable spending you might be taking out of the business or not? Brian Tyler : Yes. Thanks for that question. Certainly, each of our businesses is a little bit differently positioned in terms of fixed versus variable cost. And I think the challenge that we're having in our first half of the year in particular, is that the revenue declines are quite sharp and so that kind of revenue declines really putting pressure on the overall cost position. I did talk about the fact that we've implemented mitigation plans across all of our businesses and across all of our different cost categories, and this is an extension of what we're already working on with our cost savings program. So we're certainly making great progress on that. We do have some things in our structure that will remain the same year-over-year in our material, like that will the opioid litigation-related costs, which we expect, which we expect to continue to be $150 million. But generally speaking, our variable costs will adjust with the volumes that we're seeing. But because some of our businesses have more significant and severe declines in volumes over the first half of the year, there will be some deleveraging that occurs in our businesses over that period. And as the year goes on, cost savings initiatives that we put in place, not only our cost savings program, but these mitigation activities will generally start to benefit our businesses and lead to that growth that we're seeing over the second half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim. Glen Santangelo : Yes, thanks for taking my call. I just want to follow-up on this negative operating profit leverage question. I mean, I appreciate all the details. But maybe, Britt, could you unpack the guidance a little bit at the gross margin line, particularly as it relates to things like mix and drug pricing and contract renewals because what I think all of us are probably trying to understand is maybe how much of the operating profit contraction may be the result of a weaker gross margin versus lower revenues or incremental expenses related to maybe help us better assess how much of the incremental expenses was maybe onetime versus ongoing? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Thanks for that question. Again, what I would come back to here is and I've tried to give you a little bit more detail into where we're seeing the impacts on our business. And in particular, if you just talk about our medical business for a moment, that medical business has an adjusted operating profit \u2013 rate of over 800 basis points that is one of the most severely impacted of our business. And we try to give you a little bit more detail in the sense that our primary care business, where we have lots of capabilities and services that we provide there, about 60% of that medical business is primary care sites, which have been the most severely impacted. So what I would say is, it's not necessarily a cost issue. And we have additional cost for protecting our employees, and sanitation and cleaning in our distribution facilities. This is more a first half mix issue, particularly in our provider businesses and our medical business which as you know has a higher adjusted operating profit rate. Holly Weiss : Operator we have time for one more question. Operator : That question will come from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for taking my question. I thought Glen have just kind of stormed it, but I will dive in on the U.S. margin guide one more time. You guys called out in Q4 that branded generic conversions, which we normally think of as a tailwind to margins or a positive impact. I guess, as we look at the 2021 margin guidance in the drug segment, could you kind of rank order what's driving what's driving the margin erosion when we think of either customer mix, product mix, VA renewal or COVID, just kind of rank ordering the negative margin mix? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thanks for that question. Again, I would come back to what we're seeing is within our business, our specialty provider businesses are most impacted. So that's certainly having a big impacted in the first half of the year. We've called out very similar types of mid-single-digit branded price increase rates that we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years, especially not an impact, renewables are not an impact we talked about, we've been able to renew our \u2013 three of our largest customers without an impact to our guide. So I'll just get back to -- as you think about where the recovery and the shape of the curve in our business is most severely impacted is our physician sites, our specialty provider sites, those tend to be higher growth and higher-margin businesses for us, and that mix is really what's impacting the business. There's nothing fundamentally or structurally going on within our business. Our business continues to be very, very fundamentally sound. This is a matter of a temporary decline in revenue and really, a mix issue of where that revenue is coming from, but there's nothing fundamentally changing within the business itself. Brian Tyler : Great. Well, thank you. Thank you, everybody, for your participation today, for your interest in McKesson and certainly, your great questions. I want to thank Lashana for facilitating this call for us. Obviously, this was a little longer call than we typically have, but we thought it was very appropriate given the environment to try to provide a little more detail insight into what's going what's going on in the business. McKesson has navigated challenges many times before. Our industry and our countries have navigated these kinds of challenges many times before. I think it's fair to say, I know I and we all probably take great inspiration from our frontline health care workers and our essential workers like those in McKesson. I want to thank the 80,000 members of the team McKesson for their dedication and the inspiration they provide me every day. I am confident that, we're well positioned to emerge from this experience as a stronger business and in strong communities. On behalf of our team at McKesson, we wish you and your families good health and wellness. We very much look forward to seeing you soon. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Holly Weiss, please go ahead. Holly Weiss : Thank you, Alyssa. Good morning and welcome everyone to McKesson's First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Holly and good morning everybody. Thank you for being with us on this morning's call. I hope that you, your families and your communities are staying healthy and safe. On our fourth quarter call in May I discussed that we were entering the new fiscal year with macro uncertainties and volatility in healthcare consumption patterns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. And our first quarter results clearly reflect the effects of these dynamics. Today we are reporting results for one of the most complicated quarters in our Company's history. Our first quarter adjusted results while materially down against prior year due to the pandemic, finished significantly above our original expectations. We reported first quarter total company revenues of $55.7 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.77, both ahead of our original expectations. Through April and May, trends in the business aligned closely with our original expectations. However, we saw volumes across the business improve significantly over the back half of June, resulting in a strong close to the quarter. Based on our first quarter results and the current shape of the recovery versus our original expectations, we're raising our fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance range to $14.70 to $15.50 per diluted share. This is up from our previous range of $13.95 to $14.75 per diluted share. Despite the uncertainty brought on by the pandemic, our focus is on executing against what is within our control and that execution really underpinned our strong finish to the quarter, as customer demand began to improve from the troughs we experienced in April and May. From the beginning, our top priority has been to navigate the challenges and the fluidity of the situation brought on by the pandemic by focusing first on protecting the health and safety of our teams, so that we could continue to meet the needs of our customers and keep the healthcare supply chain operating at a high level. We've committed to increase safety measures for our employees and have maintained an unwavering commitment to our customers and our communities. In May, I talked about the essential role McKesson plays in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to partner closely with manufacturers and various government entities, so that we can react quickly as demand pattern shift with the spread of the COVID-19 virus. One such area that has evolved is the demand for personal protective equipment or PPE as frontline workers and our customers work to help treat and keep patients safe. We work with supplier partners, federal, state and local governments to get higher volumes of PPE to areas of critical need. Our partnership with Walmart to produce and deliver medical gallons in the US has continued to increase total gallon supply with over 30 million gallons shipped to the US since April. We're also continuing to invest in our communities. Our foundation made contributions to over a dozen food banks in some of the nation's most vulnerable areas. These investments translate into more than 6 million meals for individuals who would otherwise go hungry. Before I expand on our first quarter results, I want to provide just a brief update on the macro environment and the trends we've seen over the past 75 days, since we reported our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results and issued our fiscal 2021 outlook. COVID-19 has continued to progress and persist here in the US, in ways we couldn't have predicted when we initially provided our outlook for fiscal '21. Several states including Texas where I am today are experiencing significantly higher numbers of cases, while others -- other parts of the country and frankly the world are in very different and various forms of recovery. This variability makes predicting an aggregate timeline for the recovery challenging. As we detailed on our fourth quarter call, we expected the most severe impacts to our business in the fiscal first quarter. And as a reminder, our original outlook assume the pandemic would have the most material impacts on our businesses with physician and specialty provider and oncology exposure. We expected a gradual stabilization beginning in our fiscal second quarter and ramping over the remainder of the fiscal year as doctors' offices reopen and patients return to their treatments. Through April and May, our results were largely in line with our original expectations with volumes across the enterprise materially down versus the prior year and well below pre-COVID levels. What we experienced in June however was an earlier than expected pace of recovery particularly the last weeks of the quarter, resulting in demand acceleration and higher volumes versus our original expectations. These impacts were the most pronounced in the primary care business within our Medical segment. Primary care patient visits showed encouraging signs of improvement in June, as patients returned to their doctors following the relaxation of shelter-at-home guidelines. Now turning to the business. I'll summarize the first quarter and then I'll turn the call over to Britt to elaborate. US pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions exceeded our original expectations in the quarter, underpinned by strong execution and improving volume trends in the business in the back half of June. Market stability, our disciplined approach to pricing and a growing specialty market continue to be foundations for us to build upon. We're very pleased to have recently renewed our distribution agreement with the buyer's alliance, sometimes referred to as TBA and doing so maintaining our disciplined approach to the market. I would remind you TVA [ph] is a group consisting of several health systems, retail national accounts and small and medium chain pharmacies. We're always looking for how we can best serve our customers and help them grow their business. This was evidenced by the growth in our specialty provider business in the midst of this pandemic, driven in small part by improved adoption of biosimilars in the quarter. While our specialty business recovered more quickly than we had assumed following the initial downturns in demand, we have certainly had to adapt to meet the needs of patients. At the onset of the pandemic, the US Oncology Network developed a rollout plan for telemedicine. And within four weeks, 80% of our network positions were able to initiate telemedicine follow-up visits and new consultations with their patients. To date more than 120,000 telemedicine visits have taken place with over 1250 providers. Our improved outlook for fiscal 2021 in the segment reflects the positive trends we saw in the quarter across the portfolio versus our original expectations. Let me make a few comments on Europe. While each of the 13 countries we operate in have had different responses and recoveries during the pandemic, we're encouraged by the segment's results in the first quarter. We also continue to take actions to better position the business for future growth, as evidenced by our ongoing efforts to evaluate our footprint and cost structure in our largest market, the UK. In the UK market, I'd remind you that our owned retail pharmacies are very healthcare focused with up to 90% of our mix coming from pharmaceutical volumes. While lower foot traffic through our pharmacies with a headwind in the quarter, our downside was limited due to our relatively small exposure to the front shop categories. A good example of how we're evolving this business is our 2019 acquisition of a company called Echo, now operating as Echo by Lloyds Pharmacy. This is an online prescription fulfillment business in the UK. It's all -- it is -- it was a timely acquisition for us, particularly given the impacts of the pandemic to meet customer demands in uncertain times. Our investment in our digital health care strategy in the UK has helped position the business to benefit from movement of patients to home and to omnichannel services. Let me move on to Medical. As I discussed earlier, in June we experienced a sharp increase in demand across our primary care sites. This directly correlates to the reopening of physician offices and resumption of performing elective procedures as patients started to feel more comfortable returning to their doctors and healthcare providers. In addition to a stabilization in primary care volumes as the quarter closed, our leading position in our lab business also puts us in a good place to respond to customer and patient needs during the pandemic. We have a strong history in this channel and as customers need solutions for COVID-19 and as our manufacturer partners develop and launch testing solutions, we remain a partner of choice and a leader across alternate site settings of care. The trends we witnessed in June combined with our improved outlook for the business over the remainder of this fiscal year give us confidence in our significantly improved outlook for this segment. Turning to Other, which now primarily consists of Canada and McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions following the separation of our investment in Change Healthcare in fiscal 2020. We're encouraged by the trends we saw in Canada to end the quarter as volumes began to approach pre-COVID levels in our distribution and retail businesses. Within the retail setting, our focus remains on building an enhanced customer experience through investments in people and reconfigured pharmacy formats. This has helped to strengthen our fundamentals and the role that community pharmacy plays in the Canadian healthcare system, which is especially important in times like these. Our owned Canadian pharmacies are continuing to evolve and will soon offer e-commerce and e-Prescribing platforms creating additional options for Canadian consumers, who want both a physical and digital shopping experience. Within MRxTS, we're making progress with our investments to create technology offerings that resonate with our retail and biopharma customers. Since launching in September of 2019, Access for More Patients. a product we call AMP has helped automate access to therapies for complex and chronic diseases, reducing the time to therapy by 18-days on average and we're continuing to expand the brand's taking advantage of this offering. The collaboration between our RxCrossroads and CoverMyMeds businesses to develop AMP is a good example of how our business evolves to meet the needs of our customers. As part of our ongoing evolution on July 1st, we announced the re-segmentation of our businesses effective in the second quarter of this fiscal year. We believe that this new organization structure better positions McKesson to focus and execute against our growth strategies and to meet the changing needs of our customers. With this re-segmentation, two new segments have been established, International and Prescription Technology Solutions. Kevin Kettler has assumed responsibility for the new International segment, which combines McKesson Europe and our Canadian business. Nathan Mott will lead the new Prescription Technology Solutions segment, which has been expanded to include the RxCrossroads business formerly reported as part of McKesson Life Sciences within our US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. In the quarter we also appointed Tom Rodgers as Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Business Development Officer. Tom brings more than 25 years of experience working in both emerging companies and large health care environments. In summary, we certainly faced unprecedented headwinds to begin fiscal 2021, but we're encouraged by the signs of recovery across our businesses as we exit our first quarter. We still believe the first quarter will be the trough of the recovery curve with the most material impacts in the business. We are pleased our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, reflecting great execution by our teams. The path to recovery over the remainder of our fiscal year is unlikely to be linear and we will continue to closely monitor the progression of COVID-19 through our communities and its implications for our business. The pandemic has reinforced the need for us to be agile in response to both customer demands and the ways in which patients choose to consume health care. One theme through the pandemic has been change and I believe McKesson is well positioned to respond to change, as the macro environment around us continues to evolve, McKesson will continue to evolve. I believe we have exited the quarter in a much stronger position than we entered it, stable fundamentals across the business, paired with focused execution against our strategic growth initiatives, give me confidence that McKesson will adapt to the near-term uncertainties and ultimately be positioned to thrive long-term. Thank you very much for your time. With that, I'll hand it over to you, Britt. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. My comments today will relate to our existing segment structure. As Brian discussed in his opening comments effective with the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we'll begin to report our financial results in four reportable segments, US Pharmaceutical, International, Medical-Surgical Solutions and Prescription Technology Solutions. We will issue a recast of financials in the new segment structure ahead of our second quarter earnings call to assist with your modeling under the new structure. Our June quarter was a testament to McKesson's ability to execute during challenging times. Our results speak to the dedication of our people, the resilience of our business and the important leadership role that McKesson plays in the healthcare supply chain. This morning I'll provide commentary on our first quarter results and I'll provide an update on the key assumptions that underpin our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2021. Throughout my comments this morning I'll provide an update of the recent trends we are observing and the implications to our fiscal 2021 results. As expected, our first quarter was severely impacted by the global pandemic as lockdown and social distancing requirements placed unique pressures on our customers and patients. We navigated the quarter with a combination of discipline and focus to what we continue to believe will be peak levels of global lockdown and restrictions. In the first quarter, we finished ahead of the expectations that we laid out in May on our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. Those expectations included our assumption that patient visits in the physician, specialty provider and oncology segments and pharmacy interactions in our US, Canadian and European markets would bottom out and gradually improve beginning with our second quarter. Through April and May, the relative shape of the recovery curve was in line with this original guidance framework. However, as we progress through June, we began to see an acceleration of demand as volumes across our business has recovered at an earlier pace than our original outlook had contemplated. This increase in demand largely track the easing of restrictions and openings of markets across the world. Prescription transactions, patient interactions and elective procedures began to recover sooner than we had anticipated and had favorable volume impacts that were most pronounced in our Medical-Surgical and Specialty businesses. Let me turn now to our first quarter results. The summary of our first quarter results and updated guidance assumptions can be found in our first quarter earnings slide presentation, which is posted on the Investors Section of our website. Before I provide more details on our first quarter adjusted results, I want to point out one item that impacted our GAAP only results in the quarter. During the first quarter, we recorded an after-tax gain of $97 million for insurance proceeds received in connection with the settlement of the shareholder derivative action related to McKesson's controlled substances monitoring program. Now let's transition to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the first quarter, starting with our consolidated results on slide four. First quarter consolidated revenues of $55.7 million were flat compared to the prior year. Market growth and higher retail national account volumes within the US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment were offset by lower prescription volumes and primary care patient visits, primarily a result of the negative impact from COVID-19. Although flat-to-prior year, this result exceeded our original expectations for the quarter. First quarter adjusted gross profit was down 4% year-over-year, as lower prescription transaction volumes and mix were results of the pandemic. First quarter adjusted operating expenses decreased 2% year-over-year, driven by cost mitigation efforts in response to the headwinds presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. These were partially offset by increased investments in the business. Adjusted operating profit was $707 million for the quarter, a decrease of 24% as compared to the prior year. When excluding the results of Change Healthcare from the prior year, adjusted operating profit was down approximately 14%, again ahead of our expectations. Interest expense was $60 million in the quarter, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate was 22.3% for the quarter. We continue to assume a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. We anticipate reporting a favorable tax discrete item in our fiscal second quarter, which would result in the second quarter adjusted tax rate of approximately 5% to 10%. I would remind you that this could vary as a result of the mix of our worldwide earnings. First quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.77, down 16% in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the business and the lapping of prior year contribution from the company's investment in Change Healthcare. These items were partially offset by a lower share count compared to the prior year. In wrapping up our consolidated results, our first quarter diluted weighted average shares were $163 million, a decrease of 14% year-over-year, driven by the successful exit of our investment in Change Healthcare, which lowered our shares outstanding by approximately 15.4 million shares and due to prior year share repurchases. Next, I'll review our segment results, which can be found on slides five through seven and I'll start with US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $45.1 billion for the quarter, which were up 2% driven by market growth in higher retail national account volumes. This was partially offset by branded generic conversions and the negative impact of COVID-19 on prescription transaction volumes. Prescription transaction volumes were uneven in April and May, improved throughout the quarter and were above our expectations in June. Oncology visits were approximately 70% of pre-pandemic levels in April, however, improved over 95% in June. In telemedicine visits and our oncology practices now account for up to 15% of all visits. First quarter adjusted operating profit decreased 2% to $589 million, driven by lower volumes as a result of a pandemic and strategic investments, including our oncology portfolio partially offset by growth in the provider solutions business. The segment adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 131 basis points, a decrease of 5 basis points. Next I'll talk about European Pharmaceutical Solutions, where revenues were $6.2 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 7% year-over-year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues decreased 4% driven by the negative impact of the pandemic on the pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy businesses partially offset by two extra sell days in the period compared to the prior year. First quarter adjusted operating profit was flat year-over-year at $35 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $36 million, driven by lower operating expense in two additional sell days in the period, when compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower volumes due to the pandemic. The segment adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 56 basis points, an increase of 4 basis points. I'd like to spend a minute on the actions taken in the UK which Brian discussed earlier. The first quarter was a very difficult quarter and the COVID pandemic had a greater impact on our UK operations than the rest of our European operations. Our teams have adapted to a changing operating environment in the wake of COVID-19. We saw increased demand prior to the lockdown with material reductions after the state home orders were imposed. Volumes have remained steady, however below pre-pandemic levels. In our UK business, we identified an opportunity to accelerate our transition to digital. Our investment in Echo and our digital capabilities, but the strong growth in our online business moved quickly to increase capacity. Revenues from our Echo business grew over 300% from pre-pandemic levels and continue on a strong growth trajectory. Our investment in digital health care strategy in the UK positions us to benefit from the movement of patients to a digital environment. However, given the severity of the COVID impact in the uncertain outlook, we are accelerating actions in our UK business. During the quarter, we announced restructuring actions in the UK to adapt to the difficult and evolving operating environment in the wake of COVID and to continue to better position the business for future profitability. As a result, we took incremental charges in the quarter, which include further rationalization of our footprint in the UK, along with additional cost optimization efforts. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions, we're encouraged to see improved patient mobility and procedure starting to return versus what we saw at the onset of the pandemic. For example, according to IQVIA, April in person primary care visits were down nearly 70% and it improved to approximately 10% to 15% declines as of late June. Revenues were $1.8 billion for the quarter, which were down 5%, driven by the pandemics impact on volume in our primary care business, partially offset by growth in the extended care business. First quarter revenues including increased volumes of personal protective equipment. First quarter adjusted operating profit decreased 22% to $124 million, driven by lower demand in the primary care business, in part due to temporary closures of physician offices across the US, as a result of shelter-in-place guidelines. Segment adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 689 basis points, a decrease of 147 basis points driven primarily by customer and product mix. In finishing our business review with Other, revenues were $2.6 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 13% year-over-year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues decreased 10%, driven by lower volumes in the Canadian business, which includes both the exit of an unprofitable customer at the onset of the fiscal year and the negative impact of the pandemic. First quarter adjusted operating profit was $137 million, down 50% on both the reported and FX adjusted basis, driven primarily by the lapping of the prior year contribution of $108 million from the company's investment in Change Healthcare, along with the negative impact in pandemic on the businesses within Other. Excluding the prior-year contribution from Change, Other was down approximately 18% year-over-year. And moving to Corporate, McKesson reported $178 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the quarter, an increase of 30% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by the lapping of a prior year one-time gain from investment activities and an increase in opioid litigation cost compared to the prior year. Excluding the prior year one-time benefit, corporate expenses increased approximately 10% year-over-year. For the first quarter, we reported net opioid related litigation expenses of $43 million. Now on to cash, which can be found on slide 10. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.9 billion. During the quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.2 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. The dynamics of the current operating environment resulting from the effects of COVID-19 has introduced further volatility in our cash flow. However, improving volumes and strong working capital fundamentals give us confidence we will continue to generate solid free cash flow. Investment in growth opportunities remains a key priority for McKesson and during the quarter, we made $170 million of capital expenditures. We continue to focus on internal investments in areas such as technology and our strategic growth initiatives. We return cash to our shareholders through the payment of $74 million in dividends. We have $1.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization and we continue to expect weighted shares outstanding in the range of $161 million to $163 million. We also continue to anticipate free cash flow in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion for fiscal 2021. Let me transition now and talk about our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2021. We continue to believe we are well positioned in the markets we compete with a clear strategy in a differentiated set of assets and capabilities. We remain confident in our long-term prospects, which are rooted in the important role we play in the healthcare supply chain. In May, we outlined two key macro assumptions which I am reiterating today. First, we did not assume a second wave of COVID-19 which would lead to shelter-at-home and economic lockdowns. And second, we do not assume any systemic customer insolvency events. Similar to my comments in May, I'd reiterate that one certainty is the defense will occur in the coming days and weeks that could cause these underlying assumptions to change from what we know today. As you think about our outlook, I'd highlight the strong relationship of our performance with two key factors. First, the macroeconomic environment and the intersection of prescription volumes in patient behavior. And second, our ability to continue to execute our strategy, with a disciplined approach to invest and position ourselves for growth in the areas of specialty, oncology and biopharma services. This remains a dynamic environment and while the situation has undoubtedly improved, the reality remains that the virus is not completely under control with many areas seeing increased positive cases in hospitalizations. The impact of the pandemic is highly fluid and likely to continue evolving over the coming weeks and months. We continue to expect the trajectory of the recovery to quarterly closely to the level of mobility of patients, prescription transaction volumes and the demand for healthcare interactions with primary care physicians, oncologists and elective procedure levels. We continue to believe the first quarter will be the most severely impacted and we expect to see sequential revenue and adjusted operating profit improvement over the balance of the fiscal year. However, we do not believe the recovery in our business will be linear. Based on what we've observed in the past 75-days, we believe that a full recovery may take longer than originally contemplated. However, we continue to expect growth in the second half of the year as compared to the prior year. Let me provide a few details of our outlook. As a result of earlier recovery in volumes versus original expectations, we now anticipate consolidated revenues to increase on the high end with the previously provided range of 2% to 4% growth for fiscal 2021. We now expect the consolidated adjusted operating profit will decline between 1% and 4% for the full-year, when you exclude the results of Change Healthcare from the prior year and this is up from our original guidance, the decline between 5% and 8%. And as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate enterprise adjusted operating profit to grow sequentially throughout fiscal 2021 and continue to expect growth in the second half of the fiscal year on a year-over-year basis. Let me talk a little bit about the segments. Given the earlier than anticipated recovery of the provider solutions business in the quarter and improved outlook for fiscal 2021, we now expect US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions full-year segment adjusted operating profit to be in the range of down 2% to up 2% compared to prior year. In the second half of our fiscal year, we continue to expect adjusted operating profit of flat to 3% growth compared to the prior year. In Europe, our first quarter segment results were above expectations, driven by increased cost mitigation activities in response to the pandemic. As a result of this first quarter performance and modest improvement in the aggregate recovery timeline across Europe, we now expect European segment revenues to be in the range of down 3% to up 1% compared to prior year. Additionally, we now expect segment adjusted operating profit to decline between 4% and 9% for fiscal 2021. The operating environment remains challenging in many markets due to the earlier recovery in the flattening of the recovery curve, we now expect second half adjusted operating profit to decline between 4% and 6% in Europe. Turning to our Medical-Surgical Segment. As discussed in my opening remarks, we began to see volume improvements in the primary care business in the month of June. As a result of the pace of the recovery within primary care in the segment and higher volumes within extended care, we are updating our outlook for the segment. We now expect fiscal 2021 segment revenue to increase between 8% and 12% and segment adjusted operating profit in the range of down 3% to an increase of 3%. We continue to expect growth in the second half of the fiscal year, compared to the prior year and now project to be between 10% and 15%. Turning to Other, as a result of return to more normalized volumes in the Canadian business in the back half of June, we now anticipate segment revenues to decline between 5% and 10% for fiscal 2021. Excluding the impact of Change Healthcare, we continue to expect greater than 10% growth in the second half of the fiscal year when compared to the prior year. Within our corporate segment for fiscal 2021, we now anticipate that opioid-related costs will approximately be $160 million. Based on higher opioid-related costs and increased investment in the business, including technology versus our original outlook we now anticipate corporate expenses to be in the range of $690 million to $740 million. We have a solid balance sheet, healthy cash generation and financial flexibility, which underpins our investment grade credit rating. These dynamics form the foundation for a balanced approach to capital deployment, investing in growth areas aligned to our strategy and returning cash to our shareholders. Based on our solid first quarter results, our view of the macro environment and our updated outlook on transaction volumes across the business we are raising the full year fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $14.70 to $15.50 per diluted share from our previous outlook of $13.95 to $14.75 per diluted share. In closing, we're pleased with the results of our fiscal first quarter and we're proud of how we responded to a dynamic environment, supporting our customers despite the uncertainties that were brought on by this pandemic. Our disciplined execution delivered solid results, combined with our strong balance sheet and financial position, we're well positioned to deliver growth in the second half of the year as compared to the prior year. The external environment continues to present many unknowns, but our businesses have continued to be resilient with strong execution and stable fundamentals. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time I ask that you limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Turn over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. Eric Coldwell : Hey, thanks very much. Congrats on navigating the tough environment. The question is pretty simple, it's on PPE. I'm curious if you can give us a sense on how much PPE demand help the growth or offset the challenges in Medical-Surgical. And then longer-term, do you see opportunities in PPE that expand beyond your core customer base, other industries that might be a need of these products and whether you have an interest in addressing that as well? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Eric. I mean the -- probably goes without saying the demand for PPE is up significantly whether you're talking about core healthcare markets or schools or workplaces. We certainly see that increased demand for PPE and that reflects, that does reflect in the Medical Group's results for the quarter. Our priority internally has been and continues to be to make sure we support the frontline caregivers and that we get the necessary PPE to them. And quite honestly, some of these customer segments historically didn't have a lot of demand for some of the products like N95 mask, it just wasn't necessary in the way they were in their businesses, that's the way they ran their businesses, that's obviously changed. And so we're working hard to source. Our sourcing teams are very active with various partners. Manufacturers around the world really to continue to make sure we can meet the needs of those healthcare customers. And we would not be looking to expand into industrial or other lines until we felt confident we could meet the core needs of the healthcare -- our healthcare customers today. Britt Vitalone : Eric, I guess what I would add to that. You probably noticed that in addition to the strong volumes we saw in primary care in June, PPE contributed to that, and that was part of the reason why we increased our revenue guide for the year. If you recall, our original guidance for the medical segment was revenue to be down 3% to 8% year-over-year. We've now upped that to 8% to 12% growth and PPE was a part of that in addition to the strong primary care volumes that we saw at the back half of June. Holly Weiss : Next question? Operator : And next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. You guys noted a strong recovery in June. Maybe you can give us a sense on how July has looked then? And has volumes remained at the June levels? Or are you continuing to see a further acceleration? Particularly as we've seen more surges here in states like Texas, California and Florida, because it sounds like you're saying you're not assuming a second wave. So is that kind of the assumption that unlike the beginning of the pandemic where everything kind of shut down, you're assuming that these states largely stay open, which kind of changes how volume should be affected? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Charles. Certainly, April was a very soft month. I think we signaled that when we talked about our guidance for the year. April and May more or less tracked to the assumptions that we had laid out as we saw the recovery progressing. That held up early part of June, and then it really accelerated, and it's pretty correlated to, if you look at the timing of when states kind of relax their restrictions on movement and local economy, markets got opened back up and people got back to the business of healthcare. And we saw those volumes strengthen for us really through the conclusion of our June quarter. June ended right prior to the 4th of July holiday. So there's always nuances around timing of events like that. I think as we think about going forward, you're exactly right, we are not -- we have not built this plan around a presumption of a second lockdown, so to speak. We think economies will continue to stay open. I do think if you reflect on what's happened in Texas and Florida and Arizona and what's occurring now in other states as those states start to bend their curves downward, that's where we get to this idea. I think the word we used was linear. We don't think it's going to be steady progression. I mean based on states and cities and municipalities and how the virus accelerates or decelerates, we'll see some variability. But we are not anticipating a return to shelter in place, like we saw in the March time frame. Holly Weiss : Next question? Operator : And next will be Michael Cherny with Bank of America Securities. Michael Cherny : Good morning and congratulations on the strong results. I want to dive in a little bit to the pharma segment. You had a comment in your release about the strength in national accounts, you talked about that going forward. Can you may be bifurcate a little bit in terms of the pacing of recovery you're seeing, the differences you're seeing broadly between those national accounts versus some of the independent pharmacies that you've traditionally served and how those should dovetail going forward given the various different pacings of openings across the country? Brian Tyler : Sure. I would say as a general characterization, the pacing has been pretty consistent retail national account versus independent. Meaning the macro trend of when we saw volume soften in April, start to recover in May, continue to bounce back in June. I think those trend lines are largely consistent. A national chain probably has a little less exposure to a particular state or community that might be experiencing a better or worse COVID progression. So obviously, there's some almost built in risk mitigation from being a national chain. But by and large, I think the independents have held up pretty well. We have -- we stay obviously in close contact with them. We see many of, for example, our Health Marts, participating in some of the testing and I think people reflect now more than ever, the important role of community care and pharmacists as a point of community care in the recovery. So I don't think there's anything I would draw other than that. Britt Vitalone : And I think it goes without saying that national accounts just based on their size, have a greater proportion of the segment. And I don't think you should take that as one part of the segment grew faster than the other. I think it's just given the proportion that national accounts make up within that segment, they had a bigger impact. Holly Weiss : Next question? Operator : And next will be Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, Brian and Britt. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, if you go back about three months ago, there was a lot of chatter in the US prescription marketplace about mail order Rx taking share from retail Rx. I guess, I'm curious, just based on reorder patterns that you might be seeing as the June quarter progressed and into July. Are there any notable trends from your own book of business just on the strength of reorders in the mail order channel versus retail channel? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Thank you for the question, Steven. I mean we obviously went early in the lockdown period and payers and health plans started relaxing some of their -- or changing some of their policies. There was an uptick in mail order. If you actually look at the trend lines for mail order and retail, though, after that sort of initial -- just take that initial period out, they actually are tracking pretty consistently. So we don't -- there -- one week, you can get a swing one way or the other. But if you looked over a period of a couple of months, they're actually tracking, would say, and kind of in lockstep. So I don't see anything systemic in terms of the way the market is going to change because of this. Holly Weiss : Next question? Operator : The next will be from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. A question on the specialty business. I think you mentioned 70% volumes at one point in oncology. Certainly, the volumes don't look -- or your US. pharma volumes don't look like you saw that type of impact. Is it safe to assume that, that was visits and that administration has remained much more stable? And then any commentary on the non-oncology would be appreciated. Britt Vitalone : Eric, let me start, and then Brian can add. Just to clarify, my comments were really related to visits. And so what we saw at the beginning of the quarter right after the pandemic is that visits ticked down to about that 70% level. And we saw pretty steady growth throughout the quarter to roughly the 95% at the end of the quarter that I referenced. And we also saw an increase in telemedicine visits, which I think helped the practices from an efficiency standpoint as well. So a comment, just to clarify, was really based on visits. Brian Tyler : The only thing I would add to that is, obviously, we had a lot of tremendous insight into oncology. We're in a lot of other specialties. And it's one of the, I guess, nuances to the environment we're in right now is that each specialty, just like each of our market segments has got a bit of their own recovery curve [ph] and timing just kind of dependent on what's the nature of the disease, what's the nature of the therapies, what's the interaction with physicians, what's the applicability of telehealth versus not. So we really watch this by each of the various disease states. Holly Weiss : Next question? Operator : Next will be Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim. Glen Santangelo : Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had two quick financial ones. Britt, you raised the adjusted EPS number by $0.75 at the midpoint. I just want to be clear that this doesn't include any of the gain from the insurance proceeds or the one-time benefit that sounds like it's coming in 2Q? And then secondly, you raised operating profit and your EPS outlook, but could you may be discuss the impact on cash flows? Because, obviously, we had the negative timing thing in 1Q in maintaining the free cash flow guidance for the year, despite raising the operating profit and it seems like you have no repo in the guidance. I just want to make sure I have all those pieces clear. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Sure. Thanks for the questions. Let me try to unpack those for you. As it relates to the guide, first, as it relates to the insurance proceeds, as I mentioned, those are GAAP only. So those are not included in our adjusted earnings. As it relates to the comments that I made around tax, I would just refer you that our full year expectation on the tax rate is still within 18% to 20%. What I was trying to do is to give a little bit more visibility into the timing that we expect to see throughout the year. So, I think -- and as you think about cash flow, it's early. It's first quarter of the year. We're trending as we had assumed or roughly as we assumed in the first quarter. Our cash flow, as I mentioned in my comments, has historically varied from quarter-to-quarter, but I think the COVID environment places additional volatility on that. And so our -- as we think about this throughout the rest of the year as we get more visibility into patterns and working capital demands, we'll certainly provide updates as appropriate. But I wouldn't read anything into that. It's early from a -- for a -- to give a full year update on the cash flow guide. Holly Weiss : Next question? Operator : Next will be Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Stephen Baxter : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I was hoping you could touch on trends within the generics market a little bit. As we entered this COVID period, there are some concerns around API and potential drug shortages. So I guess, what, if anything, did you end up seeing on that front? And then kind of in line with that, it looks to us, at least the generic depletion trends moderated a bit in the quarter. Is that consistent with McKesson's experience? And then if so, do you have a view on what's driving that moderation and how sustainable it is? Thanks. Brian Tyler : So, I'll start and let Britt add on, if he'd like. I mean, I think that the generic market has continued to perform in a way consistent with the past several quarters. As you know, we focus more on the spread, the difference between the sell price and the acquisition price, and we don't tend to comment on generic deflation too much. But I would continue to characterize that market as stable and is consistent with what we've seen over past quarters. I think it's -- I think the disruptions to generic supply from COVID have been well-managed and quite minimal and may not even be attributable to COVID per se. We do have a dedicated and focused team that we stood up at the outset of this pandemic to work closely with suppliers, not just existing suppliers, but other suppliers around the globe to forecast and track our views of inventory and inventory availability. But I would say thus far through certainly our first quarter, the supply situation has been well managed. Holly Weiss : Next question? Operator : Next will be Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to a comment, Britt, that you made around the macro-economic environment. I'm just curious, what do you currently have built into your expectations? I know that there's been some concern around layoffs and them staying permanent. But yet, as we look at membership across the managed care companies coming in a little bit better than expectations. I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are, obviously, going into the guidance. And then, as we think about that macro environment and go back to the last financial downturn, if I remember correctly, when we think about pharmaceutical utilization, it was pretty inelastic, right, had a little bit of an impact, but not very material. So I just -- I want to better understand what's in the guidance. Britt Vitalone : Sure. Good morning, Lisa. Thanks for that question. I'll just refer you back to some comments that I made on the May call. And we track unemployment levels very closely. We track the solvency of our customers very closely, work very closely with them to make sure that they have all the resources that they need. What I said in May would still hold. We expect that the peak unemployment levels will be in the second calendar quarter. We still expect that to be the case. Obviously, unemployment has been stubborn for the last 18, 19 weeks, but we do believe that it will peak in this second calendar quarter. And so I think, to your second question, I think you're right. I think we do believe that prescription transaction volumes will be not as affected as the overall economy will be. And that's given us the confidence to really raise our revenue guide within that segment for the full year. Holly Weiss : Next question? Operator : Next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi, good morning. So distribution of COVID vaccine captured headlines last week, and we've been getting questions from investors on what could the distribution infrastructure looks like. So just wondering how do you envision distribution of COVID vaccine when available in the market? Where would it be administrated? And what role would McKesson have? Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Ricky. It's early days, I think, to forecast, A, when the vaccine will be available, which manufacturer, it might be available from and what the best method of distribution for that vaccine will be. You're as aware as I am, there's over 100 vaccines close to 150 in development. There's probably 10 to 20 at the front end of that funnel. We continue to work closely and are in discussions with all of those -- all of the manufacturers around these vaccines. Our company has a great capability in this area. We administer the vaccines for children's program today. We obviously have large channels in the medical business and in the pharmaceutical business that support community providers who administer these vaccines, and in over a decade ago, when our nation was dealing with H1N1, we continue -- it's a proud moment in McKesson's history of the role we were able to play in managing that vaccine solution. So, I think we have terrific capabilities. We're in active dialogue with everybody. Our first and foremost goal will be to do whatever we can do to help accelerate getting a vaccine to market. That's the most important thing we can do and what we're focused on right now. Holly Weiss : Next question? Operator : Next will be Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess, maybe just to follow-on to that. There seems to be a view that flu vaccines will be much higher utilized this year than in a normal year. So just curious how you're thinking about that and what's factored into guidance? And then -- and Brian, you made a comment during the prepared remarks around lab testing and the opportunity that McKesson is playing in just the COVID testing process. I was curious also there, if you could maybe just expand a little bit about how big that opportunity is and what's factored into the guidance. Thanks. Brian Tyler : Sure. Thanks, Robert. So I'll start, I guess, just a few comments on flu. I mean, flu is a component of our medical business. I wouldn't overemphasize the role of flu vaccine there. Every flu season tends to be its own season, depending on the severity of the strand, depending on the effectiveness of the vaccination. So we've lived through lots of different kinds of flu seasons, strong ones and weak ones. And I think our best thinking at this point is this -- it would be a typical or average flu season. Now, it's still quite early to make that call with any specific insight into how flu may interact with COVID and patient perception. So it's something we'll continue to monitor and watch. And then relative to the comments about lab, I mean we -- by virtue of our position in the alternate care markets and supporting nursing homes and supporting physician offices. We just have great reach into the community. And so as the need for these -- this testing moves into the community-based setting, we're well positioned to take advantage of that. Britt Vitalone : Maybe just to build on Brian's comment. The flu vaccine itself within our medical business is a component of pharmaceutical distribution within that segment. And it's not -- the vaccine itself is not material to the segment. And as Brian mentioned, we've thought about this as more of a typical flu season that we've seen over the last several years. Now if it's a little bit greater than it has been in prior years again, the vaccine distribution itself is not material to the segment. Holly Weiss : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly, that question will come from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for squeezing me in. I guess nobody's asked the opioid question. I was a little surprised to see opioid litigation expenses up year-over-year. I guess, just do you guys feel like any project, any progress has been made on the opioid litigation front over the last quarter? Kind of any update in that process would be helpful. Thank you. Brian Tyler : Thanks, George. I'll take this one. And I really don't have any kind of material update. We do continue to be engaged in discussions with attorneys, generals and others. We do remain hopeful that broad resolution can be achieved. We think it's important that if there's a path to accelerate relief efforts for people and the communities impacted that we find a way to take that path. You can imagine the amount of focus on COVID-19 over the past quarter, but we do continue the dialogue, we do continue to be optimistic that a broad resolution could be reached, and we do continue to prepare our defense in the event that it can't be. And that's about all I can add to that. Well, thank you, everyone, for your questions, and thank you for joining us on the call. Alyssa, thank you for helping us facilitate this call. I want to conclude my remarks today by just thanking all the frontline workers across the world who are tirelessly day in and day out working to keep us healthy and safe. And I certainly want to recognize the outstanding performance of our 80,000 employees, especially their commitment to helping their communities and to helping each other in this time of need. We wish you and your families good health and wellness. I look forward to the day we can be together. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

Holly Weiss : Thank you. Good morning and welcome everyone to McKesson's Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Holly and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us on this [Technical Difficulty] in United States. Today is obviously an important day, a day which every citizen can vote should have the opportunity to exercise this civic right regardless of who\u2019s in the White House, we look forward to working with the administration and the new Congress to ensure a strong and safe economic recovery, while keeping the Healthcare supply chain running and continuing to deliver for our customers on the front lines of this pandemic. Today, we reported second quarter total company revenues of $60.8 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.80, both ahead of prior year and our revised expectations we laid out in August. I\u2019d like to thank the people who make up Team McKesson for their resilience, their dedication, their flexibility and ability to manage through change. The first half of fiscal 2021 has certainly played out differently than the original expectations we provided to you in May. You recall that based on the positive signs of recovery at the end of our first quarter, we raised our guidance for fiscal 2021. In our second quarter, we again saw volumes increase compared to the low points earlier in the first quarter while patient mobility and prescription volumes showed improvement and stability. The recovery continues to be non-linear as the word we\u2019ve adopted and our second quarter results are a good example of the unpredictability of the pace and the trajectory of the recovery. In addition, the pandemic has caused customer needs to evolve and repivot it quickly to meet the incremental demands and needs. Investments in the business and customer relationships particularly in our medical business have positioned us well to serve our customers during this unprecedented time. New demand for product categories such as COVID-19 test, and elevated demand for PPE have contributed meaningfully to our results year-to-date. While short-term upside we do not anticipate the elevated levels of demand for these products in the long-term. Our results year-to-date are underpinned by three dynamics. First and foremost, the shape and pace of the recovery has been different than we had originally contemplated in May. Following a sharp recovery to the end of the first quarter, we continue to see modest improvement in the second quarter but with signs the recovery will not fully happen in our fiscal 2021, most likely extending well into the calendar year 2021. And given current COVID-19 infection rate volatility we expect a non-linear recovery. Second, the fundamentals in the business remains solid and our execution has continued to improve. Lastly, discrete one-time gains in the second quarter and short-term opportunities present near term upside for the fiscal year. As a result of our performance in the quarter, and our improved outlook across the business, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share to $guidance range to $16.50 per diluted share. This is up from our previous range of $14.70 to $15.50 per diluted share. Since the onset of the pandemic McKesson has partnered with government agencies at the Federal State and local level along with other industry leaders to help find solutions to the most complex and pressing issues the crisis presented. This critical work once again speaks to the important role we play in the healthcare supply chain and to the depth of McKesson's expertise in sourcing, picking, packing and distributing supplies to sites of care across the U.S. Our role in the supply chain was highlighted in the quarter through expanded partnerships with the U.S. Government, specifically supporting Operation Warp Speed Similar to our role in the 2009 to 2010 period, the H1N1 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention engaged us to expand our existing partnership under the Vaccines for Children program to support the U.S. Government's Operation Warp Speed team as a centralized distributor of future COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer those vaccines. McKesson's role in the H1N1 response was a proud moment in our history over 10 years ago and we're very honored to serve in a similar capacity as we help support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic I do want to take a moment to just clarify the scope of McKesson's involvement in Operation Warp Speed. We will be the centralized distributor for refrigerated and frozen vaccine types, once approved by the FDA. Ultra frozen vaccines, which are those requiring temperatures of minus 60 degree Celsius or colder are not within the scope of McKesson's contract with the CDC. In the centralized model, the U.S. Government directs McKesson on the distribution of the vaccines and related supplies to point-of-care sites across the country. McKesson will make no allocation or prioritization decisions and we will not have any influence on which vaccine is shipped to which location. While it's still early in the process and a vaccine is not yet been approved for distribution, our role in Operation Warp Speed has been and will continue to be our Company's top priority since we were selected by the CDC in August. We've been working to scale up the infrastructure necessary to be ready to distribute approved vaccines as soon as they are available. Given the uncertainty around the timing and volume of vaccines that may become available, future earnings tied to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, as a centralized distributor for the U.S. Government, are not reflected in our current outlook. McKesson was also selected by the U.S. Government to manage the assembly and distribution of the ancillary supplies needed to administer the future COVID-19 vaccines. We're partnering with the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to help equip healthcare professionals with the supplies they need to safely and efficiently administer COVID-19 vaccines once they're available. Supplies like syringes, alcohol prep pads, face shields and more will be selected and grouped together as directed by the HHS for future distribution to point-of-care settings across the country. We quickly ramped up our capacity outfitting and staffing four distribution center locations for assembling and storing the ancillary kits to be used in the administration of the COVID-19 vaccines once approved. Each kit contains enough supplies to be used for the administration of 100 plus vaccines. Our teams have been hard at work assembling these kits as part of the preparation needed when the vaccine is approved. Given the scope of our work with the HHS is well defined and that the work has begun the economics from this contract are factored into our improved outlook for fiscal 2021. We are honored and proud to serve the U.S. government in this dual role, and we believe it will help streamline delivery to frontline, and provide the most expeditious access possible to the COVID-19 vaccines. Before I elaborate on our second quarter results, I wanted to provide just a brief update on our board of directors. In mid-October, our board of directors welcomed Linda Mantia, as a new independent director. Linda most recently served as a Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for Manulife Financial Corporation, where she played a critical role in defining Manulife\u2019s corporate strategy and oversaw its innovation portfolio. She brings over 25 years of experience managing extensive financial services, operations and digital technology. Linda's appointment demonstrates our continuing commitment to refresh and diversify the experience backgrounds and perspectives on our board. Now let's get into the business. I'll remind you that this is our first quarter reporting in the new segment structure we announced back in July. I'll summarize the second quarter and then I'll turn it over to Britt to provide more details. U.S. Pharmaceuticals results in the quarter exceeded our expectations and reflect improved script and patient mobility trends versus the levels we experienced in the first quarter. Specialty volumes, particularly oncology, have continued to be resilient throughout the pandemic. Oncology patient visits, inclusive of telehealth visits returned to pre-COVID levels in the quarter and our provider solutions in U.S. oncology business continued to grow and are well positioned as innovative specialty products and biosimilars come to market. Our U.S. oncology research team recently celebrated a significant milestone. We have now been part of the trial process for 100 FDA approved cancer therapies. This achievement is the result of the hard work and the dedication to research for more than 165 research locations, conducting and participating in over 1600 clinical trials for cancer therapy. Our health mart franchises continue to play a vital role in community healthcare as they roll out COVID-19 testing efforts and expand immunization capabilities ahead of this year's influenza season. Transitioning to our international segment. As part of our segment realignment, we brought together our strong presence and non-U.S. based drug distribution and retail operations in Canada and Europe. Together, these businesses are positioned to further leverage the company's global footprint to drive value across key differentiators like the company's own retail pharmacy assets. I remind you as part of the reorganization in August, we named Rebecca McKillican, as the Chief Executive Officer for McKesson, Canada. She succeeded Domenic Pilla, who retired in August. I'm encouraged by the performance of our international business as we found ways to meet the changing customer demands and contain our costs. We continue to invest in the digitization of healthcare in both Canada and Europe. We've invested in new state of the art distribution centers to support digital growth and our e-commerce platforms in Canada our Well.ca business was recognized for the second year in a row as a leader in digital customer experience. And in Europe, Our Echo by LloydsPharmacy platform in the U.K. remains the U.Ks fastest growing pharmacy. I'm pleased to announce that on November 1, we completed the creation of a joint-venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance to combine our pharmaceutical wholesale businesses in Germany. As a reminder, WBA owns 70% controlling equity interest in the joint-venture and McKesson holds the remaining 30% ownership interest. We have a continuous process in place to look at review and evaluate our portfolio and our strategy. Sometimes the outcome is we find assets that were not the natural owner of or as was the case in this transaction, we believe that combining our German wholesale businesses with that of WBA is the right decision to secure the long term success of both businesses. The combined businesses will strengthen the ability to compete and deliver high customer satisfaction through evolving our customer value proposition and delivering on operational excellence. Let me move to Medical. Demand continued to improve across the businesses in the quarter. As physician offices reopened across the U.S., the pandemic has also created new demand for products like COVID-19 tests, and an unprecedented level of demand for PPE across the segment, both of which we view as near term drivers of growth in the segment. We're proud to have a leading position in the distribution of lab equipment and solutions in the provider space. Over the past several years, we've developed relationships with many lab partners and help position our providers with the tools they need to deliver better patient outcomes. Our investments in our lab business and in our private brand portfolio continue to position us to serve our customers evolving needs, particularly in times like these. Also, to meet this incremental demand, we work quickly to strengthen our sourcing partnerships around the globe. We've built our inventory across several product categories to be ready for incremental and often unpredictable levels of demand from our customers, improve patient mobility and a continuation of near term opportunities for McKesson to meet our customers evolving demands contribute to the revised outlook for the segment. Turning to Prescription Technology Solutions, we'll refer to as RxTS for shorthand, which brings together our RelayHealth pharmacy, our CoverMyMeds, and our RxCrossroads businesses. I want to just spend a minute here on the evolution of these businesses into the reportable segment it is today. Overtime, we have acquired capabilities that together create a broad set of commercial services businesses. RelayHealth is an asset that's been in the McKesson family dating back to 2006. This business processes over 19 billion transactions a year and connects us to over 50,000 U.S. pharmacies, giving us access to the workflow of the vast majority of pharmacies in the U.S. with the goal of delivering value added services directly into this pharmacy workflow. In 2017, we acquired CoverMyMeds whose mission is to help patients get access to the appropriate drugs for their care by automating and accelerating the prescription approval process known as electronic prior authorization, and otherwise very manual and very time consuming process. This business gave us access to the workflow of over 700,000 providers by automating the insurance approval process for drug coverage. And most recently, in 2018, we acquired RxCrossroads, a business that expanded our services and solutions for our biopharma partners, and gave us disease state expertise specifically focused on specialty therapies. Bringing these businesses together under one leadership team allows us to have a more cohesive strategy and a highly coordinated go-to-market effort. Together, these businesses help to connect pharmacies, providers, payers and biopharma for next-generation patient access and adherence solutions. Last quarter I talked about one of these solutions that we've continued to invest in, and how we've been able to reduce the average time to therapy by 18 days. Just one year ago, we had one brand on the platform. Today, we have several brands live and a good growing pipeline. Expanding our brand support programs for our biopharma partners help to offset the impact of lower prescription volume trends, specifically new prescriptions in the quarter. As an important part of our strategy, we are continuing to invest in these businesses so that we can provide innovative solutions for biopharma and these investment dollars are reflected in our results in the segment year-to-date. Summarizing at the enterprise level, while we expected challenges in the quarter, we significantly exceeded our expectations and it is in large part due to the execution of our 80,000 employees. Our teams move quickly and decisively to react to the evolving customer needs and our expanded government partnerships. I continue to just be so impressed by our teammates, particularly those on the front lines for their unwavering focus and dedication during this incredibly challenging time. And as part of our appreciation, we again made special payments to our frontline employees recognizing their courage and their service to our company, our customers, and frontline caregivers for these past several months. I mentioned how the second quarter was a good example of the non-linearity of the recovery, as our results far exceeded our original and even revised expectations. While we're encouraged by the positive trajectory of the recovery, we continue to believe a full recovery back to pre-COVID levels will take longer than we originally contemplated and is unlikely to occur within our fiscal year. We continue to expect in the second half of the year as compared to the prior year, driven by an improved market near term demand from our customers and our current work in the U.S. government assembling the ancillary kits to go along with future COVID vaccines once approved. While some of the tailwinds I mentioned are expected to be near term, we believe we have made the investments necessary to position us as a partner of choice for our customers and manufacturers to about this time on our -- would be changed. And that I thought McKesson was well positioned to respond and react to that change. And I believe the second quarter was a clear example of how McKesson shines when faced with challenges and new opportunities. Despite an evolving market landscape, we remain focused on executing against our priorities, which now proudly includes playing an even larger role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging our deep expertise as we partner with the U.S. government on future COVID-19 vaccine efforts. I'm so proud of the execution I\u2019ve seen across the business in the first half of fiscal 2021 and the dedication of our employees remains unmatched in my view. Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, let me hand it over to Britt to elaborate. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share results in the second quarter. We delivered growth over our prior results and exceeded the expectations that we laid out on our Q1 earnings call despite an extremely volatile and challenging macro environment. We couldn't be more proud of the way our teams have executed and continue to deliver and innovate through this unprecedented period of uncertainty. We delivered solid core performance across our businesses in the quarter, including new product volumes and elevated demand in our medical surgical segment. This new volume includes an increase in the sales of COVID-19 tests, and increased volumes of personal protective equipment as we continue to respond to the needs of our customers during the pandemic. We also recognize gains in equity investments within our McKesson ventures portfolio, and I'll provide further detail on this. As a reminder, in our first quarter, we were impacted across our businesses by economic lockdowns and social distancing, which led to decreased healthcare utilization across the geographies that we operate in. However, in June, we began to see an acceleration of demand as volumes recovered earlier than we originally anticipated. As I mentioned during our Q1 earnings call, we expected a non-linear recovery from the effects of the pandemic over the remainder of our fiscal year. And we saw the non-linear course and recovery continue to play out in our second quarter results. Prescription volumes recovered from their lowest levels earlier in our fiscal year, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In primary care, patient visits continued to improve at a rate faster than we had anticipated. As Brian mentioned, in the second quarter, we observed increased volumes for COVID related products, particularly COVID tests as we stocked up to meet demands for additional testing and supplies, including personal protective equipment. We continue to respond to the dynamic and fluid environment and we're pleased with our execution throughout the first half of our fiscal year. This morning, I'll provide commentary on our second quarter results, and an update on the key assumptions that support our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2021. And my comments today will relate to our new segment structure. Let's turn now to our second quarter results, the summary of which including updated guidance can be found in the investors section of our website. And I'll start by pointing out two items that impacted our GAAP only results in the quarter. First within U.S. Pharmaceutical, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $50 million for an estimated liability related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act or OSA. The charge is the estimated share of the New York OSA surcharge for calendar years 2017 and 2018. As a reminder, we recorded an approval in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2019 for the estimated portion of the annual assessment under the OSA. The OSA was later ruled unconstitutional and the accrual was reversed in the third quarter of our fiscal 2019. That ruling was reversed in September of 2020. And therefore we took a charge in our fiscal second quarter. Secondly, within our international segment, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $69 million which was associated with segment realignment. Now to a discussion of adjusted earnings results for the second quarter, starting with our consolidated results on slide four. Consolidated revenues of $60.8 billion were up 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to market growth, and higher volumes from retail national account customers in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment. Adjusted gross profit increased 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in our medical surgical segment, which saw increased demand for COVID-19 tests in higher volumes from customers in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. Adjusted operating expenses increased 5% year-over-year, led by increased technology spend, which was partially offset by reduction in operating expenses due to the impact of COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit was $953 million for the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to the prior year, when excluding the $39 million contributed by Change Healthcare in the prior year, which was previously recorded in other. Adjusted operating profit grew 8%, which was ahead of our expectations. Interest expense was $50 million in the quarter decline of 22% compared to the prior year, due to lower commercial paper balances. And we now expect interest expense in fiscal 2021 to be between $220 million and $240 million. Our adjusted tax rate was 7.2% for the quarter in the range that we indicated on our first quarter earnings call in August. During the quarter, we realized discrete tax benefits of approximately $129 million. And we continue to assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%. Second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.80, which was up 33% in the quarter compared to the prior year, driven by a lower share count, a lower tax rate and operating performance led by the growth in the medical surgical solution segment. These items were partially offset by the lapping of the prior year contribution from the company's investment in Change Healthcare. Second [ph] quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pre-tax gains of approximately $49 million or $0.22 per diluted share associated with McKesson Ventures Equity Investments. Wrapping up our consolidated results, second quarter diluted weighted average shares were 163 million, a decrease of 11% year-over-year, which was driven by the successful exit of our investment in Change Healthcare, lowering our shares outstanding by approximately 15.4 million shares, and due to prior year share repurchases. Next I'll review our second quarter segment results which can be found on slides five through nine. As a reminder, effective with the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the customer revised its segment reporting structure. We now report results in four reportable segments, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, International, Medical Surgical Solutions, and Prescription Technology Solutions, or RxTS. And I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical where revenues were $48.1 billion, up 5% driven by market growth in higher retail national account volumes, partially offset by brand generic conversions. In our Specialty Businesses, particularly in our U.S. Oncolocy Network, we saw patient visits approach pre-COVID levels. Adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $658 million, driven by growth in Specialty, partially offset by higher operating expenses in support of our strategic growth initiatives. In the segment adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 137 basis points, which was a decrease of three basis points. Next on to International, where revenues were $9.5 billion in increase of 2% year-over-year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues decreased 1% primarily driven by lower volumes in the Canadian Pharmaceutical Distribution business, which was largely due to the exit of an unprofitable customer at the beginning of the fiscal year. This was partially offset by higher volumes in the European Pharmaceutical Distribution, and retail pharmacy businesses. Adjusted operating profit increased 20% year-over-year to $116 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 19% to $115 million driven by lower European operating expenses, including continued cost reduction initiatives and cost mitigation efforts in response to COVID-19. The segment adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 122 basis point, which was an increase of 18 basis points. As Brian mentioned in his remarks, yesterday, we announced the completed contribution of our German wholesale business to a newly formed joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. WBA now holds a 70% controlling equity interest in the JV and McKesson holds the remaining 30%. Going forward, McKesson will no longer consolidate the operating results of its German wholesale business, will recognize the 30% share of the JV earnings and losses in other income within our international segment. Moving on to Medical Surgical Solutions, we continue to see trends improve during the quarter. According to an October aculiar [Ph] report, primary care patient visits reached approximately 91% of the pre-COVID baseline. Our medical surgical business continues to play a vital role in the COVID-19 pandemic ramping up to meet customer demand with our delivery of COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment. revenues were $2.5 billion in the quarter up 23% driven by higher volumes of COVID-19 test in personal protective equipment in both our primary care and extended care businesses. Adjusted operating profit increased 27% to $210 million driven by demand for COVID-19 test, early flu season volumes and contributions from the extended care business. In the segement adjusted operating margin was 829 basis points, an increase of 22 basis points. Next, Prescription Technology Solutions, revenues were $668 million an increase of 7% driven by new brand support programs which were partially offset by the impact of lower prescription volume trends. Adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $104 million, which was driven by higher operating expense investment to support the company\u2019s biopharma service growth initiative. For the past several quarters, we\u2019ve outlined our strategic investment into the products and services within RxTS resulting in higher operating expenses to support future growth. We expect to continue to invest in the expansion of our technology offerings for our retail and biopharma customers to support the future operating profit growth of this segment. The segment adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 15.57% down from 18.37% in the prior year. And moving to Corporate, McKesson reported $135 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the quarter, an increase of 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased technology costs and lower interest income. This increase was largely offset by net gains of approximately $49 million on equity investments within our McKesson ventures portfolio. Now McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth stage, digital health and services companies and we're pleased with the portfolio result and the insights obtained. While mark-to-market valuations in this quarter resulted in gains from three of our investments. The impacts were consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment, quarter-to-quarter. As a result, McKesson\u2019s investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude which can vary for each investment. It's difficult to predict when gains or losses on our venture portfolio companies may occur and therefore our practise has been and will continue to not include Ventures portfolio activity in our guidance. And finally, we reported opioid related litigation expenses of $41 million in the quarter and for fiscal 2021, we continue to anticipate that opioid related legal costs will be approximately $160 million. Turning now to cash, which can be found on slide 11. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. For the first half of fiscal 2021, we had negative free cash flow of $306 million. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow varied from quarter to quarter and were impacted by timing included the day of the week that marks the close of the quarter. Looking at the cash flow dynamics, we saw higher levels of inventory this quarter, primarily resulting from the increased quantities of COVID testing and personal protective equipment and our participation in Operation Warp Speed. As we prepare for continued larger quantities of personal protective equipment, and Operation Warp Speed activity, we may experience additional working capital volatility. Year-to-date we made $265 million of capital expenditures led by internal investments in areas such as technology and continued investment in our strategic growth initiatives. We also made investments in data and analytics capabilities across the enterprise. For the first six months of the fiscal year, we returned $388 million of cash to our shareholders to $248 million of share repurchases and the payment of $140 million in dividends. We have $1.3 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorisation and we continue to expect diluted weighted shares outstanding in the range of $161 million to $163 million. Let me now turn to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2021. As we've seen over the past several months, the trajectory of the COVID virus can change quickly, as evidenced by recent increases in case numbers in many parts of North America, in Europe. On our Q4 FY20, and Q1 earnings calls, we outlined two assumptions underlie our guidance for fiscal 2021 that we are reiterating today. First, we do not assume a new wave of COVID-19, which would lead to shelter at home and economic lockdown, which would preclude patient mobility and consumption of Healthcare Services. And second, we do not assume any systemic customer insolvency events. We continue to believe that the recovery will take longer than initially anticipated, and it will not be linear, as the full impact of the pandemic is likely to persist beyond the fiscal year. The non-linear nature of the recovery continued in our second quarter. As a result of our second quarter performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, including near term opportunities related to COVID-19 demand, we're increasing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $16 to $16.50 from our previous range of $14.70 to $15.50. While our guidance does not take into account any revenues or earnings related to future COVID-19 vaccine distribution, it does include volumes for marketing program in our medical surgical segment, which I'll provide more details on shortly. We anticipate consolidated revenues to increase 2% to 4% for fiscal 2021, and we now expect the consolidated adjusted operating profitable growth 2% to 6% for the full year, when excluding the results of Change Healthcare from the prior year, an increase from our prior guidance of a decline between 1% and 4%. We continue to anticipate enterprise adjusted operating profit to grow sequentially throughout fiscal 2021. And now on to the Segments. In our U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment, we expect revenue growth of 3% to 6% and segment adjusted operating profit to grow 1% to 4% compared to the prior year. This takes into account improved volumes, particularly in our specialty businesses. In our International Segment, we expect a revenue decline of 5% to 10% year-over-year, and segment adjusted operating profit to be flat to 4% growth driven by the performance in our European business. Let me now provide some details on our Medical Surgical Segment. As discussed in my opening remarks throughout the quarter, we saw increasing volumes of COVID-19 tests. We expect these sales to be a near term opportunity in the segment, and it's factored into our guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2021. We've also seen increased volumes of personal protective equipment. This category remains vital as we support our customers during the pandemic. We expect that volumes will continue to fluctuate through the balance of the year. As the largest seasonal flu vaccine distributor in the U.S., we continue to prepare for the influenza season, which is particularly important this year due to the impacts of COVID-19 and the nation's healthcare system. While it's too early to predict how the flu season will progress, we're actively preparing to meet the needs of our customers. As Brian mentioned in his remarks, we're also partnering with HHS on preparing and storing ancillary kits to be used in the administration of future COVID-19 vaccine. We\u2019ve included in our guidance the net benefit to adjusted earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 in the second half of our fiscal year related to our partnership with HHS. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2021 Medical Surgical Segment revenue to increase between 20% and 25% and segment adjusted operating profit to grow in the range of 8% to 18%. In our Prescription Technology Solution segment, we expect segment revenue to grow 5% to 10% and segment adjusted operating profit in the range of down 5% to flat. We expect to improve it in this segment over the second half of the fiscal year as we continue to realize the benefits of our strategic investments. As this is our first quarter, reporting Prescription Technology Solutions segment, I want to provide some background in the drivers within the segment. Brian discussed in his remarks how this segment brings together our RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads businesses. Volumes in a RelayHealth and CoverMyMeds businesses are driven by pharmaceutical transactions including prior authorizations. Volumes in these businesses are also driven by adding drug brands to the existing platforms and services that we offer to our biopharma and pharmacy partners. Moving on to Corporate, we now expect corporate expenses in the range of $625 million to $675 million. Our Corporate guidance takes into account increased technology investments and the impact of our second quarter equity investment gains and our McKesson Ventures portfolio as previously discussed. Let me wrap up our outlook by turning to cash flow. We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. As a reminder, we historically have generated the majority of our cash in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. This consistent cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to continue investing in our strategic initiatives, which position our business for long term growth. Our investment grade credit rating remains a priority and underpins our financial flexibility. We have two bonds totaling approximately $1 billion, which mature during the second half of our fiscal year. We intend to utilize a portion of our free cash flow to modestly deliver by up to $500 million, further strengthening our balance sheet and financial position. And we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through a modest dividend and through share buybacks. In closing, we're pleased with the results of our fiscal second quarter and we're confident in our updated outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our focus and execution should drive another full year of operating profit growth, despite a challenging and competitive environment. We will continue to invest in high growth, high margin markets in strategic areas that will further leverage our differentiated positions in oncology and biopharma services. We're proud of our expanding partnerships as we work on the COVID-19 vaccine effort, and continue to be an important part of the pandemic response to maintain supply chain stability. And with that, Holly, let me turn the call back to you for Q&A. Holly Weiss : Thank you. We will now take questions. In the interest of time, please limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator? Brian Tyler : Operator, can we go to questions please? Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Your line is now open. Eric Percher : Thank you. Your role enabling the vaccination distribution is of great interest. Brian, could you help us understand what's required operationally, it sounds like you're developing some new DCs as well as using some of the existing infrastructure. And then Brett, can you help us understand the financial flows from a government contract of this type? Is some of the initial government investment flow through the P&L? And should we think of this as paid for preparation, or is it really tied to the amount of volume that ultimately moves through? Brian Tyler : Well, good morning, Eric. Thanks for the question. We're fortunate to have had a H1N1 experience about a decade ago and provided a bit of a roadmap or a playbook for us to execute. I mean, based on the volumes that we've been given and projections, we have quickly been engaged in standing up some new facilities both for the vaccine distribution and for the kidding and frankly for just some storage. That is all in-flight on plan tracking, but yes, it will be -- it's a big effort to stand up several new facilities and onboard a lot of new employees, but something that we've successfully done in the past. Britt Vitalone : Eric, let me address your second question. There's a couple different elements to this program. As we've talked about, previously, we were reimbursed for some of the costs to set up these new facilities. We will also when a vaccine is approved and we begin distribution, we\u2019ll recognize a fair value for the services that we perform, similar to a third party logistics provider that's on the vaccine side. Obviously, that hasn't started yet. As the -- there's not been a vaccine that's been approved. On the kitting side, it will be very similar to you know, how we prepare kits that we did in H1N1 as we prepare kits, and produce those kits will recognize revenue as those kits are prepared and produced. Holly Weiss : Next question, operator. Operator : And next will be Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Robert Jones : Great, thanks for the question. I guess maybe just to stick with COVID, but look looking at the Med-Surg segment; it appeared that EBIT in the quarter, came in somewhere roughly around 50 million higher than what was implied relative to the back half guidance you guys had given previously. Just wanted to see if you could share or help us understand kind of what drove the performance as it relates to the increase in COVID-19 tests that you mentioned. And then the increased demand for PPE just trying to really get some context around just what the contribution has looked like in that segment from COVID test and PPE would be helpful? Brian Tyler : Sure, thanks for the question. I'll start certainly, as the year has progressed we've seen some momentum in that -- in the segment, what we talked about in both of our comments and what we've seen through the through our second quarter, is that COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment have increased in volume throughout the quarter. So they're a key driver for that. We also I also touched on early vaccine, flu vaccine sales, so too early to call the flu season, but we did see earlier of flu vaccine sales, and we had anticipated a little bit stronger than we had anticipated in the quarter. And we're seeing really strong underlying performance as flu vaccine, sales start to pick up as COVID-19 test kits pick up that really helps the core business, it drives more primary care visits, drives more supplies within our core business. So I think all of those things really play together. But certainly COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment are key drivers in the quarter, and key drivers for our full year race. Holly Weiss : Next question, operator? Operator : And next will be Stephen Baxter from Wolfe Research. Sir, your line is now open. Stephen Baxter : Thanks. Wanted to ask about the trajectory and seasonality of the Prescription Technology Business. It seems like the full year guidance implies a pretty big step up in EBIT relative the way you just posted for Q2. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the factors driving this increase whether there's anything to do with, some of the timing of investment spend that you cited in the release. And then just in general, what's the right way to think about seasonality in this business, trying to understand that we should be thinking about future periods using the second half of fiscal 2021 as a baseline or if there's other considerations that we should be keeping in mind. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes, appreciate that question. I'll start and then Brian can certainly elaborate. We have been making investments into this business. We think that this is a business where innovation can happen. And so we've been increasing our investments over the last year or so. And we'll continue to do that. Certainly, one of the things that we've noticed here is that lower prescription volume trends versus the prior year, particularly new prescriptions, or new branded prescriptions, has had an impact on that business from a top line perspective. We do expect that the second half of the year, we'll see some very strong growth. And typically in this business, you can expect that the fourth quarter is a little bit stronger seasonally than the other three quarter. So I think it's a few things. It's been the lower prescription volume trends year-over-year, investments that we continue to make in the business to drive new brand programs and innovation. And then we expect that the back half of the year will be stronger and typically seasonally, Q4 is a little bit stronger than the other three quarters of the year. Brian Tyler : And not much to add to that other than we do think as we bring these businesses together and look at the connectivity we have and the providers and pharmacies we look at the automation experience and tools we have, and the expertise in various disease states. We think this is a growing part of the market. And there, we have opportunities to invest internally and innovation that will deliver superior returns over time. And we're we continue and are committed to making those investments. Holly Weiss : Next question? Operator : Next will be Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is now open. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks, and thanks for taking my call. Just a PPE question. You're saying demand is gone up. Your inventory levels have gone up. I guess, I'd like to understand the dynamics around the pricing of PPE and how that affects your revenues and/or or profit. PPE prices seem to be stabilizing or maybe coming down a little bit. But then also we're hearing there's a shortage of nitrile gloves. Can you just talk a little bit about pricing dynamics change your profit in the PPE segment? Brian Tyler : Yes, sure. Maybe I'll just make a couple of general comments. We certainly have seen higher demand for these products over the course of the year. That demand can continued through the second quarter, more in the COVID 19 test kits in the second quarter, but PPE has been heavy demand as well. And look, we have very good and solid relationships from a logistics perspective with many different suppliers. We believe that that allows us to source competitively and clearly the market is it's a competitive market on the sell side. But again, we've seen some stability in the pricing in the first half of the year, but it's a volatile market, there's a lot of, the demand is changing as the year goes on. And our sourcing will adjust to that. And so what we're really trying to call out here is that we've seen a lot of demand in the first half of the year. It's been kind of volatile, and we would expect that we'll see good demand in the second half of the year, but certainly not in a straight line. But we feel that the relationships that we have with our suppliers put us in a good position to meet the customer demand. Holly Weiss : Next question. Operator : And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Lisa Gill : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Brian, just going back to your comments around Specialty and the resilience on the oncology side. If I start to think about biosimilars coming to the market, especially in the oncology area, one, can you talk about if there were any benefit from biosimilars in the quarter? And then secondly, if you or Britt can help us to understand the margin differential and the opportunity around biosimilars as we think about strengthen your Specialty business? Brian Tyler : Sure, we've got a very strong provider base for specialty products, and that's our we call sometimes our non-affiliated or non-U.S. oncology and our U.S. oncology. The Oncology business in particular, I think, has been pretty resilient, probably visits even at the trough period or relatively stronger than many of the other specialties. And what we're seeing now is it combined the physical patient visits with the telehealth activities, we're seeing volumes really get back almost to pre-COVID levels. And, we have a tremendous footprint in that business. We have a broad set of scaled assets. And one of the things that where we think we'll be able to do and are doing and will continue to expand over time is take advantage of not just biosimilars, but other new speciality products that launch into that space. So, our conviction in the community provider settings and how -- what important role we think it plays in the healthcare landscape, and we continue to invest and expand our offerings to position us to take advantage of those opportunities. Britt Vitalone : Lisa, maybe just to touch on your the last part. We have seen that biosimilars have grown this year. We\u2019ve seen more biosimilars launch into the space particularly into specialty provider and oncology. We think that biosimilars are a win win win. They're lower cost opportunities for patients, they provide economics for physicians, and they certainly provide better economics for us. So we like that biosimilars are continuing to develop. They're not very material yet, but they do continue to grow. And certainly they provide better costs for the patient, the physician and better margin opportunity for McKesson. Holly Weiss : Next question. Operator : And next will be Jailendra Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jailendra Singh : Hi. Thanks, everyone. Quickly, a couple of clarification on the second half versus first half outlook. Your Medical-Surgical segment revenues, of course, it now includes the benefit from vaccine distribution in second half. But can you give us any flavor around what is the second half outlook on Med-Surg business on apples-to-apples basis compared with 9% growth you had in first half? And same thing on International segment, what is driving that high-single to low-double-digit decline for second half outlook versus down 3% in first half? Brian Tyler : Thank you for the question. And I'll let Britt respond to it. But just to clarify, the medical business really is not the vaccine distribution, but it's the kitting operation or the production and storage of the kits that will support the administration of the vaccine. Britt Vitalone : Right. Thanks, Brian. And so what we are seeing in our second half is a continuation of some of the momentum that we saw in the first half, we expect that COVID-19 tests will continue to be a big portion of the business in the second half of the year. Our core business continues to have very strong momentum. And then as Brian just clarified, we do, we did put in guidance to kitting portion of the contract that will drive some top lines as well as the $0.15 to $0.20 of adjusted earnings that I called out. So what we have in our medical surgical business is a very broad based business that we've talked about many times across primary care, extended care. And we continue to grow there. And the opportunities that we have now through our relationships with lab suppliers and others is just providing additional momentum in the business. Holly Weiss : Next question. Operator : And next will be Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Michael Cherny : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dive in a little bit on the U.S. pharma side, and particularly thinking about how the pacing of growth this quarter could influence or impact the growth in the back half of the year. You noted some of the higher volumes from retail national accounts. This is despite what appears to be market wide softness and what you've been called to in terms of the pacing of recovery. So heading into the second half of the year, outside of Specialty which I know you already addressed. What are the key drivers to support U.S. pharma revenue growth in particular? And how should we think about how those should drop down to the bottom line and incremental margins? Britt Vitalone : Yes, I'll start. And certainly Brian can elaborate. I think what we are seeing in our U.S. pharmaceutical business, just to be clear, it's our traditional U.S. wholesale business to independence to retail national accounts and the health systems. We're seeing pretty good stability in that business. Now we're seeing quarter-to-quarter stable position, stable growth. You add to that the position that we have in our specialty provider businesses, the opportunities that we're seeing in oncology, and what you're seeing is a business now that is growing at a stable, you know, 2% to 4% that we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. So I don't think there's anything specific. I think it's just the good execution, the stability of our customers and the stability of the environment, that's really allowing us to continue to perform. Brian Tyler : Yes, I think that the brand market has been relatively stable, the generic markets been relatively stable. And we've been very focused on cost and efficiency initiatives in this business to help underpin that. Holly Weiss : Next question. Operator : Next will be George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. George Hill : Hey, good morning, Britt and Brian. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you guys would quantify or detail, both from an office procedure perspective, and maybe from an RX volumes perspective, what percent of baseline you guys expect to achieve in the back half of the year as it relates to volumes. I know in the press release, it says you're still not expecting kind of a return to baseline, but we'd love to know what percentage you guys are thinking of getting back to? Brian Tyler : Yes, great question. And always a little bit risky to prognosticate in the current environment. I mean, even given the way we've seen the disease progress in Europe in the U.S. in the last several weeks, shows the volatility that's still out there in the marketplace. I mean, you'll recall we early in the year, when we gave our first guidance, we assumed Q1 was going to be the trough that Q2 would get sequentially better, Q3 would get better. And by Q4, we would be back to what we call pre-COVID levels. If you think about the way the years unfolded, we had really high volatility in the first quarter, month-to-month, even week-to-week, the swings were pretty challenging. I think we saw that begin to stabilize a little bit as we got midway through Q2, and the trend lines started to look like they were they were leveling out a little bit. And so that's what gives us the pause or the revised view, I guess that that we won't get back to full pre-COVID elective procedures, physician office visits and scripts by Q4, but the recovery is likely to extend in well into the calendar 2021. And so that's our current view. And that's what we worked into our guidance. Holly Weiss : Next question. Operator : Next will be Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, you touched on this for the US just a minute ago. But, I guess, I'm curious to hear about the Rx volume progression throughout the quarter for Europe. Maybe any early color on trends in October as well, just given that some of the region in Europe seem to be going back into lockdown mode? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Yes, we track these trends in Europe very closely. And frankly, what you see is it's really not a Europe trend. It's a country by country trend depending on how the COVID virus itself progresses and how local governments react to react with their social policy closed down, locked down and things of that nature. So it really is very different. We saw France for example, tended to be ahead of the U.K. and the way it experienced these waves. But the general theme has been pretty consistent. Then we had the trough and the key one period we had slow strengthening. We're very proud of the way our teams have operated there. Our pharmacies are open. They're servicing their communities. They've adopted all the new safety protocols and standards that enable them to provide that continuity of care. But I'd say at a macro level, I mean, while there is definitely difference between countries and the way, the way country governments react, it's generally the same. Holly Weiss : Next question. Operator : And next will be Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi. Good morning. As a quick follow-up question on the COVID vaccine benefit, if we think qualitatively about the relative contribution from kitting versus vaccine, how should we think about these two? Is vaccine contributions, in general, qualitatively tend to be higher than the kitting or vice versa? Thinking about the broader potential opportunity. Brian Tyler : Yes, thanks for the question, Ricky. Yes, we've only quantified our relationship on the kitting side, that's really all that we can quantify at this point. We don't have a vaccine approved. So it's too early for us to really provide you any guidance on that. And I wouldn't try to relate the two, they're very different programs. I would say though, that the kitting program does provide us the opportunity to continue to expand our relationship with the government and others. We certainly have all the capabilities. And that's why we were selected to be able to continue to expand our capabilities and services. So we're focused right now on the programs that are in flight, but certainly there are opportunities for us beyond that. Holly Weiss : Next question. Operator : And next will be Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim Investment. Your line is open. Glen Santangelo : Oh, yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian, I just want to follow up and maybe pivot towards the opioid litigation status. It's been a while since we've heard anything on this front. And, in the press release, you seem to suggest that you're going to reserve some monies for settling with the state of New York potentially. I was just kind of curious. I mean, has COVID really slowed the process here, it felt like we were making much greater progress in the beginning of the year tracking towards the settlement. Now it feels like, there's some inertia in the process. And I just kind of curious if you can maybe give us an update on any signposts that we should look out from this point. Britt Vitalone : Hey Glen, just before Brian jumps in there, I just want to clear up. The New York charge that we took was related to the surcharge that was enacted in 2017, and 2018. And so what we're doing here is just picking up the approval for the reversal of that court litigation suit back in 2019. So it's not related to the larger opiod settlement at all. Brian Tyler : Yes, great, I I was going to make that point. So, I mean -- and as regards to the larger discussions, I mean, I think it's fair to say there was a few months' period there where the nations and the AGs and the distributors focus was on responding to a pandemic. But that -- we're now in the eight-month of this. And just like all of us have had to find ways to return to normal business. We continue to be engaged with the AGs. We continue to believe we're making progress in the discussions. We continue to be hopeful we'll reach a broad resolution, because we think that that's the best way to accelerate relief for people and communities that have been impacted by various health crisis at this point. So, we remain very focused and hopeful. Holly Weiss : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. And that question will come from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore. Your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys, thanks for the question. And I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more in terms of details on AMP. Just in terms of like how you see the trajectory of that growing the types of drugs and potential and potentially also how you guys positive value proposition to customers and sort of if you could comment anything on margin, so that would be helpful. Thanks. Brian Tyler : So I mean, relative to AMP. I mean, I really think about this, as you know, there are existing models out there to do access and adherence. That really frankly, hasn't haven't really innovated too much in a long time. And the opportunity we see here is to bring really the disease state expertise, the expertise we have over two decades supporting these access adherence like programs, but then leveraging the technologies that we have in a Relay or a CoverMyMeds to essentially automate and that process more efficient. Get patients started on their therapies quicker, help them adhere to them longer so that ultimately they get better health outcomes. And so, it's really the combination of these things, this kind of redesigning access and adherence model. And we've been very pleased with our early partnerships and the development of this, we've been very quick to take it from concept into market, and it's been quite encouraging and nice to see the number of brands on that program grow and the pipeline continue to expand. Brian Tyler : Okay, well, I'd like to apologize for running a few minutes late. We wanted to be provide as much insight as we could on the call. I want to thank everybody for your great questions and thank Raul, for helping facilitate this call. I'm going to conclude my remarks today by once again thanking all of the frontline workers across the world who are working day in and day out to keep us healthy and keep us safe. And I want to recognize the great work of the McKesson team all 80,000 of them for their persistence, for their commitment, for their energy, resiliency during this time, they really are playing a vital part in keeping our communities healthy as well. So I wish you all a very good day. I hope you voted if you haven't, please do. And with that, we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Holly Weiss : Good morning and welcome everyone to McKesson's Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, is included in today's press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Holly. And good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us on our call today. Before I get to our third quarter results, I'd like to update you on the status of discussions related to a framework proposed resolution of opioid-related claims. In the third quarter, we made an accrual of approximately $8.1 billion, reflecting the amount we would expect to pay over a period of 18-years for opioid-related claims of governmental entities, with more than 90% intended to remediate the opioid crisis. We continue to be in ongoing advanced discussions with State Attorneys General and counsel for plaintiffs and based on the substantial progress we have made toward a settlement, we determined it was appropriate to accrue for this liability. Although we're prepared to defend ourselves vigorously, we remain hopeful that a broad resolution can be achieved, which would accelerate relief efforts for the people and communities impacted by this public health crisis. Now, let's get to the results. We're pleased to report third quarter total company revenues of $62.6 billion and an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.60, which is ahead of the prior year and the revised expectations we laid out in November. The third quarter was yet another example of the often unpredictable and dynamic nature of the recovery from the effects of the pandemic, while heightened demand persisted for products like COVID-19 tests and PPE, medical visits, and prescription volume trends did show some signs of softness in the quarter. Despite those macro trends, we're pleased to have grown adjusted operating profit across each of our segments. And our third quarter results reflect the important role McKesson plays in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and abroad. Our fundamentals remain strong, and we continue to see success across the differentiated assets in our broad portfolio. Today, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance range to $16.95 to $17.25 per diluted share. This is up from our previous range of $16 to $16.50 per diluted share. This update reflects our solid performance in the quarter and improved outlook across the business, including the anticipated contribution from our work distributed - distributing COVID-19 vaccines and assembling and distributing ancillary supply kit. Before turning to the business, I do want to expand on the work being done across McKesson in support of the COVID-19 vaccination efforts in the US. In August of last year, the CDC selected McKesson to ramp up and distribute future COVID-19 vaccines in the US, expanding our 14-year partnership. The CDC exercises existing option within our vaccines for children contract, making McKesson the centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer vaccines, similar to the role we played in the H1N1 pandemic over 10 years ago. Our team immediately got to work, standing up the infrastructure needed the support and initiative of this scale, we quickly established new fit-for-purpose distribution centers, separate from our normal business operation, so that when vaccines became available for distribution, McKesson would be ready to execute our part. We've added four new distribution centers that are highly specialized and capable of frozen and refrigerated cold chain COVID-19 vaccine distribution, and given our work also includes the assembly and storage of ancillary supplies, several more DCs were brought online to support this additional work. In total, we've added over 3.3 million square feet of dedicated space to support this initiative. A little over a month ago, on December 18, Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine became the second COVID-19 vaccine granted emergency use authorization by the FDA and given this vaccine is within the scope of our contract with the CDC, McKesson began distributing the vaccine within 48 hours of its authorization. Through January, McKesson has successfully distributed over 25 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to sites around the country. From a distribution perspective, we remain on target to meet the US government's plan to distribute hundreds of millions of refrigerated and frozen vaccines. There are currently distributing vaccines from only two of the four DCs built for this program. I'd like to remind you that in this operation, McKesson is operating as a third-party logistics provider on behalf of the US government, which is similar to our role during H1N1. The US government administers this program allocating vaccines to states, pharmacy chains, federal agencies, et cetera and takes orders for the participating provider site. Ultimately, the US government makes all allocation decisions and decides what product is distributed to what site, and in what quantities. The orders are submitted to McKesson and when the orders are received, we pick pack and ship orders typically within one business day of receiving the order. We are using the depth and breadth of our experience to manage the safe distribution of hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines to the entire country. We believe this distribution approach is the safest and fastest way to get COVID-19 vaccines into the arms of Americans across our country. This is a complex distribution program with several partners, collaborating from end-to-end and McKesson takes extensive measures to maintain the safety and efficacy of the vaccine supply chain. Our goal is that every shipment be received at the administration site in a timely manner and within the specified guidelines established by the manufacturer. As I've discussed, our work as a centralized distributor is now underway. So earnings from the COVID-19 vaccine distribution program are factored into our improved outlook for fiscal 2021. McKesson has also been hard at work preparing and distributing the ancillary kits needed to administer all of the COVID 19 vaccines, including for the Pfizer ultra-frozen vaccine, even though Pfizer's vaccine itself is not distributed by McKesson. Each week we're producing enough kits to support 10 to 15 million doses and to date, we have assembled enough kits to support over 250 million doses. It's our great privilege to have been selected to serve the US government for these roles and we've been engaged with the new administration's transition team and stand ready to fulfill our commitments in the ongoing battle against COVID-19. Now let's get to the business. I'll summarize the third quarter and then turn it over to Britt to provide more details. Let me start with US Pharmaceutical. Prescription volume trends in the third quarter were again reflective of the non-linear trajectory of the recovery. After seeing stability in the market trends in the second quarter, we saw some volume declines in our third quarter as it progressed, driven in part by a light cold and flu season versus the prior year. Despite some softness in volume trends within the quarter, we continued to see stability in brand and generic pricing. Through the third quarter and into January, branded price inflation has tracked in line with our original expectation. For generics, we continued to be disciplined in our approach to pricing in the market. On the buy side, through the scale and strength of our sourcing operation with ClarusONE, we've leveraged our relationships with a diverse set of manufacturers to main - stable levels of supply at low cost for our customers throughout the pandemic. Strong pricing discipline and effective sourcing continue to allow us to earn spread in the business. While total prescription volume trends fluctuated in the quarter, specialty volumes and particularly oncology have been more resilient throughout the pandemic, our provider solutions and US Oncology businesses have performed well year-to-date and our key areas of investment as we look to further differentiate our capabilities in oncology. In the quarter, the US Oncology network continues to expand its reach in some local communities by welcoming two new practices, further strengthening the availability of advanced cancer care across the communities we serve. US Oncology also reached a major milestone in its journey to provide high-quality, value-based care by enrolling its 100,000th patient in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Oncology Care Model. Lastly, our Health Mart franchises are expanding the role they play in the fight against the pandemic. Health Mart pharmacies have performed more than 400,000 COVID-19 test collections through a partnership with Equinor [ph] and the HHS. Many of our Health Mart franchise pharmacies are also preparing to serve as COVID-19 vaccine administration sites in local communities when the CDC moves into the next phase of the rollout. Let's transition to our international segment. Our businesses in Europe and Canada are continuing to play their part in the pandemic response and as essential business our pharmacies remain open. Through our owned and banner [ph] stores abroad we're working with local governments to accelerate COVID-19 testing efforts. Our digital offerings like Well.ca in Canada and Echo by LloydsPharmacy continue to grow quickly and expand their service offerings to meet the needs of patients. Also, as a reminder, on November 1st, we completed the creation of a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, combining our German wholesale businesses. While it is still early days, we are excited about these teams coming together and the progress they are making. Let's turn to Medical. When we gave initial guidance for fiscal 2021, our alternate site customers were facing significant headwinds with providers and surgery centers seeing sharp declines in office visits due to shelter-in-place guidelines. These dynamics were clearly reflected in our first quarter results, which were significantly down versus prior year. The pandemic continues to affect the needs of our customers in this market and how they operate today, who looks very different than it did nine months ago. As our customers reopen and address COVID-19, the core business has recovered and returned to growth. Within one of the largest - with one of the largest and most tenured sales forces in the industry, our Primary and Extended Care teams work hard every day to ensure that our customers have the products and services they need to provide patient care, whether it's COVID-19 tests, PPE or pharmaceuticals. Investments we've made into our lab business over the last few years have given us additional expertise and reach around lab testing solutions. So as COVID testing emerged, we have been well-positioned to expand our existing partnerships and quickly drive these products into the community provider channels. We strategically built this business to succeed at moments like this. We are the leader in distribution to the alternate site setting and offer a broad set of products and solutions to over 250,000 customers. The broad capabilities of this business position us well to quickly take advantage of new opportunities as they emerge and as customer demand evolve. I continue to be impressed at how our Medical business has responded to the rapid change in fiscal 2021. Turning now to Prescription Technology Solutions. We saw solid growth in the quarter, underpinned by the expansion of our brand support programs for our biopharma partners. We invest in innovation in this segment, and our results reflect positive contributions from our prior authorization solutions and newer products, like Access for More Patients, also known as AMP. AMP service offering is continuing to be recognized in the market, both by our biopharma customers and the industry. AMP recently signed on a full product portfolio for a top pharmaceutical company and was recognized as one of 2020's most innovative products in the health care and medical category according to Best in the Biz Awards, an honor voted on by top reporters and editors in North America. Taking a step back to reflect, it was over two years ago that we redefined our strategy, identifying the areas of oncology and biopharma services as key differentiators and areas of investment. We also set out to make the business simpler and more efficient, kicking-off a comprehensive review of the company's operating and cost structure. Since then, we have been methodical in our actions, as we work to build a connected ecosystem of assets across the enterprise, with the ultimate goal of creating innovative solutions that improve patient care delivery and drive incremental profit growth for the company. Through internal investments and M&A, we've built a powerful and scaled specialty business with deep oncology expertise. Today, we are the number one distributor in community oncology. And the US oncology network is the nation's largest network of its kind, with 1,400 independent physicians. Most recently, we launched Ontada, an internally developed technology and insights business dedicated to transforming the fight against cancer. Ontada builds off our existing capabilities and combines real-world data and research with the leading suite of technologies to help deliver innovative solutions that improve patient outcomes. Shortly after the launch of Ontada, Amgen and McKesson announced a strategic agreement to advance cancer care and improve outcomes by accelerating the development and access to life-changing medicine. Last quarter, I talked about the evolution of our Prescription Technology Solutions assets into the exciting business it is today. This business is a powerful biopharma commercial services business that enables over $5 billion in annual prescription savings for patients through innovation and next-generation patient access and adherence solutions. The strategic investments I've discussed have been powered in part by the successful efforts to streamline the business. We've centralized many back office functions in North America and Europe and have become smarter as an organization about how we spend and invest. We also continued to evaluate the portfolio and position the business for success. Last year, we successfully exited our position in Change Healthcare and most recently, we created the joint venture in Germany with WBA. Further, we re-segmented the business to better align us around our strategies and increased focus and speed throughout the organization. But underpinning everything we do is our continued focus on growing the core business, where fundamentals continue to be stable and execution has improved. Success in the core enables strong cash flow generation, which we can use to reinvest back into the business and return to our shareholders. While the pandemic has brought an unprecedented level of uncertainty, it has not paused our strategic priorities and we will continue to invest to differentiate and innovate our service offerings to our customers. This has served us well throughout the pandemic as we responded to near term demands from our customers, but it also positions the business to succeed in the long-term. As we look forward to our fiscal 2022, I'd like to walk through some of the things we're thinking about. First and foremost, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present many unknowns. The trajectory of the virus can change quickly, accelerating in some communities and decelerating in others. The recovery from the pandemic is likely to continue to be non-linear into fiscal 2022. But McKesson will continue to be part of the recovery, serving our customers and partners every step of the way. Secondly, our work distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies will ultimately be influenced by the number of vaccines that come to market, the percentage of the population that chooses to get vaccinated, the effectiveness of each vaccine, and the duration of the centralized distribution model. These same dynamics are likely to have an impact on the levels of demand we see for products like COVID tests and PPE in fiscal 2022. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a new administration in Washington and our teams have been working closely with the new administration's transition team and now emerging team to ensure that the proposed reforms support solutions to improve cost, quality, and access. I'll reiterate that we continue to see stability in the core and strength in the underlying fundamentals of the business heading into fiscal 2022. We will continue to make strategic investments in the areas of oncology and biopharma services. So, in summary, through nine months, each quarter of the current fiscal year has proven to be different one to the next and the results we're sharing today reflect McKesson's ability to rise to the challenge and meet the evolving demands of our customers and partners. The pandemic has not put our strategy on hold, but has challenged us to continue to think differently and react more quickly against the dynamic macroeconomic backdrop. Before I close, I also want to touch on our commitment to our local and global communities. We're dedicated to doing our part to eliminate bias and promote equality. And we are proud to have been recently recognized as one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign for the eighth consecutive year. And we recently recruited Dr. Kelvin Baggett to newly created role of Chief Impact Officer, reporting to me, where he will be responsible for advancing our strategy and execution related to diversity, equity and inclusion, ESG and McKesson's overall social impact. We are excited to have Kelvin on the team. In the end, it all comes back to our people. The passion and the focus of our 80,000-plus employees are what make McKesson special. And without them, the work we're doing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic would not be possible. My greatest thanks to them all. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Britt. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to speak to you about another solid quarter for McKesson. Against a dynamic and challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we continued to respond to the evolving demand brought on by the pandemic, leveraging the breadth and scale of our distribution and services capabilities. The underlying core business continues to be fundamentally sound. And we've built solid revenue, operating profit and cash flow momentum over the past several quarters, which continued in the December quarter. Our solid broad-based third quarter results reflect this momentum. Our demonstrated delivery of consistent and stable organic growth, combined with the execution of the vaccine and kitting programs with the US government, are enabling us to further increase fiscal year 2021 guidance. As we mentioned during our first and second quarter earnings calls, we expected the non-linear recovery from the effects of the pandemic to persist for the remainder of our fiscal year and likely into our fiscal 2022. We saw this uneven recovery play out in Q3. COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels. This led to some softening in recovery trends during the quarter. Prescription volumes were softer than the prior quarter. And Primary Care patient visits and elective procedures continued to remain below pre-COVID levels. Despite these challenges, in Q3, all segments delivered year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth. And year-to-date, adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 14% compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, we recognized a benefit from our work with the US government for assembling and distributing ancillary supply kits needed to administer COVID-19 vaccine. And while not material to the quarter, we also began distributing the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in late December. Volumes for COVID-related testing and personal protective equipment or PPE continued to remain high in our Medical segment, while the impacts of social distancing measures have resulted in soft cold and flu season. According to IQVIA, US adult food diagnosis were down approximately 10% compared to the prior year, which resulted in a lower generic flu stress [ph] And similar to last quarter, in the third quarter we recognized unplanned gains on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. Now on to our third quarter results, which can be found in the Investors section of our website. And let me start by pointing out two items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. Based on the substantial progress toward settlement of our ongoing opioid weighted claims, it is concluded that a broad settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities is now probable. It can be reasonably estimated. And as a result we reported a pretax charge of $8.1 billion, $6.7 billion after tax. Secondly, we recorded a pretax long-lived asset impairment charge of $115 million, primarily related to McKesson's Retail Pharmacy businesses in Canada and Europe. Let's move now to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the third quarter, starting with our consolidated results on slide four. Consolidated revenues of $62.6 billion were up 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to market growth, higher specialty volumes in our US Pharmaceutical segment and COVID-related volumes in our Medical business, including COVID tests and PPE. This was partially offset by branded to generic conversions and the contribution of our German wholesale business through joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Adjusted gross profit increased to 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in our Medical-Surgical segment, which once again benefited from the contribution of near-term opportunities, including distribution of COVID-19 tests and our work assembling ancillary supply kit for COVID-19 vaccine. Adjusted operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year, led by higher operating expenses to support growth in strategic investments across the business, partially offset by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, and a reduction in operating expenses due to the impact of COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. When excluding the $51 million contributed by Change Healthcare in the prior year, which was previously recorded in Other, adjusted operating profit grew 18%, exceeding our expectations. Interest expense was $55 million in the quarter, a decline of 14% compared to the prior year, which was driven by lower commercial paper balances and the retirement of approximately $1 billion of debt. We now expect fiscal 2021 interest expense in the range of $210 million to $230 million. Our adjusted tax rate was 21.6% for the quarter, and we continue to assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%. Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.50, which was up 21% in the quarter compared in the prior year, driven by a lower share count and growth in the Medical Surgical Solution segment. These items were partially offset by a higher tax rate and the lapping of the prior year contribution from the company's investment in Change Healthcare. Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $30 million or $0.14 per diluted share, which is associated with McKesson's Ventures equity investment. Wrapping up our consolidated results, third quarter diluted weighted average shares were 161 million, a decrease of 10% year-over-year, driven by the successful tax-free exit of our investment in Change Healthcare at the end of fiscal 2020, which lowered our shares outstanding by approximately 15 point million shares and in addition to share repurchase activity in the current and prior year. We now expect diluted weighted shares outstanding for fiscal 2021 to be approximately 162 million. And next, I'll review our third quarter segment results, which can be found on slides five through 9, starting with US Pharmaceutical, where revenues were $49.5 billion, up 7%, driven by market growth and higher specialty volumes, partially offset by branded generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit increased 2% to $656 million, driven by growth in specialty, partially offset by higher operating expenses in support of our strategic growth initiatives, including Ontada. These investments accounted for an approximate 2% headwind to year-over-year segment growth. Our segment results were also negatively impacted by the light colder flu season. Given the timing of FDA approval of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine in December, earnings related to the vaccines distribution were immaterial in the third quarter. I'll provide more detail on our outlook related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution later in my remarks. And for the third quarter, branded price activity trended in line with our expectations. Additionally, based on manufacturer price actions taken in January, we are maintaining our full year fiscal 2021 assumption of branded price increases to be in the mid-single digit percent range. Next, International. Revenues were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues decreased 10%, primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the newly formed joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was effective as of November 1st, 2020. The segment also had lower volumes in the Canadian Pharmaceutical distribution business, largely due to the exit of an unprofitable customer at the beginning of the fiscal year. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, segment revenue increased 4% year-over-year and was flat on an FX-adjusted basis. Adjusted operating profit increased 9% year-over-year to $158 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $150 million, primarily driven by two additional sell days in the European business compared to the prior year. Now moving on to Medical-Surgical Solution. Our Medical-Surgical segment continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced strong demand for COVID-19 tests throughout the quarter and often unpredictable and uneven levels of demand related to PPE. We're also pleased to have delivered solid growth in the core business, despite patient mobility trailing pre-COVID levels. Our customers have been resilient throughout the pandemic. And we're supporting providers and their patients with the breadth of our Primary and Extended Care capabilities, such as lab solutions, private brands and patient home delivery. Similar to the US Pharmaceutical segment, Q3 results were also impacted by the light colder flu season, and we expect this to continue throughout the remainder of our fiscal year. Revenues were $3.1 billion in the quarter, up 43%, primarily driven by demand for COVID-19 tests in the Primary and Extended Care businesses. As we discussed on the second quarter call, our Medical-Surgical business built supply quickly to meet demands from our customers for COVID-19 tests and elevated levels of demand for PPE. This elevated and uneven demand is reflected again in our third quarter results, as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels, impacting patient mobility and elective procedures, which were down 15% to 20% at times in the quarter according to IQVIA. Throughout the pandemic, and as always, our focus has been meeting the needs of our customers and their patients, providing access to the supplies, including PPE that they need to continue to treat patients. Early on, we procured these products in a highly volatile market, with unpredictable supply and demand levels due to the impacts of the pandemic. Due to these dynamics, some PPE and related items experienced inventory charges. In our third quarter, we recorded $35 million of charges related to these products. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 52% to $279 million, driven by demand for COVID-19 tests and the contribution from the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines, partially offset by the inventory charges on certain PPE-related products. Excluding the impact of the incremental PPE and COVID-19 test, adjusted operating profit in the segment is up 29% year-over-year in the third quarter. Next, Prescription Technology Solutions. Revenues were $777 million, an increase of 9%, driven by new and higher volumes of existing brand support programs. Adjusted operating profit increased 27% to $131 million, driven by organic growth in the business. While we continue to invest in the expansion of our technology offerings for our biopharma customers, we are starting to recognize the benefits of these investments, such as our investment in AMP, which Brian discussed earlier. Moving on to Corporate, McKesson recorded $158 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the quarter, a decrease of 6% year-over-year, driven by gains of approximately $30 million on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. This was partially offset by an increase in employee expenses, as well as lower interest income. This quarter, we had fair value adjustments related to several of our portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, it's difficult to predict when gains or losses on our Venture portfolio companies may occur and therefore, our practice has been and will continue to be not include Ventures portfolio impacts in our guidance. And finally, we reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $34 million in the quarter and for fiscal 2021, we anticipate that opioid-related costs will be approximately $160 million. Turning now to cash, which can be found on slide 11, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.6 billion. And for the first nine months of the fiscal year, we generated - free cash flow of $745 million. Our working capital metrics can result in free cash flow vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. In fiscal '21, our cash flow dynamics have also been impacted by changing levels of customer demand. In Q3, we again saw higher levels of inventory, resulting primarily from increased quantities of COVID tests and PPE. As we work to meet the evolving needs of our customers and ramp-up our work with the US government, we may experience additional working capital volatility. Year-to-date, we made $427 million of capital expenditures, includes internal investments to support our COVID-19 vaccine and kitting efforts and technology, data, and analytics investments to support our strategic initiatives of Oncology and Biopharma services. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, we returned $709 million of cash to our shareholders through $500 million of share repurchases and the payment of $209 million in dividends. Let me now turn to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2021. The COVID-19 virus and effects of the pandemic continue to impact our communities in different ways. The sharp declines across our businesses in the first quarter, followed by a more positive trajectory through our second quarter, indicated signs of stabilization. However, the third quarter was another good example of the non-linear shape of the recovery that we've been talking about all year, as increased case counts and hospitalizations led to a softening of the trends in the third quarter. Two important assumptions have underpinned our guidance throughout fiscal 2021, and we're reiterating those today. First, we do not assume a new wave of COVID-19 which would lead to shelter at home and economic lockdown, which would preclude patient mobility and consumption of health care services. And second, we do not assume any systemic customer insolvency event. I'd also like to reiterate that we believe that the recovery will take longer than initially anticipated and will not be in a straight line, as the impacts of the pandemic will persist into our fiscal 2022. Further, we do expect that there will continue to be significant volatility in the demand and ultimate volume levels for COVID-19 test kits and PPE. Through our third quarter, we've seen elevated levels of these product categories. However, we do expect these dynamic volumes will moderate. Also, given there is now an approved COVID-19 vaccine that is within the scope of McKesson's contract, our guidance now takes into account earnings related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution, in accordance with the distribution schedule provided to McKesson by the CDC. As a result of our solid third quarter performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, which now includes estimated earnings tied to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, we are increasing and narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $16.95 to $17.25 from our previous range of $16 to $16.50. We continue to anticipate consolidated revenues to increase between 2% to 4% for fiscal 2021. And we now expect the consolidated adjusted operating profit will grow 7% to 9% for the full year, excluding the results of Change Healthcare from the prior year, which is up from our prior guidance of an increase between 2% and 6%. Now moving to the segments. In our US Pharmaceutical segment, we continue to expect revenue growth of 3% to 6% and now expect adjusted operating profit to grow 2% to 5% compared to the prior year. We've included in our guidance the net benefit to fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share of approximately $0. 25 to $0.35 related to our role as the centralized distributor for COVID-19 vaccine. This range is dependent on a number of factors, which includes final vaccine distribution volumes and product mix as directed by the CDC. I would also remind you of our continued commitment to invest in and extend our leading position in Oncology, where we are making incremental investments in the second half of fiscal 2021, which equates to a headwind of approximately $0.05 to $0.10 of adjusted EPS for fiscal 2021. In our International segment, we now expect a revenue decline of 5% to 9% year-over-year and segment adjusted operating profit to be 1% to 3% growth. Let me now turn to Medical-Surgical. The shifting pattern and recovery path of COVID-19 remains a pivotable variable within the Medical-Surgical supply market. As I referenced earlier, throughout the third quarter, we continued to see elevated levels of demand for COVID-19 test kits and PPE. We expect to see shift in volumes, which we anticipate will moderate. We expect these sales to be a near-term opportunity in the segment, and elevated levels of demand are factored into our guidance for the remainder of our fiscal year. During the quarter, we expanded our contract with HHS for the assembly and storage of COVID-19 ancillary supply kit and also contracted with Pfizer to distribute ancillary kits directed to administration sites on their behalf. Due to this expanded scope, we now expect a benefit of approximately $0.20 to $0.30 in FY '21 related to the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, we now expect fiscal 2021 Medical-Surgical segment revenue to increase between 27% and 32%. And as a result of our improved third quarter performance and outlook, including the increase in our expected contribution from the kitting and distribution of ancillary vaccine supplies, we now expect adjusted operating profit will grow in the range of 29% to 37%. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we expect revenue to grow 5% to 8% and now expect adjusted operating profit to be approximately flat to the prior year. And finally, we now expect corporate expenses in the range of $645 million to $685 million. Let me wrap up our outlook with capital deployment. We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. As a reminder, we historically have generated the majority of our cash in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. This strong cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to execute a balanced capital allocation approach, investing in our strategies of Oncology and Biopharma Services, positioning our business for long-term growth, while remaining committed to return capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. Our investment-grade credit rating remains a priority and underpins our financial flexibility. In Q3, we utilized a portion of our free cash flow to retire approximately $1 billion of debt, and we issued a $500 million bond at attractive market rates. These actions, which were in line with our stated intent to modestly delever, further strengthened our balance sheet and our financial position. In closing, we're pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter and we feel confident in our updated outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. I'm proud of our focus and execution across the business, despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Investing in the strategies we've outlined remains a priority, as we drive further differentiation in our positions in Oncology and Biopharma Services, as evidenced by our continued investment in Ontada. As a proud partner of the US government and the COVID-19 vaccine effort, we look forward to continuing our role in the pandemic response, working to get vaccines and ancillary supplies into the communities that need them. And with that, Holly, let me turn the call back over to you for Q&A. Holly Weiss : Thanks, Britt. We will now take questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator, please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from - of Mr. Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning. Thanks for all the color and congratulations on the strong results. I want to dive in a little if I can, to the pharma segment profit. Given the moving pieces you had in the investments in that segments, also with obviously the offset of the COVID vaccine. Can you just give us in terms of how you think about the implications for key growth, and also with all the market dynamics in place, how the trajectory should progress on the core pharma side, and packing out the puts and takes in terms of directionally or conceptually on the volume side versus some of the strategic investments versus the COVID benefits that you'll be seeing in that segment? Brian Tyler : Sure. Let me start and Britt can add any color. I mean, we're very pleased with the results from our core Pharmaceutical business. I think, we see that kind of step back from COVID impacts, we'd say market fundamentals are consistent with where we thought they would be in the beginning of the year, brand price inflation in line with the dynamics that we see in the generics marketplace, both in terms of our go-to-market strategies and our sourcing capabilities are - we're pleased to see where they're at. I mean, we are continuing to invest in this segment. And that investment in particularly in the area of Oncology, comes at the expense of a little bit of what could be operating profit growth, but we think that that's a very important investment to make for the long-term positioning and the long-term growth of the segment. So I think in general, everybody recognizes the cold and cough and flu season was a little bit lighter than what we would historically have seen. Probably the result of the social responsibility, social distancing, mask wearing measures. But overall, we're very pleased with the progress of this segment. Britt Vitalone : Yeah. Mike, maybe what I would just add is I think part of trends that we talked about, the softening trends in Q3, really, I think is going into Q4 a lot of that will depend on how the pandemic continues to persist, but despite that, we continue to grow in the quarter. So our business, despite the kind of lumpiness in the overall environment continues to grow, and we feel confident in that growth. As Brian mentioned, it continued to invest. And as I talked about, we invested about 2% of headwind year-over-year in Ontada. So I think as this continues to persist, as our vaccine distribution begins to take hold, we feel comfortable that the business is stable and is showing good - the fundamentals of it are strong, and the growth is still there. And again, that allows us to continue to make investments for further growth going forward. Holly Weiss : Operator, next question please? Operator : The next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. So Britt, I know I asked this a couple of weeks ago at my conference, and that's around the actual profitability per dose on the vaccine. So now that, that you've given some numbers, you talked about 25 million doses being on target. Not a lot of impacts in the third quarter. You talked about the $0.25 to $0.35. How do I think about that on a per dose basis? Number one. And then number two, there's been some news articles talking about your two chief competitors saying, hey, we'll help out with the vaccine distribution as well. Would - what would that potentially do as far as the amount of volume that McKesson would potentially get given your current contract? Britt Vitalone : Good morning, Lisa. Thank you for that question. Let me start, and I think Brian will probably want to tackle on your - some of your later questions. Just to clarify. What Brian talked about in his remarks was $25 million of doses through January, 25 million doses through January. And as I talked about the amount that was in our quarter was immaterial to our results. We don't get into a per dose conversation. What we have guided here is based on the distribution volumes that we've been provided by the CDC, and we expect that that will deliver $0.25 to $0.35 of contribution in our fourth quarter. Brian Tyler : Yeah, let me - and to the second point, Lisa, a lot of people have offered their help and support of the vaccine distribution program, and we appreciate everyone's desire to help facilitate the nation getting itself vaccinated. In our view, we think the centralized distribution model that we have is the safest and the fastest way to get these COVID vaccines into the arms of people. We have built capacity to ramp-up to provide hundreds of millions of doses. And we think it's the fastest, safest way. And by that, I mean it's the least time from the time an order is delivered to that vaccine arriving at a provider site. It's the least handoffs and handling and chances for temperature excursions or lost product or damaged product. So in essence, it's going to allow us to get the very - the maximum amount of doses out of what is produced and available from the manufacturers in the fastest time. Now to the extent we can find ways to be faster, we're open for any idea. Make no mistake, our goal is to get this product to into patients' arms as quickly as we can so that we can get this country vaccinated and back to a more normal environment. Holly Weiss : Operator, next question? Operator : And next will be Eric Coldwell from Baird. Eric Coldwell : Thanks very much and good morning and sorry toggling several calls this morning. I want to just follow-up on one thing here quickly if you addressed it, I apologize. I know you've talked about the 25 million doses mostly in the month of January so far. I guess a couple of questions around that. First off, are you able to provide your expectations for total doses in fiscal for 4Q specifically? So the next two months how much that might ramp. Britt Vitalone : Our - the guidance we provided ties to the schedule we have been provided by the CDC and just like every other major customer we have, we don't comment on their plans and business strategies. So we are not able to talk about that, but the guidance we provide it ties to the schedule we've been provided by the CDC. Eric Coldwell : That's - okay. Fair enough. And then just on - my follow up on that was the kitting opportunity. Obviously, you've assembled a tremendous number of kids today you're making 10 million to 15 million a month or a week, excuse me. I'm just curious does the kitting opportunity extend into fiscal '22? Are you so advanced on what you've assembled to date that, that opportunity really ends in fiscal '21 even if the vaccines obviously extend into fiscal 2022? Brian Tyler : Yeah. Eric, thank you for the question. Obviously, as we think about the kitting opportunity, we produce kits in advance of the vaccine. So we talked about that on our Q2 call. I think it's a little early to tell how far this will actually play out. We would expect that some kitting would continue on beyond our fiscal year. But it's hard to say at this point, how to value that. So we feel good about increasing the guidance range for the kits that we expect to produce this year. I think that you could expect to see some kitting into next year. I guess it will all really depend on the distribution schedule that we get from the CDC and what the volumes are this year. Holly Weiss : Operator, next question? Operator : Next will be Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the question. I guess maybe just to shift gears over to Med-Surg, EBIT there was particularly strong in the quarter. Britt, I know you shared what the increased contribution you're viewing from kitting and other ancillary COVID-related supplies. But I am just wondering even taking that out, it was a particularly strong result, just given where that business has been and I know utilization hasn't exactly been even or strong in this environment. So I was hoping maybe you could just talk a little bit about what's driving the growth kind of X, the vaccine kitting related items that you quantified? Britt Vitalone : Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for that question. You're right, our core business was continue - did continue to be very solid into the quarter. And I tried to call out a little bit for you in my remarks, what our growth was excluding COVID tests and PPE. So that gives you some sense that we did continue to see solid momentum into our quarter. I talked about a few of the items and certainly, Brian can elaborate on as well. But if you think about our business, it is across all settings of alternate site. And as we've talked about in prior calls, our product breadth is very large, private brand, labs solutions, certainly the depth of capabilities that we have in extended care, patient home delivery, it's a very broad set of solutions capabilities and customer set that we address, and we've seen that really continue to grow in a very stable way over the last several quarters now. Holly Weiss : Operator, next question? Operator : And next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones. Britt, maybe just to clarify, you talked about the $0.20 to $0.30 from kitting. I think last call, you talked about $0.15 to $0.20, so is this an incremental 2030? Or is it really, are we talking about just kind of a bump of $0.05 to $0.10? And then secondly, in the drug - International Drug Retail business, you obviously took an impairment charge here. Was there any benefit? I think one of your peers talked about receiving some funding from NHS. Just wanted to see if that was something that you guys were also benefiting from? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me take the first one quickly. The $0.20 to $0.30 is not incremental, it's $0.20 to $0.30 from $0.15 to $0.20. So we did increase it from the last by that $0.05 to $0.10. In terms of the International question, the NHS funding that you referenced here was fairly immaterial to our quarter. Holly Weiss : Operator, next question? Operator : And next Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. So in Medical, I think a lot of questions on kitting, vaccine. Am I wrong to expect that this is really testing-driven strength? And we look at the testing numbers, they seem to have doubled or tripled from quarter to quarter to quarter. So is that really the primary driver? And is the supply there continuing to expand in ways that will enable you to continue facilitating that? Brian Tyler : Eric, thank you for the question. I would say it's really both things. I mean, I think the PPE demand has remained elevated and strong. That's certainly contributing. And there's no question that as COVID test kits emerged on the scene - or remember, when we provided our guide at the beginning of this year, there wasn't such a thing as a COVID test. So as the scientific community, the lab community began to develop these tests, whether molecular, antigen, antibody, because of our existing business in the lab, we were really well positioned to help get those to market quickly and swiftly. And we have certainly benefited from the strong demand for COVID test kits. Britt Vitalone : And Eric, maybe I'll just add on. I did try to call out in my comments here that, while this has been elevated, and we've seen sort of an uneven supply and demand throughout the year, we do expect that this will moderate. Now we expect the elevated demands to remain through our fiscal year, but we do expect at some point in FY '22, these elevated levels of demand will moderate. Holly Weiss : Operator, next question? Operator : And next will be Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Jailendra Singh : Yeah. Thank you. Actually quick clarification on vaccine. Does the vaccine EPS contribution take into account additional vaccines receiving approval for use in the US? And then my main question, I want to better understand the $100 million increase to the company's CapEx guidance. Is that all related to building out more infrastructure for COVID vaccine distribution beyond fiscal '21? Any color there will be helpful. Brian Tyler : Yeah. I'll just start with the guide for the vaccine. It is tied to the schedule that the CDC has provided us, which would be largely consistent with what you read in the public statements. Britt Vitalone : And I'll take the CapEx one. We did increase our guide on CapEx. Part of that is to support the vaccine and kitting programs. But a larger part of that is really continuing to invest in our strategies, technology, data and analytics to support those strategies. So I would say that a portion of that is to support the infrastructure, but a larger portion of that is really to support ongoing growth initiatives. Holly Weiss : Operator, next question? Operator : And next will be Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim Securities. Glen Santangelo : Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Brian, I appreciate there's probably not much you can say with respect to the opioid settlement at this point. But if we assume for a second that it does come to fruition as you outlined, I wanted to ask about the potential impact on the future capital deployment algorithm. And to that, you know, if we look at the after-tax settlement over 18 years, maybe netting that against some of the legal costs that go away, it looks like it could consume roughly 10% to 15% of your free cash flow. And so I'm trying to reconcile the future capital deployment versus maintaining the investment grade rating on the balance sheet? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Thanks, Glen. Well, you mentioned a couple of things that I'll come back to in my answer. One is we are very focused on maintaining our investment grade credit rating. We think we have a business that generates good cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet. We've had time to contemplate this. So I think, philosophically, our approach to capital deployment will not change, it will be a balance. We look to make internal investments that we think support growth in the business. We look to make growth investments in M&A where we can find targets that are aligned to our strategy and offer a financial return that makes sense vis-\u00e0-vis other ways we can deploy capital like buying back shares or paying a dividend. So I don't think our philosophy changes at all. And I think we feel very comfortable that we have a strong balance sheet. Holly Weiss : Operator next question. Operator : And next will be Rivka Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Rivka Goldwasser : Yeah, hi. Good morning. So taking everything that you said on the vaccine, and I understand that you're looking - you're basing it on the guidelines. The CDC guidelines are for about $100 million. So just wanted to confirm that that's what we should think about as we think that, what's included in your guidance. But if we take that and we extrapolate sort of the - what you are guiding for the fourth quarter, we're getting to sort of an average benefit of about $1 in 2022. So while I know that it's early to talk about 2022, is going to guide in May. But maybe you can - but clearly, vaccine is going to be a nice tailwind. So maybe you can just offer us some color on what tailwinds and headwinds should we just be considering as we think about 2022? Brian Tyler : Well, let me talk about the - your opening comments on vaccine, the vaccine itself, and then maybe Britt can give us a few headwinds and tailwinds. First, just to reiterate, our guidance is based on the schedule that the CDC has provided to McKesson. We've been working to that schedule from day one, and that is what we base our forward guide on and we can't really comment on that. So I just want to make that clear. And then, Britt, I don't know if you want to start down your list - our list of puts and takes? Britt Vitalone : Yeah. Thank you for the question, Rivka. I mean, I really start with what I think are some strengths and some tailwinds in the business, and we've talked about these really over the last several quarters now. We've had good momentum for several quarters now where we're seeing organic growth, and Q3 is a good example of that where each of our operating segments grew over the prior year. We would expect that our - the fundamentals of our business will continue to be solid and sound. And we're starting to see some benefits from the investments, some of the investments that we're making. Brian talked about AMP. And clearly, we've talked about the investments we're making in Ontada. So the strategies and the investments in Oncology and Biopharma Services, I would expect will continue to be strengths of ours. Obviously, the breadth of our Medical business, as we talked about earlier, the breadth of our customers, the breadth of services and capabilities across private brand and lab will continue to be strong for us. So I think as you look across our operating segments, we have a lot of good momentum and strength. We have a very strong balance sheet. As Brian just mentioned, we've seen consistent cash flow. From a headwinds perspective, I think it will really be how long does the pandemic persist and the unevenness and unpredictability of that. I think that will be the thing that we will be challenged with. But as you've seen from our results this year, we've been able to manage through that quite well and take down some near-term opportunities at the same time. Holly Weiss : Operator we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Certainly, that question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : So when we think about the $0.25 to $0.35 EPS related to COVID vaccine distribution, the additional $0.20 to $0.30 from McKesson's supplies, is the 100% of this combined EPS being derived in the US? I just want to confirm that. And can you remind us about the potential for McKesson to capture international economics on either the COVID vaccines or kits in Canada or Europe and where that stands either for the remainder of fiscal '21 or maybe a greater opportunity in your fiscal '22? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : I'll start. Great question. Let me just clarify, for the kitting component of this, the $0.20 to $0.30 is not incremental to last quarter. It's $0.20 to $0.30 from $0.15 to $0.20. What we've talked about here, both for the vaccine contribution and the kitting and supply contribution are US contributions. And I'll let Brian maybe talk a little bit about our international. Brian Tyler : Yeah. Look, our international countries and companies are engaged with local governments to - you know, either through our distribution capabilities, our retail pharmacy capabilities, to help the response of those countries to the pandemic. I would say, as a general characterization or probably from a time line trailing the US a little bit, but we are heavily involved in those discussions, but nothing that would be material to our financials at this point. Brian Tyler : Okay. Thank you, everyone, for your questions, and thank you Susan, for facilitating this call. I want to conclude my remarks today by once again recognizing and thanking all the frontline health care workers across the world who are working day in and day out to keep us safe and also acknowledge the great work from our biopharma scientific community to have us at this helpful moment as it relates to vaccinations. Our company's top priority is the vaccination program. And we look forward to continuing to work with the US government to successfully distribute COVID-19 vaccines and stand ready to support the distribution of additional vaccines, as they come to market. I want to thank the entire McKesson team for their continued commitment and hard work during this challenging time. We wish you all and your families' good health and wellness. Thanks again for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.",

Please go ahead. Holly Weiss : Thank you, Stephanie. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, I am joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecasts about McKesson\u2019s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today\u2019s press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, is included in today\u2019s press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Holly and good afternoon everybody. Thank you for joining us on our call this afternoon. On our fourth quarter call last year, I talked about how the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to impact our employees, our customers, our partners and the very communities in which we live. As one of the largest health care companies in the world, I said that McKesson would play an essential role in protecting the health and safety of the healthcare supply chain. While we were confident in our abilities to help our customers during challenging times, what played out over the course of the year proved to be more unpredictable than anyone could have imagined. The up and down trajectory of the recovery was certainly different than we had originally anticipated. And our role in the COVID-19 response efforts evolved and expanded quickly as a result. Fiscal 2021 was one of the most challenging yet fulfilling and inspiring years of my career, a year like no other in the 188-year history of our company. I want to thank the team McKesson and our innumerable public and private partners for their resilience, commitment to our values and service to our caregivers and patients. From the onset of the pandemic, our sourcing teams worked closely with manufacturers and various government entities to better forecast changing pharmaceutical and medical product demand in order to extend supply and channel inventory to critical areas of need, whether it was working to secure higher volumes of PPE for caregivers and frontline workers early in the pandemic or leveraging our expertise and lab capabilities to ramp up distribution of COVID-19 tests as they came to market, McKesson moved quickly to support our customers, our partners and our communities. Our role in the COVID-19 response was also highlighted by our partnership with the U.S. government\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort, having been selected as the centralized distributor of refrigerated and frozen COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary kits used to administer those COVID-19 vaccines. We distributed our first COVID-19 vaccine in December, shortly after Moderna\u2019s vaccine was granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. On February 27, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine became the third COVID-19 vaccine granted EUA by the FDA and the second vaccine within the scope of our contract with the CDC. We began distributing the J&J vaccine within 48 hours of its authorization and we are now distributing out of all 4 fit-for-purpose distribution centers we built for this program. We stand ready to support the distribution of additional vaccines as they come to market. Through April, we have successfully distributed over 150 million Moderna and J&J COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites in the U.S., and we remain on target with the U.S. government\u2019s distribution schedule. Also through April, we have assembled enough kits to support the administration of more than 550 million doses for all vaccine types. This work remains our company\u2019s top priority, and we are prepared to support the U.S. government for as long as they ask us to lead the centralized distribution model. In Europe and Canada, we are also partnering with the local governments in the COVID-19 vaccine effort through administration in our owned and banner pharmacies as well as distribution efforts in selected markets and countries. Let me turn now to our financial performance. Against the dynamic and challenging macroeconomic backdrop in fiscal 2021, we grew revenues 3% and our adjusted earnings per diluted share result of $17.21, was up 15% over prior year. When pressed with challenges and uncertainties, our customers and government partners continued to choose McKesson to help ensure stability of supply for their patients. So while prescription volume and primary care patient visit trends negatively impacted the core business throughout the fiscal year, the strength of our business model and our differentiated capabilities help us to grow the business and deliver value to our shareholders. Our commitment to executing our strategy, transforming and simplifying the operating model contributed to these strong financial results. Looking forward into fiscal 2022, I am confident that we operate in scaled and resilient markets with underlying trends that support long-term growth. We invest in our business to differentiate our solutions and create value for customers, patients and partners. The pandemic has not paused our progress on these strategic priorities. Targeted investments into our business over time have positioned us well to succeed and respond quickly to changing demands from our customers and government partners during these uncertain times. We have been focused on building out a connected ecosystem over the last several years in the areas of oncology and biopharma services. These are areas where we believe we have key differentiated capabilities. Through investments in technology, we\u2019ve been able to develop more robust solutions that help connect patients, providers and manufacturers and support our growth. Starting first with our oncology assets, which have proven to be resilient throughout the pandemic, through scaled distribution, GPO services in our U.S. oncology business were positioned well as innovative therapies come to market. Biosimilars are just one example where McKesson has been able to combine the breadth and scale of our specialty capabilities to help give providers choice and lower cost for patients. We were pleased to add more practices and over 100 providers to the U.S. Oncology Network in fiscal 2021. Today, through U.S. Oncology and our nonaffiliated provider business, we are connected to over 10,000 specialty physicians. And our oncology technology platform has supported millions of patient journeys, providing us access to real-world outcomes data and research. Our recently launched technology and real-world insights business, which we call, Ontada, is an extension of our oncology ecosystem and is a key area of investment for us, going forward. We believe this business differentiates our value proposition to providers looking to drive better outcomes for their patients and to manufacturers focused on innovative therapies in the area of oncology. In terms of biopharma services, in fiscal 2021, we brought together our RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads businesses. Together, these businesses are focused on innovating and automating the ways in which biopharma connects with patients, pharmacies and providers with the ultimate goal of providing stronger access, affordability and better adherence outcomes. These assets embed us in the daily workflows of over 50,000 pharmacies and more than 750,000 providers. We are integrated into over 75% of EHRs today. And through our market-leading position and advanced solutions, we\u2019re able to automate and simplify otherwise very manual processes. Ultimately, our solutions help patients get on therapies quicker and stay on those therapies longer. This value proposition to our manufacturing partners is reflected by the over 500 brands we support today, covering nearly every therapeutic area. In fiscal 2022, we will remain focused on these growth areas and we will continue to look for ways to streamline the business so that we can operate with added speed and increased focus. Part of our commitment to grow the business is to continually review and evaluate our portfolio. Sometimes we find assets we\u2019re not the natural owner of, as was the case with our German wholesale business, where we created a JV with Walgreens Boots Alliance in November. To further simplify the business, we continually evaluate and adapt the way in which we work. For McKesson, it\u2019s been over a year since we successfully transitioned all of our office-based employees to work from home seemingly overnight and without a loss of productivity. While we are quite anxious to see each other in person soon and at a time and place where it\u2019s appropriate and safe to do so, the success of our employees in this remote work environment and their desire for more work flexibility has challenged us to reevaluate the way we work and our real estate and existing office-based footprint. This is yet another example of how we\u2019re looking to simplify operations and grow the business and do the right thing for our teams. Britt will go into more detail about our thinking on these impacts going forward. Now, let me turn to the business and touch on how we are positioned for success heading into fiscal 2022. I\u2019ll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where we again grew adjusted operating profit despite soft prescription volume trends throughout the fiscal year. Our priority in this business is to strengthen the core and deliver the world\u2019s highest-quality supply chain to our customers and manufacturing partners. Our focus on cost and working capital efficiencies underpin this growth and help fuel investments for growth across the business. For Generics, the pricing environment continues to track in line with our expectation. On the buy side, we leverage our scale and our sourcing capabilities through ClarusONE to ensure stability of supply at low cost for our customers. On the sell side, McKesson has taken a disciplined approach to pricing, and the market continues to be competitive but has been stable for years. While generic volume remained below pre-COVID levels in the quarter, we expect volume improvement over the course of our fiscal year. I am also pleased with the performance of our Specialty business this past year. Our U.S. Oncology business, patient visits were at pre-COVID baselines in March, with many returning for in-person visits to their providers. In fiscal 2022, we\u2019ll look to grow both our U.S. Oncology and nonaffiliated businesses, which are just another part of our connected oncology ecosystem at McKesson. Let me talk about Prescription Technology Solutions. They perform well this year despite prescription volumes being down since the onset of the pandemic. We\u2019re continuing to invest in innovation in this business, and despite this year\u2019s challenges, we\u2019ve been very successful in adding new brands to our platforms. In fiscal 2021, our access solutions helped over 50 million patients get on therapies after their original prescription was denied coverage. And our affordability solutions helped patients save over $7 billion in out of pocket prescription cost. Under a single cohesive go-to-market strategy, this segment is positioned to return to growth in fiscal 2022 as patient mobility improves and prescription trends recover. In fiscal 2021, Medical-Surgical played a central role in providing supplies to our primary and extended care customers at a critical time of need. Demand within this segment was volatile throughout the fiscal year for products such as PP&E and COVID-19 tests, and our procurement teams worked diligently to find the supplies our customers needed to treat their patients at a time when supply was constrained and pricing was volatile. While we took measures to meet the needs of our customers for PPE-related products, demand has fluctuated and market dynamics for some of these products has changed since the onset of the pandemic. As a result, we took action to position the business for lower demand levels, which resulted in inventory charges on some PP&E and related products. Further adapting to the impact of COVID-19 on our customers, we leveraged our existing lab capabilities to quickly distribute over 50 million COVID-19 tests into the provider settings we serve, demonstrating the breadth and expertise we have in our market-leading lab business. Despite patient mobility trends below pre-COVID levels for much of fiscal 2021, I\u2019m proud of the way the business responded to the needs of our customers, and I am confident that as patients return to consume healthcare and see their community-based providers, our core business is positioned well for growth heading into fiscal 2022. Finally, turning to international, the segment grew full year adjusted operating profit despite lower foot traffic in many of our retail pharmacies across Europe and Canada, where the pandemic still lags the recovery we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve taken deliberate actions to address our cost structure and to evolve our retail footprint in these markets, and we saw benefits from those actions this fiscal year. We are also very disciplined in how we operate these businesses as evidenced by our thoughtful exit of unprofitable customers at the onset of the fiscal year in our Canadian business. These businesses play an important role in the pandemic response in their respective markets. And through our investments into digital assets, we\u2019re able to better reach patients who are increasingly choosing electronic means to access healthcare in those countries. Going forward, we will continue to find ways to position these businesses for future growth. The pandemic still presents many unknowns, and the trajectory of the recovery will likely show signs of nonlinearity at times in our fiscal 2022. But we do expect a return to pre-COVID levels of prescription volumes and patient engagement levels in the second half of fiscal 2022. As utilization improves over the course of our fiscal year, we expect the stable fundamentals underlying our core business to serve as the foundation for the outlook we are providing you today. Our fiscal 2022 outlook of $18.85 to $19.45 of adjusted earnings per diluted share includes a return to solid growth in our core businesses, a continuation of our role in the COVID-19 vaccine efforts, investments in growth and a balanced approach to capital deployment. Britt will take you through additional detailed assumptions that make up this outlook. As I reflect back, fiscal 2021 has taught us a lot and it showed us once again that our business model is positioned well to adapt and succeed in uncertain times. Time and time again, we\u2019ve proven our resiliency during crisis, and I\u2019m so proud of the way our employees rose to the challenges brought on by the pandemic and society more broadly. Our ability to be together, to stand together, focused on our values and purpose in service of the healthcare communities we serve makes me so proud. We will focus on building momentum on our fiscal 2021 accomplishments, and we will look to embrace the changes that have made us better to advance our growth strategy and grow the business. We will also continue to be front and center in the fight against COVID-19, helping to serve the communities in which we live and work. I thank you again for your time. And I will turn it over to Britt. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal 2021 was an unprecedented year, as Brian talked about earlier. When we spoke a year ago, we just finished our fiscal 2020 as the COVID pandemic was beginning to take hold on our communities and economies. During that call, we provided our full year fiscal 2021 outlook with quite possibly the highest level of uncertainty in McKesson\u2019s 188-year history. As I have said since the outset of the pandemic, McKesson\u2019s operating momentum is the result of our strategic clarity, focus, execution and discipline. As a company, we\u2019ve been operating in new ways for over a year. We\u2019re proud of the way our teams continue to execute and innovate. We are stronger than before the pandemic. And our fiscal 2021 financial results give us even more confidence in our ability to continue delivering compelling performance in the future. Today, I\u2019ll provide an update on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, including a detailed fiscal 2022 outlook, an overview which can be found in the Investors section of our website. We start now with our fiscal 2021 results. Our full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $17.21 grew 15% above fiscal 2020 and within our updated guidance range. Our fiscal year began with each of our segments experiencing volume decline due to the impact of COVID-19. Volume improvements in our first quarter were earlier than originally anticipated and on a nonlinear trajectory followed to the remainder of the fiscal year, correlating to the trajectory of the COVID virus. Our fiscal fourth quarter experienced a continuation of the volatility from COVID as well as a weak cold and flu season and a winter storm that impacted portions of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. We also recognized benefits from our leadership role distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments, respectively. And similar to previous two quarters, in the fourth quarter, we recognized unplanned gains on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. Let me move now to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.05, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs of the U.S. government and the lower share count. These items were partially offset by a higher tax rate in the prior year contribution from the company\u2019s investment in Change Healthcare. Let\u2019s transition now to details of our consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 4. Consolidated revenues of $59.1 billion increased 1% compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by the prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the contribution of our German wholesale business through a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Adjusted gross profit was approximately flat to prior year as inventory charges in our Medical-Surgical segment and the previously mentioned prior year demand increase, driven by COVID, largely offset the contribution of our COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs and the distribution of COVID-19 tests. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter decreased 6% year-over-year, led by a reduction in operating expenses due to the impact of COVID-19 and the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. This was partially offset by increased expenses related to our role distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits and higher operating expenses to support growth investments in oncology and biopharma services. Adjusted operating profit was $1.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. When excluding the $55 million contributed by Change Healthcare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which was previously recorded in other, adjusted operating profit grew 19%. Interest expense was $52 million in the quarter, a decline of 20% compared to the prior year, driven by the retirement of approximately $1 billion of debt and lower commercial paper balances. Our adjusted tax rate was 22.9% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $44 million or $0.21 per diluted share associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. In wrapping up our consolidated results, fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares were 161 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year, driven by the successful tax-free exit of our investment in Change Healthcare at the end of fiscal 2020 and other open-market share repurchase activity. As a reminder, the exit of our Change Healthcare investment lowered our shares outstanding by approximately 15.4 million shares. Moving now to our fourth quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 5 through 9, starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $47 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers, partially offset by the prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and branded-to-generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 7% to $813 million, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, partially offset by the previously mentioned prior year COVID pandemic impact and higher operating costs in support of the company\u2019s oncology growth initiatives and the impact of a weak cold and flu season. Adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 3% to $2.7 billion, driven by growth in specialty product distribution the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, offset by the previously mentioned prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the pandemic and by higher operating costs in support of the company\u2019s oncology growth initiatives. Next on to Prescription Technology Solutions, revenues in the quarter were $789 million, an increase of 7%, driven by higher volumes of technology and service offerings to support biopharma customers. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 11% to $146 million, driven by organic growth from access and adherence programs supported by our Technology Solutions. Full year adjusted operating profit was $467 million, which was flat to the prior year, as organic growth from access and adherence solutions was offset by higher investment costs to support the growth of the company\u2019s biopharma strategy. We finished the year with strong momentum from these investments, including our new product, AMP, which contributed to profit growth in the fourth quarter. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 23%, primarily driven by demand for COVID-19 tests. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 13% to $192 million and for the full year increased 19% to $805 million. We previously outlined that demand for COVID test kit and PPE products were closely associated with the rate of COVID case levels. Although COVID-19 test kit volume continued through the fourth quarter, these levels moderated significantly from Q3 levels as U.S. COVID cases trended lower throughout the quarter. As we discussed at various conferences during our fourth quarter, we anticipated that these elevated levels of demand would moderate. As we discussed in prior calls this year, early on in the pandemic, our Medical-Surgical business built supply quickly to meet demands from our customers for COVID-19 tests and elevated levels of demand for PPE. We procured these products in a market with unprecedented and unpredictable supply and demand levels, and the volatility associated with COVID case levels impacted the demand levels for PPE. The demand tapering occurred sooner than we had anticipated, and we took action to position the business for the lower demand levels. As a result, some PPE and related products experienced market-driven inventory charges. In our fourth quarter, we recorded $87 million of charges related to these products. Our underlying business was impacted by lower levels of elective procedures and patient visits, partially resulting from a continuation of a weaker cold and flu season. According to IQVIA, elective procedures trended approximately 20% below the prior year at times during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the incremental COVID-19 tests, PPE and distribution of ancillary supply kits for COVID-19 vaccine, adjusted operating profit in this segment increased approximately 1% in the quarter. Next, international, where revenues in the quarter were $8.6 billion, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, on an FX-adjusted basis, revenues decreased 18%, primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance effective November 1, 2020. Similar to the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, the International segment was also impacted by the prior year increase in volumes, which corresponded with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, segment revenue increased 4% year-over-year and was down 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 1% year-over-year to $138 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit decreased 8% to $126 million due to the previously mentioned fiscal 2020 volume increase, again driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 5% to $485 million. And on an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 1% to $466 million. Moving on to corporate, for the quarter, adjusted corporate expenses were $125 million, a decrease of 42% year-over-year driven by gains of approximately $44 million on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio and prior year onetime expenses. For the full year, adjusted corporate expenses were $584 million, a decrease of 9% compared to the prior year, driven by gains of approximately $133 million or $0.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio, partially offset by lower interest income. As in the previous two quarters, net fair value adjustments related to several of our portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. As we previously discussed, we can\u2019t predict when gains or losses within our Ventures portfolio of companies may occur. And therefore, our practice has and will continue to not include Ventures portfolio impacts in our earnings guidance. We reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $153 million for fiscal 2021. Until a settlement is reached and executed, we anticipate a similar level of spend. For fiscal 2022, we estimate opioid-related litigation to approximate $155 million. And finally, fiscal 2021 also marked the end of our previously announced 3-year program to transform our operating model and drive cost reductions across the enterprise. We are proud to have achieved our original 3-year target of $400 million to $500 million in savings by the end of fiscal 2021. A portion of the savings has been reinvested in our growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. Turning now to Slide 11, we continue to place a sharp focus on working capital efficiency and cash flow generation. For fiscal 2021, we generated free cash flow of $3.9 billion, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $6.3 billion, ahead of our expectations. In fiscal 2021, we continued our long track record of solid cash flow generation, resulting from another year of operating profit growth and our continued focus on working capital efficiency. In fiscal 2021, our cash flow was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including uneven levels of customer demand. Over the course of the year, the dynamics of the operating environment resulting from the early effects of COVID-19 introduced further volatility in our cash flow. We experienced higher levels of inventory primarily resulting from the increased quantities of COVID testing and PPE. We anticipated this additional working capital volatility, meeting the evolving needs of our customers, all while we\u2019re increasing our work with the U.S. government to distribute COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits. In Q3, we utilized a portion of our free cash flow to retire approximately $1 billion of debt, and we issued a $500 million bond at attractive market rates. These actions which were in line with our stated intent to modestly de-lever further strengthen our balance sheet and financial position. In fiscal 2021, we made $641 million of capital expenditures, which includes continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives of oncology and biopharma services as well as investments to support our COVID-19 vaccine and kitting efforts. We returned $1 billion of cash to our shareholders through $770 million of share repurchases and a payment of $276 million in dividends. Let me now spend a few minutes on our fiscal 2022 outlook. And I\u2019ll start by framing a couple of key macro-level assumptions that underpin our outlook for fiscal 2022. We do not assume a return wave of the virus, additional shelter-in-place or increased social distancing. As we\u2019ve discussed throughout the year, volume trends in fiscal 2021 were nonlinear and varied over the course of the year. Our markets have not fully recovered, and we remain in a dynamic environment. We are, however, encouraged by recent signs that a broader recovery is forthcoming. We expect prescription volumes will continue to demonstrate steady improvement from volume levels at the end of our fiscal 2021 through the first half of our fiscal 2022, in line with the rate of increasing vaccinations and decreasing COVID cases. We anticipate a return to pre-COVID prescription and patient engagement levels in the second half of our fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2022, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $18.85 to $19.45, more heavily weighted towards the back half of the fiscal year. We also expect core growth across all of our segments. Rather than outlining each assumption, I will instead walk you through the key items, starting with the segments. For a full list of our fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to Slides 13 through 16 in our supplemental slide presentation. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we expect revenue to increase 4% to 7% driven by market growth and strong performance in our specialty business. Adjusted operating profit is expected to deliver 4% to 7% growth as volumes continue to improve compared to fiscal 2021. Our outlook also includes approximately $0.40 to $0.50 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2022, the majority expected to be realized in our first quarter. This compares with approximately $0.35 in fiscal 2021. We will also continue to invest in our leading and differentiated position in oncology and increase investments to support future growth. We expect these investments will represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. Normalizing for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and our continued growth investments, we expect approximately 5% to 8% core adjusted operating profit growth. Finally, we anticipate branded pharmaceutical pricing to approximate mid-single-digit increases, which is consistent with fiscal 2021. And the generic market remains competitive yet stable. We continue to be pleased with the performance of ClarusONE, which provides competitive costs and supply stability to our customers. This combined with our disciplined approach to pricing and improving overall volume and utilization, gives us confidence in our ability to grow and generate positive spread. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we expect revenue and adjusted operating profit growth of 12% to 17% driven by organic growth as we continue to recognize the benefits of the investments we\u2019ve been making in technology offerings for our biopharma customers. Now, transitioning to Medical-Surgical fiscal 2021 saw notable impacts from the contribution of COVID test kits and personal protective equipment as well as impacts to the underlying business due to office closures, social distancing and reduced patient visits. Our Medical-Surgical business delivered strong results against these challenges, and we continue to position the business for long-term growth. In fiscal 2022, we expect demand for COVID test kits and PPE to moderate further as vaccinations increase and case counts decrease. As patients continue to return to their providers, we expect growth in our Primary and Extended Care segments of this business. Given these dynamics, we expect revenue to be down 5% to 1% growth, and we expect adjusted operating profit to be flat to 6% growth over the prior year as growth in our underlying business is offset by a lower contribution from COVID test kits. Included in this guidance is $0.10 to $0.20 of contribution related to the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines. Again, the majority will be realized in our first quarter. This compares to approximately $0.35 in fiscal 2021. Due to the timing of when we began executing our contract with HHS, a larger portion of kitting revenue was realized in fiscal 2021. Excluding the contribution of our COVID-19 kitting and distribution program, the contribution from COVID-19 test kits and the fiscal 2021 impairments for PPE and related products, we expect year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 10% to 16%. Finally, in the international segment, we expect revenues to decline 2% to grow 3% as compared to the prior year, and this reflects the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance in the third quarter of our fiscal 2021. We expect adjusted operating profit growth in the segment of 4% to 8%, led by core business improvement as our geographies continue the recovery from COVID-19. And now turning to the consolidated view, we expect 3% to 6% revenue and adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. We expect corporate expenses to be $670 million to $720 million. And as a reminder, our corporate expenses in fiscal 2021 were offset by net gains of approximately $133 million or $0.60 per diluted share from equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. We assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter to quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. As Brian mentioned in his remarks, we continue to transform and evolve our operating models to drive efficiencies. As part of this evolution, we plan to make changes to our real estate strategy to increase efficiencies, supporting increased flexibility, including a transition to a partial remote work model for certain employees on a go-forward basis. This will result in reduction to our real estate footprint. In executing this plan, we will incur GAAP-only restructuring charges of approximately $180 million to $280 million over the next year. We expect these actions will result in the realization of annual savings of approximately $60 million to $80 million when fully implemented. These actions will get underway in this upcoming fiscal year, and therefore, we do not expect to see a material benefit in fiscal 2022. We are in the early stages of this planning and we will provide additional detail at a later time. Let me wrap up our fiscal 2022 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. The past year has reinforced the importance of managing our business for the long term through a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment with a sharp focus on investments for innovation and growth to further enhance our competitive positioning and leverage our differentiated assets and capabilities. We expect free cash flow of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As we consider our capital deployment options, we first start with our commitment to maintain our current investment-grade credit rating. With respect to capital deployment, our priority is growth and the use of capital continues to be focused on supporting organic growth of our oncology and biopharma services strategies, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions to accelerate these strategies. We complement these growth drivers with the return of capital to our shareholders through a modest share-growing dividend and share repurchases. We continue to execute at a high level, and we have confidence in the business today and in the future. And we continue to believe that there\u2019s great value in our stock. As indicated on Slide 16, our fiscal 2022 outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $2 billion of stock, which we expect will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year. As a result of this activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of approximately 153.5 million to 155.5 million. We also anticipate use of cash to purchase shares in McKesson Europe through exercises of a put rate option available to non-controlling shareholders. As a reminder, McKesson originally acquired 77% of Celesio, the remaining non-controlling interest shareholders retained a put option for their shares. The put right option of the minority stakeholders expires in Q1 of fiscal 2022. We estimate that the remaining put rate options could result in cash payments up to approximately $1.3 billion, which will be reflected in the financing activities section of our cash flow statement. During fiscal 2021, McKesson used $49 million of cash for exercise of these put rate options. In fiscal 2021, we delivered strong performance in an unprecedented environment, and we capped off our 3-year operating model transformation, setting the stage for an acceleration of growth. We look forward to continuing our role in the pandemic response by distributing COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supply kits as we continue our leadership role in the pandemic response. Our outlook for fiscal 2022 reflects the continued confidence in our operating momentum with growth across all segments of the business, supported by the strength of our balance sheet and strong financial position. We will continue to invest in our strategies of oncology and biopharma services as we build out our connected ecosystems in these growth areas, delivering value to our customers and partners. We\u2019re confident in our ability to leverage our position and capabilities to accelerate growth. In closing, I would like to acknowledge and thank all the McKesson associates across the world for their dedication, execution and unrelenting commitment to our customers and patients. The results we achieved this year could not have been possible if not for the dedication of team McKesson. We are pleased with our results in fiscal 2021 and confident in our outlook for fiscal 2022. And with that, Holly, let me turn the call back to you for Q&A. Holly Weiss : Thank you, Britt. I will now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Brian and Britt, I just really want to start with the oncology business. So Britt, I want to better understand the $0.20 of investment that you talked about in the guidance and help me to understand what type of investments you\u2019re making there. Are they tuck-in acquisitions? Is it technology, those kinds of things? And then secondly, as we think about growth in the oncology and specialty business, can you maybe just talk about the impact of biosimilars, what you\u2019ve seen in the quarter and kind of your expectations going into 2022? Britt Vitalone : Good afternoon, Lisa. Thanks for that question. Let me just talk a little bit about the mechanics and then Brian can talk a little bit about some of the specific investments that we are making. We did talk on our Q3 call about the second half having investments in our oncology business and how that would be a modest headwind to the second half of the year. And we did make those investments. We\u2019re increasing our investments next year. We\u2019ve talked about our Ontada business publicly now, and we\u2019re making some good traction and having some good partnerships that we\u2019re \u2013 that we have been announcing. And so we are going to continue to invest in our oncology ecosystem in FY \u201822. It\u2019s another investment year, but we do see that we are going to be turning profitability in years after. We feel very confident that these investments in the oncology business and specifically in Ontada will bear fruit. Now, Brian, maybe you talk about the specific investments? Brian Tyler : Yes. I think that\u2019s right, Britt. I mean I\u2019d put \u2013 I think of the investments in a couple of buckets, right. We have got a leading EMR in oncology. Well, we need to continue to invest in that as the practice of oncology changes and the complexity of the therapies continue to evolve and things like genomics and all these advanced diagnostics start to fold in. That\u2019s a bit of just infrastructure investment. Britt talked about Ontada, that\u2019s our technology and data insights business that we are investing in. That\u2019s a growth \u2013 future growth area of opportunity for us. And then we did not have any M&A in oncology in this quarter. We have had some great partnerships. We had some great momentum on that front. This is an area that is strategically \u2013 is aligned to our enterprise strategy and we would certainly be open to doing M&A if it was on strategy and met our financial thresholds for good M&A. Britt Vitalone : And Lisa, maybe I\u2019ll just finish up on your biosimilars question. We are very pleased with how biosimilars are beginning to hit the market. We see the pipeline growing, particularly in the oncology space. It\u2019s not a material driver to our results right now, but we are encouraged by the pipeline and we are encouraged by the opportunities in the next \u2013 in the coming years. So, we think that biosimilars are going to continue to be a positive driver for the business, for the providers and for patients and we expect with our scale and reach that we will continue to get that contribution as adoption continues to increase. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just on the guidance within the Pharma segment, the core growth of 5% to 8%, Britt, seems really strong, especially considering your assumption that scripts won\u2019t be back to pre-COVID level into the second half. So, just any additional kind of building blocks or thoughts there would be helpful? And then just to clarify, your peers have talked a lot about pockets of pricing pressure in generics and pockets of volume weakness. Just want to understand clearly what your assumptions are from what you are seeing today and in guidance relative to the generic book? Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question, Bob. Look, we are very pleased with how the business has continued to grow and gain momentum. This is the second year in a row now where this business has grown. We have got really good scale and reach across all of our businesses. Brian talked about our specialty businesses and particularly the differentiation that we have in oncology. And so we think that the momentum is going to continue. As I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019re seeing some encouraging signs, and we think that as utilization comes back, the momentum will just continue. As it relates to our thought on the pricing environment, again, from a branded pricing perspective, we expect that FY \u201822 will look a lot like FY \u201821. And from a generic perspective, we have a great sourcing capability in ClarusONE. We continue to do a great job for our customers in providing stability of supply and low cost. We don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s really changed the dynamics around either the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s a competitive market but it\u2019s been stable now for several quarters. And we feel with the strength of our sourcing operation and our disciplined approach on the sell side that we\u2019ll continue to see the same types of contribution that we\u2019ve seen now for several quarters. Brian Tyler : Years, actually. Britt Vitalone : Years, yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Cherny with Bank of America. Mike Cherny : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if we could talk a little bit about pharmacy tech solutions a bit. It doesn\u2019t really get a ton of attention, but clearly, it\u2019s become a big piece of the EBIT. As you think about the demand curve that you\u2019ve seen heading into fiscal \u201822, and obviously, in terms of how pharmacies are reacting from fiscal \u201821 and all the changes they\u2019ve had around COVID, can you just give us a sense on what drives that growth? It\u2019s clearly stand out in terms of your overall revenue, overall profitability it\u2019s higher margin. So how should we think about where the adoption levels are coming from your customers in terms of supporting that underlying growth? Brian Tyler : Yes. I mean, thanks, great question. So fundamentally, this is a transaction volume-based business. So as script growth returns, that\u2019s a good fundamental underlying driver of this business. We also grow this business by signing more brands onto our programs and to innovating and putting more value on our network that delivers value to a pharmacist, to a provider or to a biopharma that allows us to grow our services revenue. I mean, fundamentally, this is about growing transactions. Britt Vitalone : I think just the other thing I would add there the way that we\u2019re growing the transactions is we\u2019re utilizing technology. We have great technology and capabilities within that business, and that allows us to leverage our capabilities in a unique way. Brian Tylerb : Yes. So our access to workflow, our ability to automate, what we\u2019re doing is creating new solutions that drive volume through \u2013 transaction volume through our networks by solving real customer problems. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. Question on the medical side, the core growth of 10% to 16% is notable. I\u2019d be interested to hear how the medical business has changed as you continue to progress through the COVID pandemic. And then how much or to what extent can you follow testing? Of course, it\u2019s declining. It\u2019s also moving toward retail and home. We saw the alignment with Cardinal. Where else or how material could that be to you? Brian Tyler : I\u2019ll start and give a few comments, Eric. Look, it was certainly a dynamic year in the medical business, I mean, out of the gates with PPE demand outstripping supply by a wide margin. You\u2019re well familiar with the early period of this fiscal year. Mid-part of the year, we start to see COVID test kits really come to market. And through our leading position as a lab distributor, I think our team did a fantastic job working with really a broad spectrum of those providers across all types of tests, molecular, antigen, antibody, to get those into the provider communities that we serve. And we had tremendous growth. That growth probably peaked in Q3. It was, frankly \u2013 it fell away quicker than we had anticipated when we had our earnings call in that third quarter. We still \u2013 there is still COVID test kit volume out there. But it certainly was \u2013 if any \u2013 of all of our businesses, I would say the medical business was the most dynamic in terms of the market dynamics this year. Britt Vitalone : And maybe, Eric, just to follow-up on that, as Brian talked about the breadth of our \u2013 the markets that we serve and the breadth of products and capabilities that we have, our leading capabilities go across Rx, private brand, lab, as Brian talked about. And if you go before the pandemic, FY \u201820, we had growth \u2013 AOP growth of about 12%. So I think as we look at our guide for next year, it really speaks to the fundamentals of the business have remained very strong all the way through the pandemic. And as volumes begin to come back and utilization comes back online, we would expect that the business could continue to grow in that historical range. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. So you guys have $6 billion of cash in your balance sheet. Looking at the cash flow from this year, even with the larger buyback and the dividend, like you\u2019re still likely to add cash, net-net. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about potentially what you might do in terms of M&A going forward. What\u2019s your appetite in terms of M&A? Are you looking to just add on and bolt on? Is there a meaningful acquisition you\u2019d be looking to do? Anything notable, sort of talk about where you sit now versus maybe where you had been in the past? Brian Tyler : Yes. I mean let me give you just a couple of framing comments on how we think of M&A. So first, if it\u2019s what we would call tuck-in or it\u2019s a core business, we\u2019re in the business today, we understand the business, it\u2019s just about really adding customers or maybe a capability but \u2013 and scale to a platform we already have, that\u2019s attractive M&A. And over the history of this company, we\u2019ve been very successful doing that kind of M&A. The second kind that we \u2013 the second criteria we really have is to assess its alignment to our enterprise strategy. We\u2019ve articulated our oncology ecosystem and our biopharma services business as areas that we want to deploy growth capital against. But it\u2019s got to meet our third criteria, which is we\u2019re very financially disciplined about the way we approach these things. We know we have alternate uses to deploy our capital. M&A is just one of them. And so we\u2019re very disciplined as we think about approaching M&A. But I would say we would do M&A if it was aligned to our strategy, it fits that first type of M&A, a tuck-in, and it met our financial discipline business criteria. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask about sort of the vaccine guidance \u2013 contribution guidance, the $0.40 to $0.50, should we assume that\u2019s pretty much front-end weighted into the fiscal year? And have you taken into account some of the concerns around vaccine hesitancy and the fact that whether the pace of vaccine administration is going to slow down? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question. Let me address that. As I think I\u2019ve mentioned in past calls, we take our guidance from the U.S. government. They make all the decisions on the administration of the program. And so we leverage the guidance that they gave us in terms of volumes and where those volumes need to be distributed. And that\u2019s how we put this guide together. So that\u2019s how we form the basis of the $0.40 to $0.50 for the vaccine distribution and the $0.10 to $0.20 for the kit distribution. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, that\u2019s going to be weighted more towards the first half of the year or first quarter of the year primarily. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good afternoon. So Britt, in your prepared remarks, you called out the weak cold and flu season. That did have some impact on the fiscal 4Q results just reported. It seemed like that dynamic did cause a wide variation in financial impact across all three distributors. But I guess as we think about the fiscal \u201822 guidance from you guys, you mentioned the return to the pre-COVID levels of prescriptions and patient levels in the back half of the year. I just want to confirm whether or not that includes the normal cough, cold, flu season. Is that also a large factor or a small factor in that 5% to 8% core EBIT growth in U.S. pharma? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Sure. Thanks for the question. Look, as I talked about, there were a couple of factors that really occurred during the fourth quarter. Weak cold and flu season was one of those. We also had a winter storm. Those had modest impacts on our results. We do expect next year that we would have a normal flu season. Those are very difficult to predict in the last several years. We\u2019ve had some variations within what normal is based on history. But we expect that the cold and flu season will be back to a normal cadence historically. And as utilization starts to improve over our first half of the year and get back to pre-COVID levels in the second half of the year, that\u2019s where we expect volumes will begin to ramp. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric Coldwell : Thanks very much. This somewhat tails on Charles\u2019 question. It was \u2013 in a nutshell, you guided to earnings being back half weighted again. And frankly, if I look at the 3 years prior to COVID, your contribution was, on average, 54% of full year earnings. So I just want to make sure that this is, more than anything, kind of a reiteration of what happened in the past prior to COVID impacts, number one. And then number two, if the heavy weighting of your vaccine and kitting, $0.50 to $0.70, is in the first quarter, how do we true that up with earnings being weighted towards the back half? Is by default is the implication that we should be a bit more cautious on 2Q results? Just trying to bridge all these moving pieces. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes. Sure. Let me see if I can help you out. You are correct. Historically, our earnings have been generated primarily heavier in the second half of the year. And we would expect that we would have a slightly higher second half contribution than the first half again this year. I think when you look at our guide and you look at the vaccine contribution of $0.40 to $0.50 on the range of $18.85 to $19.45, inside of that, the core business is still growing. And we would expect that as utilization continues to improve through the first half and gets back to pre-COVID in the second half, that those core earnings would reflect that. So again, I think, historically, we\u2019ve had higher second half contribution than the first half. We expect that we\u2019ll have a slightly higher second half than first half contribution as well. We don\u2019t guide the quarter, so I\u2019m really not going to comment on second quarter versus first quarter. I think you should take our thinking on how utilization comes back online. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi. Good evening. So my question goes back to the guidance of \u201822 for core distribution operating income growth. We get often questions from investors around what\u2019s the long-term growth algorithm for the business. I think it\u2019s really helpful that you separated the core. So when we think about that core growth of 5% to 8%, and while it doesn\u2019t include some of the COVID impacts, it does include lower volumes in the first half of the year. Should we think about that as sort of the starting point or a baseline for longer term growth and when volumes accelerate that, that starting point could be even higher? And then my follow-up question is just on the opioids litigation. Your guidance assumes sort of the same legal expenses in 2022 and in 2021. So if we can get any updates on where you are in the process. Thank you. Britt Vitalone : Thanks, Ricky, for the question. Let me see if I can start with your first question. Look, we have talked about improving momentum in our business for the last several quarters, and you referenced 5% to 8% core. That\u2019s for our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. We expect that our business is going to continue to generate improving momentum over the course of FY \u201822. And so we feel very good that we\u2019ve had a return to growth in that segment, really the whole business over the last 2 years that we would expect that, that will continue. We\u2019ve talked about some of the investments that we are making in the business and how we\u2019re leveraging some of those investments. And so I think what you should \u2013 you should not think about this as a long-term jumping off point. We don\u2019t provide long-term guidance. And I would hesitate for you to just take that 5% to 8% and take it out over the long-term. But what you should take from this is we expect continuing improvement in utilization, continuing momentum in the business, and I think our core growth rate really reflects that. I don\u2019t know, Brian, if you want to... Brian Tyler : Yes. I mean also embedded in the U.S. Pharma segment is the assumption that the flu season returns to normal. That, historically, would have been in the run rate and not incremental growth for the segment. Relative to opioids, the second part of your question, Ricky. We continue to have constructive discussions around a broad settlement framework and structure. The parameters of that have been pretty consistent over the last several quarters. I\u2019m very encouraged. We\u2019re hopeful we can reach resolution. We think it will be great for patients and communities. But as we said last quarter, until we have a deal, we are going to continue to prepare to defend ourselves, and we\u2019ve made significant investments in that defense. We\u2019re prepared to rigorously and vigorously defend ourselves in court if it comes to that. So our assumption, until such point in time that we have a resolution, is that we\u2019ll continue to make the ongoing investment in our defense. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you might be able to give me an answer to a question that would settle some debate in the investor community, which is, I guess, could you talk about your appetite for maybe adding another leg to the operational stool through M&A and kind of how we should think about the company\u2019s appetite for deals that could be dilutive or value transference, if that\u2019s the right word, in the short-term for \u2013 to enter segments that could relate to your core customers and might have a better long-term growth profile? So that\u2019s kind of the really broad M&A question, but just interested in how you\u2019re thinking about the \u2013 kind of the risk appetite versus valuation. Brian Tyler : Well, look, first, we\u2019re always looking at the landscape. And if you look at the landscape in health care this year, obviously, with the pandemic, we saw a lot of the telehealth assets really catch a lot of momentum. We\u2019ve gone back. We\u2019ve checked our strategies based on how we\u2019ve seen the landscape change over the past year. And I\u2019ll just say this, we have a lot of conviction that our strategy, which is built around continuing to get growth out of the core, continuing to focus on oncology and continuing to focus on biopharma services, where we think we have unique and distinguished capabilities, we have the opportunity to do internal innovation to drive growth, and we have appetite to do external growth if we can find the right asset, align to the strategy in the right way that meets our return thresholds. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Jailendra Singh : Thank you. I actually want to talk \u2013 ask about your International segment. Maybe if you can provide some little bit more details on the key drivers behind 4% to 8% core growth you expect in that business in fiscal \u201822? Brian Tyler : Sure. I\u2019ll start. I mean let\u2019s \u2013 first, we should recognize that in the International segment, the pandemic recovery is lagging what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. a little bit. But we\u2019re very pleased with the performance that this business has had. We have worked diligently over the last few years to really think about how we organize and streamline and make that business more efficient, capturing some of the scale across all of the countries. We\u2019ve been rigorous in looking at our retail footprint, and we\u2019ve done some rationalization of our physical estate there. And we\u2019ve made some investments, frankly, in some digital technologies that really were \u2013 turned out to be quite timely and important this year as patients decided they wanted to use digital health services more. So we are very pleased with the performance of the European business. We run it in a very disciplined, very tight way. It is not inherently high-growth markets. So to get the growth that we see, we\u2019re very pleased with the team. Britt Vitalone : And I guess I would just add. Similar to the U.S. market, our international markets have also faced COVID headwinds. And we would expect that those markets will begin to recover along the same type of time lines we laid out in our broader comments. Holly Weiss : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly, that question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, just in your prepared remarks, you talked about expanding U.S. Oncology. So just curious how you see that? Philosophically, is that \u2013 how will that play out? Is that expansion in terms of footprint, number of practices, capabilities? And how are you thinking about the shift of that business or evolution of that to value base as the oncology world changes? Brian Tyler : Yes, great question. So look, we think we have a terrific value proposition for independent community-based oncologists. And we look to grow our practices and our \u2013 the number of oncologists in those practices. That is part of the growth, I mean, and we like that growth. But we also think we have the opportunity to grow our research efforts to grow our data and analytics and insight business. We\u2019ve got opportunity to put more value into our EMR so that we stay contemporary with patient care and that we\u2019re innovating ahead of the marketplace. And we view all of these things as kind of reinforcing each other, right? More scale in the network gives you a bigger distribution channel for the products and services that you develop, more impact back upstream to the biopharmas. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve actually been referring to it as an ecosystem because these are not really disconnected growth strategies. They are actually quite connected under the umbrella of oncology. Brian Tyler : Okay. Well, thank you everybody. That enters our fiscal 2022. I am excited about the businesses and the markets that we operate in today. I\u2019m very pleased with our performance and the momentum that gives us, and I really do believe we are positioned for long-term success. I\u2019m again so proud of how resilient our employees have been throughout the pandemic. And in fiscal 2022, we look forward to supporting our customers, partners and communities as we hopefully resolve these uncertain times. We wish you and your families good health and wellness. Get vaccinated. And I want to wish everybody a Happy Nurses Day. Thanks to all those amazing nurses out there on the front line. Thanks, everybody. Have a great evening. Operator : Thank you for joining today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

Please go ahead. Holly Weiss : Thank you, Jenny. Good afternoon and welcome everyone, to McKesson's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, is included in today's press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Holly, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter call today. We are pleased to be reporting a strong start to our fiscal 2022, which reflects continued operating momentum across our businesses despite the fact that our markets are still recovering from the impacts of COVID-19. We're also making significant progress against our strategic priorities and our commitment to do what's in the best interests of you, our shareholders. Before we get to our first quarter results, I want to provide an update on the progress made towards a broad resolution of governmental opioid related claims. On July 21, we announced that McKesson along with two other distributors negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement, which if all conditions are satisfied, that results in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. This broad resolution -- this broad agreement becomes effective. The agreement reached between the distributors and the state of New York and its participating subdivisions to settle opioid related claims will become part of this broader settlement agreement. Under the negotiated proposed settlement agreement and subject to final state territorial and political subdivision participation, McKesson will pay up to $7.9 billion over a period of 18 years. Over the next several months, we will monitor participation of the eligible governmental entities to determine if participation levels are sufficient to proceed. This is an important development. And I'm pleased with the progress we've made after years of negotiations. For able to reach a final settlement, it would provide immediate relief to 1000s of communities across the United States that have been impacted by this public health crisis. While we strongly dispute the allegations made in these lawsuits, we believe that bringing resolution to these outstanding claims is in the best interest of those impacted by this crisis. We also believe resolution is in the best interest of our shareholders, and will allow us to further focus on the business and our role in protecting the safety and the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain. We remain committed to doing our part to fight against the opioid epidemic through efforts to continuously enhance our anti diversion programs and to advocate for reform at the state and national level. As settlement cannot be finalized or plaintiffs instead choose to pursue their claims in court, we are prepared to litigate against those claims, and we remain confident in our defenses. We also recently announced that we entered into an agreement to sell several of our McKesson, Europe businesses to the PHOENIX group who we believe is the right and natural successor to McKesson, and the ideal leader of these European businesses going forward. The agreement includes our McKesson Europe businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia, as well as our German Ag headquarters in Stuttgart, our shared service center in Lithuania, our German wound care business and our equity stake in our joint venture in the Netherlands. This transaction is expected to close in fiscal 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. Our remaining European businesses in the UK, Norway, Austria and Denmark were not included in this transaction and will continue to be operated by McKesson. However, we are exploring strategic alternatives for these remaining businesses as we align future investments to our growth strategies outside of Europe. We believe fully active in Europe is another step towards becoming a more streamlined and efficient organization. Let me turn now to our performance in the quarter. We are continuing to see the operating momentum we discussed in our fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, we're reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $5.56. Ahead of our original expectations, resulting from the strength across our businesses and our roles in the COVID-19 response efforts across the geographies in which we operate. Our US and international distribution businesses are playing an integral role in the pandemic response and our operational excellence and capabilities continue to be highlighted through our evolving partnership with the US government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution efforts. Through July, our US pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 185 million Moderna and J&J. COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites across the United States. And our medical business has now assembled enough kits to support the administration of more than 785 million doses for all vaccine types. Also in the quarter, the US government asked McKesson to support their mission of sending millions of COVID-19 vaccines to countries in need all around the globe. We are picking and packing with Moderna and Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines and the temperature controlled coolers and preparing these vaccines for pickup by international partners, all at the direction of the US government. McKesson is not managing the actual shipments of vaccines to other countries. Through July, we've successfully prepared over 65 million COVID-19 vaccines for shipment abroad. We are humbled and honored to serve the US government in this expanded role. Our roles in Europe and Canada are also continuing to evolve and we're partnering with local governments to distribute and administer COVID-19 vaccines there as well. Through July, we've distributed over 45 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across the geographies. Based on our first quarter results, our evolving roles in the COVID-19 response efforts at our confidence in our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal 2022, we are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to $19.80 to $20.40 from a previous range of $18.85 to $19.45. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're making significant progress against our strategic priorities. We're simplifying the portfolio and increasing our focus on areas where we have deep expertise and that are central to our long-term growth strategy. Our progress to date is underpinned by execution against our top company priorities. The first is a focus on the people and the culture. The second is our commitment to strengthen the core pharmaceutical and medical supply chain businesses. The third are intentional efforts to simplify and streamline the business. And finally to continue to invest to advance our differentiated oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. Let me now touch briefly on the progress we're making across each of these priorities. First and foremost, we're prioritizing our people and advancing our company's culture as we strive to be recognized as an impact driven organization, and the best place to work in healthcare. We've been hard at work to transform and energize our company's culture. Our ICARE and ILEAD value serve as the foundation as we work toward our common goal, advancing health outcomes for all. As an organization, we're committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion. For the sixth consecutive year, McKesson was named a Best Place to Work for disability inclusion; McKesson earned a top ranking score of 100 on the 2021 disability equality index. In addition, we marked progress in diverse representation in the US with female executive representation of 3% over the prior year, and a 6% gain over the prior year in executive representation for persons of color. Our second company priority is to strengthen our core distribution businesses where we have market leading scale and capabilities across North America. Success in the core enables strong cash flow generation, which we in turn use to reinvest in the business and to return capital to our shareholders. In addition to our work to help our customers and government partners in their pandemic response efforts, our pharmaceutical and medical surgical distribution businesses are continuing to improve and the recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has been in line with our expectations. Elective procedures and primary care visits have improved throughout our first quarter. The prescription volume trends are showing signs of improvement as well. Also positive or the trends we've seen across specialty and oncology patient visits, which were at or above pre COVID baselines in the first quarter, and distribution volumes to our specialty provider customers continue to drive and support our growth. In our Canadian distribution business, our operational excellence and scale was recently recognized through a new partnership with one of Canada's largest retailers as a primary distribution customer. This is a testament to the strength of our supply chain in Canada. Renewed focus on growing the core has been enabled by our commitment to streamline the business over the past several years, efforts that go beyond a recent announcement to exit the European region, which I commented on my opening remarks. Over the past several years, we've committed to transforming our operating model we've centralized back office functions across North America and Europe to further rationalized costs through reduction of our own retail pharmacy footprint and a commitment to lower spend across the organization. Throughout our enterprise, it's an initiative we called Spend Smart which helped us achieve our three year cost reduction target of $400 million to $500 million of annual cost savings by the end of our fiscal 2021. Over time, we've identified businesses that are not central to McKesson's current strategic priorities or direction, as was the case in our exit of our physician and change healthcare and the creation of a German wholesale joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance; we will continually review our portfolio to ensure tight and focused on alignment to our strategy. All this work has enabled us to focus our time and investments on our strategic growth pillars, where we're working to build connected ecosystems in the growth areas of oncology and biopharma services, which should serve to advance our already differentiated positions. We continue to be confident in the long-term outlook of businesses that operate in these high growth markets, starting with oncology and ecosystem that McKesson has strategically built over a period of nearly 15 years, beginning with our acquisition of Oncology Therapeutics Network, all the way back in 2007, which added at that time core specialty distribution capabilities. 10 years ago, we deepen the breadth and the depth of our offering with the acquisition of US Oncology Network, which gave us practice management, site management for research and the iKnowMed EHR which is one of the foundational pieces of on Ontada. Fast forward to today and we're now supporting over 14,000 specialty physicians through distribution and GPO services. We're also the leading distributor in the community oncology space and have over 1,400 physicians in the US and college networks spread over approximately 600 sites of care in the US. As innovative specialty therapies come to market our leading position in oncology distribution enabled us to grow our connected oncology ecosystem in parallel. As we grow, our non-affiliated and our US oncology provider basis, we accelerate the growth of our oncology assets such as GPO services practice management, site management for clinical research, specialty pharmacy, and our value proposition for Ontada where we're providing real world insight to both manufacturers and providers. Although in its infancy, Ontada value is being recognized through expanded partnerships with manufacturers such as Amgen and its leading role in a large scale real world research study known as MYLUNG, which aims to improve treatments and outcomes for non small cell lung cancer. New therapies coming to market can also provide additional challenges for patients' providers and our biopharma partners. Our Prescription Technology Solutions business invest in innovation and aims to provide access, adherence and affordability solutions for over 500 brands across nearly every therapeutic area. Our connectivity to over 50,000 pharmacies, 750,000 providers and 75% of VAHR in the US, helps enable over $5 billion of prescription savings for patients each year. Prescription Technology Solutions ended fiscal 2021 with solid momentum. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we saw organic growth in the business and encouraging signs that patient engagement levels and prescription volume trends are continuing to improve. Our market leading technology offerings are helping patients get access to therapies they need more quickly and efficiently and stay on those therapies longer to get better health outcomes. In closing, we believe that we've made significant strides against our strategic priorities of strengthening the core, simplifying the business and investing in our growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. Announcing the proposed opioid settlement agreement is an important development. In addition, our strategic intent to exit the European region positions us to become a more focused and agile. We believe both are in the best interest of our employees, in the best interest of our customers and in the best interest of our shareholders, while it's early in the fiscal year, and then pandemic continues to present unknowns, I'm confident in the fundamentals of the business, and believe we are positioned well for long-term growth. And we'll look to build upon this momentum over the remainder of our fiscal 2022. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to you Britt for a few additional comments. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to speak to you today about our strong first quarter results which reflecting importance of the products and services McKesson delivers, the execution and momentum across our business, which includes supporting US government's COVID-19 domestic and international vaccine and kitting efforts, and the recovery of prescription volumes and patient visits impacted by the COVID pandemic in the prior year. I'll begin my remarks today by sharing an update on our European businesses, followed by our first quarter results, and I'll close with an update for fiscal 2022 outlook. The summary of our first quarter results and updated guidance assumptions can be found in our earnings slide presentation, which is posted on the investor section of our website. In early July, we announced an agreement to sell our European businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia to the PHOENIX group. This transaction includes our German Ag headquarters in Stuttgart, and our European shared service center in Lithuania. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately US $1.5 billion. The ultimate proceeds for this transaction are subject to certain adjustments under the agreement. Therefore the proceeds may differ from the purchase price. The assets involved in this transaction contributed approximately $12 billion in revenue and $75 million in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2021. We've determined that this transaction shall not qualify for discontinued operations. And that asset included in the transaction we've classified as held for sale, and held for sale accounting is affected at the start of our second quarter of this fiscal year. We will re-measure the net assets to the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. And we estimate that this will result in a GAAP only charge between $500 million to $700 million in our second quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to help for sale accounting treatment we will discontinue recording depreciation amortization on the assets involved in the transaction. As a result of the help for sale accounting, we would guide to approximately $0.26 adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022. This will be included in our updated outlook. And I'll outline those later in my remarks. McKesson will operate these businesses and record revenue and income until the transaction is closed, which is expected to occur in fiscal 2023. We're committed to exploring strategic alternatives for our remaining European businesses. And we'll provide details on the plans for the remaining businesses as they become available. Exiting Europe at this time is the right course of action for McKesson and our shareholders. And it'll sharpen the focus on our growth strategies in oncology and biopharma services. As we develop and grow a connected ecosystem. Let me now turn to our first quarter results. Before I provide more details on our first quarter adjusted results. I want to point out two items that impacted our GAAP only results in the quarter. First, during the June quarter, we committed to donate certain Personal Protective Equipment and related products to charitable organizations to assist in COVID-19 recovery efforts. In the quarter, we recorded $155 million of pretax inventory charges within our medical-surgical solution segment for inventory which no longer intend to sell, and will instead direct the previously mentioned charitable organizations. And secondly, on our May 6 earnings call, we outlined an initiative to rationalize office space in North America to increase efficiencies and support increased employee flexibility. These actions will result in the realization of annual operating expense savings of approximately $60 million to $80 million when fully implemented. Our guidance does not assume a material benefit in fiscal 2022. In the June quarter, we reported approximately $95 million of charges associated with this initiative. Moving now to our adjusted results for the first quarter, beginning with our consolidated results, which can be found on slide 7? First quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $5.56, an increase of 101% compared to the prior year. This result was driven by the recovery in prescription volumes and primary care patient visits from the COVID-19 pandemic, as we lap the most significant pandemic impacts in lockdowns Q1 of fiscal 2021; it also included a lower tax rate, and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs, with the US government. Consolidated revenues of $62.7 billion increased 13% to the prior year, driven by growth in the US pharmaceutical segment, largely due to higher volumes from retail and national account customers, and price increases on branded and specialty pharmaceuticals, which is partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, up 19% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 6% year-over-year led higher operating expenses to support growth in our core businesses and strategic investments, partially offset by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 55% compared to the prior year, which reflects double digit growth in each segment. Interest expense was $49 million in the quarter, a decline of 18% compared to the prior year, driven by the retirement of approximately $1 billion of long-term debt in fiscal 2021. Our adjusted tax rate was 11.3% for the quarter due to discrete tax items that were reported during the quarter. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged. And our first quarter diluted weighted average shares were 158 million, a decrease of 3% year-over-year, driven by $1 billion of shares repurchased in the first quarter. Moving now to our first quarter segment results, which can be found on slide 8 through 12? And I'll start with US Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $50 billion, an increase of 12% driven by higher volumes in retail and national account customers and price increases on branded and specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 16% to $682 million, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and growth in Specialty Products distribution to our providers and healthcare systems, which was partially offset by higher operating costs, and supported a company's oncology growth initiative. Turning to Prescription Technology Solutions, we're very pleased with the strong growth and scale that we're building in this higher margin segment. The drivers for our Prescription Technology Solutions businesses continue to move in the right direction. First, we're seeing expansion in many of our services businesses, as we continue to add more manufacturing partners and programs for our existence solutions, such as electronic prior authorization, or access and adherence services, and 3PL. Second, our technology based platforms like Relay Health, support $19 billion clinical and financial transactions annually. From claims routing and the growing discount card market to alerts and adec that make the practice of pharmacy clinically safer and administratively more efficient. And we continue to invest in innovate to build a connected ecosystem of biopharma services, our next generation access and adherence solution, AMP is showing accelerated adoption in growth with new brands. This year, AMP is bringing its network enabled approach to hub services into support for oncology and specialty drugs covered under the medical benefit. We also continue to expand our clinical decision support capabilities in provider office workflow across every major HER. Our technology network stands at every touch point in the patient journey from doctor's office to benefit verification to dispensing pharmacy, which allows us to address barriers in the patient journey by adding unique automation that accelerates timed therapy and lowers patient out of pocket costs. In the June quarter, revenues were $881 million, an increase of 34% and adjusted operating profit increased 62% to $139 million, driven by higher volumes of technology and service offerings to support biopharma customers, organic growth from access and generic solutions and recovery of prescription volumes from the COVID-19 pandemic. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 40% driven by improvements in primary care patient visits and increased sales of COVID-19 tests. Contribution per contract with US government to prepare and distribute ancillary supplies related to the COVID-19 vaccine provided a benefit of approximately $0.25 in the quarter, and we're above our original expectations. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 107% to $257 million driven by improvements in primary care patient visits, and the contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for the US government's COVID-19 vaccine program. Next, let me speak about international, revenues in the quarter were $9.2 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year, excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, segment revenue increased 28% year-over-year, and was up 14% on an FX adjusted basis. Revenue was primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and the recovery of pharmaceutical distribution retail pharmacy volumes, and the COVID-19 pandemic. First quarter adjusted operating profit increased 133% year-over-year to $170 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 107% to $151 million led by the recovery of pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy volumes from the COVID-19 pandemic, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and test kits in Europe and Canada. Moving on to corporate; for the quarter adjusted corporate expenses were $154 million, a decrease of 7% year-over-year, driven by decreased opioid litigation expenses. We reported opioid related litigation expenses of $35 million for the first quarter; we continue to estimate fiscal 2022 opioid related litigation expenses to approximate $155 million. I would remind you that while we've negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement until we know the scope of participation in proposed settlement, you're not in a position to revise our opioid litigation expenses outlook. Let men now turn to our cash position which can be found on slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion. During the quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.8 billion. As a reminder, we're working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow vary from quarter-to-quarter, and were impacted by timing including the day in a week that marks the close of a given quarter. We made $159 million of capital expenditures in the quarter, which includes investments in technology data and analytics to support our strategic initiatives of oncology and biopharma services. As our business performed at a very high level, we were also able to return $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders in the June quarter. This included $1 billion of share repurchases pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program, which resulted in an initial delivery of 4.3 million shares in the quarter. Additionally, we paid $69 million in dividends. We have $1.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And we're updating our guidance for diluted weighted shares outstanding, to range from $154 million to $156 million for fiscal 2022, which incorporates plans; repurchase an additional $1 billion of stock over the remainder of the fiscal year. Let me transition and speak to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2022. For a full list of fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to slide 16 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation, I'll begin by reiterating a couple of key macro level assumptions that underpin our fiscal 2022 outlook. We expect prescription and patient engagement volumes will demonstrate steady improvement from the levels at the end of our fiscal 2021 through the first half of our fiscal 2022 and return to pre COVID levels in the second half of our fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2022, our updated guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share is a range of $19.80 to $20.40, up from our previous range of $18.85 to $19.45, approximately equally split between our first and second half of the fiscal year. Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 15% to 18.5% growth from the prior year. And our guidance assumes core growth across all of our segments. In the US Pharmaceutical segment, we now expect revenue to increase 5% to 8% and adjusted operating profits to deliver 4.5% to 7.5% growth over the prior year. Our US Pharmaceutical segment continues to exhibit stable fundamentals. Our outlook for branded pharmaceutical pricing remains consistent with the prior year for mid single digit increases in fiscal 2022. And the generics market remains competitive yet stable, as volumes have shown signs of recovery. COVID-19 vaccine contribution contributed approximately $0.30 in the first quarter of fiscal '22. We are updating our full year outlook to approximately $0.45 to $0.55. The $0.45 to $0.55 range reflects an anticipated contribution of earnings for the fair value of services performed at the US government centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines, including work preparing vaccines for international missions. Our current outlook remains aligned to the volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and the US government, which excludes booster shots and vaccines for pediatrics, which have not been approved by the FDA. We will continue to invest in our leading and differentiated physicians in oncology. These investments will represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. Normalizing for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and our ongoing growth investments, we continue to expect approximately 5% to 8% core adjusted operating profit growth. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we see revenue growth of 20% to 25%, and adjusted operating profit growth of 17% to 22%. This growth reflects the opportunities we see to accelerate service and transaction contributions, benefiting from our technology platforms.  Now transitioning to Medical-Surgical, we continue to partner with the US government under our contract for the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies and are updating our outlook to $0.35 to $0.45 of contribution in the segment related to kitting and distribution. This program scope and duration is evolving and our updated assumptions reflect the current outlook provided by the US government. Our revenue outlook assumes the 3% decline to 3% growth and adjusted operating profit to deliver 6% to 12% growth over the prior year. We continue to expect year-over-year core adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 10% to 16%. Finally, in the international segment, our revenue guidance is 1% decline to 4% growth as compared to the prior year. And as a reminder, this reflects the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. For adjusted operating profit, our guidance's growth in segment of 26% to 30% due to the previously mentioned benefit in the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization, which followed the announcement of our agreement to sell certain European assets. Our strong performance in the first quarter and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment.  Turning now to the consolidated view, our guidance assumes 4% to 7% revenue growth and 7% to 10% adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. We continue to expect corporate expenses in the range of $670 million to $720 million. Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We were pleased to recently announce the completion of cash funded upside tender offer. This successful tender offer resulted in the early retirement of $922 million of our outstanding debt. Additionally, we announced the early retirement of a \u20ac600 million note for a total reduction in debt of approximately $1.6 billion. These actions occurred during the beginning of our second quarter. It further strengthened our balance sheet and financial position, and they are in line with our previously stated intent to modestly delever. And as a result of these actions we are updating our interest expense guidance for fiscal 2022 to $180 million to $200 million. We're also reiterating our free cash flow guidance of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. Last quarter, I mentioned that we anticipated the use of cash to purchase shares of McKesson Europe through exercises of the foot rate option available to non controlling shareholders that expired in June of fiscal 2022. The remaining foot rate options resulted in payments of approximately $1 billion in the quarter, which was generally in line with our expectations. As a reminder, this is reflected in the financing activities section of our cash flow statement. As a result of this activity, McKesson holds approximately 95% of McKesson Europe's outstanding common shares. And we anticipate income attributable to non controlling interest in the range of $175 million to $195 million in fiscal 2022. Our commitment to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was recently highlighted by our board's approval of a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share. And our fiscal 2022 guidance continues to include share repurchases of approximately $2 billion for the full year. In closing, we're pleased with the strong results of our first quarter; we remain focused on driving growth as we invest against the strategic high growth opportunities in oncology and biopharma services. This focus combined with our commitment to further evolve the portfolio will drive significant value to our customers, shareholders and patients. Our outlook for fiscal '22 reflects this focus and execution with healthy adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share growth and return of capital to our shareholders. With that, Holly, let me turn it back to you for Q&A. Holly Weiss : Thank you, Britt. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. BrianTanquilut: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a very strong quarter. I guess, Britt, as I think about the guidance, it looks like it assumes a lower margin profile. Just curious what you're thinking in terms of any puts and takes in the margins as we look forward to the next three quarters. BrittVitalone: Yes, Brian, thanks for that question. No, I would remind you that this is our first quarter, and we had a very strong first quarter. We're still in an evolving environment; we're very encouraged by the utilization trends and the improvement that we're seeing, as we think about our US Pharmaceutical business. Our growth, as I mentioned in my remarks was driven in large part by the growth of our largest customers. So that does impact the mix. And it certainly impacted the mix in the first quarter. In our RxTS business, we have very healthy growth, as I mentioned across all of our different capabilities and some of the growth that we're seeing in that business there. Again, mix impacted by some of our 3PL growth, we're very encouraged by the growth of our access and adherence solutions, particularly our AMP product. But I think as you think about this, it is really a reflection of the first quarter. It's a reflection of the continued improvement in utilization. And it's a reflection of some mix within some of our segments. Operator : We will go next to Steven Valiquette of Barclays Bank. StevenValiquette: Great, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess if we go back to when McKesson acquired the European assets, seven, eight years ago, one of the drivers of the deal was to increase McKesson's generic drug purchasing power, I guess by announcing the sale to PHOENIX. My sense is you're probably not too worried about any dis synergies related to less generic purchasing power, you wouldn't do the transactions. I guess I'm just curious to hear a little more about the McKesson's purchasing power today, whether it's ClarusONE or other factors such that the additional European purchasing power as well as critical, and just to make sure we are not missing anything around this to hopefully well, I guess, is there any post deal agreement between McKesson and PHOENIX and generic purchasing collaboration? Or was that even explored? Thanks. BrianTyler: Thank you for the questions. Maybe I'll start, I mea if you wind the clock back to almost a decade ago, when we expanded into Europe. I think there were multiple elements for the company to strategically go to Europe, one of them; one of many was the opportunity to make sure we stayed leading in our generics procurement capabilities and scale. I think over the last years, we continue to invest in that capability. We have a very successful partnership in ClarusONE and we're very confident that we have not just the scale but also the procurement expertise. And then we have a very contemporary generic procurement operation that will continue to be a leading generic operation after the divestiture of the European assets that we've discussed. So we're quite confident in our -- the productivity and the yield results we see from ClarusONE and we believe that will continue to be the case into the future. Operator : Next we will go to Michael of Bank of America. MichaelCherny: Good afternoon, congratulations on the quarter. I just want to dive in and get a little bit more on the pharma distribution outlook, clear the results are strong in the quarter, it claims towards higher record growth on a go forward basis. As you think about the dynamics in the market, maybe aside from the ClarusONE question, but what has been the pace and health of recovery of your non large national chain customers? You call them out as specific contributors to the quarter, can you give us a sense about how the rest of your book of business or rest of your customers are handling the potential or hopefully recovering utilization across their platforms and where the factors in terms of your outlook for the rest of the year? BrianTyler: Sure, Michael, start with a couple of comments. So first off, we are pleased at the trajectory of the recovery that we have seen. And we, it's been more or less in alignment with the expectations we set out at the beginning of the year. And I think it's not just isolated to a particular segment. I think if you look at the market overall, we continue to see really through the first quarter, steady progression along the trend line that we signaled we thought would be the case. So we're very, we continue to be encouraged by that; we continue to think that we will reach full recovery, meaning pre COVID levels in the second half of our fiscal year, obviously we tracked the trends regularly. If we saw something that would cause us to deviate from that we would be sure to share it with you. But right at this point in time, the recovery has been more or less in line with how we thought. We're very pleased about that and we expect that we will get to the full recovery in the second half of this fiscal year. BrittVitalone: Maybe I would just add that I think the balance of our customers and the channels that we serve, and what we're seeing in those various channels is reflected in the guidance that we gave you a 5% to 8% operating profit growth. So all of the channels are recovering. They're recovering, as Brian mentioned in line with our expectations, and they're all contributing to that overall core operating profit growth. Operator : We will go next to Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. LisaGill: Thank you and let me add my congratulations as well. Brian and Brett, I just want understand biosimilars. So you talk just now about operating profit, how much of an impact are biosimilars having and then as we think about the comments, Brian, that you made both around oncology and bio services, how do we think about that going forward, especially on the oncology side. What types of investments are you making, how important are biosimilars as these programs are going to make acquisitions? How do we think about that? BrianTyler: Thank you for the question, Lisa. I'll maybe start with biosimilars, and then round into the oncology question. I mean biosimilars we think we are very well positioned, given our strength in the specialty business and including the oncology elements of that. It's still from our perspective is fairly early days, there's just under a dozen in the marketplace today, we think the pipeline does look good and that given the assets we have in oncology and biopharma and our footprint in the specialty space, we will benefit from that and we have seen a growing impact of biosimilars over the last several quarters. As it relates to oncology, we use the word ecosystem. And that's really just to try to introduce this notion that there are many assets that McKesson has that relate to our oncology businesses, whether it's just distribution, specialty distribution, GPOs, health economics outcome research, the latest addition to that portfolio of assets is the data and insights business that we call Ontada. And when we think of the oncology ecosystem, we think of these as all kind of self reinforcing and adding momentum to each other. We add providers that add scale to GPO that adds more customers and data to Ontada, as Ontada matures, as partnerships expand and we get more insights, we funnel that back a to provider which makes us a more attractive solution provider to them. So that's really how we're thinking about it. It's each into themselves is a good business, we think, but together we think there's real differentiation and strength. BrittVitalone: And Lisa, I just add on that we're really pleased with the development of biosimilars are really adding to the operating profit growth in the segment. It's growing. Over time, we think that it will continue to grow. And the channel matters where we have more services to provide. As Brian mentioned, GPO services, a good example of that, certainly is more profitable for us and we'll see higher adoption rates, the adoption rates continue to build. And that I think is reflective of the growing operating profit contribution that we're seeing from biosimilars. But we do think longer term, there's a larger opportunity. Operator : Next will be Eric Percher of Nephron Research. EricPercher: Thank you. The International DNA dynamics are interesting. Thank you for that detail. Maybe a two parter, Britt. One is when we think about the remaining European business, can you provide us some sense of scale? I think the last time we got a salacious number without Canada was around $230 million about profit. And then on the DNA, could the same circumstances exist for the remaining EU business? Should you get to a sale? BrittVitalone: Yes, great questions, Eric. And thank you for those questions. And we're not going to break out the international business into a piece parts, which is something that we're ready to do at this point in time. And I would just say that every transaction that could happen in the future we will evaluate that based on the facts of the transaction for this particular transaction, we deemed that these assets would be in the health for sale perspective, but I can't really comment on what future transactions might look like, it's difficult to know how those transactions may or may not come together and what the specific details would be. Next question, operator? Operator : And next will be Charles Rhyee of Cowen. CharlesRhyee: Yes, thanks for taking question. Just wanted, Britt, just talk about the guidance here for the remainder of the year. Obviously, the large upside performance of the quarter, at least relative to what I think consensus was expecting, maybe if you could talk about how this came in, at least relative to what you're expecting coming into this quarter. And as we think about the rest of the year, if I looked at the pieces, it seems like we're getting a benefit from the DNA also a tax benefit. Is that really the big drivers here relative to your expectations coming in? And maybe any kind of thoughts around that as we think about the remainder of the year, relative to how you guys were? Your plan came in? Thanks. BrittVitalone: Yes, thank you for that question. Maybe I'll just start with, as you look at some of our macro assumptions, we talked about these in May, that we assumed that we would continue to see growing patient activity and prescription volumes, we saw that in the first quarter. And so that was in line with our expectations, we see that continuing to build and continuing to improve. And so just from a very macro utilization perspective, we're seeing improvement that we expected to see where we're seeing it on the trajectory that we expected to see. And so we're very encouraged by that. Our businesses, each of our segments had very strong performance. And so we're very encouraged by that. It is our first quarter; certainly utilization will continue to evolve over the rest of the year. But we're very encouraged by that, the strong operating performance, the utilization that we're seeing; the patient activity that we're seeing, we expect that will continue along lines that we thought it would certainly the vaccine distribution and kitting program continues to evolve, and it was a little bit higher than we had anticipated. We've increased the guide for that, generally speaking, utilization is strong. It's in line with what our expectations were. And we expect that will continue through the remainder of the year. And you'd ask the question on tax. The one thing that I will remind you on taxes, we don't guide tax by quarter, we guide you on an annual basis. We did not change our guidance for the full year effective tax rate. And I think if you look over the last few years, the annual guidance around the tax rate that we've given is pretty much been in line with the original guide. Operator : And we'll go to Kevin Caliendo of UBS. KevinCaliendo: Thanks for taking my call. So I want to ask the guidance question a little bit differently because it is unusual for McKesson to sort of raise guidance for all the segments right after the first quarter and I'm wondering if it's just something about the way if it's COVID related or not, but I mean to raise your revenue expectations for all of your segments versus what you guided to just a couple months ago. Is there anything else specific? Was it just conservatism on your part? Because we can't just point to script growth or patient volume, it's got to be some sort of larger macro thing happening here that's driving this. And I know you've kind of addressed it, but maybe talk specifically about the conservatism or when you went into the year, what was the overhang that possibly lifted that allowing you to do this across the board? BrittVitalone: Well, let me start, appreciate the question and maybe phrase it a little bit differently. We don't provide conservative guidance, as we provide guidance is based on what we see in our markets and what we're seeing within our businesses. I would remind you that when we gave you our guidance, one of the things that we talked about is that the markets that we operate in had not fully recovered. And so we're coming off a year of one of the most dynamic environments that we've ever operated in. And when we provided that guidance, we were very clear that our market had not fully recovered. We expected that they would, but certainly it was going to evolve over time. Our businesses continue to operate at a very high level. And I think you saw that in the performance this quarter. We're very encouraged by the utilization trends that we see. We're very encouraged by the performance that each of the businesses has shown. And we're seeing really good reaction and response to a lot of the products that we have, it's specifically in the RxTS business as an example. So I think what you're seeing is an environment that is continuing to recover, not necessarily on an even basis over the last year and a half in a business that is performing very well in those situations. Operator : And next will be Rivka Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. RivkaGoldwasser: Yes, Hi, good afternoon. Let's go back to kind of especially on Ontada, you talk, Brian about subcontractor relationship and sort of that cycle between providers and biopharma, et cetera. So for Ontada, our payers customers as well and is that sort of coincided and started that sort of a growth opportunity that you're looking, just guess I'm interested in CapEx opportunities to grow that oncology business beyond just the pipeline of drugs. BrianTyler: Thank you, Ricky. I think there's lots of interest in data and insights and understanding patient and provider behavior as relates to these oncolytics. Our primary focus in Ontada is really to leverage the data and the working relationships and the scale of our physician relationships, to generate insights that help the development, the discovery, and ultimately the launch and adoption of oncology products. And likewise, to take the early lessons we get in the research and the development and launch planning around these products to ensure that providers are most able to react, adopt and get great patient outcomes from that. So we see it as a very virtuous cycle really anchored in provider and in the biopharma companies. But there may be several other interested parties in the data insights that we can generate. And that's something that certainly consider as the business matures. Operator : Next question will come from Jailendra Singh of Credit Suisse. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, this is Adam on for Jailendra today, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the assumption of a return to pre COVID utilization in the second half of your fiscal year. One of your competitors this morning, thinking that they saw returns pre COVID prescription utilization in the June quarter. So I mean is the difference in comments as a function of customer or channel mix? Or I guess the way pre COVID is being measured? Or what else should we be thinking about when attempting to bridge those comments? Thanks. BrittVitalone: Thank you for your question. I'll give you one example in a medical business as an example. What we saw in the June quarter was that primary care patient visits improved from the fourth quarter, back to about 95% in pre COVID level. So continuing to see the improvement but not back at pre COVID level. So when we speak about utilization, we are seeing pre COVID levels for oncology and for specialty. We're not seeing that quite yet for primary care patient visits as an example, continuing to improve on the trajectory that we laid out in our earnings call that we had expected. But that's one example, for our business that is perhaps a little bit different. Brian Tyler : Great. Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you for your insightful questions. Thank you for joining us on this call. And thank you, Jenny, for helping facilitate the call. McKesson is off to a very strong start in our fiscal 2022. I'm incredibly excited, not just about the recovery of the market, but frankly, the execution by our teams, which is generating this performance in the business. So I want to be sure to thank our more than 75,000 employees for their commitment to be together to be a team to focus on doing good for our company, for our customers and for the healthcare industry. As a global leader in health care, we are committed to doing our part to serve our employees, our customers, our partners and our communities as they continue the pandemic response efforts. So, in closing, I just want to wish you all and your families, good health and wellness. Have a great evening, thank you. Operator : And thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rachel Rodriguez. Please go ahead. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you, Sarah (ph.). Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Taylor, our Chief Executive Officer, and Britt Vital one, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation, and to the risk factor section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.McKesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter call today. We are happy to report another strong quarter for McKesson, driven by continued market improvements and the underlying fundamentals of our businesses. We achieved double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all four segments based on a strong operating performance and alignment across the enterprise.  As a result of our second quarter performance, our confidence in the second half of the fiscal year, and McKesson's continued role in the COVID-19 response efforts, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2022 to adjusted earnings per diluted share from $19.80 to $20.40 to a new range of $21.95 to $22.55.  We continue to believe we will see a return to pre - COVID pharmaceutical prescription and patient engagement levels in the second half of our current fiscal year. We are encouraged by the trends we continue to see across primary care specialty and oncology patient visits, in addition to overall prescription volumes. We're pleased to see our markets are recovering in line with our original expectations. Our enterprise-wide focus on our Company priorities is driving operating performance, and furthering the advancement of our long-term growth. I would like to take the time today to talk about each of our Company's priorities. First, we have a focus on our people and the culture, which is guided by our ICARE and ILEAD values. These values include a commitment to both our local and global communities, our customers, and the healthcare industry to innovate and deliver opportunities that make our customers more successful, all for the better health of patients. Along with these values, we're committed to fostering an inclusive workplace that celebrates our differences and respects the diverse world in which we live and work. As an organization, we continue to be committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion through a more diverse and inclusive workplace we are a stronger, more creative, and a more productive team.  At McKesson, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees, and we're deeply committed to supporting our team members across the organization, which is why I'm incredibly pleased to have announced McKesson's first-ever day of wellness, which we call \"Your day, your way. \" This will take place this Friday, November 5th. We understand that mental, physical, and emotional well-being or most importance to our team.  So, we've made the decision to set aside a special day to help ensure our employees can rest, recharge, and take time for themselves. We're so grateful for all the contributions from the team over the last 19 months. McKesson employees continue to be in the center of the fight against COVID-19 and we want to make sure everyone gets a chance to take a well-deserved break. Our second priority is to strengthen our core pharmaceutical and medical supply chain businesses across North America, we have a best-in-class pharmaceutical supply chain. As a reminder, in the U.S. we have a scale distribution presence that delivers roughly 1/3 of prescription medicines each day. Our operational excellence and our ability to leverage our scale of global suppliers is one of the many reasons why McKesson continues to be the partner of choice for hospitals, health systems, and pharmacies of all size.  We strengthened our business when we strengthen our customers and partners. This past quarter, we held our annual McKesson idea Share educational event, which brought together independent pharmacy operators to help them learn new skills, how to grow strategically, and how to operate efficiently. The virtual experience helps 2,000 independent pharmacies prioritize education and networking, which we believe will shape the future of community pharmacy and strengthen the independent business for the better.  In Canada, we've been the leader in healthcare related logistics and distribution for 100 years, and we support hospitals, community, and retail pharmacies to ensure that medication is always available. We're a leader in medical distribution to alternate site markets, and our footprint in the U.S. healthcare is underpinned by our strong sourcing and supply chain capabilities. We deliver medical and surgical supplies and services to over 250,000 customers. Our pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses continue to play an integral role in the pandemic response efforts. And our capabilities have been highlighted through our evolving partnership with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage programs.  I'm glad to say that the fundamentals in our core business remain solid and our execution has continued to improve as we accelerate our growth and work to deliver high-quality, resilient supply chains to our customers. Our third Company priority is to simplify and streamline the business. We're prioritizing the areas where we have deep expertise and are central to our long-term growth strategies, largely within the North American market.  As a result, we made the decision to fully exit McKesson's businesses in the European region. In July, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our European businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, and Slovenia to the Phoenix Group. Today, we're announcing that McKesson has made the decision to sell our UK retail and distribution businesses as a whole.  The transaction is expected to close in Q4 of Fiscal 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. We believe this step toward a full exit of our European business is an important milestone in our strategy as a streamlined, efficient, focused organization. Building upon the foundation of a strong Company culture, and a stable business, the last Company priority encompasses our 2 strategic growth pillars. We are investing to advance our Oncology and Biopharma services, which includes building integrated ecosystem that leverage our differentiated assets and capabilities, and our strategic focus on these 2 pillars is important as both of these areas have good inherent growth opportunities. McKesson's oncology ecosystem supports over 14,000 specialty physicians through distribution and GPO services. And we are the leading distributor in the community oncology space. We have over 1,400 physicians in the U.S.  Oncology Network spread over approximately 600 sites of care in the U.S. Within our oncology ecosystem, Ontada generates insights at the intersection of technology and data, and supports community providers with precise cancer care by improving patient outcomes and delivering evidence and insights to help accelerate life sciences research. Ecosystem helps the clinicians to provide better care in an increasingly complicated oncology care landscape by helping them grow their businesses, attract more patients, and produce better health outcomes.  We can then leverage interconnected technology and real-world insights to speed data backup stream to manufacturers, which can help them think about identifying new products, innovations, and new markets. Within the biopharma ecosystem that prescription Technology Solutions businesses leverage technology networks and access to provide our workflows to serve biopharma and Life Sciences partners and patients.  We have built this ecosystem over many years as it includes assets like Relay Health Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds, and RxCrossroads. It allows us to connect providers, payers, and patients together to focus on access, adherence, and affordability solutions. Our two strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services are not just businesses or products, but fundamentally a suite of solutions that solve long-standing problems in ways that bring more speed, impact, and efficiency.  We will continue to invest and accelerate the execution against those strategies, which support the long-term growth for McKesson. I'm confident in the progress against our Company's priorities, that they will enable the advancement of our growth. Before I turn to our second quarter results, just a brief update on our Board of Directors.  In September, our Board of Directors welcomed Dr. Richard Carmona as a new independent director. Dr. Carmona has a strong focus on improving public health care and extensive experience in clinical sciences, healthcare management, and emergency preparedness, which led to his nomination and unanimous Senate confirmation as the 17th Surgeon General of the U.S from 2002 until 2006. Currently, Dr. Carmona is Chief of Health Innovations at Canyon Ranch and a Professor of Public Health at the University of Arizona. His hands-on healthcare experience will be invaluable for McKesson's Board of Directors.  Now, I want to turn to the business performance within the second quarter. We are pleased with our strong second quarter performance and we remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals in our business. Let me start with U.S. pharmaceutical, where our solid results for the second quarter reflected continued improvement of prescription trends, which were in line with our expectations. Within specialty oncology visits, we saw an exit rate of pre -COVID levels, which again was in line with our expectations.  The U.S. pharmaceutical segment saw 12% adjusted operating profit growth, which was underpinned by the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, and the contribution from our successful COVID-19 vaccine distribution operations. We're in a strong position to continue to support the government and private enterprise in the future for distributing COVID and flu vaccines. And our investments in the distribution business continue to be showcased through our successful vaccine response.  Through October 28th, our U.S. pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 311 million Moderna and J&J COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites across the U.S and to support the U.S. government's international donation mission. In Prescription Technology Solutions, the business continued to perform well this quarter as our technology and service offerings have accelerated the support and growth of our biopharma customers and we've been successful in adding new brands to our platforms. The segment had excellent momentum and delivered a 38% increase to adjusted operating profit growth during the second quarter.  In addition to the operational strength, I'm proud to say that we are helping patients get access to the therapies through our market-leading technology offerings in this segment. In medical-surgical, we saw an increase in COVID-19 tests and improvement in patient care visits, and we announced we are expanding our work with the U.S. government through a new kitting and storage contract. Our medical-surgical business remains well-positioned to continue to support the government as needed.  The growth in our Medical-Surgical segment is reflective of strong top line performance and underlying business improvement. As it relates to International, the segment had solid adjusted operating profit growth benefiting from both local COVID programs, and a new partnership with one of Canada's largest retailers. We're partnering with local governments to distribute and administer COVID-19 vaccine, and through September, we've distributed over 58 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across our international geographies. As a reminder, excluding our planned divestitures in Europe, we have businesses in Norway, Austria, Denmark, and Canada in our International segment. For our remaining European businesses, we are exploring strategic alternatives as we align future investments to our growth strategies.  Before I close, I would like to update you on the status of the proposed opioid settlement. Recently, we announced that enough states have agreed to settle to proceed to the next phase, which is the subdivision sign on period. During this phase, each participating state will offer its political subdivisions, including those that have not sued, the opportunity to participate in the settlement for an additional 120-day period, which ends January 2nd 2022. We are pleased with this important step, and we believe the settlement framework will allow us to focus our attention and resources on the safe and secure delivery of medications and therapies, while expediting the delivery of meaningful relief to the effected communities. In closing, I'm encouraged as we continue to make progress and accelerate growth as we advance our Company priorities.  Our underlying distribution business have stable fundamentals, great teams, and strong execution. We're investing in what we believe are 2 good growth markets where we have differentiated capabilities and we look forward to sharing more of those successes and Proofpoint's with you at our upcoming Investor Day. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Britt for a few additional comments. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian. And Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss our fiscal second quarter results, which reflects strong performance and momentum across the business driven by operational excellence and execution against our growth strategies. This momentum can be seen in each of our segments. A summary of our second quarter results and updated guidance assumptions can be found in our earnings slide presentation, which is posted on the Investors section of our website. Let me start with an update on Europe. This morning, we announced that we've entered into a definitive agreement to divest our retail and distribution businesses in the UK to Aurelius for approximately $438 million. The ultimate proceeds from this transaction are subject to certain adjustments under the agreement.  Therefore, the proceeds may differ from the announced purchase price. McKesson will continue to operate these businesses, and record revenue and income until the transaction is closed, which is expected to occur in our fourth quarter Fiscal 2022 pursuant to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. The assets involved in this transaction contributed approximately $7.8 billion in revenue, and $64 million in adjusted operating profit in Fiscal 2021. The net assets included in the transaction will be classified as held-for-sale and held-for-sale accounting will be effective beginning with our fiscal 2022, third quarter.  We will re-measure the net assets to the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost for sell. And we estimate that this will result in a GAAP only charge of between $700 to $900 million in our third quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to held-for-sale accounting treatment, we will discontinue recording depreciation amortization on the assets involved in the transaction. This impact is not included in the Fiscal 2022 outlook provided today.  This transaction provides us the focus to pursue the growth strategies of oncology and biopharmaceutical services in North America. And as Brian mentioned, we remain committed to a full exit of our European businesses, which includes announced transactions to the Phoenix Group and Relias, as well as our remaining operations in Norway, Austria, and Denmark. Let me now turn to our second quarter results. Before I provide more details on our second quarter adjusted results, I want to point out two additional items that impacted our GAAP -only results in the quarter. First, we recorded a GAAP -only after-tax charge of $472 million related to our agreement to sell certain European businesses to the Phoenix Group. to account for the re-measurement of the net assets to lower accruing amount of fair value, less cost to sell.  This transaction is expected to close within the next 12 months. Also, during the quarter, we recorded an after-tax loss of $141 million on debt extinguishment related to the successful completion of a bond tender offer. Moving now to our adjusted results for the second quarter, beginning with our consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 7. Our second quarter results were highlighted by strong operating performance, which included record revenue and double-digit adjusted operating profit growth across all segments.  We are encouraged by the ongoing market improvement in both prescription volumes and patient visits, which we observed in our second quarter. These improvements are supported by our strategic agenda, setting us on a path of disciplined growth. In our work to support U.S. government's COVID-19 domestic and international vaccine and kitting efforts continues to contribute to growth in addition to the momentum we have built across the business.  Second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.15, an increase of 28% compared to the prior year. This was -- this result was driven by the contribution for the COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution and growth in the medical-surgical solution segment, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $97 million or $0.46 per diluted share associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, as compared to $49 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021. Consolidated revenues of $66.6 billion increased 9% above the prior year, principally driven by growth in U.S. pharmaceutical segment, largely due to increased pharmaceutical volumes, including growth in specialty products, and our largest retail national account customers. And partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions. Adjusted gross profit was $3.3 billion for the quarter, up 12% compared to the prior year. Comparable adjusted gross margin for the quarter was up 10 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 4% year-over-year. And adjusted operating profit of $1.3 billion for the quarter, was an increase of 34% compared to the prior year and reflected double-digit growth in each segment. Interest expense was $45 million in the quarter, a decline of 10% compared to the prior year, driven by the net reduction of debt in the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. In wrapping up our consolidated results, second quarter diluted weighted average shares were 155.8 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year.  Moving now to our second quarter segment results, which can be found in Slides 8 through 13, and I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $53.4 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year as increased pharmaceutical volumes, including growth in specialty products and our largest retail national account customers we're partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit increased 12% to $735 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution.  The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government related to the distribution of COVID-19, provided a benefit of approximately $0.28 per share in the quarter, which is above our original expectations. In the Prescription Technology Solution segment, revenues were $932 million, an increase of 40%, driven by higher biopharma service offerings including third-party logistics services, and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes. Adjusted operating profit increased 38% to $144 million, driven by organic growth from access in his year-end Solutions. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 23% driven by increased sales of COVID-19 tests and growth in the primary care business. Adjusted operating profit increased 52% to 319 million driven by growth in the primary care business, increased sales of COVID-19 tests. And the contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program.  The contribution from our contract with U.S. government related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines provided a benefit of approximately $0.14 per share in the quarter, which was above our original expectations. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues in the quarter were $9.1 billion, a decrease of 5% primarily driven by the contribution of McKesson's German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, partially offset by volume increases in the pharmaceutical distribution and retail businesses. Excluding the impact from the contribution of our German wholesale business, which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, segment revenue increased 13% year-over-year, and was up 9% on an FX adjusted basis.  Adjusted operating profit increased 41% year-over-year to a $163 million On an FX -adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 34% to a $155 million, driven by the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization on certain European assets classified as held-for-sale beginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2022. The held-for-sale accounting in our international business contributed $0.13 to adjusted earnings in our second quarter of Fiscal 2022. Moving on to corporate. Adjusted corporate expenses were $83 million, a decrease of 39% year-over-year, driven by gains of approximately $97 million or $0.46 from equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. This quarter we had fair value adjustments related to multiple portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. Compared to fiscal 2021, gains from McKesson Ventures contributed $0.24 year-over-year. As previously discussed, it's difficult to predict when gains or losses on our Ventures portfolio companies may occur, and therefore, our practice has been, and will continue to be, to not include Ventures portfolio impacts in our guidance.  We also reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $36 million for the second quarter and anticipate that fiscal 2022 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $155 million. Consistent with the proposed settlement announced in July, we also made the first annual payment into escrow of approximately $354 million during the quarter. Let me now turn to our cash position, which can be found on slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion, and for the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we had negative free cash flow of a $109 million. In Q2, we completed several debt transactions. In July, we redeemed a EUR600 million denominated note prior to maturity. In August, we completed a cash-funded up-sized tender offer, which resulted in the redemption of $922 million principal outstanding debt. And finally, we completed a public offering of a note in the principal amount of $500 million at 1.3%. These actions align with our previously stated intent to modestly deliver, and to further strengthen our balance sheet and financial position.  Year-to-date, we made $279 million of capital expenditures, which included investments to support our strategic pillars of Oncology and biopharma services. For the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we returned $1.4 billion in cash to our shareholders through $1.3 billion of share repurchases. and the payment of a $134 million in dividends. We have $1.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization and continue to expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to range from 154 to $156 billion for  Fiscal 2022. Let me transition now and speak to our outlook for the remainder of Fiscal 2022. For our full list of Fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to slide 16 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation. As a result of our strong first-half performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance range for Fiscal 2022 to $21.95 to $22.55, which is up from our previous range of $19.80 to $20. And $0.40. Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 27.5% to 31% growth from the prior year and our guidance assumes growth across all of our segments.  Additionally, fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance includes $2.30 to $3.05 of impacts attributable to the following items : $0.50 to $0.70 related to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, which is an increase from the previous range of $0.45 to $0.55; $0.80 to a $1.10 related to the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, an increase from the previous range of $0.50 to $0.70 as discussed to the recent conference; $0.50 to $0.75 related to COVID-19 tests, impairments for PPE and related products, and approximately $0.49 from gains or losses associated with McKesson.  McKesson Ventures equity investments within our corporate segment year-to-date. Excluding the impacts of these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 20% to 29% forecasted growth. Let me provide a few additional assumptions related to our guidance. We continue to expect prescription and patient engagement volumes will return to pre -COVID levels in the second half of our Fiscal 2022, which is in line with our original guidance. In the U.S. pharmaceutical segment, we now expect revenue to increase 8% to 11% and adjusted operating profit to deliver 4.5% to 7.5% growth over the prior year. We continue to see stable fundamentals, specifically, our outlook for branded pharmaceutical pricing remains consistent with our original guidance and the prior year of mid-single-digits increases in Fiscal 2022. And our view is that the generics market remains competitive yet stable as our volumes have continued to improve in the September quarter. Our guidance includes contribution related to our roles of centralized distributor for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution. This includes work preparing vaccines for international missions.  Our current outlook remains will mind the volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and the U.S. government. The current guidance excludes booster shots due to the timing of the recent approvals, as well as vaccines for pediatrics, which has not been approved by the CDC. We will continue to update you on the progress and contribution from this program. When excluding COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment, we expect approximately 3% to 6% adjusted operating profit growth. In addition, our investments in our leading and differentiated position in oncology will continue to represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we see revenue growth of 31% to 37% and adjusted operating profit growth of 23% to 29%. This growth reflects the strong service and transactional [Indiscernible] in the business.  Now transitioning to Medical-Surgical, our revenue outlook assumes 8% to 14% growth and adjusted operating profit to deliver 35% to 45% growth over the prior year. As mentioned previously, our outlook includes $0.80 to a $1.10 related to the contribution from the U.S. government's distribution of ancillary supply kits and storage programs, and $0.50 to $0.75 related to COVID-19 tests and PPE impairments in related products. Excluding the impacts from these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 13% to 19% forecasted growth.  One additional note related to our U.S. distribution businesses. One of the pillars of our enterprise strategy is channel, the ability to attract and retain the best workforce in healthcare. The labor market remains competitive and we've assumed the modest expense impact to ensure there is continued service continuity through the holiday season and the back half of our fiscal year. Therefore, the guidance that we're providing today includes approximately $0.10 to $0.20 of adjusted operating expense impact for labor investments in our U.S. distribution businesses in the second half of the year. Finally, in the international segment, our revenue guidance is 1% decline to 4% growth as compared to the prior year. As a reminder, this reflects the impact of the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance.  For adjusted operating profit, our guidance reflects growth in the segment of 39 to 43%, which includes approximately $0.38 of expected adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022 as a result of the held-for-sale accounting related to our agreement to sell certain European assets to the Phoenix Group. It also includes our strong performance in the second quarter and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment. Turning now to the consolidated view. Our increased guidance assumes 8% to 11% revenue growth and 18% to 22% adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021.  Our full-year adjusted effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged. And we anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $610 million to $660 million. On our May 6th earnings call, we outlined an initiative to rationalize office space in North America to increase efficiencies and to support employee flexibility. We've made good progress against this initiative.  And based on this progress, we now expect earlier benefits from these actions, resulting in the realization of annual operating expense savings of approximately $15 million to $25 million in the second half of Fiscal 2022, with annual savings of $50 million to $70 million when fully implemented. These savings will be realized across all of our segments. Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We expect free cash flow of approximately $3.5 to $3.9 billion in fiscal 2022, which is net of property acquisitions in capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, historically we generate the majority of our cash flows in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.  This strong cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to execute a balanced capital allocation approach, investing in our strategies of oncology and biopharma services, positioning our business for long-term growth, while remaining committed to returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. Our investment grade credit rating remains a priority in underpins our financial flexibility. In closing, we are encouraged by our strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year. The momentum across the business, including our partnership with the U.S. government, positions us to deliver the updated fiscal 2022 outlook provided here today. Finally, we're looking forward to providing additional details on our strategies and the strength of our businesses at our upcoming Investor Day on December 8th. Thank you for your time. And now I'll turn the call over to the Operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. If you would like to signal with questions [Operator Instructions]. If you are joining us today using a speaker phone, please make sure the mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that is star 1, If you would like to ask a question. And we'll pause for just one moment. And we'll take our first question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good afternoon and congratulations on a great quarter. Britt, I appreciate your comments around what you're seeing as far as wage inflation goes. But one of the other questions we've gotten there as inflation is around, freight costs, can you remind us of how that works between the manufacturer and the drug distributor, and if you will bear any of those costs from a distribution perspective, or is it just the manufacturer that bears that costs? Are you able to pass those on to the customer? Just any color around that would be helpful. Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thanks for your question, Lisa. Certainly, we will bear some cost for freight. We've been able to pass that on to this point in time, both our pharmaceutical and our medical business. We are responsible for the freight from our distribution locations to our customers. And to this point, we've been able to manage through that without any material impact.  And our guidance for the rest of the year assumes that that will continue. We did call out the incremental labor impact, the investment that we're making to make sure that we have continuity through the rest of the year. But as it relates to freight, we are responsible from [Indiscernible]. Operator, can you get on with the next question please? Operator, can you go ahead to the next question, please. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, you will hear music for just a brief moment while reconnect the speaker's line. Brian Tyler : Hi Sarah (ph.), this is the McKesson presenter line. Operator : Please proceed. Brian Tyler : We'll go ahead and take the next question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First of all, the call cut off, so I don't know if you've got a chance to finish Lisa's question on freight. [Indiscernible] if you would to highlight that again. And then I guess just from my perspective, I don't want to get too far ahead of things, especially with the Analyst Day coming up. But I appreciate all the breakout you have on the strong work tied to all the COVID -related elements. I know one of the questions from guests who will come up is what that means into next year.  Given that you outlined some of the benefits that you're seeing specifically this year that [Indiscernible] all it takes we all hope that don't [Indiscernible] growth trajectory into next year. Is there any way to think about that 230 to 305, and how we have to think about that as a whole in terms of your overall growth versus what your core business will continue to do? Britt Vitalone : Hey, Mike. This is Britt. Thanks for hanging in there. Let me just get back to Lisa's question just to finish that up. We are responsible for the freight from our distribution centers to our customers. To this point this year, we have not had an impact in our financial statements as a result of increased freight and we don't expect any of that in our guidance as well, so just to be clear on that. We did call out for you, investments that we're making in labor in the back half of the year, so that we can ensure the holiday season in the back half of the year for our customers has continuity.  As it relates to your question, Mike, what we've really tried to do here is provide you some clarity on those items that are related to our distribution of COVID vaccines and ancillary kits, as well as the increase that we've seen in COVID test kits which have varied quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter over the last year. We've tried to isolate those for you so that you can have a good view into the operations of our core business. I would remind you that the first quarter this year was lapping a very low quarter from the prior year, which was really the first quarter post the COVID pandemic.  So, the growth that you're seeing this year while strong, includes the first quarter which lapped a very low quarter due to COVID in FY21. We'll provide more detail for you on the core components of each of the segments at our Investor Day. We're very pleased with the performance that we've seen thus far, our core business has performed well. But again, I just would remind you that in addition to that, we did have that low quarter for lap in Q1 of last year. Michael Cherny : Okay, thank you. Brian Tyler : What Michael was -- just about the vaccine and kitting operation. We continue to run that operation at the direction of the CDC in accordance with the schedules -- the production schedules that they give us. It's obviously been quite dynamic over the past months. We are prepared and we'll continue to run that operation as long as the CDC sees value in it and asks us to do it. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about Prescription Technology Solutions. Obviously, very strong growth here in the quarter and you raised for the full-year outlook. But when we look at the Slide 4 and you talk about the various services within -- in this -- for biopharma services, can you highlight which of the ones are really driving the growth here? Obvious some of it is tied to prescription utilization, and I know that we are still coming out of the COVID period, but maybe any comments around growth among some of these various services, and I guess just a sense on which ones will benefit as we continue to recover from the COVID levels. Thanks. Brian Tyler : Thank you for the question. Look we're -- we continued -- this business is responsive to absolute levels of activity relative to prescription. volumes in the market. We continue to see benefits from the prior investments we've made and these technology services offerings, we do see a good underlying growth across the portfolio. Clearly, we've benefited from the recovery in COVID-19 related pandemic volumes. And honestly, some of the policy decisions payers would have made around the way they manage prior authorization, we're really seeing that market return to pre - COVID level conditions and requirements coming out of the payers.  So, we believe as patients continue to start new prescriptions, this business is well-positioned to support -- and support the access and adherence to those medications. and we will continue to invest from that. We are seeing returns on some of the investments we highlighted for you in previous calls and things like AMP. And then we are components of this business that we haven't talked much about, like 3PL and we saw strong 3PL growth in the quarter. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks for taking my call. So, I was wondering -- it looks like in the slide presentation, the non COVID pharma growth estimate is slightly lower. It's now 3% to 6% versus 5% to 8% at the end of Q1. Can you just walk us through what the delta -- what's changed there? I know part of it is probably labor but it doesn't explain it all. And then maybe do the same for med-surg, which is also now higher than what you saw or expected at the end of Q1. Brian Tyler : Yes, thanks for that question Kevin. Let me just maybe point out a couple of things. First of all, we're pleased with the continued performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, the momentum there is really good. There\u2019re a couple things that we called out for you or I called out for you in my opening comments. First of all, the investments that we're continuing to make in our oncology business and Ontada, called that out as a $0.20 headwind year-over-year. And then, as I also talked about and you referenced, the labor investments that we're -- that we made into our business, our U.S. distribution businesses, those two things really had an impact on the growth of U.S. Pharma.  And in our Medical business, we're really pleased with not only the performance against the U.S. government program, and the increase in COVID test kitting, which is really reflective of the strength of our Lab Solutions business. But we're pleased with the performance of our Primary Care business and the core business underneath our Medical business, in addition to labor investment that I called out.  So, both businesses continue to have good momentum. In the case of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, continuing to invest in oncology, as well as the labor investment in our medical business. And really continuing to leverage the strength of the Lab business, and the investments we made there. And we're seeing good performance in our Primary Care business. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next. Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. A question on the brand marketplace or maybe brand pricing in particular. I think you've made it pretty clear that the book is no longer tied in a material way to brand price increases. Given the reimbursement and policy debate going on, can you remind us what your view is of what could happen if we saw a change in list prices, particularly a downward change, and how you may or may not be exposed to that? Britt Vitalone : Thanks for your question, Eric. Maybe I'll start and take the first part of that question and Brian can maybe respond to the policy piece. You're right. We've continued to evolve our business over really the last several years in terms of tying the services that we provide to our customers and for our manufacturers to the pricing and the agreements that we have. And it is less -- the brand inflation is less impactful than it has been in the past. We've talked about that a lot over the last few years. As it relates to really the policy piece, Brian, I'll maybe let you talk about that. Brian Tyler : Yeah. Just to build on that comment before we move on, I think 1 of the tenants we've always held through multiple changes in dynamics in the industry over my career here is our services provide real value. And regardless of how, what sorts of mechanisms get changed in the marketplace, we will continue to be paid fair market value for those services.  As it relates to the public policy debate and it's as dynamic now as ever, I suppose, I think the main issues that we're discussing are issues that frankly have been long discussed. We are active at the Company with elected officials on both sides of the aisle on key policy priorities. We track these discussions very carefully. We're always advocating for the role of care being provided in the community. We obviously have very strong presence in the community channels, but we believe that fundamentally that's where you get the best access, the best care, and equally good quality. We have been at the forefront in many of the experiments, I suppose you could call them.  Think about USAN and our value-based care. We've had robust participation in the oncology care models that's delivered substantial benefit to CMS. So, I think the mix is -- it's really -- it's not exactly clear where this will go. I think we have a lot of assets. We're engaged in the discussion. We'll find a way to navigate through them as they unfold. I mean right now, I think these are issues have been long discussed and well-discussed. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take a -- from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations. I just have one question. Britt, as we think about the investments in labor that you called out, it sounds like it's a back-half thing. Is it a bonus structure or is it the reset in the wage rates that we should be thinking about as we start thinking about our models for fiscal '23? Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian.Yeah, we're just going to guide to date Fiscal 2022. We thought that this was an investment that was important for our frontline associates, for our delivery drivers in others, to get us through 2022 with continuity. We're not guiding anything beyond that. So, I think you'd just take this as an important investment to make sure that our customers have the continued service that they would expect them to constitute a holiday season in the back half of the year. Operator : Thank you. We'll move on to our next question with George Chao, Deutsche Bank. George Chao : Good afternoon, guys and thanks for taking the call. I guess -- Brian, I would ask you or Britt. I know that you guys have said a bit on the record in the past, just talking about not wanting to enter any big new businesses, but as you continue to retrench your way from Europe with a focus towards the U.S, I guess, is there any rethinking of the capital deployment priorities or an appetite for maybe bigger transactions? Brian Tyler : Well, I would start by saying that I don't think our overall capital deployment strategy has changed. We take a balanced approach to capital deployment. We want to prioritize strategic growth. We think we've got a really clearly defined strategy. We've laid out what we consider our strategic growth areas. And assuming the alignment to those strategies and assuming they meet our disciplined financial review process and are -- create value for our shareholders, we would love to be deploying capital against those strategies.  We obviously always balance that against returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and our modestly growing dividend. But we think we've really identified -- we had a set of differentiated assets in good markets focused in North America that when we execute against, we'll deliver as the long-term growth that we're looking for. So, it's strategic alignment, financial discipline. That's really what drives capital deployment. Britt Vitalone : And I think what you're seeing your by our actions is a focus on return on invested capital, really making sure that the -- where we allocate capital, it finds the highest returns in the Company and our actions thus far that you've heard us talk about the last couple of quarters have been focused on investing and moving capital away from lower returning assets to higher returning assets, and Brian's point are right on strategy. Operator : Thank you. Brian Tyler : Next question. Operator : From Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. So, within the med-surg segment, clearly a lot of variables driving the strong profit growth there. On Slide 10, you mentioned the increased primary care business as one of those drivers. Are you able to comment just on the current level of patient volumes in the quarter, either as a percent of the pre-COVID baseline, either for your customer base or just your assessment of the overall U.S. marketplace for physician patient visits? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Yeah. I mean, I will start and Britt can add some comments if he'd like. Obviously, we think about patient visits, we think about elective procedures, you think about Primary Care versus specialty. I would say generally we have been pleased with the market recovery. It's recovering in line with how we expected it to at the outset of the year.  It is -- we think it's continuing to strengthen, but is -- we'll reach in the second half of our year what we call -- I guess people call pre - COVID levels. So, we think we're more or less right in line with our expectations, and we're really pleased with the performance of the Medical-Surgical business. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator : Well comes from Rivka Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Rivka Goldwasser : Yes, hi. Good evening Brian Tyler : Hi, Rivka. Rivka Goldwasser : Hi there. So, a quick flop on your last comment, you said pre - COVID levels, second half of your Fiscal year for the med-surg business, how should we think about when do we get to pre - COVID levels for the drug distribution? It sounded like specialty is already there, but how should we think about the segment in its entirety in core? So that was the follow up question. And then you're hosting the Analyst Day in December, so maybe you can you give us a sense of granularity around what should we expect from the day -- next month? Brian Tyler : You want to start with Pharma and I'll take the -- Britt Vitalone : Yes. I think similar to Medical, we are pleased with the performance of volumes, they are approaching pre-COVID levels in pharmaceutical prescription volumes as we expected. So, I think as we look to the rest of the year, we expect that these prescription volumes will get back to what we guided originally in May, which is in line with those pre-COVID levels.  So, we're continuing to see improved performance and improved volumes across all -- both brands, specialty and as well as generics. We expect that that will continue in the second half year. Brian Tyler : Britt, as it relates to Investor Day, we are really excited to be able to have an Investor Day. We're going to host it December 8th in New York City. Probably would've done it sooner, but it's been quite a crazy environment for the last 18 or 20 months. In terms of -- well, what we hope to see is we really want to bring some more members of the management team, the executive team that have been leading the results that we've had a great chance to review with you.  The team that's been responsible for developing these strategies, we want to provide just a little bit more insight and granularity into each of our growth strategy, and some of our core distribution businesses. And we plan to begin to outline our long-term growth prospects. So, we think it's going to be a great day. We hope you can all join us. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We have one final question from Jailendra Singh, Credit Suisse. Jailendra Singh : Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just wanted to make sure I understand what is in and what is not in the guidance respect to vaccine benefit. It seems you're not including the benefit from vaccines designated for kids or boosters short. Is that true on both vaccine distribution benefit and the benefits related to the kitting, storage and ancillary supplies as well? Just trying to understand if you see a reasonable adoption of boosters and vaccine among kids, will that drive incremental revenue in both bottom-line and med-surg? Brian Tyler : So, your first part of the question I think answers your question. We are not including -- we have provided guidance based on what the CDC has provided to us. And at this point, that does not include boosters and pediatric vaccines. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions. Brian Tyler : Okay. Well, thank you, Sarah. And thank you, everyone for the great questions and for joining our call. I want to conclude my remarks today by just underscoring that we're hosting an and Investor Day on December eighth, and we hope everyone will get a chance to join us and tune in, we're going to have our leadership team there.  The team that's been responsible for building the momentum and the business, and executing the strategies that have been put in place. We will spend some quality time on our oncology and biopharma strategic growth pillars.  I think it's going to be a great day. We're really excited to be with everyone and see you. I also don't want to let this call lapse without thanking the McKesson team for their incredible work and their dedication as we round out the first half of our fiscal year.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you, Keith. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer, and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including reconciliation of these measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Rachel and thank everyone for joining us on our call today. Today we reported third quarter fiscal 2022 results, another quarter with double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all four segments, reflecting strength in the fundamentals across our businesses. Our focus and execution against our company priorities positions us consistently generate strong financial results despite fluidity we continue to see in the macro economic environment. Before I discuss the business performance, I would like to just quickly remind everyone of our company priorities we have been sharing with you our strategic transformation to a diversified healthcare services company centered around a set of four enterprise priorities. We believe that execution against these priorities is critical to our ability to generate long-term sustainable growth and we want to reiterate our focus and commitment to each one of them. Our first priority is our people, our teams and our culture. Through our diversified portfolio of assets and operations, we as a company touch and impact many aspects of health in the healthcare system, including patients embedded in our daily operations is our purpose, advancing health outcomes for all and our mission of building an impact driven organization. We've been focused on enabling change in three areas, improving access to healthcare, advancing health equity, and protecting our environment. In the past year, our employees came together and shared countless moments of impact, finding new ways to get involved and to contribute. In 2021 alone, we completed more than 26,500 volunteer hours and supported nearly 1,500 charities. I couldn't be more proud of what we've achieved so far. And I'm confident in our ability to build a brighter future that in fact, offers greater health outcomes for all. Part of our focus on culture is our continued improvement in diversity and inclusion. We put a particular focus on hiring, developing and promoting what we call a best talent strategy at McKesson. Recently, we were recognized as one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality, the ninth year in a row we've received this honor. Our commitment to diversity and refreshment includes our board of directors. In January, we welcome James Hinton and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson as new independent directors to our board of directors. Both James and Kathleen have served in multiple senior leadership roles within the healthcare industry. Currently, Jim serves as an operating partner for the private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and prior to that, he held the role of Chief Executive Officer at Baylor Scott & White Health. And Kathleen, most recently held the role of Executive Vice President and Global Chief Human Resource Officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance, where she led the Human Capital Strategy including merger integration and HR transformation through digitization. Their decades of healthcare experience and proven record leading complicated organizations and executive leadership roles will be instrumental to McKesson, and we are excited to welcome them to our board. Additionally, we announced today that Don Knauss has been elected as the next Independent Chairman of our Board, which will go into effect on April 1, following a plan transition led by our current Independent Chair Edward Miller. I want to thank Ed for his years of steady leadership and invaluable contributions as the Independent Chair to McKesson's board of directors. And I also want to welcome Don to his new role. He brings deep leadership expertise and shares McKesson's values, culture, strategy, and vision including his commitment to board diversity, we look forward to his leadership and stewardship. Our next priority is to drive sustainable growth in our core pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses. We have a vast scale distribution network and deep expertise in global supply chain management, which have been a critical and foundational part of our long history. We're proud of our operational excellence and our ability to capture efficiency and deliver consistent and high quality service to our customers while optimizing operating margin. Building off of this core capability, we've been very successful and expanding into new product categories and new adjacent markets like our lab solutions and our government partnership strategies. Our scaled assets and capabilities also enable us to play an integral role in the response to the COVID 19 pandemic. We're proud to serve as a centralized distributor of vaccines and ancillary supplies for the U.S. government. We've also been working closely with our partners, suppliers and manufacturers to navigate the complex supply chain system. These relationships have allowed us to continue to provide stability of supply and low costs for our customers. And as a result, we've been able to manage through some of the challenges that the market has been seeing. Our third priority is to streamline the business, which includes initiatives like the split-off of change healthcare and our strategic intent to fully exit the European region. We recently announced the sale of our Austrian business which was completed on January 31 and we have agreements to sell 10 of the 12 countries where we operate. As a reminder, Norway and Denmark remain the only countries that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. We continue to work towards the closing of the other pending divestitures. These transactions are the result of our intentional effort to evaluate and assess our portfolio for strategic alignment. We believe that by fully exiting the Europe region, we'll be able to better focus our human and financial capital into higher growth and higher margin areas, which leads me naturally to our next company priority. The last company priority is our strategic growth pillars, oncology and biopharma services. Over the past few years, we set out to accelerate the growth in these two areas, and build out what we refer to as ecosystems. As we shared in our Investor Day in December, these are both large and growing markets that have significant unmet needs and opportunities and we are tackling some of the most complex problems in the healthcare system with the goal to bring efficiency and benefits to all stakeholders across these ecosystems. In the oncology ecosystem, our growth strategy is centered around our support for the large growing and diversified U.S. oncology network. With the reach of over 1,400 physicians, the U.S. oncology network treats 15% of all new cancer patients in the U.S. at one of its 500 sites of service. One of the U.S. oncology networks important initiatives is its participation in the oncology care model, which is a five year experimental payment model with the goal of bringing down the cost of cancer. Based on the latest results, the U.S. oncology network practices participating in the program, achieved high marks on quality metrics and provided significant cost savings to Medicare. By representing approximately one-fourth of all providers participating in the program, the U.S. oncology network demonstrated its leadership role in transitioning healthcare to a more value based approach. Building upon our deep reach in the Community Oncology space, we're creating an oncology ecosystem with multifaceted service offerings that are all interconnected. At the center of this connectivity is Ontada, oncology, technology and insights business dedicated to help advanced cancer research and advanced patient care. We recently highlighted this business at our Investor Day. Since its launch in December of 2020, the team has made great progress transforming ideas into reality. Ontada signed two agreements with strategic partners to improve patient outcome and quality of patient care and it was instrumental in the launch of The MYLUNG consortium which through real world research and study provides critical information to improve the patient's journey. Within our biopharma ecosystem, we build a set of differentiated assets and capabilities, including businesses like RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads. They're combined under the prescription solutions business with a shared goal to improve access, adherence and affordability of medicines. One of the key customers of our business is biopharma companies, through our scale and interconnected technology network, we provide biopharma a range of commercialization services and by automating and simplifying the process of prior authorization, we reduce prescription abandonment and provide biopharma access to new patients. Our unique technology capabilities also generate insights into patients needs and challenges enabling greater ability to impact patient actions and get better outcomes. We support over 650 brands today covering 94% of the therapeutic areas and we're connected to all the major insurance companies and most of the regional payers in the United States. The reach of our network is deep and broad, which is why it's the foundation of our biopharma ecosystem and we are incredibly excited about the market opportunities it brings. Our progress with each of the company priorities has been truly outstanding and we see the strategies working. The strong conviction in these priorities will be our NorthStar as we seek to advance and win in the marketplaces as a diversified healthcare service company and to drive long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Now, before I turn to our third quarter results, I want to provide a brief update on the progress made towards a broad resolution of governmental opioid related claims. To date, 46 states, all five U.S. territories and Washington DC have joined the proposed settlement to sign on period for political subdivisions in participating states to join the previously announced Proposed Opioid Settlement Agreement founded on January 26. We have now entered into the evaluation period. The deadline for our decision is February 25 2022. We continue to work with all parties to bring meaningful relief to effective communities and towards resolutions which will allow us to further focus on the strategic priorities of our business. Now, let me get to the results. We're pleased to report a strong third quarter with total company revenues of $68.6 billion and an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $6.15 ahead of our expectations. As a result of our performance in the underlying business and the contribution from COVID-19 related items, we're raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to $23.55 to $23.95. This is from the previous range of $22.35 to $22.95. The third quarter was another example of the nonlinear nature of the recovery from the pandemic. At the beginning of the quarter, volume and utilization trends were recovering as COVID 19 cases continue to decline across the country. Although we expected a nonlinear recovery trend, emergence in the spread of the Omicron variant in December was unexpected. Since then, we've been closely monitoring its impact. One thing we've learned in the past two years is the resilience of our business and our communities. Regardless of the trajectory of the pandemic, we're confident about our ability to adjust and adapt to support our customers and their patients in these challenging times. Let's turn to the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. U.S. Pharmaceutical segment saw 12% adjusted operating profit growth, which was underpinned by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and increased specialty volume. Through the third quarter and into January, branded pharmaceutical pricing is tracked in line with our original expectations, and consistent with our experience over the past several years. For generics we continue to benefit from the success and strength of our sourcing operation with ClarusONE. We have not only the scale, but the procurement expertise to consistently source products at low cost while protecting the integrity and the safety of the supply chain. We are also proud of our role in supporting the U.S. government's pandemic response effort as the vaccine and booster recommendations for various age groups continues to expand and evolve. Through January 31, our U.S. pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 370 million Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to International Donation Mission. In January, U.S. government extended the existing COVID-19 vaccine and distribution contract through July of 2022 which is roughly in line with the first quarter of our fiscal 2023. In prescription technology solutions, the segment had excellent momentum and delivered an 11% increase to segment adjusted operating profit in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we offer a range of commercial services primarily to biopharma companies. And this quarter the growth was led by third-party logistics services and our access adherence and affordability solutions, including our access for more patients product. This segment aligns with our focus on developing the biopharma services ecosystem. The market that we're focused on presents many exciting opportunities, and we estimate the total addressable market to be around $15 billion with good growth potential and an attractive margin profile. We are pleased with the financial performance and expect to continue to drive, while growing the business. With surging demand and a complex supply chain our new products playing an important role in the fight against the pandemic. The dedicated team and med surge is the foundation to our business growth, and we continue to invest to ensure operational continuity and excellence. As it relates to our international segment, we continue to benefit from COVID-19 related programs and our European operations in Canada. Through December, we've distributed over 81 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across our international geographies. As we look forward to fiscal 2023, I'm most excited about the progress on the four company priorities. Since the rollout of these multi-year strategic initiatives in our fiscal 2019, we've been very focused on execution, making impact and delivering results. While the pandemic continues to present unknowns, what is certain is that fiscal 2023 will be another year in which we focus on strong execution on strategic advancement. Our continued progress towards these four priorities will be a key driver to our sustainable profit growth, strong cash flow, and shareholder value creation. We continue to focus on the things that matter most to our customers, to our patients, to our employees, and to our shareholders. In closing, we continue to be excited about our future growth prospects as we meet the opportunity as a diversified healthcare services company. We have unique and differentiated assets in oncology and biopharma services with unmatched scale and connectivity. And we're strategically positioned to win in these growing markets. And lastly, before I conclude, I want to take a moment to thank our dedicated team, including every one of a 76,000 employees that make up team McKesson. We share a mission to improve healthcare in every setting. And that will be achieved only with the dedication and the commitment from our people. And for the opportunity to work alongside this amazing team. I continue to be humbled and deeply grateful. Thank you for your time this afternoon. Britt, I'll pass it to you. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss our fiscal third quarter results, which reflects another quarter of strong performance across the business driven by operational execution against our growth strategies. In the third quarter, we delivered overall growth compared to the prior year results across each of our segments including growth over the prior year on excluding COVID-19 related programs. Let me start with an update on Europe. We remain committed to fully exit the European region and the progress of our exit activities are on track. Today we announced the transactions to sell our Austrian business to Quadrifolia Management and the sale of McKesson remaining share of our German joint ventures to Walgreens Boots Alliance closed on January 31 of '22. The assets involved in the Austrian transaction contributed approximately $1.5 billion in revenues and $50 million in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2021. The earnings related to our German joint venture were immaterial. Next pursued to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. We anticipate the pending divestiture to sell McKesson's U.K. retail and distribution businesses will close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. And the transaction to sell certain European assets to the PHOENIX Group will close in the first half of fiscal 2023. The net assets included in these transactions are classified as held for sale. Our fiscal 2022 guidance includes approximately $0.49 of adjusted earnings per diluted share accretion related to these pending transactions, which is recorded within our international segment. This $0.49 of accretion resulting from the held for sale accounting will conclude once each transaction is closed. For fiscal 2023, we currently anticipate approximately $0.10 of adjusted earnings per diluted share of accretion related to the held for sale accounting based on the current estimated close date for the PHOENIX Group transaction. Norway and Denmark remain the only countries that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. As previously discussed, we anticipate we'll deploy capital to offset dilution resulting from all European divestitures principally through share repurchases. Before I provide more details on our third quarter adjusted results, I want to point out one additional item that impacted our GAAP only results in the quarter. We recorded a gap only after-tax charge of $829 million related to the sale of retail and distribution businesses in the U.K. to account for the remeasurement of the net assets to the lower carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. These charges were largely driven by declines in the British pound sterling. Moving now to our adjusted results for the third quarter. Beginning with our consolidated results which can be found on Slide 7. As discussed in our Investor Day event in December, we manage the business for the long-term and our financial and strategic framework is focused on shareholder value creation. Our financial framework combined three key elements to generate sustainable adjusted EPS growth, organic growth, operating leverage and capital allocation. This framework is once again demonstrated by our strong third quarter fiscal 2022 results. Additionally, our leadership supporting the U.S. governments COVID-19 domestic and international vaccine and kitting efforts continues to contribute to growth and the momentum we have built across the business. Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.15, an increase of 34% compared to the prior year. This result was driven by strong operational performance across the segments. COVID-19 related items, which include the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting and storage programs of the U.S. government. COVID-19 tests in fiscal 2021 impairments of personal protective equipment and related products, and a lower share count. Consolidated revenues of $68.6 billion increased 10% above the prior year, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment largely due to higher volumes from our retail national account customers. And branded pharmaceutical price increases, which were in line with our initial guidance, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted gross profit was $3.4 billion for the quarter and increase of 8% compared to the prior year, which benefited from the increased contribution from our strong operational performance and previously mentioned COVID-19 programs and related items. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 1% year-over-year, excluding the impact of held for sale accounting and announced divestitures in the international segment adjusted operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit was $1.3 billion for the quarter an increase of 19% compared to the prior year led by strong operational performance across the segments. Moving below the line, interest expense was $41 million in the quarter and improvement of 25% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate was 19.6% for the quarter. And wrapping up our consolidated results, third quarter diluted weighted average shares were $153.5 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Moving now to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 8 through 13. Starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $55 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, driven by higher volumes from our retail national account customers and branded pharmaceutical price increases partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit increased 12% to $735 million driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and growth in the distribution of specialty products to hospitals and community conditions. The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government, with the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines provided a benefit of approximately $0.26 per share in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. In the prescription technology solution segment, revenues were $1 billion an increase of 33% higher volume growth related to biopharma services, including third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes. Adjusted operating profit increased a 11% to a $145 million driven by growth from access inherent solutions. We continue to experience growth across our broad spectrum, higher margin capabilities and offerings in this segment. We're pleased with the increased transaction volumes related to our access inherent solutions, and the increasing number of brands that joined our platforms this year. We also experienced increased volumes in our logistics and hub services, due to the continued recovery of prescription volumes. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 1% driven by growth in the primary care business, and the contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines, partially offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 tests in our primary care and extended care businesses as compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating profit increased 18% to $330 million driven by the contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. governments COVID-19 vaccine program, the prior year impact of an inventory of impairment charge related to PPE that incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and growth in the primary care business. The contribution from our contract with U.S. government related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines provided a benefit of approximately $0.31 per share in the quarter, which was above our original expectations. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues in the quarter were $9.5 billion, an increase of 2% driven by new customer growth in our Canadian business, and volume increases in the pharmaceutical distribution and retail businesses across the segment, which were partially offset by the contribution of McKesson's German wholesale business through joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 41% to $223 million, driven by the reduction as compared to the prior year of depreciation and amortization. Uncertain European assets classified as held for sale, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and tests in Europe and strong distribution results in our Canadian business. The held for sale accounting in the international segment contributed $0.18 to adjusted earnings in the quarter. Moving on to corporate, adjusted corporate expenses were $159 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year. We incurred opioid related litigation expenses of $33 million for the third quarter. We anticipate that fiscal 2022 opioid related litigation expenses will be approximately $135 million. Let me now turn to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.8 billion. For the first nine months of the fiscal year we generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion. Here to-date it made $380 million of capital expenditures, which included investments to support our strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, we returned $2.2 billion of cash to our shareholders, which included $2 billion of share repurchases and the payment of $206 million in dividends. At our Investor Day event in December, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase program. At the end of our third quarter $4.8 billion remains on our share repurchase authorization. With this increased authorization, the completed sales of the Austrian business and remaining share in the German joint venture and the anticipated fiscal fourth quarter closure the sale of the U.K. business, we anticipate executing share repurchases of up to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. As a result, we now anticipate returning approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases in fiscal 2022. Our strong operating performance combined with our return of capital to shareholders, reinforces our commitment to driving the shareholder value. Let me transition and speak to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. A full list of our fiscal 2022 assumptions can be found in Slide 16 through 18. We continue to anticipate a full recovery of prescription volumes. However, the persistence of COVID-19 and its variants such as Omicron, is leading to a non-linear trajectory. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we anticipate revenue to increase 8% to 11% and adjusted operating profit to deliver 8% to 10% growth over the prior year. We continue to see stable fundamentals in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Specifically, our outlook for branded pharmaceutical pricing of mid single digits increases in fiscal 2022 remains consistent with both our original guidance and prior-year. In our view of the generics environment remains competitive yet stable. Our guidance remains aligned to the volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and U.S. government, and includes the contribution related to our role as a centralized distributor for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution program. We will continue to update you in the progress and contribution from this program. When excluding COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment, we anticipate approximately 3% to 6% adjusted operating profit growth. And as a reminder, our investments in our leading and differentiated position in oncology will continue to represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 32% to 36%, and adjusted operating profit growth of 24% to 28%. This growth reflects the strong momentum in the business, as we project increased volumes across new and existing biopharma solutions and customers. Transitioning to medical surgical, our outlook assumes 15% to 19% revenue growth, and adjusted operating profit growth of 51% to 55% over the prior-year. Our outlook includes $0.85 to $1.05 related to the contribution from the U.S. government's distribution of ancillary supply kits, and storage programs and $0.75 to $0.95 related to the net impact of COVID-19 tests, and PPE impairments and related products. When excluding the impacts of these items in the segment, we anticipate 22% to 26% growth over the prior-year. One additional reminder related to our U.S. distribution businesses. On our earnings call in November, we discussed the highly competitive labor market, which continues to persist. We also outlined an assumption for modest labor related expense impact to ensure support of our talent strategy and continued service continuity through the second half of our fiscal year. Based on labor market trends experienced in the third quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to anticipate approximately $0.10 to $0.20 of adjusted operating expense impact in our U.S. distribution businesses in the second half of the year, weighted slightly higher in our Medical segment. Finally, in the International segment, our revenue guidance 2% decline to 1% growth as compared to the prior-year. And as a reminder, this reflects the impact from the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. For adjusted operating profit, our guidance reflects growth in the segment of 43% to 47%. This includes approximately $0.49 of adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022 resulting from held for sale accounting related to our agreement to sell certain European assets. Turning now to the consolidated view. Our increased guidance assumes 8% to 11% revenue growth and 24% to 27% adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. Our full-year adjustment effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged and we anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $570 million to $620 million an improvement from the previous range of $610 million to $660 million related to our focus on operating leverage, which we highlighted at our recent Investor Day event. Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong free cash flows and returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support sustainable long-term growth. This strong free cash flow generation provides financial flexibility to execute a balanced capital allocation approach including investing in our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services, while remaining committed to returning capital to shareholders through our growing dividends and share repurchases. Our investment grade credit rating remains a priority and it underpins our financial flexibility. For fiscal 2022, we continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, historically, we generate a larger portion of our cash flows in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Our working capital metrics and resulting cash flows vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, which could include the timing of planned European divestiture activity. We also now anticipate diluted weighted shares outstanding to range from 154 million to 155 million for fiscal 2022. This includes the impact of the anticipated 1.5 billion of fourth quarter share repurchases mentioned earlier. As a result of our strong year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are raising and narrowing our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $23.55 to $23.95, which is above our previous range of $22.35 to $22.95. Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 37% to 39% growth compared to the prior-year. Fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance also includes $2.99 to $3.59 of contribution attributable to the following items, $0.90 to $1.10, related to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, $0.85 to $1.05 related to the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, $0.75 to $0.95 related to COVID-19 tests in the fiscal 2021 impairments for PPE and related products, which is an increase from the previous range of $0.50 to $0.75, and approximately $0.49 from gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures Equity Investments which are within our corporate segment. Excluding the impacts of these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 27% to 33% forecast growth over the prior-year. When you pull it all together, our strong performance in our outlook equates to an adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance increase of $1.10 compared to our previous fiscal 2022 outlook provided at Investor Day, the $1.10 adjusted earnings per diluted share increase includes the following. Approximately $0.45 driven by strong underlying business performance and operating leverage, approximately $0.22 related to COVID-19 tests, approximately $0.22 related to held for sale accounting and reduced opioid litigation expenses, and approximately $0.20 related to NCI interest expense and lower weighted average shares outstanding. Let me spend just a minute providing some initial thoughts on fiscal 2023. I want to point out that we are not providing fiscal 2023 guidance at this time. However, I thought it would be instructive to walk you through some of the items that could impact fiscal 2023 as we sit here today. First, the COVID 19 pandemic continues to present many unknowns, we continue to expect to full recovery. However, it is likely to continue to be non-linear into fiscal 2023 and it could impact a quarterly cadence. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical Surgical Solution segments, our contracts with the U.S. government to serve as the centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and to assist with the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies are scheduled to expire in July of 2022. Outside of the contract with U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution, we anticipate normal customer renewal activity in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. As it relates to COVID-19 tests, we continue to anticipate the demand will be closely associated with a rate of COVID case levels and the impact from this will moderate from prior-year levels. For the International segment, we anticipate $0.10 of adjusted earnings per diluted share accretion in the first half of fiscal 2023 related to the held for sale accounting based on the current estimated closed date for the Phoenix Group transaction. We will no longer record revenue adjusted operating profit or held for sale accounting benefits related to these transactions once the transactions close. We anticipate that opioid litigation expenses will remain relatively in line with our fiscal 2022 guidance, until we have a completed assessment of government entity participation in the proposed settlement and a final determination regarding that settlement. We will continue to update you on the outcome of that determination and remaining opioid litigation expenses. We anticipate further investment to support the growth of our two key strategies of oncology and biopharma services. Overall, we continue to see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business heading into fiscal 2023 and we remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. We'll share more details with you about our fiscal 2023 outlook at our fourth quarter earnings call in May. In closing, we are pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter and we have a strong financial outlook. McKesson continues to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework. We continue to focus on the things that matter most to our customers, patients and shareholders as a diversified healthcare services company. I want to thank you and thank all of our employees for all their hard work and dedication. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you and appreciate the commentary on fiscal year '23. At this point, one thing I want to zero in on relative to the EU. So you'll remove most of the factors $0.10 of benefit continuing to flow through. As you speak to offsetting with repurchase, is that part of what the repo that you suggested for Q4 is getting in front of and do you expect your - how will you judge that? Will you judge it over the full fiscal year given that the timing is still variable? Brian Tyler : Thanks, Eric for that question. As I talked about in my remarks, we do anticipate that the Austrian transaction, the German transaction, which have already closed, we anticipate that the U.K. transaction will also close in the fourth quarter. So consistent with our comments, we do intend to offset the dilution. And that is one of the reasons why we intended to do some fourth quarter share repurchases, we will continue to apply the principles of our share repurchase activity and certainly we'll look at cash that is in excess of what we need to operate the business as well as other opportunities that we have to deploy that capital, whether that be additional share repurchases for our shareholders, or if we have M&A transactions. So certainly we told you, we would offset the dilution. We're closing transactions now and anticipate more in the fourth quarter. And so that was one of the reasons why we wanted to begin the share repurchase activity, in addition to being very consistent with our share repurchase principles. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And our next will be from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good afternoon, and thanks for all the detail. Britt, I just want to go back and talk about inflation. You talked a little bit about labor. And I know you and Brian talked last quarter about some special bonuses and increasing wages. But how do we think about wages going forward as we continue to have wage inflation would be my first part of the inflation question. And then secondly, as we think about product inflation, or transportation, I know generally speaking, it's a passthrough on the pharmaceutical side of things. But how do we think about any PPE on your medical side of your business? Britt Vitalone : Lisa, thanks for that question. Maybe I'll just step back for a minute and just address labor and inflation separately, and maybe I'll just start with inflation. Our business model has a normal component that's built into it that relates to pricing, you have a model like we do that's founded on both supply and service stability and consistency, that solves problems, but in a better way for customers and patients, we are able to incorporate some of these higher input costs, through pricing. Our organization, as Brian has talked about continues to do really a tremendous job in productivity efforts. And those productivity efforts enable us to offset some of this cost. And then of course, there is a pricing component. Just finally, we have an organization of really smart people that are continuously working to find better solutions, greater efficiencies, in leveraging the scale and broad expertise that we have to provide quality and reliability that our customers have come to expect from McKesson. So that's maybe just answering some of the questions on the inflation front. In the labor front, Brian's talked about talent being one of our key components of our strategy, and will remain that and of course, this is a very challenging market. We're seeing pressures in the labor market. And so we've talked about the fact that we expect some of these labor pressures to find their way into operating expenses in the second half of the year $0.10 to $0.20. We've not guided beyond FY '22, we'll obviously assess if we think that those costs are going to be sustained in any way at this point, we just see a $0.10 to $0.20 impact in our U.S. distribution businesses in the second half, what we've seen so far in the third quarter, it's tracking right in line with that. Brian Tyler : We will stay on top of the market, we'll be responsive to it, we got a lot of confidence in our team's ability to adjust. And we actually think we've got an asset in terms of the company culture, our purpose, our mission, the investments we make in our teams, we think this is a great place to work and we'll continue to find ways to attract the best talent. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, hey, thanks for taking the question. Britt, you talked earlier in your prepared comments about in the Pharma Technology Solutions segment about access to medications. And you highlight a couple of businesses, you mentioned a $15 billion market opportunity here. Maybe if you can just give us a little more details around sort of your position in the market, in this part of the market particularly and what is the competitive landscape? And do you see an opportunity here for McKesson to consolidate in this industry? Brian Tyler : Thank you for the question. I think you addressed it to Britt, but I'll jump in and start with my thoughts. I mean, so this we think we're extremely well positioned in this marketplace. And one of the things when we're anchoring our growth strategies, we try to anchor around is making sure we have differentiation that we have things that are difficult to replicate. And the reason we brought these businesses together as a segment is because we think individually, they all had their strengths and we're winning in their market, but collectively together accessing the reach of our networks, utilizing the advanced technologies, we have in CoverMyMeds and then the clinical expertise and the biopharma relationships, we had in RxCrossroads, they kind of reinforce and compound each other. And so we think about the access as distinct market, adherence is a distinct market, outcomes is a distinct market, but by putting these together, it allows us to really more effectively compete across all of those some of that is reinventing a better solution for a market that exists. That's sort of what we did with AMP, we brought in infusion of technology to really redesign and greatly enhance the value we deliver to manufacturers, giving us what we think is a significant competitive advantage. We'll continue to do those kinds of innovations as we grow into it. I mean, it is a pretty fragmented landscape. There are some competitors names you know, there's frankly lots of little ones. This is an area that we would like to use the strength of our balance sheet to be acquisitive, to be additive to that ecosystem through additional capability or additional scale. As long as we find that strategically aligned asset and it can meet our financial hurdles and stand up well to other means, we have to deploy capital, we'll certainly look to execute on that. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And the next one will be from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jailendra Singh : Thank you, and hello, everyone. So we just go to $0.45 core business outperformance, you called out which is now captured in your fiscal '22 outlook. How do you think about the sustainability of some of those drivers behind that outperformance and related to that how should we think about the fiscal '22 baseline EPS of $17.50 to $18 you share that is today? Brian Tyler : Let me take those in two pieces. We're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance and obviously saw growth across each of our segments. So as we look at the outlook for the remainder of the year, we expected the momentum in our business is going to continue. And we haven't provided any guidance as it relates to FY '23 but in our Investor Day, we did provide long-term targets where we suggested and felt very confident that we'll continue to see growth in each of those segments for the long-term. So we feel very good about the performance that we're seeing in our business and consistent with our Investor Day, we expect that to continue. So I think that is really the point that you should see just continued strong performance for several years now across all of our segments with the fundamentals of our businesses are strong, we're investing in these businesses for future growth. And we're in markets that we think are going to continue to grow and we're in very good positions to take advantage of that with some differentiated capabilities. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good afternoon, and thanks for the color so far. I want to talk a little bit about the U.S. pharma segment. As you think about into next year and thinking more qualitatively as much as anything else. But how do you think about outside of the COVID related script and volume recovery, the other moving pieces. You did comment on a normalized renewal year? So are there any things you're seeing there big renewals, and how you think about the areas of growth that have remain steady, maybe within specialty and the potential for biosimilars? And how that should factor into that long-term growth trajectory and where that falls relative to '23 broadly? Britt Vitalone : Mike, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll let Brian jump in here. Again, I - as we think about it, and some of the things that I mentioned here. We do expect a full recovery of prescription transaction volumes. And we're certainly pleased that transaction volumes have continued to increase throughout the year, it has not been in a straight line. But we do expect that full recovery to continue. We're very well positioned in the specialty clinic space, as well as on oncology, making investments in those areas that we think are going to continue to pay off over the long-term. And biosimilars is one of those areas that given our position, particularly in oncology. We believe that it's going to be a growth driver for us over the long-term. We're pleased with the development of biosimilars to this point, we think that they offer a better returns than branded and specialty products, not at the same level as generics from a margin perspective. But still, were we believe and were optimistic that they're going to continue to add value to the segment over time. So the position that we have, the strength that we have across segments, but particularly our differentiated capabilities in oncology. Your positions is very well for further growth. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats to the quarter. I guess Britt my question is the medical segment, operating income rates was pretty significant. Even if you backed out, COVID? Can you just dissect for us that outperformance and how should we be thinking about the sustainability of earnings in that segment past 2022? Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question, Brian. Maybe I'll just start just to remind you, since fiscal '19, this business has grown at 10% from an adjusted operating profit perspective. On the core basis outside of COVID programs. So we've seen strong growth in this business now for a number of years. It's one of our higher margin segments. We have very strong positions across the primary care segment of the business. And across all alternate sites, your extended care business has grown nicely over time as well. We've added a lot of capabilities and investment over time, whether that be acquisitions to position us well in lab. We've seen private brand be an important component. And we've seen growth in Rx as well. So we've got a lot of capabilities across the entire alternate site. We've invested in these capabilities over time. It's positioned us well, not only from a core perspective, but certainly now as COVID has taken on. We've been in really good position to handle the kitting and the storage programs as well. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Rick, excuse me, Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi, good evening, and thanks for the very comprehensive details. So two follow-ups here. One, just to clarify, as you think about 2023, should we assume that all the buyback activity is going to be offsetting the dilution from the European divestitures that's first? And then secondly, as we think about the COVID impact, when we clearly did nice contribution in the last couple of years. How do you think the economics of vaccine in testing will evolve is sort of COVID becomes more of an annuity is. Should we think about it as is flu type economics? Britt Vitalone : Ricky, let me take the first one. And then I'll let Brian come on the second. Just because more mechanical question. As I mentioned in my comments, we do expect to offset any dilution from the European divestitures through capital deployment. And that could be share repurchase activity like we're doing in the fourth quarter. So just to reaffirm that we will be - we do plan on offsetting that dilution. Brian Tyler : Ricky relative to I guess it's called the future of testing. That's a little bit, I think difficult to forecast. And a lot of it will depend on the science, the development, a lot of it will depend on the current testing hold up to current and future potential variants. What will be the mix between, in a medical setting versus over the counter that those become more reliable. I think there's a lot of questions that still have to resolve themselves there. What I would say though is, regardless of how that evolves, we think McKesson is in an excellent position to capitalize on that. We are currently the largest distributor, we distribute more flu vaccine than anyone. We have a great franchise in the physician alternate site setting. We distribute to pharmacies, because of our presence in the communities in both our medical and pharmaceutical business, our relationships with the labs, and I think the real credibility we've built up over the last couple of years, I think we're extremely well positioned to capture that opportunity, however it unfolds. Rachel Rodriguez : We have time for one more question. Operator : Most certainly. And this question will come from Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good afternoon. I also have a question just around the - your comment around the normal customer renewal activity in fiscal '23. I guess I just wanted to make sure and confirm the messaging around that. So I guess first, can you remind us how customer renewal activity and any related pricing step downs trended for fiscal '22. In those, if that activity is going to be normal in '23. Is that net positive, net negative or net neutral. As you think about the how all that flows year-over-year? Hopefully that question makes sense. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thanks, Steve, that's a good question. I'm happy to answer that. And I'm happy to clarify. When I speak of normal, what I mean by that is in any year, we typically see about a third of our U.S. pharmaceutical book renewal. As we have seen over the last few years, there has been no material impacts to that. And certainly, we've been able to renew all of our customers successfully within our guidance. And I would not anticipate that we would see anything material from our - next year. It's early, obviously, if there's an update to that information will provide it on our May earnings call. But normal, what I was referring to is that about a third of our book renews every year would not anticipate anything that would be a material driver from that activity. Brian Tyler : Great. Well, thanks again, everyone for joining us on this call. And thank you for the insightful and very thoughtful questions. Keith, thank you for help facilitating the call. I wanted to just conclude by reiterating McKesson executed really well in the third quarter with double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all segments. I continue to be excited about the focus on our company priorities and the contributions we can see that making the strong financial results. It's really the driver between - the driver of our shareholder value creation. So none of that happens without the team that makes up McKesson. And so, to everyone, in McKesson, no matter what your role, no matter what geography you work in, whether you're on the frontline or elsewhere in the business. I'm so appreciate of their hard work, their dedication to our purpose and our mission. Their commitment to our customers. They really are what makes this a special place. So thanks to them. Again thank you everyone, I hope you have a terrific evening. Be safe and stay healthy. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today I\u2019m joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.  Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson\u2019s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today\u2019s earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP results, can be found in today\u2019s earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everybody. Today, we announced our fourth quarter results, marking a solid finish to our strong fiscal 2022. Thanks to the dedication and excellent execution from Team McKesson, we made outstanding progress against our company priorities and in our transformation to a diversified health care services company. We achieved 31% growth in adjusted earnings per diluted share when excluding the impacts attributable to COVID-19 related items and net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. We have good momentum across the enterprise. We saw strength in our core distribution business and our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services. We remain focused on the company priorities, which are foundational to our sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value creation. My remarks today will be centered around these themes. Before I jump into company priorities, I do want to talk briefly about the recent developments in opioid litigation. In February, we announced the approval of the proposed opioid settlement agreement. 46 of the 49 eligible states and the District of Columbia and all eligible territories joined the settlement, representing more than 98% of the eligible political subdivisions that have brought opioid related suits against us as calculated by population under the agreement. The resolution delivers much needed relief for the impacted communities. It will collectively provide thousands of communities across the United States approximately $19.5 billion over 18 years. The agreement became effective on April 2nd. The approval of the settlement agreement also removed a significant portion of operational and financial uncertainty in the business, allowing us to redirect resources for more focused execution on our company strategies. In addition to the 46 states participating in the previously announced agreement, on April 4th, an agreement was reached in the Alabama matter, in which McKesson will pay $141 million and an additional $33 million in attorney's fees and costs to resolve the opioid related claims of the State of Alabama and its subdivisions. On May 3rd, an agreement was also reached in the Washington matter, in which McKesson will pay $197 million, consistent with the State of Washington's allocation under the previously announced comprehensive settlement framework, as well as certain additional attorney fees and costs. This resolution will result in the settlement of the state of Washington and its litigating subdivisions. That will bring the total number of states settling opioid-related claims with McKesson to 48 of 49 eligible states and the District of Columbia. As a company, we remain deeply concerned about the impact the opioid epidemic is having on individuals, on families and communities across the nation, and we continue to be committed to be part of the solution. This includes our controlled substance monitoring programs, advanced customer purchasing analytics and many, many other initiatives. Let me now take you through our company priorities and the progress we made in fiscal 2022. We are excited about these initiatives, as we continue to deliver strong results and improve our strength as an organization. After our fiscal 2022 discussion, I'll walk you through each of the operating segments and lay out how they are positioned for growth, as we head into fiscal 2023. For the last several years, the enterprise has centered its strategic, its operational and financial decisions around our set of company priorities and the results have been outstanding. We fundamentally changed the trajectory of the company from declining financial performance to sustainable growth across the business. Through the focused execution of the priorities, we improved efficiency, we defined our differentiated and strong market positions, and we established the right to play and win in oncology and the biopharma services markets. Now let me briefly walk you through the progress on each of them. I'll start with our first priority, which is our focus on people and culture, our ICARE values, our enterprise-first mindset and our commitment to Team McKesson, our commitment to each other, were critical to successfully navigating the last few years. We are committed to being the best place to work in health care, and our best talent strategy is accelerating our business momentum. In fiscal 2022, we made investments in our workforce including the frontline workers through additional labor investments in the US Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments in the back half of our fiscal year. Our company culture, our purpose, our mission and the investments we've made in our teams underpin our performance as a business. Our people and culture strategy is integrated with our continued focus on ESG initiatives, ensuring we not only do good business, but we do business the right way. As an impact-driven organization, we embrace our responsibility to enable lasting changes in the communities we serve. Over the past year, we made great progress in many areas, particularly around advancing access to care, health equity and climate action for health. To promote diversity, equity and inclusion, we have set specific and measurable goals to increase representation of both women and people of color amongst our leadership ranks. We released our employment information report, including our EEO-1 data, to improve transparency and accountability and equal employment opportunities. We also launched company-wide inclusion training, fostering positive behaviors and teaching ways to address bias in the workplace. Our commitment to diversity starts with our Board as evidenced by the recent successful completion of our Board refreshment. In April, we announced the election of Roy Dunbar as the new Director of the Board. Mr. Dunbar brings decades of experience in technology, operations and health care and will be instrumental in guiding the company's strategic priorities. In addition to the appointment of Mr. Dunbar, in fiscal 2022, we elected a new independent chair of the Board and introduced three other new board members with diverse backgrounds and experience. Women and people of color now represent 50% of our Board of Directors, and we look forward to benefiting from their leadership and their stewardship. Moving to our second priority, which is driving sustainable core growth. At the core of our offering is the Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical distribution solutions. Building upon the momentum in fiscal 2022, we continue to innovate and invest in our distribution assets and capabilities. Some of the latest advancements over the past year include automated picking and packing solutions and robotics, which help us improve productivity, so we can pick more accurately, pack medications faster and ultimately serve our customers better. We're also expanding the reach of our core business by entering adjacent markets while maintaining operational excellence. A great example of this is our patient home delivery service. Leveraging our scale distribution network, we help our partners deliver medical-surgical products directly to patients' homes nationwide. With an increasing demand in virtual and home care, we've seen significant growth in this channel in the past few years. Our best-in-class customer service and deep medical-surgical products enables us to capture the market opportunity, ensuring the right product to the right patient at the right time. We also continued to partner closely with the US government in its COVID-19 response effort. It's been more than a year now since we started shipping the COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies. Through March 31, we have successfully distributed over 380 million Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites across the United States and in support of the US government's international donation mission. Although the contract with the US government to serve as a centralized distributor is expected to end in July, this experience has been a strong testimony to our vast and scaled supply chain capabilities. And I am incredibly proud of the way our employees rose to the challenges brought on by the pandemic through our focus on meeting the needs of the healthcare community. In early fiscal 2022, we announced our intent to exit the European market, which aligns with our company priority to streamline and simplify the business. Over the past 12 months, we've made significant progress as we have successfully entered into agreements to sell the operations in 10 of the 12 countries. We've completed the divestiture of the Austria and UK businesses, and our German joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, bringing all the in-process transactions to closure and exploring strategic alternatives for the remaining countries is a top priority in fiscal 2023. The actions we're taking in Europe build upon our deliberate efforts over the past years to maximize the organization's operational efficiency and focus our resources on the highest growth opportunities. The last company priority that we're excited about is the expansion of our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem. At our Investor Day in December 2021, we shared details about our differentiated assets and capabilities in these two areas. We believe that these ecosystems can help solve complicated problems, and importantly, improve patients' lives. The goal to help ease the frictions and eliminate inefficiencies in the healthcare system and to improve patients' lives is what motivates us continuously to innovate and to execute. Our biopharma ecosystem represents a scaled network of assets and capabilities that are highly differentiated. Within the ecosystem, we're expanding the reach of our products and services that aim to improve access, affordability and adherence. In the past year, we helped patients save more than $6 billion on branded and specialty medications. We helped prevent more than 9 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges, and we helped patients act their medicine more than 67 million times. We created an ecosystem that's more efficient and more valuable to the customers and patients and each of the pieces would be standing alone. The cohesive business strategy and coordinated go-to-market solutions are both critical enabling continued growth in this segment. In our oncology ecosystem, we're strategically positioned to improve cancer care with a range of services and solutions. Our distribution and GPO capabilities continue to provide patients access to life-saving drugs, including biosimilars. Combined with our reach through the US oncology network, we help promote awareness and bring more affordable treatment options to both providers and patients. A great example is our US oncology research, which continues to play a central role in accelerating research and science. As one of the largest community based oncology research programs, it has contributed to more than 100 FDA approved cancer therapies. Last year, nearly 900 physicians actively accrued patients to clinical trial. And through Ontada, we're leveraging the reach and resources across the ecosystem to generate real-world data and evidence. We've published more than 200 real-world studies and leading industry publications for over 70 oncology indications. We are now serving the top 15 global life sciences companies, providing them valuable services to accelerate research and commercialization. As I reflect on our progress against the company priorities, I am very excited to see the meaningful impact it's brought to our business, our customers and to patients. The strategy is working and will continue McKesson's growth journey into fiscal 2023. I'm confident in our ability to continuously execute, innovate and deliver sustainable profit growth for the long-term. Now let me turn to the performance over the past 12 months and how we're positioned for success heading into fiscal 2023. First, I want to share an exciting update on our ESG initiatives. At the beginning of fiscal 2022, we committed to set science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets. We have already submitted our targets to the Science Based Targets initiative for official validation. Through initiatives across operations and supply chain management, we're setting measurable and specific goals to reduce both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, building a more sustainable business, and ultimately, serving the health of patients and communities. Next, let me provide some observations on volume and utilization trends. We're encouraged by the prescription volume and medical visit levels across the business. We've seen continued improvement in pharmaceutical prescription volume, oncology visits and primary care patient visits. While recovery in certain markets like extended care may be lagging, we are seeing other markets recover close to pre-COVID levels. We anticipate the positive trends to continue in fiscal 2023. In US Pharmaceutical, we saw stability in the distribution fundamentals reflected in solid growth in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2022. Our ability to drive sustainable growth in this business derives from a few factors. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in the core distribution assets expanding and strengthening our capabilities and unlocking new efficiencies in the business. On the generics and branded front, the fundamentals of the pricing environment remains stable and generally track in line with our expectations. Our balanced approach of managing a broad portfolio of pharmaceutical products allows us to strengthen our competitive position and enables us to be resilient and flexible to market movements. We remain focused on the investment and expansion of our oncology ecosystem. We're pleased with the growth momentum across our oncology assets from Provider Solutions in the US oncology network to our data and our insights business Ontada. They are critical pieces to the long-term growth of this segment, and we're excited to capture the market opportunity and further our progress in fiscal 2023. In Prescription Technology Solutions, we saw another year of adjusted operating profit growth, driven by expansion of our product offerings, as we bring more brands onto the platform and increase transaction volume as the market recovered. A good example of growth in this segment is our access for more patients, or AMP solution, which was developed and launched about three years ago. The solution's focused on automating benefit verification and hub enrollments for patients. And in fiscal 2022, we saw accelerated growth with 25% increase in the number of brands on the program. It has contributed to the overall growth across the enterprise and more importantly, help patients get on therapies up to eight days faster and stay on therapies longer, driving better health outcomes. We anticipate innovations like this will continue to fuel growth and strengthen our differentiated product offerings. Our future innovations and investments will be centered around expanding the reach of our current products into adjacent markets, such as specialty brands and medical benefits. We continue to invest into the future growth of this segment. Moving on to Medical-Surgical, which has performed exceedingly well this past year. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 items, the underlying Medical-Surgical Distribution business grew at a double-digit rate for adjusted operating profit. The lab business that we highlighted before is just one of the drivers for this outstanding growth trajectory. Recovery in the primary care market and our expansion of selling prescription drugs into the non-acute channel also contributed to the segment. Looking ahead, as a leader in the alternate site market, we believe that this segment is well positioned, as more site of care moves into the communities. Our experience and our relationships in every channel and setting of the alternate site markets enable us to capture this growth opportunity in the years ahead. In the International segment, our strategy and commitment to the Canadian operations remains unchanged. McKesson Canada is a leader in pharmaceutical distribution in the country and has a portfolio of valuable assets, including the retail banner groups Rexall, specialty pharmacies and digital offerings such as Well.ca. We will continue to build and grow this business. In summary, we're extremely pleased with the progress we've made in fiscal 2022 to further our transformation into a diversified health care services company. Looking ahead, to our fiscal 2023, our guidance of $22.90 to $23.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share includes organic growth of the underlying businesses, improved operating leverage and a balanced approach to capital deployment. Excluding the contribution from COVID-19-related items in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, and net gains from McKesson Ventures in fiscal 2022, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to grow 9% to 14% year-over-year. We expect the adjusted operating profit growth in our US Pharmaceutical, Prescription Technology and Medical-Surgical segments to be in line or above the long-term financial framework we laid out at our Investor Day last December. We anticipate the market to remain dynamic, particularly as it relates to supply chain and inflation. We're confident in the resiliency of our business model and our ability to minimize any potential impacts. Our fiscal 2023 guidance does not assume a material headwind from supply chain disruption or sustained price inflation. Britt will walk you through the additional details that we've included in the outlook. As we look ahead to fiscal 2023 we're excited and energized to build on the momentum and to capitalize on our strong market position. We're advancing our transformation to a diversified healthcare services company, extending our long tradition of innovation and evolving our business while reaffirming our strong commitment to addressing the changing needs of our customers, their patients and the broader healthcare industry. Our success in building differentiated assets and capabilities positions us well to support better health outcomes and to accelerate profitability and healthy growth for the company. I want to conclude my remarks by acknowledging our employees, who are dedicated to bringing insight products and services to our customers and partners. Thanks to their execution and their commitment to McKesson and to each other, we're improving care in every setting, one product, one partner and one patient at a time. We are truly enabling better health for all. Thank you for your time this afternoon. And now I'm going to hand it over to Britt. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2022 results, then I'll outline our fiscal 2023 guidance. At our Investor Day in December, we discussed the transformation underway at McKesson. Distribution remains a core part of our company. However, we continue to advance and grow as a diversified health care services company, built on differentiated assets and strategies we're executing, delivering sustainable earnings growth across our businesses. As we articulated then, our confidence is based on three interconnected factors : the successful focus to advance McKesson's oncology and biopharma services ecosystem; leveraging our best-in-class assets and capabilities; effective allocation of capital, including streamlining our portfolio; and the momentum we've been generating through operating and working capital execution. We remain confident that we'll achieve the long-term targets that we've provided for fiscal 2023 and beyond. Let me start by discussing our focus to streamline the portfolio with an update on Europe. In early fiscal 2022, we announced our strategic intent to exit the European region. The transaction to complete a full exit of our European operations allow McKesson to streamline the portfolio, aligning future investments to our growth strategies in North America. We've made good progress. We remain committed to this set of actions. In July of 2021, we announced the transaction with the PHOENIX Group to sell operations in six countries and other certain assets. The transaction is proceeding well. We anticipate it will close in the second half of fiscal 2023. We have successfully closed the following transactions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed the sale of our Austrian business to Quadrifolia management, and the sale of McKesson's remaining share of our German joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance. Recently, we completed the sale of McKesson's UK retail and distribution businesses to AURELIUS, which closed on April 6. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded a GAAP-only charge of $343 million related to our agreement to sell the UK retail and distribution business. Finally, we continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit our remaining operations in Norway and Denmark. In fiscal 2022, our European operations, including held-for-sale accounting treatment impacts, contributed $409 million of adjusted operating profit or $1.97 per diluted share. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate our remaining European operations will contribute approximately $0.85 to $1.15, which includes accretion resulting from the held-for-sale accounting for the transaction for the PHOENIX Group. As I mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we intend to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset the dilution resulting from the European divestitures. Let me now move to a review of our fiscal 2022 results. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results on a year-over-year basis, unless I state otherwise. Fiscal 2022 was another year of strong execution for McKesson. We're exiting the year with solid operating performance, delivering fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings per share of $5.83, and for the full year, earnings per share of $23.69. Our full year results included revenue and profit growth across every business segment. In addition to growth in our core businesses, fiscal 2022 earnings per diluted share also included the following three items. The first is $1.79 related to the US government's centralized COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution program, which included $0.89 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution and $0.90 related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies. $0.88 was related to COVID-19 tests, and finally, $0.47 related to net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. Excluding these items and the impact of fiscal 2021 inventory impairment charges related to personal protective equipment and other related products, fiscal 2022 earnings per diluted share increased 31% year-over-year. For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues of $66.1 billion increased 12%, driven by growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment due to increased volumes of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Gross profit was $3.4 billion for the quarter, an increase of 6%, primarily driven by our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, resulting from prior year inventory charges on PPE and related products, and increases in patient care visits in our primary care business. Gross profit was also positively impacted by increased volume with new and existing customers in our Prescription Technology Solutions segment. Operating expenses in the quarter increased 4% due to increased volumes in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, which were partially offset by the impact of held-for-sale accounting on announced divestitures in the International segment. Operating profit of $1.2 billion for the quarter was an increase of 3%, led by solid operating performance across the segments, partially offset by the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies for the U.S. government and lower contribution related to COVID-19 tests. When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19 related products, net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments and the prior year PPE impairments in the Medical-Surgical segment, operating profit increased 8%. Moving below the line, interest expense was $43 million in the quarter, a decrease of 17% due to the net retirement of approximately $1.1 billion of long-term debt in fiscal 2022, including a previously announced tender offer in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Our tax rate was 21.9% for the quarter. And ramping up our consolidated results, fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 149.2 million, a decrease of 7% year-over-year resulting from share repurchases throughout fiscal 2022. Moving now to fiscal fourth quarter and full year segment results, which can be found on slides seven through 12. And starting with US Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $53.7 billion, an increase of 14%, driven by increased volume of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Operating profit decreased 4% to $780 million, due to lower demand of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, partially offset by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. The contribution from our contract with the US government for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines declined sequentially, and as demand continued to lessen along with continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions. COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter, compared to $0.26 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. As a reminder, fiscal fourth quarter operating profit growth included previously announced investments made in response to the competitive labor market. On our earnings call in February, we reiterated our expectation for additional labor-related expenses to ensure continued service continuity through the second half of our fiscal year. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the previously outlined labor investments, the US Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 4%. For the full year, operating profit increased 8% to $2.9 billion, driven by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1 billion, an increase of 29%, as a result of volume growth related to biopharma services, including third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes. Operating profit increased 11% to $162 million, driven by growth from access and adherence solutions. For the full year, operating profit was $590 million, an increase of 26%. Next, Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 6% due to growth in the primary care business. Operating profit increased 55% to $298 million. In the fourth quarter, operating profit in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment included $0.22 of earnings per diluted share contribution related to COVID-19 tests and $0.20 of earnings per share -- per diluted share contribution related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines for the US government. Excluding the impacts of these COVID-19 related items, and the prior year inventory charge on PPE-related products, operating profit increased 26% due to growth in the primary care business. For the full year, operating profit increased 50% to $1.2 billion. When excluding the impacts of COVID-19-related items and prior year inventory charges on PPE and related products, operating profit increased 22%. During the fourth quarter, COVID-19 and the direction of the disease continued to demonstrate variability. The demand for COVID-19-related products and services has fluctuated over the course of the pandemic. However, the direction generally followed the volume of COVID-19 case levels. Forecasting COVID-19 vaccine distribution and testing demand more than a few months at a time remains difficult. We continue to track new guidance and variants. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we experienced increased demand in January related to a spike in cases due to the Omicron variant. We experienced a 60% volume increase related to COVID-19 tests in January, compared to the average in the third quarter. In February and March, COVID cases declined month-over-month with a corresponding decline in COVID test volumes. In March, we experienced approximately a 90% decrease related to COVID-19 test volumes, compared to the third quarter average. The declines in February and March led to lower earnings contribution from COVID-19 tests in our fiscal fourth quarter. We anticipate that the pace of COVID test volume and vaccine demand will follow a similar fluctuating pattern in fiscal 2023, and we anticipate that fiscal 2023 COVID volume and earnings per share contribution will be materially lower than fiscal 2022. Let me address our international results. Revenues were $8.5 billion on a reported basis. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were $8.8 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by sales to new customers in the Canadian business and year-over-year volume recovery in our distribution businesses, partially offset by the divestiture of our Austrian business, which closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating profit increased 7% to $147 million. On an FX adjusted basis, operating profit increased 10% to $152 million due to the reduction of depreciation and amortization on European assets under agreements to sell and increased volumes in the pharmaceutical distribution business. For the full year, operating profit on an FX-adjusted basis increased 40%. And in our Corporate segment, expenses were $183 million in the quarter, an increase of 46%. During the quarter, mark-to-market valuations related to our equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio resulted in net losses of approximately $6 million, compared to net gains of $44 million in fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Corporate expenses were $579 million for the full year, which were approximately flat compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2022, McKesson had net gains related to our equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio of approximately $98 million or $0.47 per share. This compares to net gains of approximately $132 million or $0.60 for the full year of fiscal 2021. As a reminder, our McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth-stage digital health and services companies, and we are pleased with the insights and the portfolio results that we've obtained. The impacts for a consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary to reach investment. It's difficult to predict when gains and losses on our venture portfolio companies may occur. And, therefore, our practice has been and will continue to not include ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance. And finally, in the fourth quarter, we incurred opioid related litigation expenses of $26 million and incurred $130 million for the full year fiscal 2022. Turning now to our cash position and capital deployment on slide 13. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow, which included $535 million of capital expenditures. We continue to focus capital deployment to drive value for our shareholders. Since fiscal 2018 we returned $11 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, over $9 billion has been returned through share repurchases, reducing our total average shares outstanding by nearly 31%. In fiscal 2022, we returned $3.5 billion through share repurchases, including $1.5 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. Additionally, we paid dividends of $277 million for the full year. When combining share repurchases with dividends paid, we returned approximately 97% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2022. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, along with disciplined capital allocation, continues to provide us with the financial flexibility to invest in our strategies, pursue strategic opportunities and return capital to shareholders, all while maintaining a strong capital structure. Let me spend a few minutes now discussing our outlook for fiscal 2023. We entered fiscal 2023 with solid momentum, building upon the strong fiscal 2022 results. Rather than outlining each assumption, I'll instead walk you through the key items, beginning with additional details of fiscal 2023 consolidated guidance. A full list of our assumptions can be found on slides 14 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation. We remain confident in the fundamentals of our North American health care services and distribution businesses. We'll continue to invest in innovative product offerings that further enhance our leading roles in the oncology and biopharma services ecosystem. Our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes flat to 4% reported revenue growth and 4% to 10% operating profit decline compared to fiscal 2022. Excluding the impacts related to the US government's centralized COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution programs, COVID-19 tests and net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, which were recorded in fiscal year 2022, we anticipate operating profit to increase 3% to 9%. We anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%, and corporate expenses in the range of $520 million to $590 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we finalized the broad settlement of opioid-related claims of states and municipalities. While we've reached a broad settlement, there are cases that remain open. As it relates to opioid litigation expenses, we previously communicated that we anticipate a substantial reduction in fiscal year 2023 resulting from the settlement. For fiscal 2023, our current approximation is $40 million, and it can vary based on a number of factors, including remaining nongovernmental suits, trials and pace of legal proceedings, and we'll continue to update you accordingly. Wrapping up our consolidated guidance, our fiscal 2023 earnings per diluted share outlook is $22.90 to $23.60, which includes $0.20 to $0.60 of contribution attributable to the following COVID-19- related items : $0.05 to $0.20 related to the US government's vaccine distribution; less than $0.05 related to the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies; and $0.15 to $0.35 related to COVID-19 tests. Excluding the impacts of these COVID-19 related items from both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results and the $0.47 related to net gains associated with the McKesson Ventures equity investments in FY 2022, our fiscal 2023 guidance indicates approximately 9% to 14% growth over the prior year. This estimated year-over-year growth is consistent with the long-term financial targets that we provided at our December Investor Day event and represents solid organic growth in our underlying businesses, disciplined capital deployment and continued expansion of our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem. Moving now to our segments. In the US Pharmaceutical segment, our outlook reflects the efficiency and durability of our core distribution platform and continued expansion of our oncology ecosystem. We anticipate reported revenue to increase 7% to 10% and operating profit to approximately be flat to 4% decline year-over-year. Our outlook includes approximately $0.05 to $0.20 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the US government in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which is aligned to the current contract timing and volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and the US government. This compares to $0.89 in full year fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the US government, we anticipate 3% to 5% operating profit growth, which is consistent with the long-term growth target we provided for the US Pharmaceutical segment at our recent Investor Day event. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 17% to 23% and operating profit growth of 14% to 20%. This outlook reflects momentum organic growth across our solutions and services as we expand partnerships with biopharma manufacturers, generate higher transaction volume and increase the number of brands under access and adherence platforms. In the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decrease 7% to 11% and operating profit to decrease 15% to 21%. Our outlook includes approximately less than $0.05 related to beginning storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the US government. And this compares to $0.90 in fiscal 2022. As a reminder, our contracts with the US government are scheduled to end in July of 2022. We also anticipate approximately $0.15 to $0.35 related to COVID-19 tests in fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of these COVID-19-related items, we anticipate operating profit to increase 8% to 14%, primarily as a result of growth in the primary care business. The Medical-Surgical business remains well-positioned to leverage the breadth and depth of its services throughout the alternate site market, including growth from laboratory solutions and the government sector. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decline by 34% to 38% and operating profit to decline by 22% to 28%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we've closed to date and that we expect to close during fiscal 2023. In Canada, we have a strong position as the leader in health care distribution. We anticipate continued organic growth in our pharmaceutical distribution business, including strategic sourcing efforts. Let me conclude our fiscal 2023 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. As I communicated at Investor Day, our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth, complemented by a return of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and a modest yet growing dividend. Our investment-grade credit rating remains a priority and underpins our financial flexibility. This flexibility positions us for the continuation of sustainable long-term value creation for our shareholders. In fiscal 2023, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, our working capital metrics and resulting cash flows vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, which could include the timing of planned European divestiture activity. As discussed at Investor Day, we intend to offset the dilution related to our European divestitures with capital deployment. As indicated on slide 18, our fiscal 2023 outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares. A significant portion of the share buyback assumption is associated with offsetting the year-over-year impact of European divestitures. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of approximately $142 million to $144 million. The progress we're making across our strategic priorities, including our commitment to streamline the business, supports our strong cash flow. This cash flow provides us with the flexibility to deploy capital through organic and inorganic investments in our business and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In closing, fiscal 2022 was another strong year for McKesson. We continue to make great progress on our transformative journey, from a distribution-focused company to a leading diversified health care services company, accelerating and expanding our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem. Our strategies are working, and we're delivering for our customers, partners, patients and our shareholders. We are well positioned to capture the vast opportunities in the growing markets of oncology and biopharma services. We have a strong financial outlook and our financial framework and execution position us to deliver sustainable profit growth, cash flows and shareholder value creation. We have great confidence in our teams, in our products and services and in our strategy. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good afternoon and thanks for obviously a ton of details. So I want to think about just the cadence of the year, if I can, a little bridge, just to make sure. Should we assume, based on the timing of the CDC contract, that pharma growth should be heavier in the first quarter of the year? And how should we think about any other components of cadence and how it should filter through the year relative to some of the more identifiable items like the COVID benefits and other components? Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thanks for that question, Mike. As we didn't really outline it, we don't talk about quarterly guidance, but I can indicate for you that on a consolidated basis, what we would expect is that our earnings growth will be heavier in the second half of the year as opposed to the first half of the year. As I laid out in my comments, we have less contribution from COVID related items in fiscal 2023 than we did in fiscal 2022. And in fact, in all cases, across both Pharma and our Medical segment, we have declining COVID related contribution. So what we do expect is that we would indicate to you expect a heavier proportion of earnings in the second half of the year, a modestly heavier proportion in the second half of the year than the first half. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. Brian and Britt, kind of, standard question on initial guidance. As you've looked at your budget for the year, I'd be interested to hear what the risks and opportunities look like, recognizing you have a $0.70 range on $23 and potentially $0.40 of that attributable to COVID. So you're feeling that there's relatively little variance and what are the factors that would drive you high or low? Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question, Eric. I'll start, and then certainly, Brian can add on. I think one thing for sure as we think about this is as we talked about the variability that we've seen in COVID and the pace of COVID is certainly one that we'll watch for and that certainly can go up or down, particularly in the case of COVID tests. So that could be a risk. It could be a positive or a negative. Clearly, as we've talked about with the macro environment, we are pleased with the fact that we're seeing prescription volumes continue to increase. And as the economy continues to -- or I should say, if patients continue to be more mobile as COVID restrictions continue to ease, that certainly is an opportunity for us to see prescription volumes continue to improve, not only in our Pharma business, but really across, as I talked about, in our Prescription Technology business as well. We certainly have the opportunity to deploy capital. We've laid out for you our assumptions around capital deployment, but we have a lot of flexibility and a good financial framework. And the other way I would point out to you is really the timing around our European divestitures. We've laid out for you that we would expect the transaction with the Phoenix Group to be in the second half of the year, but clearly, that timing could move as we continue to move through that transaction. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Thanks for taking the question. Britt, you talked about how your COVID related businesses really tracks with the incidence of COVID in the country. We are seeing cases rise, at least to date, that's what the data seems to be showing. But at the same time, right, it seems like there's overall less testing sort of a less emphasis. Maybe you can talk about maybe trends that you're seeing currently? And what does an endemic phase of COVID look like, or how are you guys thinking about that as we think -- if we move into an endemic phase for COVID? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Thanks, Charles. It's -- obviously, it's been a little bit hard to predict over the last two years. We saw our last spike in testing really hit us in January of this year. And then we've seen COVID test kit volumes fall off pretty significantly since then. There is a new variant circulating. Initial indications are as probably the same medical profile as the previous variant. But the wild card will be patient behavior. Do people get into routine testing? Do they feel the need to routinely test? Do employers test, as they bring people back? And that's a little bit difficult to forecast. So what we've given you is a guide in FY 2023, based on our most -- our best and current view of the market. Britt Vitalone : And, Charles, maybe just getting back to the question that Eric asked as we think over the year, things that could get us to the higher or the low end of the range. Clearly, COVID test has a lot of variability in that. We've given you our best estimate based on the trends that we've seen, which is really that, as Brian talked about, that declining level of cases in testing. But, certainly, if a variant does come back and cases begin to rise again, that would be something that we would watch for. And we would anticipate that COVID testing would follow the trajectory of cases. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Ms. Gill, please check your mute button on your\u2026 Brian Tyler : Hi, Lisa. Are you there? Lisa Gill : Sorry, I\u2019m here. Thank you very much for all the detail. I just want to understand a couple of things, as we think about the guidance. One, I know you made a comment earlier on when we think about supply chain and inflation that you have some things built into your guidance. You talked about the inflation on the side of wage inflation. One, could you carry that through into 2023 on a permanent basis? And then secondly, if I think about your medical supply business, you have historically had a private label product that was coming, if I remember correctly, from Asia. So has there been any impact due to supply constraints on that side of the business? Brian Tyler : Thanks for the question. I'll kick it off and Britt can add whatever additional comments he'd like. I mean, starting on the labor cost front. It's obviously been a pretty dynamic labor market, and we don't actually think of it as a single market. We think of it as micro markets around where we have locations and facilities. We did make investments largely into the frontline teams in our Medical and our Pharmaceutical business in the back half of our last fiscal year. We've talked about that, and we have contemplated some labor investments in our FY 2023 outlook, based on the status of the market today and the behaviors and the indicators that we see today. That\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue to track. I mean, I think, McKesson is a great place to work. We have a really strong employee value proposition that includes competitive wages, the benefits and development and career progression and mean -- and work that has really meaning and purpose behind it. So I think we feel good about where we stand as we enter the year, but it's certainly -- the last several months have been, labor markets like most of us have not seen, so we'll continue to monitor and track that closely. On the supply chain front, I think our supply chains have been remarkably resilient in Medical and Pharmaceutical over the many, many twists of the last two years, I would say that they continue to be resilient. We would anticipate very modest levels of disruption and cost inflation in FY 2023. Our private brand program, as you might recall, we don't own physical plant and equipment and manufacture, we source. And so our teams have been very aggressively thinking about expanding and broadening and rotating our sources of supply. And thus far, we've been able to maintain very good inventory positions. Britt Vitalone : And maybe just Lisa, I'd just add on, we have a very comprehensive sourcing strategy and we source our products really in a very diverse way across many different countries. And one of the things that we're really proud about and focused on is our approach to responsible and sustainable sourcing. And we've really taken a lot of actions along those lines to also diversify our partners across the products that we serve. So we feel like we have really good strong sourcing program in place, and we feel well-positioned. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. So relative to our own EPS bridge we had built previously from FY 2022 to 2023, biggest source of upside from our view is the $0.85 to $1.15 EPS you still expect from the European assets. I guess in that piece, I was curious, too, is there any color on whether or not that will be heavily front-end loaded in the first quarter or two or maybe more evenly spread throughout the year? And then at the risk of maybe looking too far ahead, should we assume that all of that $0.85 to above $15 would essentially disappear in your fiscal 2024? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yeah, I'd say that the cadence would be very similar to what I gave you on a consolidated basis. Now we do expect that the transaction that we talked about with PHOENIX is going to close in the second half of fiscal 2023. So I guess it would be more first three quarters loaded than just half-and-half. As it relates to 2024, I think it\u2019s little early to start talking about that. We've talked to you about the fact that Norway and Denmark are still two countries that we're evaluating opportunities for to fully exit this. It's too early to really talk about any transactions along those lines. And we still operate those businesses, and we\u2019ll just continue to evaluate opportunities to exit that. But those are -- those continue to be countries that we operate in. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. So two clarification questions. So one, as we think about the European contribution, I think that's page 16 in your slide deck that $1.97. Is the take here is really that, that European contribution ultimately will be replaced by buybacks even for that, I think you have $0.85 to $1.15 in assets that you still own. But if you divest tender, we should think about this as replaceable with capital allocation through buybacks. And then similar to that, if we think about the cost inflation that's embedded in results. I think in the slides you talked about, if you adjust for COVID costs then distribution segment would have grown 2%. I think on the call, you said if you adjust for that, aim for higher rate in inflation, then you would have grown 4%. So should we think about that 2% difference is the cost and inflation? Is this something that we can think about as we try to quantify what it is embedded in your 2023 guidance? Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the questions, Ricky. Let me try to take those in order. Let me first talk about Europe. We've tried to lay out here for you as transparently as we could what the European contribution was in FY 2022. And then we talked about what we thought the operations would contribute in 2023. We fully intend to exit Europe. And what we've also said is that when we do that, the loss contribution from those earnings, we would replace with capital deployment, principally share, share buybacks. And we've tried to lay that out for you. And so, yes, the way we've laid it out for you is that you should think about Europe eventually going away and being replaced by capital deployment. As it relates to the comment on the US Pharmaceutical segment, let me break it up this way. When you think about excluding the COVID-related items, which, again, we've talked about those pretty transparently since the beginning, we had 2% growth year-over-year. We did talk about beginning on our second quarter earnings call that we were making additional investments into our US-based businesses to have continuity of service through labor expenses. That accounted for about 2% of the year-over-year impact in the US Pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter. And so, I wanted just to make that comment. It's nothing different than we've talked about before. We talked about the contribution that we'll be making and the investment we'd be making about $0.20 for the year. That, for the US Pharmaceutical segment, was about 2% in the quarter. So that's why we called that out, just as a sort of a confirmation of what we've talked about previously. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks for taking my question. Just a lot of the margin changed the guidance and the change in margins across the segments can be explained by COVID. But when I look at, say, PTS and Medical-Surgical, is there anything else we should think about in terms of the mix or benefits? You've talked a little bit about what you expect on the pharma side. Is there anything in those two segments outside of COVID that we should be thinking about that might impact margins for 2023? Britt Vitalone : As we think about 2023, wouldn't think that there would be much change in terms of the mix within those two businesses. We're continuing to see good strength in our primary care business in the medical business. We expect that will continue into FY 2023. And in our RxTS business, I mean, we had strong growth on the revenue line, we had 26% growth in operating profit. So we had strong performance at the margin line as well. And we expect that our adherence and access programs will continue to have growth as we move into 2023. So I wouldn't guide you to any different mix in 2023 than we\u2019ve seen in 2022. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with R.W. Baird. Eric Coldwell : Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. Fairly simple one, I hope. Your competitor who reported today had $115 million of opioid expense last year, said that their expense next year would be down only modestly. You had $130 million expense, and you're saying it will be $40 million. That's a really big delta between the two companies for the same situation. Any sense on what the delta is between you two? Have you excluded the injunctive relief costs, the data, the tracking, the integrity costs that come with the program in this $40 million, or what might explain this substantial delta in opioid litigation expense? Thanks very much. Brian Tyler : I don't know that we can speak to the delta. We can speak to the guidance that we provided. As we look at the litigation, the litigation calendar, open issues that are ahead of us. This is our best view based on what we know today of what we would anticipate to spend and defending ourselves against these suits. And that number we provided was $40 million. Britt Vitalone : And as I pointed out, there are some factors that could drive that number in either direction. That could be the pace of any trials or trials themselves and any of the work that goes into any trials that do happen. So we've given you our best estimate based on our analysis of what remains. And again, as Brian said, it's really can't comment on how is somebody else is thinking about this. Brian Tyler : That is the legal expense. I mean that is $40 million for legal defense, right? Britt Vitalone : Consistent as it's been since we began reporting this to you three years ago. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk about the relative contribution of pricing increases to the revenue growth in your three remaining segments and the outlook that you provided for 2023? Britt Vitalone : Yeah, thanks for the question. We didn't touch on that. We historically have talked about the environment around branded inflation and generic inflation. We don't see any change in our FY 2023 outlook to what we've seen in FY 2022. So we see relative stability in both branded price inflation. And from a generics perspective, we continue to see a stable but competitive environment that is supported by the strong sourcing operations that we have and our focus is on providing our customers, stability of supply, good pricing and our ability to do that through good sourcing and disciplined approach to the sell side. So from our perspective, as we look at the pricing environments around branded and generics, we see relative stability in 2023 compared to 2022. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey good evening guys, and I appreciate you taking my question. I guess, Britt, I would ask if you could talk a little bit about inside of the Pharmaceutical segment, kind of, the difference between what's happening in the core wholesaling business versus the more manufacturer facing services businesses? And I guess, are they both performing in line and positively, or is there a meaningful divergence on how the -- what I would call the pharmacy facing business is performing versus the manufacturer facing business is performing? Britt Vitalone : Yeah. Let me start, and then certainly, Brian can add on to this. Our biopharma services, I think, as you've captured on manufacturer services, those businesses are captured in our Rx Solutions segment. And as we've talked about, that business continues to generate really good revenue, top line and profit growth. We're seeing more brands being added to our platforms. We're seeing good acceptance in the marketplace of our access and adherence solutions. In both of our businesses, as I talked about, we're seeing improved transaction volume from prescriptions. And that certainly is benefiting our Prescription Technology Solutions segment very well, both new and existing brand. So I'd say both of those businesses are benefiting from the macro factors of seeing improved transaction volumes. Clearly, the growth of our technology solutions in RXTS and our access and adherence solutions are seeing really good growth. Brian Tyler : Yeah. And I'd just say, we've created RxTS segment to give you visibility into how that business is performing, and we're quite pleased that both the core pharma and RxTS business. Our forward guide for FY 2023 is in line. And in the case of RxTS exceeding what we said in December, we thought was a long-run growth target. So we're very pleased with both those businesses and feel we're very well positioned. Brian Tyler : Okay. Well, thank you. Thanks for your patience. I know we ran a few minutes longer than we normally do. It's typical at a year-end or year kick-off call. I want to thank everyone for your time and for joining this call. We really appreciate your thoughtful questions, and certainly, your interest in McKesson. Thank you, Cody, for facilitating the call for us. Just to conclude, McKesson delivered a strong fiscal 2022 with double-digit adjusted operating profit growth and I am excited about the continued progress of our company priorities into fiscal 2023. I'm confident about our ability to deliver strong growth, solid financial results and shareholder value creation. Of course, it's all due to the people that make up Team McKesson across all areas of our business. I want to thank them for their hard work and their dedication to executing on our strategies, for living our culture and our values and bringing positive changes to our partners, our customers and the patients that we impact. Thanks, again, everybody. I hope you all have a terrific evening. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com, and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thanks, Rachel, and thanks to everyone joining us on our call this afternoon. Earlier today, we announced our first quarter fiscal 2023 results with strong growth in total company revenue and adjusted operating profit across the North American businesses. As a result of our first quarter performance and McKesson's continued role in the COVID-19 response efforts, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $22.90 to $23.60 to a new range of $23.95 to $24.65, successful execution against our company's priorities, priorities of people and culture, sustainable core growth, streamlining the portfolio and expanding the oncology and biopharma services ecosystems are really what underpin our fiscal 2023 outlook and our long-term growth framework. So I wanted to center my remarks today around those themes. And I thought I would start maybe with a highlight of the progress we've made against our company priorities and then I will wrap up with a few brief comments on the performance in the business itself. Foundational to our company, foundational to our company's history quite frankly and our strategy are really the core pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses. As we expand the reach of our services, we remain focused on generating sustainable growth in these core businesses. Our operational excellence and ability to leverage our scale with global suppliers is one of the many reasons why McKesson continues to be a partner of choice for our customers. Over the past two years, you're well aware, we've been working closely with the U.S. government to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary kits. As requested by the U.S. government, our contract to serve as the centralized distributor for COVID-19 vaccines was extended through July of 2023. Similarly, the contract for ancillary kits and storage was extended through January of 2023. We are \u2013 well, we continue to be honored and privileged to be able to leverage our distribution scale and expertise and to continue to support this important public health effort. Britt will comment a little more specifically on the financial impacts of these contract extensions, but we continue to look forward to serving the U.S. government for several more months in this capacity. I mean, building upon the success of the core distribution businesses, we like to say we're tackling some of the most complicated problems in healthcare through the expansion of our oncology and our biopharma services ecosystems. In the first quarter, we were really excited to announce the formation of a joint venture between McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA's \u2013 HCA Healthcare's Sarah Cannon Research Institute. This transaction marks a really important alliance between two of \u2013 between these two companies and we expect it will accelerate our strategic advancement of the oncology ecosystem. By combining the resources and the expertise of these two organizations, we're creating an expanded clinical research network and that really means a broader portfolio of clinical trial offerings, expanded patient reach, access to a broader set of data and more advanced analytics capabilities to better match patients with clinical trials. The new joint venture will really also aim at accelerating drug development and increasing availability and access to clinical trials for community oncology providers and patients, including those in underserved communities. This transaction enhances our proposition to biopharma companies and further advances our differentiated offerings across the entire pharmaceutical life cycle. It is also purposeful. It reinforces our commitment as a company to advance health outcomes for all. We expect to close the transaction by the end of calendar year 2022 and we look forward to the partnership, the collaboration and greater outcomes we can bring to the patients we collectively serve. We're also making meaningful progress on expanding our biopharma services ecosystem. Through years of intentional investment, we've built a suite of innovative biopharma solutions that supports really every phase of the medication life cycle across nearly all therapeutic categories. We're reinventing how biopharma companies, providers and payers can connect to each other through technology with the ultimate goal of really helping patients' access, afford and adhere to their medications. Today I thought I might share a few examples around our affordability efforts and how these efforts fit into our biopharma ecosystem. A key piece of our innovative medication affordability product suite is our automatic couponing program. This automatic couponing program really applies co-pay offsets or savings for qualified medications right at the point of dispensing. Using our technologies, it's seamlessly integrated into the pharmacy workflow. We further help patients stay on their trusted brands through multichannel support options like activity inform messaging about other discounts, real-time support and educational materials. We also facilitate patient assistance programs, which are critical financial safety net for millions of patients. We implement and administer comprehensive patient assistant programs through program pharmacies, which enable access to free medication programs to eligible patients treated at hospitals in community care settings and sometimes even at home. Both of these solutions leverage the reach of our technology network. And in fiscal year 2022, our solutions enabled patients to save more than $6 billion on brand and specialty medications. And importantly, we prevented more than 9 million prescriptions from being abandoned. By improving affordability of prescriptions in many instances these solutions also improve adherence, helping patients stay on the treatment longer, which leads to better health outcomes. As we look ahead, we continue to be proud of our differentiated assets and capabilities and we're excited to bring innovative solutions to more partners and patients. Oncology and biopharma services both represent large, complex and growing markets for McKesson and we're strategically positioned to continue to enhance value in these areas. I want to talk a bit about our next priority, which is streamline the portfolio. It's absolutely imperative that we continue to focus our human and our financial capital into the highest growth and highest margin areas of the company. And part of that is a continual assessment of our portfolio for strategic alignment. This includes the progress we're making towards fully exiting the European region. We recently entered into an agreement to sell Denmark and the transaction was closed on July 29, 2022. The pending transaction with the PHOENIX Group is progressing well. We characterize it as on track and has an expected close in the second half of our fiscal 2023. Norway really remains the only country that we have not yet announced an agreement to sell. So now one year after we announced McKesson's strategic intent to exit the European region, we've entered into agreements to sell or we have completed divestitures of the business operations in 11 of the 12 countries in Europe. So I'm really pleased with the execution of this important initiative, I think the teams have got after it with remarkable speed and efficiency. I want to wrap up my review of our company's priorities by reaffirming our focus on people and culture. In fact, it's typically the first priority we mention. We believe that talent can truly be differentiating and we continue to invest in the development of our employees. It's \u2013 we provide our employees not only competitive compensation and competitive benefits, but also the resources and support they need to grow into the next generation of leaders for McKesson. It's an organization. We're committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion and we continue to increase leadership representation for women in North America and people of color in the U.S. In fact, just recently, McKesson was recognized by Forbes as one of the best employers for women achieving an industry leading ranking. This is a demonstration of our outstanding progress in promoting equity and diversity in the workplace and really in my view reflects our deep commitment to support all employees at McKesson, all employees at McKesson. Additionally for the seventh consecutive year, McKesson was named the Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, which includes earning a top ranking score of 100 on the 2022 Disability Equality Index. I'm proud of the progress that we've made on all of our company's priorities and we can clearly see it helping advance our long-term growth. Before I turn over \u2013 before I turn my attention to our first quarter results, I did want to just provide everyone a quick update on the progress of the opioid related litigations. This past quarter, we reached agreements in principle with the State of Washington and the State of Oklahoma. With the recent developments, we have settled or we've reached agreements to settle the opioid related claims of all 50 states, the District of Columbia and all eligible territories. The majority of the payments that will fund as part of these settlements will be used on opioid relief programs. We're particularly proud of that. And we\u2019ll support a wide variety of strategies in local communities to help fight opioid crisis. In July, after a full trial, a federal judge ruled that McKesson, along with two other distributors, could not be held liable to two West Virginia subdivisions for contributing to the opioid crisis. This ruling is significant as the court confirmed that McKesson did not cause an oversupply of opioids in these communities. As we move forward, our role in combating opioid abuse is not over. McKesson will remain part of the solution when it comes to relief across the country and in preventing opioid diversion within the pharmaceutical supply chain. Let's move on to business performance. And I want to start by just providing a few comments on the macroeconomic trends and environment that we're seeing and what the potential impacts are on McKesson's business. In the past quarter we have observed positive prescription volumes and positive patient utilization trends. Additionally, as the macroeconomic environment continues to evolve, our business model has remained resilient to the pressures from cost inflation and supply chain disruption. The impact from these macroeconomic factors was immaterial in Q1, and we do not anticipate any incremental impact in addition to what was already contemplated in our fiscal 2023 outlook. We remain confident in our ability to navigate a dynamic economic environment. We have a diverse set of products and solutions that allow us to follow the market demands and capture evolving opportunities. And we remain committed to supporting our customers and partners by delivering innovative products and solutions and making quality care more accessible and affordable. Let me quickly summarize the first quarter performance, and then I'm going to turn it over to Britt who will provide additional financial details. I\u2019m going to start with us U.S. Pharmaceutical. We delivered solid first quarter performance in core pharmaceutical distribution led really by our differentiated value proposition and exceptional service to our customers. Throughout the quarter we saw year-over-year growth in prescription volume with positive trends in both branded and generic drugs. Our distribution expertise is reflected in the breadth of product, offering delivery accuracy and reliability of our service. We also remain focused on expanding the oncology ecosystem to strengthen our already differentiated market position. The advancements not only reflected in financial performance and its increasing contribution to the segment growth, but also demonstrated by the research we published, the insights we generated and the partnerships we formed, all focused on empowering innovation and advancing cancer care. Our oncology business has proven to be resilient throughout the pandemic, and we saw stable demand in patient visit trends within our U.S. oncology practices. In Prescription Technology Solution, we're pleased with the growth momentum in the first quarter, driven by access, affordability and adherence solutions. The market demand for our products and solutions remain strong contributing to the organic growth in the core product categories. The strong financial performance also allows us to reinvest into the business and to expand the reach of our biopharma services ecosystem. The continued investment and innovation is critical to the long-term growth of the business. In the medical-surgical solution segment, we again had strong performance led by strength in the primary care marketplace. The demand for COVID tests during the quarter was higher than anticipated, but I would also say generally in line with the COVID case counts. We continue to expand the breadth of our products and services to strengthen our leading capabilities in the alternate site market. And in the International segment, we're progressing well with the divestiture of our European assets. As it relates to our Canadian business, we remain committed to our strategy in the Canadian market, where we have scale and a diverse set of assets. The distribution and retail businesses remain stable, and the team is doing great work driving growth through improved sourcing economics and expanded customer relationships. Let me try to pull everything together. McKesson reported solid first quarter in fiscal 2023. The fundamentals of our business are stable and I'm excited about the meaningful progress we've made against our company priorities. Our updated outlook for fiscal 2023 aligns with the long-term growth targets of the business and demonstrates our commitment to deliver sustainable growth across all segments. Last, I want to be sure to thank my teammates and the employees of McKesson. I'm proud to lead this amazing team. You are all innovative problem solvers that bring positive change to our customers and partners. It's the dedication and the execution from each and every one of our employees that's driving McKesson forward and ultimately helping advance health outcomes for all. With that Britt, why don't you provide some additional color and comments? Britt Vitalone : Well, thank you, Brian. And good afternoon. We are pleased to report June quarter financial results that continue to demonstrate our ability to grow our businesses and execute effectively as a diversified healthcare services company. Our fiscal first quarter results are ahead of our expectations, reflecting progress against our strategic priorities, demonstrating the continued strength of our operations. Let me begin today with a few company updates before reviewing our first quarter results. I want to start with Europe and our ongoing focus to streamline our portfolio. Over the past few years, we've taken deliberate actions to streamline the business and deploy capital more effectively, ensuring the organization is operationally efficient in delivering solutions that are focused in solving our customers\u2019 biggest challenges. This is exemplified by our actions to exit European region announced in July of 2021. Since that time we've divested or entered into agreements to sell business operations in 11 of the 12 countries in which we operate. To date, we've successfully closed the following transactions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed the sales of our Austrian business in the remaining share of our German joint venture. In April of 2022, we completed the sale of our UK retail and wholesale operations. And in July of 2022, we completed the sale of our Denmark business. The transaction with the Phoenix Group to sell operations in other certain assets in several European countries is also proceeding well. We anticipate it will close in the second half of fiscal 2023 subject to regulatory reviews. We continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit remaining operations in Norway, the only country that we've not yet entered into an agreement to sell. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate our remaining European operations will contribute adjusted operating profit of approximately $0.85 to a $1.15 per diluted share, which includes accretion resulting from the held-for-sale accounting through the transaction with the Phoenix Group. As discussed at our December Investor Day, we intend to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset the dilution resulting from the European divestitures. Exiting operations in Europe allows us to focus on another important strategic priority, expanding our Oncology and Biopharma services ecosystems. We took an important step this quarter in our Oncology ecosystem. In June, we announced an agreement to form a joint venture combining McKesson\u2019s US Oncology Research and HCA Healthcare\u2019s Sarah Cannon Research Institute, including the acquisition of Genospace, Sarah Cannon's personalized medicine platform. The combination of these assets complements our existing operations. It aligns to our strategic growth priorities. It supports our vision to improve care in every setting. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of calendar year 2022, again, subject to regulatory review and approval. We do not anticipate this transaction will have a material impact on our fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share outlook. Next, as Brian mentioned earlier, our contract with the U.S. government to serve as a centralized distributor for COVID-19 vaccines was recently extended through July of 2023. And the contract for the kitting and storage of ancillary supplies was extended through January of 2023. I will discuss the impact of fiscal 2023 guidance later in my remarks. Finally, I want to point out one additional item that will impact our fiscal second quarter GAAP only results. In July of 2022, McKesson exited one of its investments in equity securities for proceeds of $179 million. We will recognize a GAAP only gain within other income in the second quarter. Moving now to a review of our first quarter fiscal 2023 results. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results, on a year-over-year basis, unless I state otherwise. Consolidated revenues of $67.2 billion increased 7%, reflecting growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, as a result of the European divestiture process.  Gross profit was $3 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 4%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures gross profit increased 9% a result of organic growth in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, increased volume specialty products in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment and growth in the Prescription Technology Solution segment. Operating expenses decreased by 10% in a quarter due to completed divestitures in the International segment. As a result operating profit was $1.1 billion for the quarter; an increase of 4% led by growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical and improved prescription transaction volumes in the Prescription Technology Solution segment. When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19 related products and services and gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, operating profit increased 13% year-over-year. Interest expense was $45 million in the quarter, a decrease of 8% due to a net reduction of debt year-over-year. And the effective tax rate was 18.4% for the quarter. Wrapping up our consolidated results, first quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 145.9 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year resulting from share repurchases throughout fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Overall, first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.83, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year. Now onto our first quarter segment results, which can be found on slides seven through twelve and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $56.9 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year, resulting from increased specialty product volumes, led by retail national account customers and market growth, which was partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Operating profit increased 4% to $711 million led by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, generic launches and improved performance of Ontada, which is partially offset by lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.18 per share in the quarter, which is compared to $0.30 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 9%. Results in the quarter benefited from the timing of generic launches and the improved performance of Ontada. Operating margins were modestly lower in the quarter impacted by mix. As the growth from health systems in multi-specialty providers were partially offset by robust retail national account customer growth, which contributed 7% to the overall 14% year-over-year top-line growth. Next is Brian noted earlier, our Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered another strong quarter. Response to our access, affordability and adherence solutions continue to be strong across biopharma providers and payers. The scale and expanded suite of offerings continued delivered for all stakeholders, including patients. Revenues were $1.1 billion an increase of 21% year-over-year driven by volume growth from biopharma services, which includes third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenues. Operating profit increased 19% to $165 million reflecting the continued favorable market acceptance to a growing set of access, affordability and adherence solutions. Moving down to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.6 billion an increase of 3% year-over-year as growth in the primary care business, partially offset anticipated lower demand in sales for COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine program. Operating profit increased 4% to $268 million driven by strength across the primary care business; improve volumes in greater incidents of respiratory illness and the flu contributed to higher testing in patient visits in the primary care business. The contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with U.S. government for the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of approximately $0.25 per share in the quarter compared to $0.35 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of these COVID-related items, the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivered operating profit growth of 20%. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues were $6.5 billion. An operating profit was $138 million, which was a decrease of 19%. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were $7.1 billion, a decrease of 23%. An operating profit was $152 million, a decrease of 11%. Our first quarter results reflect the impact from the divestitures in McKesson UK and Austrian businesses. Moving on to Corporate. Our Corporate expenses were $145 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. In the quarter, we recognized a tax receivable gain related to our previous change healthcare investment and lower opioid-related litigation expenses. We incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $19 million in the first quarter; we anticipate that the fiscal 2023 opioid-related litigation expenses would be approximately $45 million. During the quarter, we had net losses of $22 million related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio, which compares to net gains of approximately $7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. As a reminder, the impacts on our consolidated results can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, McKesson\u2019s investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. It\u2019s difficult to predict when gains and losses on McKesson Ventures portfolio companies may occur. And, therefore, our practice has been and will continue to not include McKesson Ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance. Let me turn to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 13. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow can be impacted by timing and vary from quarter-to-quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we made a $100 million of capital expenditures, which includes investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities, including our oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. For the quarter, we had negative free flow of $1 billion. We also returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders during the June quarter, which included $1 billion of share repurchases and $71 million in dividend payments. In July, our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.54 per share. And the board also approved a new $4 billion share repurchase authorization, which brings the total remaining share repurchase authorization to $6.3 billion. Our fiscal 2023 guidance per share repurchases remains unchanged. These actions demonstrate the confidence that the Board of Directors and management have in the execution against our strategic priorities. Our capital deployment principles remain firmly in place. We prioritize growth by investing internally and through M&A our focus continues to center on the areas of oncology and biopharma services, including the expansion of access affordability and adherence solutions. Next, we\u2019ll continued to return capital to shareholders through a combination of our growing dividend and share repurchases. And the third piece of the framework focuses on a strong balance sheet and financial position, which is underpinned by the maintenance of our investment grade credit rating. Let me turn to our fiscal 2023 outlook, starting with a consolidated view. I\u2019ll walk you through the key items beginning with additional details of fiscal 2023 consolidated guidance. A full list of these assumptions can be found on Slides 15 through 19 and our supplemental slide presentation. On a reported basis our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes 3% to 7% revenue growth and flat to 6% operating profit decline compared to fiscal 2022. When excluding the impacts related to the U.S. government\u2019s centralized COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution programs, COVID-19 tests and net gains or losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. We anticipate adjusted operating profit to increase 4% to 10%. We also anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $550 million to $620 million, which includes the impact of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in the first quarter. Given the current interest rate environment, we now anticipate interest expense to modestly increase and be in the range of $205 million to $225 million. Our anticipated full year effective tax rate of approximately 18% to 20% remains unchanged. Based on our first quarter results are continued solid operating performance in each segment and the contract extensions with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies. We are increasing our guidance range for fiscal 2023 to $23.95 to $24.65 from the previous range of $22.90 to $23.60. Our fiscal 2023 outlook aligns with the previously communicated long-term growth targets, and it demonstrates the commitment to deliver sustainable growth. Our revised guidance also includes $0.99 to a $1.29 of contribution attributable to the following items. $0.35 to $0.45 related to the U.S. government\u2019s vaccine distribution in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. $0.75 to $0.95 related to COVID-19 tests in the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, and $0.11 of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. Excluding the impacts of these COVID-19 related items and net gains and losses from McKesson Ventures equity investments from both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results. Our fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings guidance indicates approximately 10% to 15% growth over the prior year. Moving now to the segment outlook. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, our outlook reflects the solid operating performance in the first quarter, the efficiency and durability of our core distribution platform and continued development of our oncology ecosystem. We anticipate reported revenue to increase 11% to 14% in operating profit to decline approximately 1% to 3% growth year-over-year. Our outlook includes approximately $0.35 to $0.45 related COVID-19 vaccine distribution, a result of the previously outlined contract extension. When excluding impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government, we anticipate 4% to 6% operating profit growth, which is modestly above the long-term growth target. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we now anticipate revenue growth of 15% to 21% and operating profit growth of 16% to 22%, which reflects increased affordability solution volumes. In the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to 3% to 7% and operating profit to decrease 5% to 10%. Our outlook includes approximately $0.75 to $0.95 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government, which incorporates the contract extension with the U.S. government to January of 2023. Excluding the impact of these COVID-19 related items, we anticipate Medical-Surgical operating profit to increase 11% to 17%. And finally, in the International segment, we continue to anticipate revenues to decline by 34% to 38% and operating profit to decline by 22% to 28%. And this year-over-year decrease includes a loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we\u2019ve closed to date. And those we expect to close during fiscal 2023. Let me conclude our fiscal 2023 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. In fiscal 2023, we continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, our working capital metrics and resulting cash flows vary from quarter-to-quarter. Each working capital metric can be impacted by timing and in fiscal 2023 are cash flows including the progression of these cash flows may be impacted by European divestiture activity. Our fiscal 2023 outlook incorporates plans repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares. Significant portion of the share buyback assumption is associated with mitigating the year-over-year impact of European divestitures. As a result of the share repurchase activity we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of approximately $142 million to $144 million. To wrap up we are pleased with our solid start to the fiscal year. We continue to deliver on our growth strategy as diversified healthcare services company. Our talented associates continue to deliver exceptional performance. Our first quarter financial performance reflects their dedication and their execution in a dynamic operating environment. And it also represents the resiliency of our portfolio. Looking ahead, the combination of our solid first quarter financial performance, our growth strategy and continued execution positions McKesson to deliver sustainable long-term performance and shareholder value creation. With that let me turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Thanks very much and good afternoon. Thanks Brett, for all of the color. I just wanted to go back and make sure I just understand just a couple of things. One, the comment around macro economic trends being immaterial, I know last year you had some wage inflation or gave people bonuses. I'm curious as to what you're seeing right now around wages? And then secondly, want to make sure that I understand how POA works. Is that just a pass through? So as we've seen rising oil prices and higher gas prices, is that something that you can just pass along to your customer and that's why it's a material to you? Brian Tyler : Well, so Lisa, I'll start with the wage component and you'll recall last year as we track the markets, both nationally and locally we decided midyear to take some wage actions. We mentioned that was probably $0.10 to $0.20 in each of the segments. We brought a perspective into our Fiscal 2023 guide and at this point we still think that that our views on the labor markets and the guidance are in sync. It's something that we'll continue to watch. People are an important part of our value delivery mechanism. It's important that that we stay on top of it, but as we look at key metrics like turnover and service out our doors, we're still comfortable that our assumptions for FY 2023 are the initial outlook we provided you for FY 2023 will be relevant. As it relates to fuel specifically, it's probably a nuanced answer. I think Britt characterized it correctly that it's been immaterial for this fiscal year. In some instances we can contractually pass it through. In other instances, we have the ability to set price and certainly we take actions for efficiency within the operation to continually offset any expenses like that we might have. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good afternoon and congratulations on a really nice quarter. As I think about the OpEx management in the quarter, it was something that clearly stood out relative to the outperformance. Aside from some of those dynamics on wage investments, what are some of the push and polls you're seeing in the OpEx line relative to last year? And how should we think about the trajectory of OpEx, at least in terms of the percent of revenue as what, in terms of what you can both manage as well as what will clearly benefit as you get more leverage from faster growth, some of these incremental revenue upside pull troughs? Brian Tyler : Hey, Mike, thanks for the question. Let me try to tackle that. I think the biggest piece that we identify for our consolidated operations was the divestitures in Europe that drove a lot of the operating expense decline year-over-year. But we also have continued to execute against a lot of our cost initiatives that we began three years ago, and a lot of the efficiency that we've driven into the organization and continue to be focused on not only efficiencies, but driving automation in the company as well. Couple other things that I would point out for sure is in our corporate line we saw lower opioid litigation expenses as compared to the prior year. Now we called that out in our guidance at the beginning of the year, but on a year-over-year basis it was lower in the first quarter and that's going through our corporate line. But I think overall it's a lot of the efficiencies that we've driven in the organization, our cost programs that we've been after now for the last three to four years and the leverage that we're able to get as we continue to drive the corporation for gaining productivity. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So yes, if we go back to the analyst day back in December, you guys talked about 12% to 14% EPS growth, excluding COVID and some of the European dilution. I'm trying to quantify what \u2013 how that's tracking in Fiscal 2023 ex-those items. So I think on Slide 19, I actually slide 15 apologize. You show the 10% to 15% growth, excluding those items. I'm wondering is that the closest proxy for how this fiscal year is tracking relative to that 12% to 14% metric that you talked about previously? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Hey Steven, thanks for the question. So what we tried to do with that slide is give you the progression, excluding some of the things that we're working through here, obviously with COVID test kits and vaccines and so forth. The guidance that we gave you is more on a long-term basis and again excluding some of the programs that we have in place, and obviously excluding McKesson Ventures'. When you look at each of our segments, as I talked about them here today our segments have actually performed slightly ahead of the launch of growth rates that we provided at Investor Day. One of the things that we're obviously working through here is the divestitures of Europe and the cadence of those divestitures and obviously what we've talked about from getting here is we're going to try to offset that dilution with share repurchases. But if you look at our operating profit growth excluding the programs that we have with the U.S. government, COVID test kits then you look at the segments that is really in line with the long term growth rates that we provided at Investor Day and on a consolidated basis, the 10% to 15% that we've talked about here today again, also aligns with that long-term guidance. We feel very good that we're on pace that we're tracking against what we, we told you at our Investor Day in December. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. Question relative to the contract extension with the government and first, are there any changes in the scope of operations for [indiscernible], would you potentially support Novavax or Pfizer? And that'd be interested in your perspective on normalization of distribution of both vaccine and COVID therapies over time? Brian Tyler : So in terms of the scope of the agreement, really the scope of either agreement has not really changed in terms of the services that we'll provide. We will not \u2013 we are not going to expand to do Pfizer, but we are committed to do all of the other U.S. government approved including Novavax as directed by the U.S. government and our facilities are capable and ready to support that. And I would just mimic similarly for the kitting side, although it's probably a little more storage than, than kitting vis-\u00e0-vis the early phases of the program when kitting was quite intensive, and what was that, I'm sorry, Erik what was your second question? Eric Percher : Just your thought on the normalization of distribution into all distributors, both for [indiscernible] and COVID therapies. Are you seeing some of that for your channels? Brian Tyler : Yes. I mean, I think as relates to the vaccine \u2013 the vaccines themselves, those continue to run through the centralized government model to be perfectly candid 2.5 years ago, it would've been hard to imagine we'd still be in this scenario as a nation, just thinking of our public health and the prevalence of the disease that we still see. As we've said all along we're committed to bring our assets and capabilities to help support the public health response in any way we can. We're I guess, happy we have the facility and continue to support the government program. But like most of us probably will not be sad when there's no longer a need for any of this Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi, good afternoon, and congrats on a great quarter. So I have a soft question on the COVID vaccines. If we think about the step-up in guidance for vaccines and kitting, how much of that and has it, or was already captured in the $0.54 beat in the quarter versus your expectation going forward? So that's question number one. And then secondly, to follow up somewhat on Eric's question, I think Moderna said today that they expect the commercial market in 2023 for vaccines. So just \u2013 can you maybe help us frame it? How should we think about it? Is this \u2013 would this be on top of sort of the contract that you have with the U.S. government, or would that be in lieu off? Brian Tyler : Do you want to take the guidance question and I'll take the second part. Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thank for the question, Ricky. So again, I think if you look at our slide presentation, we've tried to call out here, what the big changes are in our guide. Certainly a portion of our first quarter was a result of the increase in both vaccine distribution and the kitting storage and COVID test kits. COVID test kits, as we told you in our guidance would be lower than FY 2022. That has certainly been the case, although it was slightly ahead of our own internal expectations. We continue to expect that test kits will be significantly lower than last year. They are a little bit ahead of our expectations. So in our first quarter, some of the COVID related items and programs did drive some of the upside, but certainly our operating performance was strong. You can see that from the slide that talks about our guidance increase, that there is a significant portion of the increase that's related to those COVID programs, but there's also a very strong component that's related to our operating performance. Brian Tyler : And then Ricky, this relative to the distribution of the vaccine itself, I mean, I guess probably best to just stick to the facts, I mean we've extended the U.S. government agreement to July of 2023. So to the extent, the U.S. government continues to acquire vaccines and make them available to the public. We will be there, the centralized distributor of those vaccines, should another model emerge and a distributor want to use commercial markets, obviously McKesson continues to have incredible vaccine capabilities in the commercial market as well. We're the leading distributor of the seasonal flu. We support the vaccines for children program. We've got great relationships with community providers all over the country, and we would obviously be anxious, ready and willing to support those commercial efforts as well. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : Next is Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. So if I'm looking at the, the growth, just looking at revenue growth and the pharmaceutical segment and the med-surg segment, trying to back out the, the benefit of COVID just the guidance range, you apparently are growing faster than market you're raising numbers. Is this a macro thing, because we're not seeing utilization necessarily at the levels that you're growing at? Are you just in the right markets? Are you taking share, can you maybe talk about whether it's a competitive dynamics? Is it just that you're in ASCs and all the utilizations moving there on the med-surg side, what's driving your faster than market growth in those two segments? Brian Tyler : Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me parse that out because I think there are some differences between the two segments. In the pharmaceutical segment, we did talk about improved utilization year-over-year. I think if you look at IQVIA [ph] numbers, you'll see that first quarter versus last year, there's approximately 7% growth in prescription transaction volume. So that is significant from what we've seen over the last few years. I also talked about in my remarks that within our U.S. pharmaceutical segment, we are seeing faster growth in our national, retail national account customers. So our largest accounts are growing faster than the market. And that's not something new to this quarter. We've talked about that now for the previous, four or five quarters. We have seen faster growth in those retail national account customers. In our medical business, we have a very strong primary care business and we've talked about the strength that we've had across all the channels and the breadth of products and services that continues. What we did see in the first quarter is really, what I would call an extended flu season. So we talked about higher level of illness in flu sales in the quarter. That was a part of the upside for medical in the first quarter. But overall it's the primary care business continuing to be quite robust and strong. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : Next is Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric Coldwell : Thanks. Can you hear me? Hello? Operator : Yes, we can hear you. Eric Coldwell : Yes, sorry. Thank you. Following on to an earlier question about the OpEx, SG&A control the incredible upside in that number. I guess my follow on or twist would be versus street gross margin was, I think also materially lower those two are offsets. We see this substantial variance in the, the P&L each and every quarter. I think where the streets just way too high on one number and way too low in the other, they offset and all as well. But I was hoping to get maybe a little more color on what in your mind, if you could think about where the street was, why would gross margin be perhaps lower than consensus expectations to a lesser extent than OpEx was upside, but what would be the major gross margin factors or things we should be considering moving forward? Brian Tyler : Well, thanks for the question, Eric. I don't really want to try to project what's in the, the street models, but I will call out a couple things that I did talk about in remarks that I think could be a part of the disconnect, at least for the quarter. The cadence of our European divestiture activity could be a big part of that. We closed our UK retail and wholesale operations in April of 2022. And so when you look at the UK business in the Austrian businesses being divested that drove a significant Delta in gross profit and in operating expenses. In gross profit, if you could exclude the European divestitures, our gross profit to actually increase 9% that was in my initial remarks. The other thing that I would just go back to a prior comment, in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment, we are seeing faster growth from our retail national account customers. And those customers, as we've talked about in prior quarters have lower margins for us than the rest of our book, as you would expect that to have. So, again, our retail national account customers growing a little bit faster than the rest of the book that has a mix impact, but I think the big Delta in this quarter is really the timing and the cadence of these European divestitures. Rachel Rodriguez : Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for \u2013 yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the prescription technology solutions. I recall the comments about, demand is strong and you can then make investments and I guess, what I looking at the guidance though, looks like the revenue growth though, is a little bit down. I might have missed it, but can you remind just mention, what's happening there? Obviously it looks like the \u2013 income guidance is up though. Just if you could just maybe clarify that a little bit? Britt Vitalone : Yes. I'm happy to do that. We're very pleased with the performance in this segment, Brian talked about some of our solutions, our affordability solutions growth has been quite strong when you look at the revenue and the margin guidance versus our first quarter that is purely a result of mix. And so we would expect that our mix would be better as the year goes on. And it has a slight impact on the top line for certain products. So that is a function of mix, but overall, we're very pleased to be able to raise the guidance of profitability within that segment. And that kind of fits with, what we've been focused on, which is these higher growth, higher margin opportunities. Brian Tyler : Yes, I think the key is the, the margin profile of the products and the services themselves is very stable, not improving, but the mix is a pure mix effects. And 3PL tends to be a high revenue, relatively low margin component of this business. Rachel Rodriguez : We have time for one more question, please. Operator : Certainly and that question will come from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good afternoon guys and congrats. Hey, good afternoon guys and congrats on the quarter. Brian, just since you touched on the Sarah Cannon partnership, just curious if you can maybe walk us through how you're thinking about, how that's going to drive growth and how strategically it fits going forward, and maybe the opportunities to expand that relationship with Sarah Cannon given, they're one of the largest cancer groups in the country. Brian Tyler : Yes, sure. We're really excited about this. There were two parts to the acquisition. The first is the JV partnership with HCA, which brings Sarah Cannon and the USOR organizations together in the first instance, I'd say, they're both really very community provider facing organizations, both involved in clinical research. We think that community pharmacy and bringing, I mean, community oncology and bringing the community practices more prominently into clinical trials and the development of new medications is going to be important for all, overall health outcomes. So we look to see tremendous complementary across the brands, across the teams and really across the areas, we've each historically invested in. So we're really excited. We're excited to be partnered with HCA in this initiative. And the second component of that was the acquisition of an asset called Genospace. Really think about that as a complimentary data and analytics complement our other capabilities like Ontada, but this is going to help us do trial matching and recruiting, support clinical decision, support and really just become another component of this oncology ecosystem that we talk about. So we're really excited about this. We're obviously still, in the phase of waiting for regulatory approvals and pending closed, but we're really excited about this and as another important step in building out our community based oncology ecosystem. Brian Tyler : Okay, Rachel that was it. Thanks. Well look, I mean, again, say thank you to everybody for taking time to join our call. Really, appreciate the thoughtful questions. I want to thank Justin for helping facilitate the call. I just wrap by reiterating, we had a really solid first quarter, total company revenue and adjusted earnings per diluted share. We're ahead of our expectations that we laid out in May. I remain confident, I know bridge shares my confidence in our resilient business model and our ability to deliver sustainable growth and generate attractive shareholder returns in FY 2023 and beyond. I want to end again by thanking Team McKesson for their unwavering focus and commitment to our vision, to our strategy and to each other. The support of a strong and dedicated team is the powerful driving force. That helps McKesson transform itself into a diversified healthcare services company and make a meaningful difference for all the patients we serve. Thanks again. I hope you all have a terrific evening. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com, and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thanks, Rachel, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. Today McKesson reported another good core with total company revenues of $70.2 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $6.06. When excluding the contributions from COVID-19 related items and McKesson ventures, our adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 11% from the prior year.  As a result of our second quarter performance and business outlook, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $23.95 to $24.65, to an updated range of $24.45 to $24.95. We're pleased with the financial performance through the first half of our fiscal 2023 driven by continued execution and momentum across the enterprise.  Our core distribution businesses have performed well and shown great resilience and navigating the dynamic macro environment we're all operating in. We continue to strengthen our competitive advantage oncology and biopharma services through both internal investment and acquisition, as evidenced by the recent RX Savings Solutions acquisition and the Sarah Cannon and joint venture with HCA. We have established differentiated positioned to win in both oncology and biopharma services, and our defined growth strategy, combined with our company vision is a powerful reflection of how McKesson has transformed into a diversified healthcare services company.  Today, I'm going to focus my remarks on our strategy and highlight the significant progress we've been making across our four company priorities. Then I'm going to turn it over to Britt, who's going to go into more detail on the business performance in our second quarter. Let me start where I always start, and that's with our focus on people and culture. We firmly believe that having the best talent is essential to our ability to consistently execute and deliver strong operating results. We continue to invest in our people, which allows us to attract and retain talent in a tight labor market.  It's important to us that our employees are provided with the support and flexibility they need to thrive, both in work and in their personal lives. Around this time last year, we were really excited to announce a new Wellness Program at McKesson, we called it your day, your way. And we celebrated the second anniversary this past Friday. It was a great pleasure to give our employees, a company-sponsored day off to promote their mental, physical and emotional well being. We're also committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace, we have a culture where everyone can bring their true authentic selves to work. In October, I signed the CEO letter on disability inclusion, joining a group of inspiring leaders on creating a more inclusive world. This is an important opportunity for McKesson to demonstrate our values and take actions that support our employees and our communities.  Our commitment to diversity is also reflected in our board. Nearly half of our board of directors are women and or people of color. Recently Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, one of the McKesson's independent directors, was presented with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Direct Women Organizations recognizing her contribution to diversity in the boardroom, and excellence in board service. We're grateful for Kathleen's leadership and her inspiration.  Our second company priority is to drive sustainable growth in our core. Our business is built on a strong foundation of pharmaceutical and medical distribution assets and capabilities across North America. In the U.S., the steady performance of pharmaceutical distribution underpins the operating results of the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. In the second quarter segment revenues increased by 12% year-over-year with growth across multiple customer channels. We continue to expand our reach and deliver unique value propositions to all customers.  In July, we hosted our annual ideas share conference that brought together more than 2,100 independent pharmacies. It was a great forum that encouraged knowledge sharing and collaboration and really deeper connections across our Health Mart pharmacies. McKesson has a long history of supporting and investing in independent pharmacies who have and continue to play such an important role in the health of our communities.  We're also proud of the work our retail pharmacy chain partners play in improving access to care. In September, we announced an agreement in principle to extend our relationship with CVS Health to distribute pharmaceuticals to mail order specialty pharmacies, retail pharmacies, and distribution centers. This agreement goes through June 2027. We've been partners with CVS for more than 20 years, and we're extremely pleased to further this longstanding relationship. In addition to pharmaceutical distribution, we also have sustainable core distribution assets in the medical surgical segment. In the second quarter segment adjusted operating profit grew 7% When excluding the impact of COVID 19 related items. The solid performance is primarily driven by our scale and reach across the alternate site market. Through years of intentional investment and expansion, the medical surgical segment has established market leading positions in the primary care and extended care markets.  Following the needs of the patients, we're also expanding our services to other channels such as government, consumer, and direct to home markets, we continue to build out one of the largest most tenured sales forces in the industry. These seasoned sales professionals help foster trust and strategic relationships and bring us closer to our customers.  I also want to remind you that while we continue to execute on the European exit, our strategy for our Canadian operations remains unchanged. The Canadian business performed well in the second quarter, aligning with the company strategy, McKesson Canada is expanding its offering to higher growth higher margin areas including digital health solutions.  Our third company priority is to streamline the portfolio which includes our continued progress and exiting our business operations in Europe. Today we announced the completion of the sale to the Phoenix Group, which includes the operations in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia. We have now successfully exited 11 of the 12 countries in Europe. Norway remains the only country that's not been divested, but we remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives for this business.  Streamline the portfolio is an ongoing process at McKesson. It doesn't end with the European investors. It's really an ongoing practice for us to continually assess our portfolio for strategic alignment. We have a rigorous evaluation process to ensure that the allocation of resources is optimized to generate shareholder return and support long-term growth for the company. We're also focused on streamlining our businesses internally.  We have and will continue to modernize technology, improve levels of automation and simplify business processes. Taking these actions allows our team to execute with more speed and focus and to make our operational processes less labor intensive and more efficient to better serve our customers and their patients.  Building on the foundation of pharmaceutical and medical distribution, let me now expand on our two growth -- strategic growth areas, the biopharma services and the oncology ecosystem. In the biopharma ecosystem, we have a portfolio of differentiated assets that focused on connecting key stakeholders throughout the patient's journey, and reducing prescription hurdles around access, affordability and adherence.  On our last earnings call, we shared with you examples of the affordability solutions within our biopharma ecosystem. While these solutions can help make prescriptions more affordable for patients, McKesson also has significant offering of adherence to specific capabilities. We have a powerful network of over 4,000 field-based nurses who help patients manage therapies at home.  We also have capabilities for in office provider education through groups of experienced field nurse. Our enhanced services helps patients navigate complex medical issues and increase adherence by more than 25%, leveraging our scaled network and connection to the pharmacies, we continue to explore new solutions and opportunities in the adherence space.  To accelerate our growth in biopharma services, we've been assessing strategic opportunities through both internal and external investment. Today, we completed the acquisition of RX Savings Solutions, which is a benefit insights company that reaches more than 17 million patients. McKesson, in fact has been a customer of RX saving solutions for more than a year. And as a result, we've seen significant improvements in medication affordability and adherence for our members or employees, as well as significant savings at the enterprise level. RX Savings Solutions brings a unique portfolio of products and channel access that are complementary to our existing assets. We're excited to leverage our combined resources to create new capabilities around access, affordability and adherence, as well as new outcome management programs for biopharma and payers.  Prescription technology solutions segment has been delivering strong performance in the past year, and we continue to support the growth with investment and talent. We usually ramp up staffing to prepare for the anticipated support needed for annual customer programs. In the second quarter, the timing and cadence of hiring has led to a slight year-over-year decline in adjusted operating profit in this segment. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2023 and beyond, biopharma services remains a large and growing opportunity and we're confident in our differentiated market position that will help us achieve the long-term growth target laid out for this segment. We're also making good progress within oncology ecosystem. On October 31, we completed the transaction that brings together McKesson's U.S. oncology research and HCA's Sarah Cannon Research Institute and a joint venture. The team is energized to work together on integrating the two businesses and we're excited by this opportunity to advance the next generation of cancer care by increasing patient access to clinical trials in the community setting. As part of the transaction, we also acquired Genospace, a leading innovator in precision medicine and clinical trial matching. It will power oncology data and analytics capabilities for the joint venture and bring enhanced solutions to our provider partners. Also within the oncology ecosystem, Ontada, our data and insights business continues to partner with biopharma companies to advanced cancer research.  It was recently announced that Ontada formed a new strategic alliance with BeiGene. Together they will focus on accelerating the development of real world evidence to improve community education, as well as increased patient access to oncology medicines. The oncology ecosystems expanding and becoming an increasingly important driver for the growth of the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. Our leading market position in community oncology distribution allows us to capture the growing market opportunity driven by a strong pipeline in drug launches.  The U.S. oncology network serves approximately 15% of all new cancer patients in the U.S., and we're pleased that the network continues to attract new physicians to expand its reach and impact. The combined effort and progress on our company priorities, our focus on people and culture on driving sustainable core growth on streamlining the portfolio and expanding the oncology and biopharma services ecosystems are the driving force in advancing our growth strategy and generating long term value for our shareholders.  As I review our strategic priorities, I want to make sure I highlight an important part of our enterprise strategy, which is our continued commitment to sustainability and ESG initiatives. As an impact driven organization, we're dedicated to bringing positive changes to our stakeholders and society. While many impactful projects are happening across the enterprise, our focus has included improving access to health care, advancing health, equity, and protecting our environment.  Two years ago, we created our first ever global impact organization, bringing all ESG initiatives under a single business function. We're also enhancing the governance structure to ensure visibility and accountability to these important initiatives. With consultation from the executive steering committee and direct oversight from our board of directors, our ESG initiatives are deeply intertwined with how we operate our business, foster our culture, and define our strategy.  Before I hand it over to Britt, I wanted to make just a few comments on the macroeconomic trends in the general business environment. In the past quarter, we observed stable prescription volumes and patient utilization trends which were in line with our expectations. While the general economic environment remains quite fluid, the demand for health care proves to be fairly resilient and largely impacted. And I would say this is similar to what we've observed in past economic cycles.  We continue to experience cost inflation and some supply chain disruption impacting different parts of our business in different ways. However, through dedicated and well planned actions, we've been able to manage the impact of these macroeconomic factors. Through the first half of the fiscal year, the financial impact has not been material to McKesson, we continue to monitor the dynamic environment and this time, we do not anticipate any incremental impact in addition to what has already been contemplated in our fiscal 2023 outlook.  Let me pull it all together. McKesson reported a solid second quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact from COVID-19 related items and European divestitures we're pleased with the momentum in the underlying business. We've demonstrated our ability to execute for growth and strategic advancement while navigating a quite dynamic macroeconomic environment.  We are confident about our market positions and growth trajectory heading into the second half of the fiscal year. Of course, this isn't possible without a talented team committed to working together in service of our partners and patients. I want to thank all the McKesson employees. Their dedication, their hard work, their innovation, their spirit of collaboration are truly transformative and enabling positive impact to our partners, customers and patients.  With that, I'll turn it over to Britt for additional comments. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid financial results for our fiscal second quarter, which reflect operating execution and progress against our growth strategies. As a result of our fiscal second quarter operational and financial performance, combined with our strong financial position and outlook for continued execution in the second half, we are narrowing and increasing our full year fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share outlook to a range of $24.45 to $24.95.  Let me start with a few company updates before reviewing our second quarter results. During the quarter we made meaningful progress refining and strengthening our portfolio. We completed several key transactions executing against our disciplined capital allocation framework. Let me begin with Europe. As Brian mentioned on October 31, we completed the sale of certain European operations and other assets with the Phoenix Group. We're pleased that we were able to close this transaction sooner than our original fiscal 2023 guidance.  To date we've successfully exited 11 of the 12 European countries that we operated in, and Norway remains the only country that we have not entered into an agreement to sell, and we continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit Norway. Our European exit activities have created a focused portfolio, streamlined capital allocation, and it positions the company for growth in oncology and biopharma services. Next, I'm pleased to report on substantial progress with respect to our oncology and biopharma services growth strategies. Let me start with oncology. In June, we announced an agreement to form a joint venture combining McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA Healthcare Sarah Cannon Research Institute, including the acquisition of Genospace, Sarah Cannon's personalized medicine platform. On October 31, we closed the transaction and successfully formed the joint venture. McKesson has a 51% ownership interest and will consolidate the results of operations within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, beginning with our fiscal third quarter.  This transaction further advances our oncology ecosystem, which contains a broad range of scaled and differentiated assets and capabilities. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate that this transaction will have an immaterial impact on our results. We expect the joint venture and the Genospace acquisition to be $0.10 to $0.20 accretive by the end of fiscal 2026 on an adjusted earnings per share basis. Let me next move to biopharma services. In September, we announced an agreement to acquire Rx Savings Solutions, a prescription price transparency and benefit insight company that offers affordability and adherence solutions to health plans and employers. Today, we announced the completion of the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions, which will be included in our Prescription Technology Solutions segment. The addition of Rx Savings Solutions complements our existing biopharma services assets and supports our vision to improve access affordability and adherence. We anticipate this transaction will represent a modest headwind to fiscal 2023. We anticipate that Rx Savings Solutions will be $0.50 to $0.60 accretive by the end of fiscal 2026 on an adjusted earnings per share basis. As you've heard me say before and as is the case with all our recent acquisitions, we prioritize the deployment of capital towards growth directly on our stated strategies of oncology and biopharma services in a manner that delivers sound financial returns. These transactions represent capital deployment that make both great strategic and great financial sense. Moving to a review of our second quarter fiscal 2023 results. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results on a year-over-year basis, unless I state otherwise. Consolidated revenues of $70.2 billion increased 5%, reflecting growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, which were a result of our European divestiture activities. Gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 7%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 5%, primarily a result of increased volumes in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Operating expenses in the quarter decreased 11%, largely driven by completed European divestitures in the International segment and lower opioid litigation costs. Operating profit was $1.2 billion, a decrease of 6% due to lapping of prior year equity investment gains within McKesson Ventures portfolio and completed divestitures in the International segment, partially offset by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19-related products and net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, operating profit increased 6%. Moving below the line. Interest expense was $55 million in the quarter, an increase of 22% primarily due to the unfavorable impacts in our derivative portfolio as we exit the European region. These impacts were partially offset by a net reduction of debt year-over-year. And the effective tax rate was 19.9% for the quarter. Wrapping up our consolidated results. Second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 144.1 million, a decrease of 8%, resulting from share repurchases in fiscal 2022 and the first half of fiscal 2023. Overall, second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.06, a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year. Moving now to our second quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 12 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $60.1 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, resulting from increased volume of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, which was partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions. Operating profit increased 3% to $756 million, led by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, partially offset by lower demand of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The contribution from our contract with U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.24 per share in the quarter compared to $0.28 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 5%. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, driven by growth in prescription volumes in our third-party logistics business and technology service revenues. Compared to Q1, revenues were lower due in part to the timing of customer-driven promotional activity recognized in the first quarter in our third-party logistics business. Operating profit decreased 2% to $141 million driven by higher operating expenses resulting from the timing of increased head count to support customer annual verification activities, which include hub and patient support programs. Moving now to Medical Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 9%, as growth in the primary care business was offset by lower sales for COVID-19 tests year-over-year. Operating profit decreased 4% to $307 million driven by lower sales of COVID-19 tests, partially mitigated by performance within primary care distribution. Within our Primary Care business, we continue to see the effect of a stronger flu season when compared to the prior year. The contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with the U.S. government for the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of approximately $0.33 per share in the quarter compared to $0.44 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the Medical Surgical Solutions segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues were $6.2 billion and operating profit was $137 million, a decrease of 16%. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues were $6.9 billion, a decrease of 25% and operating profit was $151 million, a decrease of 7%. Second quarter results reflect the year-over-year effect from the divestitures of McKesson's UK and Austrian businesses. Moving on to Corporate. Corporate expenses were $144 million, an increase of 73% year-over-year. During the quarter, we had net losses of $3 million related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to net gains of approximately $97 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. As a reminder, the impacts on consolidated results can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. As a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. The year-over-year impact from our McKesson Ventures portfolio was partially offset by lower opioid-related litigation expenses in the quarter. We incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $9 million in the second quarter, and we anticipate that fiscal 2023 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $50 million. Turning now to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 13. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing and vary from quarter-to-quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents.  During the first six months of the fiscal year, we made $222 million of capital expenditures, which include investment in distribution center capacity and automation and investments in technology, data and analytics to support growth priorities, including our oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. For the first six months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we had negative free cash flow of $56 million and $109 million, respectively. Year-to-date, we returned $1.6 billion of cash to our shareholders, which included $1.5 billion of share repurchases and $139 million in dividend payments. And we have $5.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Let me turn now to our fiscal 2023 outlook. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 15 through 18 in our supplemental slide presentation. And I'll begin with our consolidated outlook. Our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes 3% to 7% revenue growth and 4% decline to 2% growth for operating profit compared to fiscal 2022.  Let me provide updated guidance for contribution from COVID-19 programs. Our revised guidance includes $1.45 to $1.65 of contribution attributable to the following items : $0.60 to $0.70 related to the U.S. government's vaccine distribution in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment; $1 to $1.10 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies in our Medical Surgical Solutions segment; and approximately $0.15 of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. We anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $580 million to $620 million, which includes net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, which we reported in the first half of the fiscal year. As you've heard me say before, it's difficult to predict when gains and losses on the McKesson Ventures portfolio companies may occur, and therefore, our practice has been and will continue to not include the test end Ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance. When excluding the impacts related to the U.S. government's centralized COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, COVID-19 tests and net gains or losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, we anticipate operating profit to increase 4% to 10%. Moving below the line. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million. The increase compared to the prior guidance reflects our intent to Rx Savings Solutions acquisition with new debt. Our anticipated full year effective tax rate of approximately 18% to 20% remains unchanged. And based on our second quarter results and continued solid operating performance, including the contribution from COVID-19-related items, we are increasing and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2023 to a range of $24.45 to $24.95 from the previous range of $23.95 to $24.65. The increased guidance also includes the reduced outlook in our International segment from the earlier-than-expected European closing of the transaction with the PHOENIX Group. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19-related items and net gains and losses from McKesson Ventures equity investments from both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results, our fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings guidance indicates approximately 11% to 14% growth over the prior year. This outlook aligns with the previously communicated long-term growth targets, and it demonstrates the commitment to deliver sustainable growth. Moving now to the segment outlook. We continue to be pleased with the growth we are seeing in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. The breadth of our services and solutions continue to resonate across retail, health systems and provider settings. The value of our core distribution platform was exemplified by the recent agreement in principle to extend our pharmaceutical distribution partnership with CVS Health through June of 2027. We also anticipate further growth across our oncology ecosystem, including a joint venture between McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA Sarah Cannon Research Institute. And we intend to accelerate operating expense investments in the second half of fiscal 2023 to further extend our leadership position in oncology. Our positive outlook on the growth trajectory of this segment is reflected in our updated ranges. We anticipate reported revenue to increase 12% to 15% and operating profit to increase 3% to 6%. As I outlined earlier, our outlook includes approximately $0.60 to $0.70 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution to the U.S. government, a result of the previously disclosed contract extension through July of 2023. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government, we anticipate 5% to 7% operating profit growth, which is above the long-term growth target. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 10% to 16% and operating profit growth of 16% to 22%. We will continue to invest and build capabilities to focus on increasing access, affordability and adherence solutions for patients. The acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions accelerates our capabilities. This segment continues to perform in line with the trajectory assumed in our long-term outlook, and its growth over the last few years reflects the ongoing investment and focus. In the Medical Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decrease 4% to 8% and operating profit to decrease 3% to 6%. As previously mentioned, our outlook includes approximately $1 to $1.10 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government, which incorporates the contract extension with the U.S. government to January of 2023. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items, we anticipate Medical Surgical operating profit to increase 11% to 15%. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 42% to 46% and operating profit to decline by 27% to 33%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we have closed to date, including the recently closed transaction with the PHOENIX Group.  For fiscal 2023, we anticipate our European operations will contribute operating profit of approximately $0.85 to $1 per diluted share primarily in the first nine months of the fiscal year. This includes year-to-date contributions from operations prior to completed sales, our operations in Norway and contribution related to held-for-sale accounting for the transaction with the PHOENIX Group. We are pleased to have closed the transaction with the PHOENIX Group. This transaction closed earlier than we had anticipated, negatively impacting prior operating profit guidance, and is the main driver behind the change in guidance for this segment. Let me conclude my fiscal 2023 outlook remarks with a review of cash flow and capital deployment. In fiscal 2023, our cash flows, including the timing and progression, have been impacted by European divestiture activity and other transactions. For fiscal 2023, we continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. Our free cash flow guidance includes approximately $900 million of negative impacts from our European operations and divested assets. our North American businesses continue to generate strong free cash flow.  Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and our strong balance sheet affords us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently. We will continue to prioritize growth, principally in the areas of oncology and biopharma services, as evidenced by our joint venture with the Sarah Canon Research Institute, the acquisition of Genospace and the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions. We also remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Our outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares in fiscal 2023, which we anticipate will be largely complete by the end of our fiscal third quarter. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of approximately $142 million to $144 million. In summary, we are pleased with our first half fiscal 2023 performance. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies gives us the confidence and visibility to raise our earnings guidance. We continue to create value for our shareowners through solid growth, cash flow generation and return of capital. Our strong leadership and the tremendous ongoing commitment of our people across McKesson gives us confidence that we will continue to deliver sustainable results. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. Question with respect to the strength in pharma on the op profit line, and I think you differentiated that strength coming from provider and health system versus the national account. Can you give us some sense for what you think is going on with the macro trend? If that's continuing to run stronger, how much of this is driven by specialty distribution specifically? And then do you think that there's an element of investments you made in specialty fiscal year '19 to '21 and or ongoing investments that are also helping generate above-market trend? Brian Tyler : Yeah. Eric, it's Brian. I'll jump in and then Britt can add any color that he'd like. I mean, first off, just in terms of kind of overall market trends and expectations, I think I'd characterize it as pretty stable. I think that the volume in terms of prescription transactions that we've been seeing is in line with what we expected at the beginning of the year, probably slightly ahead of where we would have been pre-COVID. I mean there are parts of the market that are still recovering, but as a general characterization, I would say it's pretty stable and pretty good growth. As it relates to some of the McKesson-specific assets, we've spent the better part of 15 years building up our differentiated capabilities in community distribution with particular strength in oncology. And I think as we look at the growth of the oncology pipeline, we think that, that continues to be a strength, certainly supports our growth. We have pretty robust value propositions for our community providers and our hospital partners. We think we bring them solutions to help them do their business better. And so I would just say it's probably a combination of all of those things that are supporting our growth. Biosimilars, while still early, has certainly helped support that growth. And we think we're well positioned to continue to benefit as that trend continues to unfold. Britt Vitalone : Eric, this is Britt. Maybe I'll just make a comment on the investments. We have been investing in this space, and we talked about investments that we were making specifically in Ontada, which has become a really important part of really the breadth of assets and capabilities we have in oncology. And Brian referenced today a strategic alliance that we're forming within Ontada with BeiGene, which is a good example of making investments for future growth.  And we're just going to continue to do that and lean into oncology. We think that we have differentiated assets and really the breadth of services and capabilities we have from distribution, data and analytics, our Ontada business and now with the Sarah Cannon Research joint venture, we feel well positioned to continue to lean in and make investments there. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next is Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I would love to dive into the Prescription Tech Solutions segment a bit, if I can. You talked about some of the hiring that you've done relative to supporting customer actions. I guess maybe a two-part question. One, is that temporary hiring? Or is that people that are going to be on your payroll going forward? And then two, relative to the updated guidance, you took down revenue growth for the segment by 500 basis points but kept EBIT growth. Can you give us a sense on what the difference is between those two levels and how you're able to generate the sustained EBIT performance despite the slower revenue growth? Brian Tyler : Yeah. Sure, Michael. I'll take the first part of that question, and then Britt can take the second part. So relative to the hiring, there is a annual component to some of these programs where we have to reverify patients' eligibility and such. And it is, I guess, you could call it seasonal or a spike, if you will. We don't expect it to be temporary. It's recurring every year. Candidly, as we came into this period with the labor market looking like it was looking we were probably aggressive in trying to make sure we could secure those resources ahead of time. And frankly, we didn't treat as much as we'd want. So I think is a good reflection of McKesson as an employer of choice in the marketplace. But those two things pinched us, but we think we'll work through that over the coming quarters. Britt Vitalone : As it relates to the question on revenue, as we've talked about previously, a large component of the revenue, at least within this segment, is related to third-party logistics services. And that business can often be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And so as we think about the third-party logistics business for the full year, that is really a key driver to the reduction in our revenue. That is lower-margin business, and we've talked about that mix impact in the past. And so as we think about the underlying technology services and programs that we run, the revenue there is still strong and the margins remain quite solid. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : Next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. And good afternoon. I just want to go back to a couple of the comments that you made on the call. One, you talked about stable utilization and demand being resilient. I'm just curious, how are you thinking about the impact of flu? It's been a couple of years since we've had a severe flu season. That's expected, at least based on what we've seen in the Southern Hemisphere. And then secondly, when we think about the impact of the CVS renewal, Brian or Britt, one of the things that have took out to me over the years is that McKesson never calls out a renewal as being a headwind. But I'm just curious, one, is there any impact that you're absorbing from that renewal? And two, are there any incremental services or anything else that you would call out with the relationship with CVS? Brian Tyler : Let me take those in reverse order. So relative to CVS, we're obviously very pleased to extend what's been a long-standing relationship. It's obviously a big relationship. A ton of complexity supporting a customer as sophisticated as CVS. The services that we're providing will largely be unchanged. We're still doing the fulfillment for their mail-order pharmacies for their forward distribution centers for some of their stores. So that's largely unchanged. In terms of the financials associated, we don't comment on the specific customer financials, as you might expect, for lots of reasons. But I will say that we've contemplated the renewal and the guidance that Britt walked you through earlier. And then as it relates to the flu, we are seeing flu season develop. We expect it will probably be more like a pre-COVID flu season than what we've experienced in the last few years. The impact of flu in general, there's various components, three probably. There's the flu vaccines themselves. There's the flu testing and test kits that go around the flu. And then there's any incremental office visits or front-of-store sales associated with cough and cold kinds of medicines. So we're well positioned against each of those. The vaccine component is probably not as important as the flu testing, to be quite candid. But as you know, we are very capable and scaled distributor of flu vaccines, and frankly, all vaccines. And materialize, we think we'll be well positioned to capture that. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator : And next will be Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So you guys normally don't call out very many monthly trends, which I think everybody kind of understands. But back at that investor conference in September, you guys did call out that roughly 7% prescription volume growth across your business in fiscal 1Q ending in June, and you mentioned that July was kind of softer versus that trend.  So I guess, just to put that to bed, was July just kind of an anomaly? Maybe you could just speak to prescription trends kind of exiting the quarter versus what you saw in that July. If July was just an anomaly, it'd be good just to kind of address that and just put that to bed. Thanks. Brian Tyler : Hi, Steve, this is Britt. Thanks for the question. You are correct. We did talk about first quarter prescription volumes on average about 7% year-over-year. When we talked about prescription trends at Morgan Stanley, we were really giving a flash view, and that flash view was predominantly our view on July, which did end up being pretty much an anomaly. It was the lowest point that we've seen for prescription volume transactions in the first six months of the year. On average, in the second quarter, year-over-year, total prescription volumes increased about 4.5%. That's well within the range that we had in our guidance at the beginning of the year. As I mentioned at the conference, we were still seeing transactions in -- within our guidance. So it still remains within our guidance. And as I talked about, the first quarter was just slightly stronger. We were seeing an illness season extend into that first quarter. So 7% on average year-over-year in the first quarter and the second quarter on average, about 4% to 5%. And July ended up being really the low point that we called out at the conference. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : Next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Just a point of clarity on the MedSurg Solutions guidance. Just to -- maybe I missed it earlier. Just -- can you just remind us? You talked about upping the guidance related to the kitting part, the one we look at the -- obviously, top line is better. What were the factors for the decline? Is that just FX-related? Or can you just remind -- maybe I just missed it, I apologize. Britt Vitalone : So let me just see if I can translate this a little bit. The decline is in our AOP. It's a very modest decline from the previous guidance. We're still showing 11% to 15% growth excluding COVID-related items. So that's well above the long-term guidance range that we gave at our Investor Day. So we feel very comfortable with that. There is no FX that runs through the medical segment. So our guidance still remains very solid. Our AOP guidance, excluding COVID-related programs, 11% to 15% is still above our long-term targets that we provided you. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : Next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. In the MedSurg side, you noted growth in the Primary Care business. Can you call out like what's happening there? Is that a change in doc visits? Is it you're able to generate more revenue from primary care? Is it a mix issue? Just any more color on what's happening there, it would be interesting. Brian Tyler : Well, I think it's probably the confluence of all of those things. We talked earlier about the presence of flu in the marketplace for the first time in a while. That certainly helped support the growth there. There's -- the last several years have been quite dynamic, obviously, in terms of missed procedures, electric -- elective procedures, things of that nature. What I would point you to is that the medical business is a very broad business. We have reached into all the alternate-site markets. So it's not just physician office narrowly defined. It's urgent care clinics, it's retail pharmacy-based clinics, it's ambulatory surgery centers. Really anywhere a patient might present in the community to consume medical care, we have reach and support into that customer base. So it's kind of a follow-the-patient kind of strategy. And obviously, as illnesses circulate in the community, that tends to support that business segment. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator : And next will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey, good evening, guys. And I appreciate you taking the question. I guess I'm going to ask one more on the medical segment. I guess I would expect that we're starting to see a decline in utilization as it relates to PPE, which probably is reflected in the updated guide. I guess could you talk, Brian, a little bit about product categories where you're seeing strength and product categories where you might be seeing weakness? Just probably focusing a little less on site of care it. Just would like to know which product categories are reflecting positively versus negatively. Brian Tyler : I mean, generally, I would say -- you asked about PPE. I would say, generally, we think that's been pretty stable. Britt, correct me if I'm wrong, I think we're well into the kind of the massive spikes in the presence of COVID. And so I think that that's been relatively stable. I think it's definitely a portfolio of products. I mean we're supporting pharmaceuticals, we're supporting lab, we're supporting commodity, medical supplies. We obviously have a large mature private brand program, which helps underpin and support our growth as we continue to grow and penetrate that. So I think it's probably all of those factors, no single factor. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator : And this will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Good afternoon, guys. Britt, just a question on the guidance rate on the vaccine and kitting side. Obviously, there's a lot of discussion about how the uptake in the vaccine is pretty slow. So just curious what your assumptions are that prompted you to raise that guidance for vaccinations. Thanks Britt Vitalone : Yeah. Thanks for the question. As we've talked about from the beginning, we take our guidance really from the government, and we factor that in both from a vaccine perspective and as how we support the building of ancillary supply kits. And so as we've talked about at the beginning of the year, we anticipated that the volumes for the program would continue to decline versus the prior year. That is, in fact, the case. They haven't declined as fast as we had anticipated, but they are down year-over-year. They are continuing to come down from prior -- from the fourth quarter. And in our guidance for the rest of the year, we anticipate that the second half will actually be lower than the first half. So we are seeing that the centralized program is beginning to slow down. And we would expect that as our contracts expire, our medical contract expires in January and the vaccine distribution expires in June, that, that will return at that point to the -- not from a centralized program back into a distributor model. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator : And next will be AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. AJ Rice : Thanks. Hi, everyone. Just on your initiative around it's access, adherence and affordability in the biopharma segment, I wonder if you could just walk us through the economic model associated with that. Is it fee-based compensation shared results somehow that you're getting? And then you say the step-up -- you offered the step-up in Rx Savings accretion over the next year is pretty dramatic. What are the milestones to get to that accretion target? Brian Tyler : So I'll start with kind of the business model. I mean in our portfolio today, we have a mix of really transaction-based -- think of it as a click every time a transaction goes through. We have more programmatic models, where you pay for a service over a period of time. And then the Rx Savings Solutions model specifically is more of a subscription-type model. So we really got a nice mix across the segment, and we're quite pleased with that mix. We're really excited about adding the Rx Savings Solutions to our portfolio. They serve about 17 million patients. It's really on point for access and affordability for patients. And we think there's a high complementarity between some of the programs and services that we offer in the legacy business that we can use to augment the value proposition Rx Savings solutions has and use their technology and AI and their really analytics to help support some of the legacy McKesson programs as well. So we're super excited about that, of bringing these assets together. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator : And next will be Liz Anderson with Evercore. Liz Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I appreciate the update you gave us on sort of the pieces -- moving pieces in the Prescription Technology Solutions. Ex what you were talking about in terms of the guidance step-down for the the logistics business, can you talk about how sort of some of those other core businesses in that segment are doing in terms of CoverMyMeds or some of the others that we've heard have contributed over time? Brian Tyler : So I'd say that Britt talked about the mix with 3PL, and I think he rightly characterized that as there's some -- I don't know the word he used, wasn't volatility, but there is some Britt Vitalone : Lumpiness. Brian Tyler : Lumpiness, yeah, that's the right way to describe it. There is some lumpiness in that business. When we look at that business, it's really driven in large part by underlying script demand. We're happy to see growth come back there. It's driven by, in some cases, brand launches and our ability to convince brands that the value propositions we have to help them find patients break down the barriers to get those patients started on therapy and then to keep those patients on therapy, we think has a really great ROI.  So historically, we've been able to grow our portfolio of brands and relationships and it's multiple, multiple hundreds now. So that's an important component of that business to keep that growing. And now with RX Savings Solutions, we think we've got a chance to continue to grow the population or the number of people accessing that platform through expanding relationships with payers and expanding relationships with manufacturers to run more sponsored programs. Rachel Rodriguez : And we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Certainly. That question will come from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks for taking my question, Britt and Brian. So on the HCA JV, I guess, can you speak to how this positions you in the oncology arena? And can you speak to the financials of the deal? I think from a longer-term perspective, you mentioned some 2026 contributions, but maybe some of the near-term contributions there. And will this help to explain the types of deals that you'll be focused on kind of going forward in terms of partnerships and JVs that are relatively open in terms of that versus outright acquisitions? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Thank you for the question. We're really encouraged by the great feedback we've got from the oncology community broadly, including the biopharma manufacturers who are deep in oncology. We think through the combination of these two clinical research networks and really their underlying data and analytic capabilities that this is going to enable us to bring greater efficiency to the drug development process. And we also think, importantly, it's going to help more cancer patients access newer life-saving medications. And oftentimes, in absence of a JV like this in the community setting, it's hard for people to find out they're eligible for a clinical trial and they might be able to benefit from a trial that's going on. We know the uptake in the community setting is much lower. And so we're really excited when we think about the impact this can have on people's lives and helping get communities that are often underserved communities and get those patients enrolled in these programs. So we think this is about enhancing the quality of care by increasing access to novel treatment options. We think it's about helping accelerate the commercial or getting these on new exciting oncolytics to market. And we're excited to have a JV and a relationship with HCA around this. I think one of the things that we would signal to everybody is we've got a very clear strategy. There will be times where we're going to invest organically to activate that strategy. There will be times where we'll do acquisition to activate that strategy, and there are times where combinations like this become, we think, the most effective way to get at activating our strategy. And so we'll have flexibility. We look at every deal on its own and its own merits in terms of its alignment to our strategy and our financial expectations before we decide to move forward with something. In this case, we feel really excited about the partnership with Sarah Cannon and U.S. Oncology Research Network. Britt Vitalone : The one other thing maybe that I would add, just as a reminder for this JV, we will have 51% of the earnings of the JV. And so we'll be recording that. The $0.10 to $0.20 accretion that I referenced is related to that 51% ownership that we have, and it's specific to the combination of this JV and the JV's activities. There are probably a number of synergies that are unrelated to this. There's a flywheel effect of having it and combining it as part of the overall oncology ecosystem that we're not including at this time. So we'll continue to watch this over time as the JV comes together and forms and some of these synergies really come into play, but we're excited about what it's going to bring to the overall oncology business at McKesson. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Britt, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Appreciate the thoughtful questions and your support of McKesson. And thanks to Jenny, our operator, for facilitating the call. McKesson delivered a solid second quarter, really driven by continued momentum in our underlying businesses. I remain confident in our ability to consistently execute on company priorities and to drive sustainable long-term growth. I want to conclude today's call by once again just acknowledging all the great work of Team McKesson. I want to thank each of you for your dedication and what you do every day to help our customers, partners and patients. I'm really proud to be a member and the leader of Team McKesson. Thanks again for joining our call. I hope you all have a terrific evening. Operator : And thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions.  With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Rachel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call this afternoon. Today, we reported third quarter fiscal 2023 results, another quarter with solid adjusted operating profit growth, underscoring the significant progress we continue to make in our company in terms of our overall company priorities. It also signals the continued strength and stability of our North American businesses.  As a result of our third quarter performance and business outlook, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $24.45 to $24.95 to an updated range of $25.75 to $26.15. During today's call, I'm going to highlight the progress we've made across our four strategic priorities. Then I'll ask Britt to provide additional details on the financial performance in our third quarter. As you know, a few years ago, we crafted our enterprise strategy and we shared our priorities with our stakeholders. We are evolving our portfolio of capabilities, and we have divested businesses that are not aligned with our strategy. And we have invested both organically and through acquisitions to add to our differentiated capabilities. We're increasing our focus on the areas where we have deep expertise and that are central to our long-term growth strategy. Our progress to date is underpinned by the execution against these important company priorities a focus on people and culture, intentional efforts to evolve and grow our portfolio of capabilities, to advance and expand our differentiated oncology ecosystem and our biopharma services platform and our commitment towards sustainable core growth.  The strength of our core distribution businesses continued to show solid growth and generate free cash flow, which provides us a strong balance sheet and the ability to invest internally and externally into the business. I'll start with our first priority, our focus on people and culture. Embedded in our daily operations is our purpose, advancing health outcomes for all. McKesson is an impact-driven organization. We recognize that giving back to the community is important to our associates, and we continue to provide engaging and, most importantly, impactful ways for Team McKesson to do exactly that.  In the third quarter, we had another successful Community Impact Day, where nearly 13,000 members of Team McKesson across North America volunteered to support nonprofits that provide food to people facing hunger. McKesson also held its annual Giving Tuesday, where Team McKesson's generosity resulted in $1.5 million in employee donations, with a portion of that matched by the McKesson Foundation, which will ultimately be distributed to 1,500 local, national and global charities.  In addition to the progress made by our employees, the McKesson Foundation donated more than $4 million to pharmacy schools to help increase workforce diversity and improve overall health outcomes for vulnerable populations. These grants, which range from one to five years in duration, will support various pharmacy school education and community outreach programs. The innovative student support, professional development and community outreach that the McKesson Foundation is funding through these pharmacy school partnerships will help transform patient-pharmacist interactions, which we believe will lead to improved health equity and patient outcomes for vulnerable populations in their respective areas. I'm proud of our talented team as their dedication, hard work and innovation enables our business to positively impact our partners, our customers and our communities. Our next priority is to evolve and grow the portfolio. We have continued to evolve and grow our capabilities, ensuring that our capital deployment is tightly aligned with where we have the best growth opportunities. This led us to our decision to exit the European region as well as a handful of smaller businesses over the last several years.  We're progressing on our plans to exit the European region and have successfully exited 11 of the 12 countries we operated in. We remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives for our business in Norway, which is the only country we have not yet divested. These actions allow us to focus our resources on areas that support our long-term strategy. It's provided us additional flexibility to invest internally or to look externally to expand our oncology and our biopharma ecosystems, which aligns well with our next company priority. We have made meaningful progress expanding our oncology and biopharma ecosystems as exemplified by the strategic investments made year-to-date. McKesson recently announced that The US Oncology Network, the U.S.'s largest oncology practice management organization, has continued to expand its geographic footprint with the addition of two new practices, Epic Care in California and Nexus Health in New Mexico. Both are now part of The US Oncology Network as of January 1, 2023. These practices offer a wide range of specialties, enabling more comprehensive care that helps ensure patients can conveniently receive the care they need in their local communities during their entire treatment and healing journey. And we're excited by the new opportunities that our joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute as well as the acquisition of Genospace bring to our overall oncology ecosystem. I'm pleased with the substantial progress we've made in the development and expansion of our oncology ecosystem.  This progress supports the solid performance of the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment as we further our long-term growth strategies. We will continue to evaluate internal and external opportunities to invest, to grow and to evolve this business. In addition to our oncology assets and capabilities, our biopharma services platform remains another priority area of growth. Over the last several years, we've systematically built and acquired an ecosystem of assets that complement on each -- that complement each other and are more valuable together than as separate stand-alone solutions.  Together, these assets leverage our network reach, technology and clinical expertise to enable better access and affordability of medications, which ultimately improves patient outcomes and impacts real lives. We started building this business in 2006 with the acquisition of RelayHealth, which gave us connectivity to over 50,000 pharmacies. We've been able to integrate value-added services right into the workflow so that we can help their processes be more seamless and give the customer the experience they need and deserve.  We then acquired CoverMyMeds, a long-term partner of McKesson in 2017. This expanded our network by providing connectivity with over 750,000 providers. The integration of CoverMyMeds' automation solution alleviates some of the friction out of the workflow providers, improving overall access for the patient. RxCrossroads brought a scale in the business that we already had, a hub services and patient support program, and they expanded our clinical expertise across many new therapeutic areas. In 2020, recall, we brought these businesses together as prescription technology solutions so we can migrate from providing individual offerings to a more comprehensive end-to-end suite of solutions. This enabled us to enhance our value proposition and to help find and get patients started on appropriate therapy more quickly. Most recently, we acquired Rx Savings Solutions, which helps employers and health plans reduce prescription drug costs by utilizing its advanced analytics capabilities. It's more than just price transparency. It really gives members insight and actionable guidance that can drive savings and improve health outcomes for patients. So, by bringing these businesses together, Relay, CoverMyMeds, RxCrossroads, Rx Savings Solutions, our McKesson prescription technology solutions connect pharmacies, providers, payers and biopharma manufacturers for really next-generation patient access, affordability and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated into provider workflows. CoverMyMeds now processes approximately 21 billion pharmacy transactions annually on behalf of patients to support medication access and affordability. We continue to build and invest in innovative products that allow McKesson to provide unique insights and capabilities to our customers.  And these investment dollars are reflected in our results in the segment year-to-date as well as in our fiscal 2023 outlook. During the third quarter, we continued to organically invest in this segment as we position our products and services for sustainable long-term growth. The investments have enabled us to expand the network and connectivity, develop new solutions and meet the growing demands of our customers. While we continue to invest and grow the platform, we're also always assessing opportunities to evolve and streamline the portfolio to ensure our resources and investments are focused on the products that bring the most value to patients.  This business saw substantial momentum coming out of COVID-19 pandemic as our biopharma manufacturers continued to bring more brands to our platform and prescription utilization trends continued to improve. These factors led to strong adjusted operating profit growth in this segment in recent fiscal years. We remain confident in the overall trajectory in this segment and our financial target of 11% growth. And we will continue to reinvest profit into this business to accelerate this business over the long term. The investments made in our oncology and biopharma ecosystems have been possible largely due to the long-standing growth in our sustainable core distribution businesses, which are our fourth company priority.  As we exit the European region, we've been able to focus our efforts on our North American businesses. Our teams are continuously evaluating how to drive efficiencies in our core operations. Whether that's leveraging a more modernized platform, it allows us to act with more speed and agility or ensuring we have the optimal talent and resources to help these businesses succeed. The fundamentals of our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segment remains strong. The work that Team McKesson has done to streamline process and efficiencies, combined with positive prescription volume and patient utilization trends, reinforces our confidence in our long-term growth for our North American distribution businesses. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical business, I'm excited to announce that our contract to extend our pharmaceutical distribution partnership with CVS Health through June of 2027 has been finalized. Our long-standing partnership with CVS further exemplifies the value of our scaled distribution capabilities.  The performance of the core operations in our North American distribution business enables strong cash flow generation that's allowed McKesson to continue to innovate and become a leading diversified health care services company. We believe we've made significant strides against our strategic priorities to focus on our people and culture, to grow and evolve the business, to invest in our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem underpinned by the sustainable core growth in our distribution businesses. Let me shift gears just a bit. McKesson has also made progress recently to address environmental sustainability. In January, McKesson received approval by the Science Based Targets initiative for its near-term climate change targets that contribute to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.  Our SBTi target serves as another example of our commitment to sustainability and our response to climate change. We look forward to leveraging the advancements in climate related technologies that will address these environmental challenges while also enhancing our business and helping to fulfill our company purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. We will, of course, continue to provide updates on our progress to stakeholders on these targets as well as our ongoing ESG-related initiatives on future calls. As an organization, we're also committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion. McKesson was recently recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greatest workplaces for diversity in 2023. We're quite honored that Newsweek recognizes McKesson's ongoing efforts to be a more diverse and inclusive employer. All right, let me wrap things up. We are pleased with our solid results in the third quarter as we delivered on our growth strategy and as a diversified health care services company. McKesson's talented employees continue to demonstrate exceptional performance, and our third quarter results reflect their dedication and our execution together as a team in a dynamic operating environment. It also highlights the resiliency of our portfolio of businesses and solutions. Thank you all for your time. With that, Britt, I'm going to toss it over to you for additional comments on the financial results. Britt Vitalone : Well, thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our solid fiscal third quarter financial results reflect continued strong execution and momentum, advancing our company priorities. In the fiscal third quarter, we delivered solid growth across our North American segment, led by strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments.  And we continue to evolve and grow our diversified portfolio through focused and strategic investments in oncology and biopharma services. As a result of our solid financial performance and confidence in the underlying business, we are increasing and narrowing our full year outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share to a range of $25.75 to $26.15. Before I provide more details on our third quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP adjusted results, I want to point out two items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. First, we received proceeds of $129 million related to our share of an antitrust class action settlement. We recognized the gain within cost of sales in the third quarter. And second, we recognized a pretax gain of $97 million from the termination of fixed interest rate swaps. This gain is included under other income in the third quarter. Let's move now to a review of our third quarter non-GAAP adjusted results on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated revenues of $70.5 billion increased 3%, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment resulted from increased specialty product volumes, including retail national account customers, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, resulting from the completed divestitures of McKesson's European businesses. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 11%. Gross profit was $3 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 10%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 7%, primarily a result of growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Operating expenses in the quarter decreased 14%, largely driven by completed European divestitures in the International segment. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 9%. Operating profit was $1.4 billion, an increase of 9%, driven by a pretax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of a tax receivable agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare and due to growth across North American businesses led by the strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. As a reminder, McKesson was a party to a TRA entered as part of the formation of the joint venture with Change Healthcare. Under the terms of the TRA, Change was generally required to pay McKesson a portion of net tax savings resulting from amortization by the joint venture.  In October of 2022, Change exercised its right to terminate the agreement and paid McKesson $126 million. Consistent with our prior practice recognizing similar items, this benefit is reflected in other income in both our GAAP and adjusted operating results in the quarter. Moving below the line, interest expense increased to $69 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher interest rates and unfavorable impacts in our derivative portfolio as we exit the European region. And the effective tax rate was 23.4% for the quarter. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items. For the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%. Wrapping up our consolidated results. Third quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was approximately 141 million, a decrease of 8%, resulting from share repurchase activity. Overall, third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.90, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. When excluding the impacts from COVID-19-related items and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 6%. Moving now to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 12 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where revenues were $61.9 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, resulting from increased volume of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, branded pharmaceutical price increases and strength in oncology, which included increased patient visits, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Operating profit increased 6% to $778 million. Our contract with U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.25 per share in the quarter compared to $0.26 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, contributions from our generics programs, and improvements in pharmaceutical prescription volumes and oncology visits. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, driven by increased prescription volumes, faster growth in our third-party logistics business and higher technology service revenues. Operating profit increased 7% to $155 million, driven by growth in access affordability and adherence solutions, partially offset by continued organic investments as we position our products and services for sustainable long-term growth. Next, moving on to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3 billion, a decrease of 3%. Lower volumes of COVID-19 tests and kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program partially offset the growth in the Primary Care business. Operating profit increased 2% to $336 million. The contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with the U.S. government for the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of approximately $0.38 per share in the quarter as compared to $0.57 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivered operating profit growth of 25%, driven by growth in the Primary Care business and favorable sourcing activities, which partially offset lower volumes of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies from the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program. Next, let me address our International results. revenues were $4.4 billion, and operating profit was $143 million, a decrease of 36%. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were $4.9 billion, a decrease of 48%, and operating profit was $158 million, a decrease of 29%. Third quarter results reflect the year-over-year effect from the divestiture of the European businesses. Moving next to corporate. Corporate expenses were $19 million, a decrease of 88% year-over-year, driven by the early termination of a tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare and lower opioid-related litigation expenses. Excluding the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement, corporate expenses decreased 9%. Additionally, we incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $9 million in the third quarter, and we anticipate that fiscal 2023 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $50 million. Turning now to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 13. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing and vary from quarter-to-quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents.  During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we made $376 million of capital expenditures, which includes investments in distribution center capacity, automation and regulatory enhancements and investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities, including our oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. For the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we had free cash flow of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. During the quarter, we allocated $833 million towards M&A activities, including a joint venture with the Sarah Cannon Research Institute and the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions.  We also returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, including $2 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we returned $3.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $3.5 billion of share repurchases and $216 million in dividend payments. At the end of our fiscal third quarter, we had $3.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Let me turn to our fiscal 2023 outlook. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 15 through 18 in our supplemental slide presentation. And I'll begin with our consolidated outlook. Our revised guidance assumes 3% to 7% revenue growth and 2% to 6% operating profit growth as compared to fiscal 2022.  Our guidance includes $2.30 to $2.50 of contribution attributable to the following four items : $0.70 to $0.80 related to the U.S. government's vaccine distribution in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment; $1.10 to $1.20 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting storage and distribution ancillary supplies in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment; approximately $0.15 related to year-to-date net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments; and a $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare.  As a reminder, our contracts with the U.S. government for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies extends through July of 2023. We anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $435 million to $475 million, which includes net losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, which we recorded in the first three quarters of the fiscal year, and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, which was recognized in the third quarter. As a reminder, our practice has been and will continue to not include McKesson Ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance. When excluding the impacts from COVID-19-related items, net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, we anticipate operating profit to increase 7% to 11%, above the previous operating profit growth target. Moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million. The increase compared to the prior guidance reflects the higher interest rate environment. Our anticipated full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%, 20% remains unchanged. Based on our third quarter results and our outlook for the fiscal year, we're increasing and narrowing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share to $25.75 to $26.15 from the previous range of $24.45 to $24.95. When excluding the impacts of COVID-19-related items, net gains and losses from McKesson Ventures equity investments for both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results and the fiscal 2022 benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance indicates approximately 13% to 16% growth over the prior year. Moving now to the segment outlook for fiscal 2023. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we anticipate reported revenue to increase 12% to 15% and operating profit to increase 5% to 8%. As I outlined earlier, our outlook includes approximately $0.70 to $0.80 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government.  When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government, we anticipate 7% to 9% operating profit growth. We are pleased with the momentum of the segment. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution business continues to deliver stable growth through focused execution and operational excellence. Let me highlight a few of the factors that are leading to the strong segment performance. First, we've observed stable prescription utilization growth, which underpins the momentum in our health system and retail offerings. Second, we maintain a favorable outlook for our oncology platform, which we see delivering higher growth and higher margin contributions.  We continue to execute and invest against our oncology strategy. As Brian touched on earlier, we continue to add practices and providers to our scale and growing US Oncology network, and we are well positioned to capture increased oncology volumes. Third, we have a scaled an efficient generic sourcing operation, delivering stability of supply and low-cost products for our customers and patients. And specific to fiscal 2023, through the month of January, we observed branded pharmaceutical pricing that was modestly above our expectations. While fiscal 2023 results benefit from this modest increase, I would make the following two comments : first, the impact from higher branded pharmaceutical pricing remains less material now than historically, as more than 95% of our manufactured contracts are now on a fixed fee-for-service arrangement; and second, we would not anticipate this modest benefit to repeat in future years. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment is well positioned and has exhibited strong performance, leading to the increased fiscal 2023 growth outlook. As a result of our execution and the factors that I just noted, we anticipate that this segment will now grow above the 4% earnings growth target rate that we previously provided, including at our 2021 Investor Day. The products and services within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered differentiated access adherence and affordability products. We are pleased with the solid growth in both revenue and operating profit this quarter. Biopharma Services remain an important strategic growth and investment area for McKesson. We're confident this segment will exhibit faster growth and higher margin. We remain confident in our differentiated assets and capabilities. We have unmatched scale across transactions, provider and retail connectivity and product breadth. Our commitment to this segment is evidenced by the investments that we have made. Over the past three years, on average, we've organically invested approximately $100 million a year into new and existing products and services. And the recent acquisition of Arc Statement Solutions will accelerate the breadth of capabilities we continue to build out.  We also anticipate further organic investments in new capabilities as well as more M&A. The internal investment pattern, the mix of technology products and third-party logistics services and the life cycle of the products we serve, including the timing of launches, have resulted in variability in performance quarter-to-quarter. As we continue to invest and grow the business, we anticipate that there could be charges to further integrate product portfolios and supporting infrastructure. We anticipate delivering revenue growth of 10% to 16% and operating profit growth of 14% to 17%, which is in line with the 14% to 20% initial guidance that we communicated on our May 2022 earnings call and above the operating profit growth target of 11% provided at our Investor Day event in 2021. We are well positioned for strong growth, and we're committed to the operating growth targets that we've previously communicated. In the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decrease 1% to 5% and operating profit to decrease 1% to 4%. As previously mentioned, our outlook includes approximately $1.10 to $1.20 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items, we anticipate Medical-Surgical operating profit to increase 12% to 15%. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 42% to 46% and operating profit to decline by 26% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions that we have closed to date. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate our European operations will contribute operating profit of approximately $0.90 to $0.95 per diluted share, primarily in the first nine months of the fiscal year. This includes year-to-date contributions from operations prior to completed sales, our operations in Norway and the contribution resulting for held-for-sale accounting for the transaction with PHOENIX Group. Let me conclude our outlook with a review of cash flow and capital deployment. We continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. In fiscal 2023, our cash flows have also been impacted by European divestiture activities and other transactions. As discussed last quarter, our free cash flow guidance includes approximately $900 million of negative impacts from our European operations and divested assets. We remain committed to be good stewards of capital for our shareholders. We have and will continue to take a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We strategically think about capital allocation in three broad categories. First, we prioritize growth by investing internally and through M&A. We are focused on accelerating our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services. These growth platforms have differentiated asset scale and network capabilities. Next, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through a combination of our growing dividend and share repurchases. And the third piece of our framework is a strong balance sheet and adequate liquidity underpinned by the maintenance of an investment-grade credit rating.  Our outlook continues to incorporate plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares, which has been largely completed by the end of our fiscal third quarter. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $142 million. Let me take a moment and reflect on the fiscal 2023 outlook and our growth targets. At our 2021 Investor Day event, we shared with you a set of growth metrics that reflect our commitment to drive continued momentum across the business segments. Since then, we've executed on our strategy and delivered operating profit growth consistently at or above the targets that we communicated on a consolidated and on a segment level. Some of the business dynamics that we outlined previously have materialized as tailwinds and contributed to recent growth, including growth in prescription volume and patient mobility, our ability to grow through macroeconomic unpredictability and successful execution on a disciplined capital deployment strategy that focuses on growth and maximizing shareholder return.  More importantly, the solid performance is further demonstration of our shareholder value creation framework. We continue to be focused on profitable growth and efficient deployment of capital. Our 24% return on invested capital illustrates our focus on shareholder value creation. In closing, we are pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter. We continued to deliver solid operating results through focused execution and strategic investment. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our disciplined growth strategy and financial framework give us the confidence we will deliver on our operating profit growth targets.  Thank you. And now with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Thanks for everyone. Diving into the Prescription Technology Solutions business a bit, I know it continues to evolve in terms of the assets that you've put in place, continued organic investment you make. As you think about the ability to continue on sustain the pathway of your long-term growth targets, how much are you working on in terms of the dynamics of visibility within your own business, not just to the Street, but ensuring that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, some of the, I guess, I'd call it, lumpiness that we've seen in the last couple of quarters can smooth itself out. And how will this business evolve on that front in terms of that level of visibility and your ability to continue to convert successful sales, successful organic investment into the sustained long-term growth rate. Brian Tyler : Great question. I'll let me kick it off first. I'd say we continue to be pleased with the performance of this business. And we've got revenue growth of 9% year-over-year, AOP growth of 7% this year. Last two years have been particularly strong for this business. And what you find is as you continue to add capabilities into this business, we find opportunities for new ideas, new invention, reinvention, sometimes reprioritization of the projects. But we shared at Investor Day, we think this is a $15 billion-plus market opportunity in access affordability and adherence. And we see a relatively long runway and we feel pretty confident in our 11% target growth for this segment. Now there are things that naturally happen in this business that may make it. I think your word was lumpy. Maybe that was our word. It became your word. Things like the recovery pace of underlying prescription volumes. The commercial success of some of the projects we partner with as they underachieve or overachieve their expectations, loss of exclusivity events. Our investments, I mean, we've made significant investments in this business over the last three years. We see continued opportunity to do that and that's not always completely smooth. I mean, the nature of those opportunities is going to be variable. Our process is to make sure that we've got disciplined line of sight, financial expectations and that those are prudent and good investments to make to sustain the growth in this segment long term. Britt Vitalone : And Mike, maybe what I would add is while we have seen a little bit of variability quarter-to-quarter, one of the things that is just inherent in this business and we talked about this is the annual customer verification process that we do for a lot of our customers, and that usually happens in the fourth quarter.  What I would say, though, is that what we are pleased with, if you go back to the guidance that we gave you at the beginning of the year in May, 14% to 20%. The guidance that we're giving you now to finish the year is really within the balance of that guidance. It's been, as I said, a little bit of variable quarter-to-quarter, but it's really in line with the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. And we're really pleased that while we've been investing in this business, both organically and through M&A, that we're seeing this business develop above the long-term target rates that we gave you at Investor Day.  So while we've seen a little bit of -- a little more variability this year quarter-to-quarter than we may have seen historically, when you look at it on an annual basis and you look at it over the long term, which is how we manage the business, we're seeing this above the long-term target rates that we gave and really in line with the initial guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. Operator : And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Good afternoon everyone. I hope everyone is safe in Texas. Just wanted to go back to a couple of comments that you made around U.S. drug distribution. One would be the renewal with CBS through 2027. Just want to understand if there's anything new or nuance to that relationship? And then secondly, as we think about oncology within U.S. drug distribution, Britt, I don't know if it was you or Brian that made the comment that you're going to see higher growth and higher margin there. At what point does that become big enough that, that actually drives the margin? Or is that part of what we're seeing in the margin improvement today? Just any kind of guardrails you could give us around how to think about that on a go-forward basis as that business continues to grow. Brian Tyler : Sure. Look, we were obviously -- I think last quarter, we shared we had a binding LOI with CVS. We've just finalized that contract work, Lisa. We've been partnering with CVS for a long time. We're incredibly proud to support the work they do and be affiliated with them. I would not say that the services that we're providing has materially changed. And so, we're thrilled to have the opportunity to extend that to 2027. In terms of oncology, I mean, we call it an ecosystem because we think it all sort of reinforces each other. So, as we do things like bring practices into the network, that gives us more access to data, which supports oncology. It gives us more purchasing power and it supports our GPO business.  And so, we've been really pleased with the progression in the oncology business and our ability to scale out in each of those dimensions. But each piece does help to reinforce the other piece. And we continue to think oncology is a very large market opportunity, in excess of $50 billion, and that we have the assets that position us quite well to succeed in the long term here. Britt Vitalone : And Lisa, maybe what I would add, what we've done over the last year or two through the development of Ontada, through the partnerships with Sarah Cannon Research Institute and Genospace, we're moving up the value chain. And so, we're leveraging the scale that we have in The US Oncology Network, the distribution scale, the GPO scale that Brian just talked about. We're adding more practices as Brian referenced earlier. And by moving up the value chain with more scale, we're very optimistic that, that's going to add to margin over the coming years. Operator : And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. I appreciate the commentary on fiscal year '23 relative to long-term guidance targets. I believe last year at this time, you provided a little bit of forward commentary in advance, the formal guidance on the factors that might be worth keeping in mind as we all model fiscal year '24. What would you call out relative to those items that have been helping '23 and may or may not drive you above/below long-term guidance next year? Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question, Eric. I tried to address a little of that in my comments but maybe I can capture it here. I think there's really a handful of items that we think could be impactful as we go forward. Clearly, we talked about the stabilization of prescription transactions and patient mobility and utilization seems to be quite stable. We saw prescription volume growth of about -- roughly about 5% in our third quarter, so that seems to be in line with what we've seen in the last few quarters. Certainly, biosimilar acceleration. We're going to see more biosimilars coming to market. We've got just over two dozen that are on the market today and more are coming. Some recent announcements certainly back that up. I'd say the timing and size of the growth investments that we make and really the timing of our integration, some of the acquisitions that we made, we think could be very impactful in a positive way. And then I think there are a handful of other items. The trajectory of COVID, we think that, that's going to go into the commercial pipeline here in 2023. Our contract goes through July of 2023. It doesn't mean that those services and products are going to go away.  So, the pace and trajectory of that will certainly be impactful. And we have a very strong balance sheet. We expect to continue to deploy that balance sheet in a very capital-accretive way, whether that's returning to shareholders or, as you've seen us do here recently, more towards acquisitions that are right on strategy. And clearly, we had the opportunity to invest organically as well. So, there's a lot of really positive things that are going on. There are some things that could go the other way in terms of trajectory of COVID as an example. But we feel like we're really well positioned against all of those items. Brian Tyler : Yes. I mean, the macro backdrop remains a bit dynamic, right? We've got China open, China closed, inflation, obviously, workforce dynamics we've dealt with. We've successfully, I think, contemplated that in our FY '23 guidance. Did not really assume any material impact and I think it's played out that way, and we'll be thoughtful about those as we go into '24 as well. Operator : And next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch a little bit on the Medical segment. Obviously, if we back out COVID, very strong growth here. And just wanted to dig a little deep to understand what's driving it? I know you mentioned the Primary Care business. But maybe you can go a little deeper into that. Is that a -- is there any changes in product mix? Or is this -- because I don't think its probably volume growth per se, but I think about your customers and their growth or new customer wins. Anything that you can kind of call out there would be helpful. And because the 25 obviously, is higher than the full year. And how should we think about that, maybe to Eric's question earlier, about thinking about '24 as well. Brian Tyler : Go ahead, Britt, you want to take it? Britt Vitalone : Yes. I would say that in the quarter, we identified that we had some strength in some of our sourcing programs, and that's really what drove above the trend that we've been seeing for the last really several years now. At our Investor Day, we talked about a long-term target rate of around 10%. We certainly are growing a little bit faster than that this year. Certainly, the volumes have been strong. And obviously, the sourcing programs were really a good contributor in the quarter. I think as you think about going forward, clearly, we've given the guidance for '23. But I would anchor you around the long-term growth rates that we've seen now really for the last three to four years. Those are good growth rates. They are good margins within this business. And we think that the Primary Care business is really going to be supportive of that 10% growth rate going forward. Operator : And the next question will be from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Thanks for taking my question. Britt, I'm going to ask you to double check my math on this, which is if I look at your guidance for the Pharma segment for the full year, you're basically -- you have it growing 200 basis points faster for the balance of the year ex COVID, which I assume if I annualize, is going to look like something greater than 6% versus preliminary expectations or at least going into the quarter. I guess, could you talk about what's driving that at the core? And can we think about kind of the sustainability of the pockets of strength you're seeing in that business? Thank you. Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thanks, George. So, we did raise the guidance for the full year to 7% to 9%, excluding COVID-related items, and we're very pleased with the performance of the segment. As I talked about in my comments, there's really a number of factors here. We've got stable prescription utilization. As I mentioned, we saw -- we're seeing about 5% based on IQVIA data in the third quarter. We're certainly seeing strength in our oncology platform. I think we just talked about some of the factors that are driving that. We're adding practices and we're certainly moving up the value chain from that perspective. And we're seeing growth, really stable growth in specialty providers as well as in health systems. And so, all of those things are performing quite well. And that's also why I talked about that we're expecting now that we're going to grow faster than long-term target growth rate that we gave you at Investor Day and that we've reaffirmed in previous quarters. So, I think all of those things are really positive contributors. And that's why we're seeing faster growth than we would expect, faster than the 4% long-term target growth rate that we gave you previously. Operator : And next will be Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I guess, separate from all of the helpful color around the COVID profit streams, are you able to comment just on how much flu may have been a key factor in the earnings upside in the quarter, either in the Pharma segment or the Medical segment? Thank you. Britt Vitalone : As we've talked about previously, this has been a stronger flu season that we've seen historically. It really started in our first quarter. We talked about in our first quarter that there was an extension of the illness season from our fiscal 2022. It's not a material driver to the enterprise. It certainly does drive more visits. We're seeing that the illness season is driving not only vaccines and test flu test kits but also some combo kits, which is -- which started last year.  So, it's not a material driver to the enterprise. It certainly does drive more foot traffic and that certainly is beneficial to other products and services that we have, not only in Medical but in Pharma. Operator : And next question will be from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Thank you, guys. I guess just to follow up on Lisa's question and Britt's comments on the oncology side. It sounds like you guys are looking to get more aggressive with the roll-up of Oncology Networks, and it seems like there's consolidation there.  So, as I think of catalysts and maybe like big moves in that space, I mean, do you see opportunity with -- or should we be thinking about the Sarah Cannon partnership as an opportunity that could bring a big chunk of new doctors into the network in the coming years? Or how should we be thinking about that? Thank you. Brian Tyler : Well, oncology is clearly one of the key growth priorities we've identified for the company and talked a lot about over the last years. And there are various capabilities within our oncology ecosystem, distribution as an anchor, GPO as an anchor, our practice management business you saw on clearly important and the innovation we've done around Ontada and the most recent addition of Genospace and the Sarah Cannon joint venture. So, we think all of these things sort of add to our differentiation, add to the attractiveness of McKesson as a service provider and a partner in this area. We've been really happy to be continuing to add to the growth of the US Oncology Network. We do it in a very disciplined way.  We have a model that works for us and any acquired practices need to be able to operate consistent within that model. But it's clearly our actions this last quarter indicate, we have opportunities to continue to grow and expand. And we think that, that's part of our model and we expect that we can continue that into the future. Rachel Rodriguez : And we have time for one more question, please. Operator : That question will come from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: Thanks for everyone. Maybe just to get you to expand, if possible, a little bit more on your comments around specialty and the development of biosimilars. I guess if you look out over the next few years, we have a significant number converting. I know it depends in your business on how that drug is administered today and how it's -- the patient receives it but as to how much benefit you'll derive. But is there a way to talk about how you see that progressing over time? And then maybe another aspect of that is we hear from a number of players that they're expecting to put more resources behind specialty and grow. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of how you assess the competitive landscape at this point and your positioning? Brian Tyler : Well, I would start by saying that the contributions from biosimilars has been increasing over the past years. We do think the pipeline holds a lot of promise. It continues to strengthen, and we think this could be a long-term opportunity really exists in front of us. I mean to date, there's 40 approved biosimilars, 25 launched, I guess, maybe 26 because if you count today's news on HUMIRA. And the impact of those are going to really be dependent on the rates of adoption, things like the interchangeability. For us, clearly, the channel will matter. Part B is we have more services to offer and more support we can provide to those biosimilars in Part B, Part D will be less impactful. But I think we continue to look at the majority of the opportunity being ahead of us. I do think this market is still young, and I think as people get more experience with biosimilars, we would be hopeful that adoption rates would continue to accelerate. But it depends on things like pricing strategies that the innovator adopts and the biosimilar comes to market with. So, there's a lot of dynamics that I think are still playing out like they always do in a young market. But we're in the very early days, and we believe biosimilars will be good for our business model going forward. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call this evening. Appreciate, as always, the thoughtful questions. I want to thank Carrie, our operator, for facilitating this call. Let me just wrap up by saying McKesson delivered really good third quarter results. And it's really driven by the continued momentum in our underlying business. I'm confident in our ability to consistently execute on our company priorities and drive sustainable long-term growth as a diversified health care services company. None of this is possible without Team McKesson, so I'd like to thank everyone for their dedication, for the big and small actions they take every day to help our customers, our partners and our patients. I'm proud to be a member of and the leader of Team McKesson. Thanks again, everyone, for joining our call. I hope you all have a great evening. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to McKesson's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Nicole Kramer, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Nicole Kramer : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com, and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for our call today. Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter results, closing out a very successful fiscal 2023. We delivered full year revenues of $277 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $25.94. When excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 15% from the prior year, driven by momentum across all business segments. In fiscal 2023, team McKesson made significant progress executing our company priorities and advancing our position as a diversified healthcare services company. We grew our biopharma and oncology platforms through a balance of strategic partnerships, acquisitions and internal investments. We delivered growth in the core distribution businesses and we divested the majority of the operations in Europe, furthering our goal to streamline and optimize the portfolio. As we close out fiscal 2023 and look ahead, we're confident in our ability to carry the business momentum forward, and we're excited to update and increase our long-term adjusted segment operating profit growth targets. This is a testament to our strategic focus, consistent execution and confidence in the outlook of the business. Building off our differentiated assets and capabilities, we are well-positioned to deliver strong sustainable growth in the years ahead. Britt will later walk you through more of the financial details, including fiscal 2024 outlook and the updated long-term growth segment targets. I wanted to start my remarks today though with the foundation of all of our strategies, which is our focus on people and culture. Our talent is critical to everything that we do at McKesson. We strive to be the best place to work in healthcare and we're building a culture that not only unites the team, but empowers them to innovate and succeed. One of the important commitments we have to our employees is to create a workspace where everyone can be comfortable to work at their very best. In the past quarter, at McKesson, we celebrated Black History Month in February and Women's History Month in March with many great, great employee-led events. I had the opportunity to participate in many of these and I'm energized by the dedication and passion our employees have demonstrated towards promoting awareness and listening and supporting each other as Team McKesson. We have a strong employee value proposition and our progress in creating the best place to work is being recognized externally. Recently, we were pleased to be named by Forbes as one of America's Best Large Employers, earning the third highest ranking in healthcare. We were also named by Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Places for Work for Women among many, many more recognitions. I'm very proud of the accomplishments, togetherness and the alignment of our team. Our second company priority is to drive sustainable core growth. In US Pharmaceutical, the core pharmaceutical distribution business continues to support the growth momentum of the segment. In fiscal 2023, the segment revenue increased 13% and adjusted operating profit excluding COVID-19 related contributions increased 8%, representing the highest profit growth rate since we formed this segment. We renewed our longstanding relationship with CVS and delivered strong value propositions to support customers across all channels, partnering with them to help solve their most immediate business needs. Our ability to consistently deliver high-quality services is supported by our deep expertise in pharmaceutical distribution and scaled network of assets. We continue to invest in the infrastructure to improve efficiency and modernize the network in support of our growth and in pursuit of efficiencies. In October 2022, we opened a new state-of-the-art pharmaceutical distribution center in Ohio. This is one of our most technologically advanced facilities. It leverages automation to increase efficiency, increased productivity and enhance the employee experience. Leveraging our scaled distribution network and logistics expertise, we have supported the US government and its initiatives of distributing COVID-19 vaccine and the kitting and storage of ancillary kits. Both government contracts are scheduled to expire in July of 2023. Looking back at the past two years, Team McKesson has demonstrated incredible agility, dedication and commitment in standing up the operation and in distributing millions of life saving vaccines across the country. We've gained invaluable experience, deepened our relationship with government partners and proven our value capabilities and expertise. The next priority I want to talk about is our priority to expand the oncology and biopharma platforms. Through years of focused investment and execution, we have built differentiated assets and capabilities in oncology and in biopharma services, and we've strengthened our market positions in these high-growth and high-margin areas. I'll start with the oncology platform. One of the pillars of our oncology platform is the distribution capability. We are the leading distributor in the community oncology market with a scale reached providers in the community setting. Biologics, our specialty pharmacy supports more than 3,500 specialty practices with cancer and other rare disease medications. Through our GPO services, Onmark and Unity, we serve thousands of oncology physicians and deliver significant savings on oncology drug purchases for practices, both within the US Oncology Network and other community-based practices. Fiscal 2023 has been a year of significant growth for our practice management business. The US Oncology Network welcomed three new practices, Epic Care, Nexus Health, and most recently, the Regional Cancer Care Associates as effective as of April 1st, 2023. With these additions, the number of providers grew by more than 450 to a total exceeding over 2,300. This represents the fastest growth period since we acquired the US Oncology Network in 2010. These new practices expand the reach of the network into new geographies and enhance its commitment to providing high quality care close to home. In addition, through the expansion and footprint, we continue to empower the growth of individual oncology practices to ensure that they are at the forefront of cancer care. Physicians in the network stand out as thought leaders in the industry with participation and leading publications and leadership roles within the industry. The network also plays a leading role in the transformation to value-based care, including its participation in the oncology care model. In October 2022, US Oncology Research formed a joint venture with HCA's Sarah Cannon Research Institute, creating a fully-integrated oncology research organization. We expect this transaction to accelerate our oncology strategy, expand clinical research and increase access to clinical trials for community oncology providers and more importantly for patients. We are pleased with the performance across the oncology platform and we believe our differentiated set of assets allows us to be a key partner of choice across both providers and biopharma companies. In addition to the momentum in the oncology platform, we're also making significant progress in growing our assets and capabilities in the biopharma platform. We continue to enhance the way as patients get their medications by improving access, affordability and adherence to prescription medications. In this past year, we managed programs that help patients save more than $8 billion on branded and specialty medications and prevented approximately 9.9 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges. This helped patients get access to medicine more than 78 million times. In November of 2022, we completed the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions, a prescription price transparency and benefit insight company. The acquisition expands our affordability and adherence capabilities and set the foundation for the expansion of outcomes, management and evidence-based biopharma and payer services. For the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, our fiscal fourth quarter is usually the busiest quarter of the year, driven by customer annual verification activities. Our employees had a particularly busy season this past quarter, assisting the highest volume of patients in the history of the segment. We continue to see strong market demand for the products and services we provide, which supports the growth outlook of this segment. While we're committed to grow the biopharma platform, we're also continually looking for opportunities to optimize the portfolio of products and services we offer. We have a disciplined review process to ensure that our resources are aligned with the areas of most strategic priority. In this past quarter, we made the decision to re-prioritize investments of products within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment that we believe have reached the end of their life cycle and are no longer essential to the growth strategy. These actions will allow us to improve operational efficiency and more importantly, to better focus investments in other strategic areas and to maximize our resources for growth opportunities. These types of decisions are always difficult and it had a direct impact on some of our employees. I am deeply grateful for the contributions of all our Prescription Technology Solution employees have made that have led to the significant growth in this segment for the past several years. As part of this initiative, we are also streamlining the real-estate assets, supporting more flexibility for our employees. We remain confident about our differentiated capabilities, the market opportunity and our ability to achieve the long-term growth target of this segment. Another important portfolio action we are executing is the divestiture of our European businesses. We have now successfully divested businesses in 11 of the 12 countries with Norway being the only country for which we are still exploring alternatives. As we make significant progress in expanding the strategic growth areas, we are doing so in a way that allows us to deliver for all our stakeholders. We're committed to drive sustainability and to execute on initiatives that are aligned to our business strategy, support our growth and contribute to measurable and enduring positive impacts and health outcomes for our stakeholders and communities. We look forward to publishing our impact report in June to share our progress on these important initiatives. Earlier this year, our near-term science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. Focused on energy, transportation and real estate, our teams are taking meaningful actions to achieve these targets and improve the business. Recently, we were included in Sustainalytics 2023 Industry Top-Rated ESG Companies list, recognizing our comprehensive commitment and achievements in environmental, social and governance-related issues. So let me pull everything together. McKesson reported a strong fourth quarter and full year results. Looking back to fiscal 2023, we made significant progress in advancing our company priorities. We executed on our strategy with focus and dedication. We invested in our businesses and our people for future growth. And as a diversified healthcare services company, we enacted positive changes to our customers, partners and their patients. I'm incredibly proud of what we have achieved as a team, and I'm confident in our ability to continue the momentum and deliver sustainable growth as reflected in our updated long-term segment growth targets. With that, Britt, I'll hand it over to you for additional comments. Britt Vitalone : Well, thank you, Brian. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023 results, and then I'll provide an overview of our fiscal 2024 outlook, including our updated long-term adjusted segment operating profit growth targets. My comments today will refer to our fiscal 2023 adjusted results unless I state otherwise. We delivered strong fourth quarter results. Earnings per diluted share was $7.19, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year. These results were right in line with the guidance we provided on our third quarter earnings call. Our results demonstrate the breadth of McKesson's strength as a leading diversified healthcare services company with strong performance in growth in each of our core operating businesses. For the full year earnings per diluted share increased 9% year-over-year, $25.94, driven by a lower share count in growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower contributions in the International segment as a result of the completed divestitures of McKesson's European businesses. Full year earnings per diluted share also included $2.36 related to the following certain items, which can also be found on slide 23, in the appendix to our earnings presentation. $0.78 related to the US government centralized COVID-19 vaccine distribution program, $1.12 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the US government, $0.65 related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement or TRA with Change Healthcare, and $0.19 related to net losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments. Excluding these certain items, earnings per diluted share increased 15% year-over-year, above our previously communicated long-term growth rate target. Our strong full year results are broad-based and reflect our ongoing commitment to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. Before I turn to our consolidated results, I want to highlight one item that impacted our fourth quarter GAAP-only results. We remain focused on strategically managing the company to deliver differentiated customer value as well as long-term financial growth and profitability. In support of delivering sustainable value, innovation and growth, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced a broad set of initiatives to simplify our infrastructure, drive operational efficiencies and increased cost optimization. These initiatives include headcount reductions and the exit or downsizing of certain facilities. During the fourth quarter, we recorded charges of $60 million related to these initiatives, which includes severance and other employee-related costs within our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, asset impairment and accelerated depreciation, including certain asset impairments, primarily within our US Pharmaceutical segment, and real estate charges within corporate. We anticipate total charges of approximately $125 million within our Prescription Technology Solutions and US pharmaceutical segment, as well as corporate to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2024. Moving now to our consolidated results. Our consolidated revenues increased 4% to $68.9 billion in the fourth quarter, for the full year increased 5% to $276.7 billion. Fourth quarter and full year results were driven by growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment, including increased specialty product volumes from retail national account customers, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment as a result of the completed divestitures of McKesson's European businesses. Excluding the impact of the European business operations, including these completed divestitures, revenues increased 13% in the fourth quarter and 12% in the full year when compared to fiscal 2022. Gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 8%. For the full year, gross profit was $12.2 billion, a decrease of 7%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 9% in fourth quarter and 8% in the full year, primarily as a result of growth in the US Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Operating expenses decreased 14% in the quarter and 13% for the full year, largely driven by completed European divestitures in our International segment and lower opioid litigation costs. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 8% in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter operating profit increased 4% to $1.3 billion, driven by growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment, including solid contributions from our generics program and Prescription Technology Solutions growth more than offsetting the impact from completed divestitures in the International segment. Full year operating profit increased 3% to $5 billion, primarily led by growth in our North American businesses, partially offset by these completed divestitures in our International segment and lower contributions from COVID-19 related items year-over-year. When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19 related products, a pre-tax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of the TRA with Change Healthcare in the third quarter and net gains or losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, operating profit increased 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year when compared to fiscal 2022. Moving below the line, interest expense was $70 million in the quarter and $239 million for the full year. The increase was primarily due to impacts from higher interest rates. Effective tax rate was 12.9% for the quarter and 18.8% for the full year, in line with our original guidance. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items. Wrapping up our consolidated results, fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $138 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. Turning to our fourth quarter and full year segment results, which can be found on slides seven through 12 and starting with US Pharmaceutical. Our US Pharmaceutical business is a scaled efficient business and comprises the breadth and depth of services and capabilities, including our growing oncology platform, and we're pleased with the momentum in this segment. Fourth quarter revenues were $61.7 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, driven by growth across all customer segments, including increased volume of specialty products, higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth which was partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Fourth quarter operating profit increased 10% to $861 million and for the full year increased 6% to $3.1 billion, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and increased contributions from our generics program. We remain pleased with the performance of our generics program, led by stable market fundamentals and the strength of our sourcing operations. We continue to provide solid value to our customers and partners delivering low cost and stable supply. Our contract with the US government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided an operating profit benefit of approximately $21 million or $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter, compared to $12 million or $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year, this contract provided a benefit of $149 million or $0.78 per share compared to a $186 million or $0.89 per share in fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, US Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year compared to fiscal 2022 results, which were ahead of the segment's long-term growth target. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 16% year-over-year, driven by growth in prescription volumes in our third-party logistics business and access and adherence solutions transaction volumes. Fourth quarter operating profit increased 35% to $218 million, and full year operating profit increased 15% to $679 million, driven by growth in access and affordability solutions. Fourth quarter results were also positively impacted by annual customer verification support activities as well as increased volume growth, partially due to the commercial success of the brands we serve. Through a comprehensive suite of solutions and services, McKesson helps patients access to their medicine over 24 million times in the fourth quarter, the highest number of patients assisted in the segment's history. This segment produced strong fourth quarter results and full year performance was in line with our original guidance. Moving now to Medical Surgical Solutions. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 6% year-over-year and operating profit was $248 million, a decrease of 17%. For the full year, operating profit declined 4% to $1.2 billion. Fourth quarter and full year results were impacted by lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, the US government's COVID-19 program, partially offset by growth in the primary care business, including favorable sourcing activities in illness season testing compared to the prior year. Contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with the US government for the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of $31 million, or $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $85 million or $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. For the full year COVID-19 related items provided a benefit of $216 million, or $1.12 per share compared to $371 million or $1.78 per share in fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 2% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year compared to fiscal 2022 results, which was at the upper end of the original guidance range that we provided. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues in the fourth quarter were $3.4 billion, a decrease of 61% year-over-year and operating profit was $80 million, a decrease of 46%. On an FX adjusted basis, fourth quarter revenues were $3.6 billion, a decrease of 58%, and operating profit was $88 million, a decrease of 40%. For the full year, operating profit on an FX-adjusted basis decreased by 22%. Fourth quarter and full year results reflect the year-over-year effects in the completed divestitures within our European businesses. In wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $149 million in the quarter, a decrease of 19% year-over-year. For the full-year, corporate expenses were $457 million, a decrease of 21%, which included a pre-tax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement or TRA with Change Healthcare in the third quarter. Corporate expenses in the fourth quarter and full year were positively impacted by lower opioid-related expenses compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we had net losses of $12 million, or $0.06 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures' portfolio compared to net losses of approximately $6 million or $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. For the full year, McKesson had net losses related to equity investments within our McKesson Ventures' portfolio of approximately $36 million, or $0.19 per share. This compares to net gains of approximately $98 million, or $0.47 per share for the full year fiscal 2022. As a reminder, McKesson Ventures' portfolio holds equity investments in several growth-stage digital health and services companies, and we're pleased with the insights and the results we've obtained through this portfolio. The impacts on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. Excluding the benefit from the early termination, or the TRA, and net gains and losses within the McKesson Ventures' portfolio, corporate expenses decreased 23% and 19% in the fourth quarter and full year respectively. Turning now to our cash position and capital deployment, which can be found on slide 13. For the fiscal year, we generated record cash flow, reflecting the broad-based strength of our businesses, the focus on working capital efficiency and disciplined capital investment. For the full year, we generated $4.6 billion in free cash flow, including $558 million of capital expenditures, which include investments to support our strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services as well as investments in our distribution centers. We used our strong balance sheet to return $3.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases, including $138 million in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we entered a new share repurchase program, which allows up to $1 billion of new repurchases. I'll speak about our share repurchase guidance for fiscal 2024 in a few minutes. Additionally, we paid dividends of $292 million for the full year, and we remain committed to growing the dividend in line with earnings growth. When combining share repurchases with dividends paid, we returned approximately 85% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2023. We continue to utilize capital deployment as a method to drive value for our shareholders. Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, we returned $12.9 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, approximately $11.5 billion has been returned through share repurchases, we do see our total shares outstanding by approximately 33%. Our strong operating performance, combined our return of capital to shareholders, reinforces our commitment to driving shareholder value. Now, let me spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for fiscal 2024. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Rather than outlining each assumption, I'll instead walk you through the key items beginning with additional details of fiscal '24 consolidated guidance. A full list of our assumptions can be found on slides 14 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation. Fiscal '23 was a strong year where we exceeded our full year operating profit, earnings per share and cash-flow guidance that we laid out at the beginning of May last year. These results have increased our confidence and our outlook. Strategies that we've discussed today are delivering and we expect that they will continue to deliver strong levels of operating profit, earnings per share growth and robust cash flow generation. We anticipate earnings per diluted share of $26.10 to $26.90 for fiscal '24, which contemplates operating profit growth across each of our core operating businesses when excluding COVID-19 related items, supplemented by disciplined capital deployment. We anticipate earnings per diluted share to increase 11% to 14% in fiscal '24 when excluding a $1.90 related to COVID-19 related items, $0.19 of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments and $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the TRA with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023. Let me start by discussing our approach to COVID-19 related items in our fiscal '24 outlook. Since the onset of the pandemic, McKesson has played a central role in providing support for the US government's distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies as well as providing the distribution of COVID-19 tests to our customers. Looking ahead to fiscal 2024 and the scheduled completion of our COVID-19 contracts with US government in July of 2023, we anticipate that the impact from COVID-19 related items, including COVID-19 tests will be immaterial to fiscal '24 results. As such, we will no longer provide earnings per diluted share guidance metrics specific to these items going forward. Let me discuss the outlook for our segments. We continue to be pleased with the growth we're seeing in the US Pharmaceutical segment. The value proposition of our core distribution platform resonates across retail, health systems and provider settings and we anticipate growth across several customer channels. We also anticipate further growth in oncology platform. US Oncology Network, the largest oncology practice management organization in the US has continued to expand its footprint into local communities to increase the availability of advanced care and better patient outcomes. We continue to grow the provider footprint with over 2,300 providers in the network. We formed a joint venture with the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in fiscal 2023. This partnership enhances our proposition at biopharma companies and further advances our differentiated offerings across the entire pharmaceutical lifecycle. Additionally, in fiscal '24, we anticipate branded pharmaceutical price increases to be in line with increases experienced in fiscal 2022. We do not anticipate the higher price increases that we saw in fiscal '23 to repeat in fiscal '24. Within our generics business, the fundamentals remain competitive, yet stable, with our strong sourcing programs continue to provide value for our customers. Wrapping up the US Pharmaceutical segment, for fiscal '24, we anticipate revenue to increase 9% to 11%, and operating profit to be approximately flat to 3% growth year-over-year. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution from fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 5% to 8%. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 7% to 13%, and operating profit growth of 11% to 15%, reflecting continued organic growth and higher transaction volumes across our access and affordability solutions and services. Within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, our 3PL services typically represent slightly more than half of full year revenues, while the services represented less than 10% of full year operating profit on average over the previous three fiscal years. I've stated previously, the mix of revenue in this segment can vary quarter-to-quarter. However, over the balance of a full year, we anticipate full year product mix in fiscal '24 to be consistent with prior years. In fiscal '23, we also acquired Rx Savings Solutions, which helps employers and health plans reduce prescription drug costs by utilizing its advanced analytics capabilities. We're pleased with this acquisition's progress and we'll continue its integration during fiscal '24, as we begin to realize the value from the synergies. This segment continues to perform well, with higher revenue and margin opportunities that leverage our scale and technology capabilities. The strong growth profile over the last years reflects our ongoing strategic investments to grow and expand our suite of products and solutions to provide next-generation patient access, affordability and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated into provider workflows. In the Medical Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to be approximately a 1% decline to 3% growth and operating profit to decrease 5% to 11%. The Medical Surgical business remains well positioned to leverage the breadth and depth of its services throughout the alternate site market, including growth in the primary care business and lab solutions. Our contract with the US government for the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies ends in July of 2023. We expect the remaining impact of this contract to be immaterial to fiscal '24 results. And while we anticipate a modest contribution from COVID-19 tests, we anticipate volumes to continue to decline and be at a lower level compared to fiscal '23 and immaterial to fiscal '24 results. Excluding the impact of these COVID-19 related items from fiscal '23 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 15% year-over-year. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 30% to 34% and operating profit to decline by 23% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we've closed to-date and that we expect to close during fiscal '24. We continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit our remaining operations in Norway and as I mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we intend to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset any dilution resulting from the European divestitures. Now turning to cash flow and capital deployment. Our North American businesses continued to generate strong free cash flow and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We continue to be focused on profitable growth and efficient deployment of capital. Our 24% return on invested capital illustrates our focus on shareholder value creation. Our strong balance sheet provides us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently. We will continue to prioritize growth through organic opportunities, however, increasingly through acquisitions that are on-strategy and appropriate multiples. For fiscal '24, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. We also remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Our outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares in fiscal '24. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal '24 to be in the range of approximately $133 million to $134 million. Combining all these elements leads to adjusted earnings per share of $26.10 to $26.90. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items and the contribution from our remaining European operations in Norway, we anticipate earnings per diluted share growth of approximately 14% to 18% in fiscal '24, which is above the long-term target rate we previously provided. The strong outlook further demonstrates our shareholder value creation framework. We continue to be focused on profitable growth and efficient deployment of capital. Turning now to our long-term adjusted segment operating profit growth targets, which can be found on slide 19. As COVID-19 related contracts with the US government are scheduled to end in July of 2023, and the contribution from Europe continues to run off as guided, we remain committed to executing against our strategic initiatives in building on our differentiated assets and capabilities. As a result, we are pleased to be raising our long-term growth targets, a demonstration of the execution of our strategies, our leading market positions and strong financial position. For US Pharmaceutical, we anticipate 5% to 7% long-term growth, which is up from 4%, Prescription Technology Solutions 11% to 12% long-term growth, up from 11%, and the Medical Surgical Solutions 10% to 12% long-term growth, up from 10%. With our strong underlying momentum and our aligned focus on the many growth opportunities moving forward, I remain confident we'll continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth to provide superior value for our customers, team members and shareholders alike. In conclusion, we are well-positioned in the market with a unique strength and scale that only McKesson can provide. We will continue to invest in our strategies as we expand the reach of our oncology ecosystem and biopharma services platform. As fiscal 2023 demonstrated, our strategies are working, producing value for all stakeholders. We have tremendous momentum across the business, a strong financial outlook, and our financial framework and execution position us to deliver sustainable profit growth, cash flows and shareholder value creation. We have great confidence in our teams and our products and services and in our strategy. With that let me now turn it back over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thanks for all the detail. Thank you. I'd like to dig into the increase in long-term profit growth targets and specifically pharma as a massive absolute number at the high end of the new range, and for '24, that range comes with needing to lap brand benefits. So I'd love to hear what gets you to the high-end of the range factors within the year, and what drives the long-term guidance, macro trend versus strategy versus investment. Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question, Eric. I think what. As we look at the business, we've already previously indicated that we thought we could grow the business faster than the originally indicated long-term guidance into a number of factors that are a part of that. First of all, we've seen strong utilization. I think that, as a baseline, we've seen that actually increase throughout the year and we expect that utilization will remain solid going forward. We've built a lot of momentum across our health systems business, our retail pharmacy network and the value that we're providing there. And we've been growing our oncology platform. You heard Brian and I both referenced the number of providers that we've added. Certainly, if you think about the value that we provide, not only as a distributor, but GPO services and now the added capabilities with Ontada and Sarah Cannon Research and the opportunities going forward as it relates to biosimilars, all of these things really point to the opportunities for us to grow faster in the future than the original long-term target rate. And the business continues to generate good cash and efficiency through a scaled operation. So I think all of those things and the momentum that we've showed now over a number of years, leading us to have some confidence in a higher growth target. Nicole Kramer : Next question please. Operator : And our next will be Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on a really strong guide. Maybe to take Eric's question, but titbit a bit onto the MedSurg side. It seems like the multitude of factors you've been backing out COVID has continued to help you strong market positioning, site of care, volumes, you name it. As you think about the build, because you did take up that guidance as well, what do you think the steady state looks like in terms of where we have been pre-COVID versus going forward among all those different metrics, among share gain among site of care, among private label that allows you to build to that higher and consistent double-digit growth rate within what already is a pretty sizable segment from an EBIT perspective? Brian Tyler : Thanks, Michael. I'll take that one and give Britt a minute of relief. So our medical business is incredibly diverse. I mean, across, it really shows up in all of the alternate sites or everywhere that's not a hospital setting to be truthful. And even amongst hospitals, we tend to serve all of their communities, not all, but we do serve their community-based locations. And then it's also diverse from a sense of multiple product lines, not just commodity medical products, it's equipment, it's lab, it's pharmaceutical, it's specialty pharmaceutical. When we look at utilization broadly across the industry, we've been pleased to see it come back. We've seen prescriptions come back, oncology visits come back. Medical has probably recovered a bit over the course of the last year, but we are encouraged by recent commentary and staff on the recovery and ambulatory surgery centers, for example. So I think there's a big utilization that we think continues to underlie this business. There's the diversity of the products and the new segments that we can penetrate. There's opportunities for us. We continue to believe in our private brand portfolio. So I'd say it's the confluence of all those things that give us the confidence. Nicole Kramer : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Just, Britt, I first wanted to follow up on the $0.40 range as we think of the guidance and just to understand some of the puts and takes and the upper end and the lower end. And more importantly, as we think about, for example, the changes in insulin pricing and how drug distributors make money. So one, can you maybe just walk us through how we should think about insulin? And then secondly, in the answer to an earlier question, you talked about lapping the brand benefit. But I'm also curious as to how you and Brian are thinking about new products that are coming to the market. I think of things like GLP-1s and other really expensive drugs that will have a big top line. Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question, Lisa. So a lot there. Let me just see if I can tick through it, and if I miss something, please remind me. As we think about the products that we serve across our biopharma partners, our first job there is to think about what is it that our customers need. And then work with our biopharma partners to determine the services that they need us to provide on behalf of those products. And when we do that, we work to establish a fair value for those services that we provide, regardless of what the product is. That's what we do on a constant basis, working with our manufacturers. So I think we've talked about this now for a number of years that we've continue to evolve our manufacturing relationships and our pricing to be reflective of the fair value of the services that we provide. And as we go forward, that's going to be -- continue to be our focus so that we maintain the economics that we have for the services that we provide. In terms of GLP-1s. Again, it's part of the broad set of products that we distribute on behalf of manufacturers to our customers. One of the other things I would remind you of is, over the last several years, we've been on a journey to ensure that all products, regardless of the category, individually are reflective of the economics that we receive in terms of how we price those back with our customers. So we're on that -- we continue to be on that focus, and I think we're well positioned to do that as we go forward. I don't know, Brian, if you would -- there's anything you would add to that? Brian Tyler : No. I think that's well done. I mean, obviously, it's hard to go anywhere these days without talking about GLP-1s. And I would just characterize it generally, I think their growth will be positive for us and have a big impact on, hopefully, patients and the health of the country. Nicole Kramer : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Hi. Good afternoon, guys, and congrats also on the guide. I guess, Britt, as I think about the guidance, obviously, raising your operating income target, you don't have an EPS growth target here in like the last time when you did the Investor Day. So just curious if the bridge to EPS has changed from the operating income targets that you've laid out. Or maybe how should we be thinking about EPS growth? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes, Brian, thanks for that question. I think what we've done here is we've updated the segments. There really is no change to the range that we provided for adjusted EPS. So one of the comments that I made, as we think about capital deployment, we're going to continue to focus on growing the business, whether that be organically and the investments that we make in it or more as we go forward more on M&A. You saw us do a couple of really key M&A transactions last year that were right on strategy. And as you know, it generally takes a few years to get the full synergies from that M&A. We expect that we'll continue to do M&A on strategy at the right multiples and that even with the increase in the operating segment guidance that overall that the overall EPS guidance would still be within the range. There's opportunities obviously for us, if we're able to generate some more capital deployment and we're able to get some acquisitions here that we can realize the synergies in an earlier manner for us to be at the upper end of the range that we provided you, but really no change to the overall range in this update. Nicole Kramer : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats as well. I wanted to focus a little bit on -- within the -- going back to the earlier question about the increase in the long-term guide for the US Pharma segment. Can you talk a little bit more about Ontada and sort of the progress you've made there, the increase in guide -- in the long-term guide, would you expect to come from Ontada. And maybe talk a little bit more about what's been going on there? And then -- and I guess is this JV with HCA, the Sarah Cannon Research Institute, is that part of the Ontada sort of partnership or is that separate. Just trying to understand a little bit more where we've gotten to at this point because I know a couple of years ago, when you announced it at the Investor Day, you kind of suggested it was kind of immaterial in the near term, but just trying to see how far we've gone so far. Brian Tyler : Yes, let me jump in on this one, Britt. So we call it an oncology ecosystem because we really think there is this value of all of the pieces together, and I'm really pleased with the progress that we're making overall. You've seen the growth that both Britt and I talked about in the U.S. Oncology Network now scaled to over 2,300 providers. We've made tremendous progress, had a record year of adding providers to the network last year, and that's a piece. And that, as that grows, that obviously feeds more data, gives us more provider insight. That allows Ontada to continue to work with our partners to create products and services that help them develop, commercialize and get their products to market and understand how to most effectively go to market to have the utilization and patient impact that they want. We think that Ontada is in year three or four of its development, building off some assets that we had long had, but we continue to invest in new product development. And we continue to see that business improve year-over-year. We think the partnership with the joint venture we did for the Sarah Cannon Research Institute, who brings additional insights, moves us up stage into clinical trials in a very prominent way in the community setting. So again we think that trial early insight business, that helps feed Ontada. That helps our providers navigate the clinical care that they have to provide every day. The insights we get from that clinical care can feed back through some of our data assets to provide information back to the biopharma. So each of the pieces is sort of additive to the overall solution. And I'd just say that while we're probably, I would characterize that it's still an investment phase in Ontada because we still believe there's opportunity and a big long-term market out there and lots of space for us to be innovating in with the unique assets we have. Overall, I think it was a -- very pleased with where our oncology business has developed. Nicole Kramer : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Daniel Grosslight : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If I back out the impact of the divestitures from the international business, it looks like you're growing Canada around 8% to 10% or so, depending on what the Norway contribution is assume this year. Curious what's driving the strength of the Canadian business in '24. And if your international guidance contemplates a full year contribution from Norway? Brian Tyler : Well, we don't really break out Norway and Canada and talk about them separately. But what I will say about our Canadian business is we have, again, a very diversified set of assets in Canada. We have a leading distribution position. We have a leading retail banner position. We've got a leading chain pharmacy position there. We've got biopharma and specialty assets. Now those work very differently than the ones that work in the US, but really in many ways, getting at kind of the same overall need just in a very different health care system. And so on the basis of our scale and our breadth, we are a really important player in the health of Canada. And I think we've been able to leverage that scale. We're able to find efficiencies across the business to continue to support growth that we're very pleased with. Britt Vitalone : Maybe I'll just answer the one mechanical question as it relates to Norway. We do have Norway included in our full year FY'24. Just to repeat, though, we continue to strategically look for an opportunity to exit the European operations completely, which would be Norway, but you should anticipate that there's a full year of Norway in our numbers. Nicole Kramer : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Brian, I want to come back to one more on oncology. You guys announced a couple of smaller transactions in the prepared commentary and your friends in Philadelphia recently announced a deal. I guess I would ask, as you guys look out from kind of the practice management and partnership perspective, how much greenfield opportunity do you guys see left? And I know that you have the Ontada business that's budding, but would just kind of look how you think about the runway to continue to either work more tightly with practices or help them grow their business, which serves as an opportunity to grow McKesson's business as well. Just trying to figure out what inning we're in there. Thank you. Brian Tyler : Thanks, George. Thanks for the question. So we've been at this for a long time. I think we acquired US. Oncology in 2010, so it's been a long time. We've got a lot of experience. And if you think about the breadth of our solutions in the community oncology space, I mean, we start with -- you can start your relationship with McKesson with just basic distribution. Then you can add on distribution and our GPO services. And then we have a la carte services to support you in the running of your practice. And that gives us great relationships, great insight into the practices that are out there in the community and helps us really identify who we consider to be the leaders, businesses that are run with similar clinical and operational philosophies to the US Oncology Network. So it's not uncommon to see a start with just a very transactional relationship, but then over time, grow that into inclusion in the US Oncology Network. We have a very disciplined model for the types of practices that we think fit the USAN model. And I think over the last couple of years, you've seen us pretty successfully attract them into the US Oncology Network. Nicole Kramer : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks for taking my question. It's about the long-range plan. If I'm looking at the Pharma segment, it looks like margins should be flat or maybe up. You have operating income kind of growing in line but yet for fiscal '24, if we back out the COVID benefit, it's below. And -- meaning this margin shrinkage is expected. So I'm just wondering if that's insulin or something else. And then with the long-range plan, is the raising of the long-range plan like from fiscal '24 forward or is it inclusive of what just happened in '23 as well? Britt Vitalone : So thanks for the question. Let me maybe answer these in reverse order. What we've done here is provide you our FY'24 outlook. And at the same time, looking back at our performance over the previous five years, updating our guidance going forward from fiscal '24 forward as a long-term rate. As we look at the margins year-over-year, I think, there's a few things that will impact us. Clearly, the mix of both products and services that we provide with a heavier and faster-growing specialty product portfolio as well as the mix of customers and continue to see growth -- faster growth in our largest customers. And then the last thing I would say is we are very proud of the oncology business that we're putting together, including our Ontada business and Sarah Cannon Research, and we're continuing to invest in those capabilities and services to support a lot of what Brian just talked about in terms of how we really think about the growth opportunities that we have going forward. So I think those would be the couple of things that I would point out that could lead to margin variation from one year to another. Nicole Kramer : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Just on the 340B topic, I think some questions on that as far as exposure for McKesson kind of heading into these results. I guess I'm just curious for fiscal '24 guidance was baked into the outlook for any sort of 340B impact and how that compares to fiscal '23, if that's even material one way or the other? I just wanted to get some color on that. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes. Mechanically, clearly, we feel like we're well positioned to manage through any impacts that come from 340B. Any impacts that will come from that are assumed within our guidance. There's nothing additional to call out. Nicole Kramer : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Can you comment a little bit on the dynamics of what's driving the strength across the generics program? And is there anything to call out there or changes in fundamentals across the generics business? And have you seen some of the disruption amongst some of the certain larger generic manufacturers flow through to your business? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question. So as I talked about a little bit in my remarks, maybe I'll expand on that. We have a very scaled generics operation. We start with a very scaled and efficient sourcing program that we've been running now for a number of years, and we have some great partners. And we have great partnerships with generic manufacturers, very diverse and very broad set of partners. That helps us manage through any supply shocks that may happen and those are -- those happen every year. We're able to manage through that. For as long as I've been in this business, you will see -- from time to time, you will see a generic shortage or a generic impact to supply. We've been able to manage through that very well given the strength and the breadth of partnerships that we have. I also talked about the fact that the marketplace has very stable fundamentals. So when you think about our -- the focus that we have on a scaled and efficient sourcing program, stable set of market fundamentals, which, again, are very competitive environment, but a stable environment and our focus that we have on the sell side with our customers, and we've been able to manage very effectively through this. Our focus is to provide low cost, high availability of supply to our customers. That is really the bedrock of the success that we have with our generics program. I think we've been able to do that quite well for a number of years. Nicole Kramer : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks for much for the question. Two questions for me. One is on the -- obviously, you had some changes and cost cutting on the OpEx line, so in the fourth quarter. How do you see sort of any potential pacing of that impacting the fourth quarter? And secondly, can you talk a little bit maybe more specifically about sort of what you have embedded in the 2024 guidance for biosimilars versus the longer-term plan? Thank you very much. Britt Vitalone : Sure. Thanks for the question. So as I talked about, we enacted a set of initiatives, and we recorded a charge for restructuring that was primarily in our US pharmaceutical and prescription technology business. We expect that those initiatives and activities will be complete by the end of fiscal 2024. So I think that would answer your question on that. And from a biosimilars perspective, we continue to believe that there's great opportunity here as we continue to add providers to the network that provides more opportunity for us. And we think we're very well positioned and we've certainly embedded the opportunity within the guidance that we provided you today. Brian Tyler : Yes. What we know is in, obviously, 40 approvals, 27 launched. A big event this year will be Humira, which is going to be a Part D product, not Part B. We have many more services to offer and assets to leverage and use in the Part B arena. So we will track kind of payer response and pricing strategies and patient adoption over the course of this year. But what we know is baked into the guidance, we've provided. Nicole Kramer : Operator, we have time for one more final question. Operator : Certainly. That question will come from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. In the prepared remarks, and maybe this is what you're just touching on a little bit, but you mentioned reprioritizing some investments in the Prescription Technology Solutions business. I wonder if there was any way to flesh out a little bit more about what specifically you're doing there. And when I look at your '24 guidance, it actually looks like you're assuming the Prescription Technology Solutions grows faster, 11% to 15% versus your updated 11% to 12% long-term target. And I wonder what was driving that. Brian Tyler : Well, I mean, if you think about this business, I mean, first off, we've had really strong growth the last several years. We actually combine and form this business a couple of years ago, just a couple of years ago by bringing various businesses and assets across the company together. And as those things continue to come together, we continue to look at our resources, our product offerings. We have conversations with manufacturers about their life cycle and service needs across that life cycle. And we just felt like, as we evaluated investments we had been making and where we thought investment opportunities were for the future, it just made sense for efficiency and focus purposes to make sure we align those to where our best possibilities are. When you make those realignments, the skill set is not always the same, what you're moving from to what you're moving to. And so unfortunately, that did impact some of our teammates. This is our job. This is one of our strategy, to simplify the portfolio and be focused on efficiency and positioning the business for long-term growth. So we feel very good about the performance this past fiscal year and feel good about the targets we have set for fiscal '24. Britt Vitalone : And I guess I would just remind you, again, these are long-term target rates that we expect that we'll be able to achieve. And as this business is broad and diverse, and we have it as a strategic focus point, we're going to continue to invest in this business from year-to-year that may vary. But over the long-term, we feel comfortable with the updated guidance that we've given you, but it's a business that we're going to continue to make investments and to grow it and to support our customers. Brian Tyler : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon or evening, depending on where you are. I appreciate all the thoughtful questions, your support and interest in McKesson. Thank you, Rachel for facilitating this call. I want to conclude by just stating McKesson had a strong fourth quarter and full year results. I am really pleased with the continued momentum in the business. Britt and I remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth. I want to end though, with a note of acknowledgment to the McKesson employees. It's really thanks to their dedication and their commitment to our customers, our partners and to each other that enable us to truly improve care in every setting, one product, one partner, and one patient at a time. Thank you, Team McKesson. Everyone else thanks again for joining. Have a terrific evening. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today, I\u2019m joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we\u2019ll move to a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson\u2019s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today\u2019s earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most current recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today\u2019s earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everybody. We appreciate you joining us on our call today. McKesson reported a strong fiscal first quarter, driven by really broad-based momentum across the businesses. We delivered $74.5 billion in total revenues and $7.27 in adjusted earnings per diluted share, both exceeding our expectations. The performance in the quarter included a favorable timing impact from a discrete tax item. But the thing we\u2019re most importantly focused on and pleased with is the strong operational performance of the underlying business, which gives us the confidence to raise our guidance range for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $26.10 to $26.90 to an updated range of $26.55 to $27.35. Before I review our business performance in the quarter, I want to provide an update on the utilization trends that we\u2019ve been observing. In the first quarter, we saw solid growth in prescription volumes and patient visits. In U.S. Oncology, same-store patient visits grew at a good pace while we continued to expand the reach of the network. The solid growth in prescription volume trends, particularly in weight loss or GLP-1 drugs, contributed to the strong revenue growth in the first quarter. As we closely monitor the trends going forward, we are well positioned to deliver products and services to support the evolving needs of our customers and patients. Now let me move on to our business review, and I want to focus my remarks today on the progress we\u2019ve made in executing on our company priorities and our differentiated market positions in the key growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. I\u2019ll also discuss some of the key growth drivers for the quarter and as always Britt will provide additional details about our financial results. So let\u2019s start with our priority of driving sustainable core growth. In the first quarter, we saw strong performance in the pharmaceutical distribution business, as reflected in the growth of the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, where revenue increased 18% and adjusted operating profit grew 14% when excluding the contribution from COVID-19-related items in the prior year. We\u2019re pleased with the broad-based momentum across all customer channels, really, including higher volumes from retail national accounts and good growth in our health systems segment. We also have a long history of supporting and investing in the growth of community pharmacies. In May, we launched Pinpoint Community Solutions, a new inventory management system powered by our proprietary Supplylogix software that\u2019s designed to help independent pharmacies improve cash flow, increase inventory efficiency and to maximize their operational performance. In June, we were proud to host the annual ideaShare Conference, a nationwide community pharmacy event that brought together more than 2,800 attendees. Through this form of discussion and education, we help pharmacists foster deeper community connections, strengthen their collective voice and discover ways to innovate and thrive using McKesson products and services. To support the sustainable growth of the core distribution businesses within U.S. Pharmaceutical, we\u2019re also investing in our infrastructure to enhance automation and improve efficiency. In the past quarter, we opened a new distribution center dedicated to specialty pharmaceuticals. This new facility incorporates the latest innovations in supply chain automation and technology, and it\u2019ll allow us to better serve our customers with increased productivity. In the Medical-Surgical segment, we\u2019re dedicated to serving customers across alternate sites of care, and we continue to look for opportunities for new partnerships. In the past two years, we\u2019ve partnered closely with the U.S. Government on important public health initiatives. And we\u2019re really quite proud of the relationships we\u2019ve built at both the state and the federal level through these close collaborations. Since then, we\u2019ve grown our state government business through participation in cooperative purchasing programs. We\u2019ve also built a dedicated government solutions team stacked with experience : sales, customer service, sales administration and legal teams with a shared goal of supporting successful government procurement and providing best-in-class fulfillment and service at every level of the government. As we expand our customer relationships, we\u2019re also strategically managing relationships with manufacturers to ensure supply chain diversity. We serve a broad portfolio of national brand and private label Medical-Surgical products, and we\u2019re enhancing our procurement tools and processes to better track domestic and international sourcing. Last year, our sourcing team traveled to more than ten countries, representing our continued effort to expand our manufacturing relationships and diversify our geographic presence. Let me move on to the next company priority, and that is expanding our oncology and biopharma platforms. In July, we were excited to welcome the Cancer Care of Kansas to the U.S. Oncology Network, growing the total number of providers in the network to over 2,400. The continued growth is a strong testament to the value proposition of the network and an example of how we continue to evolve and grow our portfolio of differentiated assets. With over 20 years of oncology practice management experience, the network brings significant value beyond just drug purchase savings. The practices in the network have access to substantial expertise and ample resources, including clinical and business services, innovative technologies that support high-quality patient care, efficient drug management and revenue cycle optimization. As one of the largest organizations of its kind, the U.S. Oncology Network is dedicated to advancing cancer care and enabling better patient outcomes. Since its initial participation in the oncology care model, more than 120,000 patients have been enrolled in the program across the network. Participating practices delivered high-quality care to patients while generating significant savings for Medicare. Recently, we announced the network\u2019s participation in the Enhancing Oncology Model, which includes representation from over 70% of the physicians in the network. The U.S. Oncology Network continues to lead at the forefront of value-based care. In biopharma services, the success of our innovative products and solutions is reflected in the growth we delivered in the first quarter. Prescription Technology Solutions segment saw a 17% revenue increase and 35% increase in adjusted operating profit. We continue to receive positive feedback on our products, enabling us to further penetrate the market and expand our channel reach. Solid prescription trends, particularly the commercial success of the weight loss GLP-1 drugs, as I mentioned earlier, also led to higher demand for our prior authorization solutions and contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. We remain committed and focused on expanding the biopharma services platform as one of our strategic growth pillars. We continue to strengthen the relationships with biopharma companies who are the primary sponsor of this business. We\u2019re also creating comprehensive value proposition for each of the stakeholders in the continuum of care. For providers, our industry-leading technology platforms help them understand the patient\u2019s progression along their treatment journey and help the patients access their therapies faster. Through our electronic payer connections, we support payers who represent 94% of prescription volumes in the U.S. and offer real-time decisions and simplified support between providers and health plans. We\u2019re also connected to more than 50,000 pharmacies, and we offer solutions like automatic coupon programs and central field distribution, helping them improve operational efficiency and ultimately, helping their patients lead healthier lives. Recently, we were honored to receive the 2023 Retail Excellence Awards from Drug Store News, recognizing the value of our retail solutions and what they bring to pharmacies. As we continue to make significant progress in our company priorities, I want to highlight our unwavering focus on our people and culture. We, at McKesson, believe that having the best talent is essential, and it\u2019s foundational to our culture and strategies. As a company, we further defined our employee value proposition. We call it The Future of Health Starts with You to demonstrate our commitment to our employees and what makes McKesson a top employer. Focusing on care, meaning and belonging, we strive to build a culture that supports the well-being and growth of each individual who works at McKesson. We also offer employees the opportunity to form authentic connections and advocate for advancing the company\u2019s culture through employee resource groups. We\u2019re pleased to see the ERG membership grew by more than 70% in the past two years. Supported by increased employee participation, these resource groups are becoming an important channel to promote and strengthen our culture of inclusion, belonging and collaboration. Our focus on people and culture is an important pillar of our company\u2019s priorities, and it\u2019s also part of our broader initiative focused on enacting positive and lasting impact. We strive to deliver value to our customers and our communities, not only as a diversified health care services company, but also as an impact-driven organization. In June, we published our FY2022 and FY2023 impact report that detailed our progress in advancing our strategy and driving meaningful outcomes to build a healthier tomorrow for all future generations. We shared many great initiatives focused on making an impact through our four impact pillars : our people, our partners, our community and our planet. I\u2019m very, very proud of what the team has achieved, and we\u2019ll continue to track, measure and communicate our progress around these impact pillars. Now before I hand it over to Britt, let me pull everything together. McKesson delivered a strong first quarter, and we\u2019re making consistent and meaningful progress with our company priorities. We\u2019re pleased with the growth and momentum across the business segments, and the market fundamentals remain solid in support of the positive outlook we\u2019ve outlined for fiscal 2024. I want to sincerely thank all of the McKesson employees. We refer to them as Team McKesson. What we have achieved would not be possible without their dedication and the commitment of each and every one of them. I\u2019m tremendously proud to be your leader and grateful for your contributions to advancing our vision. With that, Britt, I\u2019ll hand it over to you for additional insights. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian, and I\u2019m pleased to be here this afternoon to discuss our fiscal first quarter results, which as you mentioned, are tracking above the full year guidance that we provided in May, and it reflects solid progress against our long-term growth targets. Given the strong start to the year and momentum across the business, we\u2019re raising both our top and bottom line guidance today. I\u2019ll first start with a review of our first quarter results and provide an overview of our fiscal 2024 outlook, including our updated adjusted earnings per diluted share range. My comments today will refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results, unless I state otherwise. Let me start with a review of our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues increased 11% to $74.5 billion, which was led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and weight loss or GLP-1 drugs. And they are partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, resulting from completed divestitures within our European business during fiscal 2023. When excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 16%. Gross profit was $2.9 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 2%. And when excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 7% in the first quarter, primarily a result of growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Operating expenses decreased 4% in the quarter. When excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year. Operating expenses during the quarter included integration costs related to our acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions and a joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute, both of which were completed in the second half of fiscal 2023. First quarter operating profit increased 3% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by growth in our North American businesses, partially offset by the completed divestitures of our European business operations, which are within our International segment. When excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items in fiscal 2023 and losses associated with McKesson Venture equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 9% in the quarter. We\u2019re pleased with these strong operating results, which are above the long-range growth targets. We\u2019re delivering durable operating performance and sustained momentum, and we\u2019re executing against our strategies. Moving below the line. Interest expense was $42 million, a year-over-year decrease, driven by transactions within our long-term debt portfolio, which I\u2019ll discuss later in my remarks. The effective tax rate was 8.4%, driven by the recognition of a net discrete tax benefit of $147 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 related to the repatriation of certain intellectual property between wholly owned legal entities that were based in different tax jurisdictions. As a reminder, the timing of discrete tax items is difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Our effective tax rate guidance for the full year remains unchanged. First quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $136.6 million \u2013 136.6 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Adding it all up, first quarter earnings per diluted share of $7.27 represents an increase of 25% over the prior year. When excluding COVID-19-related items in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, first quarter earnings per diluted share was up 33% over the prior year. Turning to our first quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 11, and I\u2019ll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenue and operating profit results in the quarter exceeded our expectations. First quarter revenues were $67.2 billion, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Revenue growth reflected increased prescription transaction volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. The growth of the weight loss or the GLP-1 drug category provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. We generally recognize lower margin rates for the distribution of GLP-1 drugs. The growth of these products, similar to other new brand launches, led to increased demand for our access and affordability support programs such as our prior authorization services, which are offered within RxTS segment. The first quarter also marked further progress against our oncology growth strategy. We\u2019re pleased with the growth across all of our oncology assets. We saw growth in the U.S. Oncology Network, supported by the strength of our GPO capabilities. And as Brian mentioned, recently, we added Cancer Center of Kansas to the U.S. Oncology Network, expanding the total number of providers in our network to over 2,400. During the quarter, we delivered solid performance and contribution from the U.S. Oncology Network. First quarter fiscal 2024 total patient visits were 19% above the prior year and on the same practice basis, U.S. oncology patient visits grew approximately 7% above the prior year. The joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute is progressing well as we support the expansion and the advancement of clinical trials and clinical trial research, and we continue to invest in and progress our data and insights business Ontada. These oncology assets and capabilities are important pieces to long-term development of the segment, we\u2019re excited about the growth and the continued progress that we\u2019re seeing. First quarter U.S. Pharmaceutical operating profit increased 8% to $771 million driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and increased contributions from our generics program, which included new product launches within the quarter. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 14% year-over-year ahead of the segment\u2019s long-term growth target. The U.S. Pharmaceutical operating profit growth reflects increased prescription volumes and the breadth of capabilities that we provide, including solid generic volumes and sourcing contributions, operating discipline, and the continued momentum from our oncology platform. Let me move now to Prescription Technology Solutions. First quarter revenues were $1.2 billion an increase of 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in our third-party logistics and technology services businesses due to increased prescription volumes. Operating profit increased 35% to $223 million, driven by increasing demand for access adherence and affordability solutions. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, prescription transaction volumes showed solid improvement in the quarter. The increased transaction volume drove higher demand for our access programs, including our prior authorization products. During the quarter, we noted strong new brand prescription volumes, which included the GLP-1 drug category. The strength of our program supporting access and affordability solutions positions us to capture the demand driven by the strong prescription utilization trends. Our products continue to receive positive feedback and recognition for the value that they deliver to our partners. One example of this is CoverMyMeds electronic prior authorization solutions. Historically, the prior authorization process was a tedious and time consuming task for providers through the technology solutions that McKesson has, we automate this process providing a faster and easier way to review complete and track prior authorization requests. CoverMyMeds delivering value and returns for our partners by increasing connectivity between pharmacies, providers, payers, and biopharma manufacturers through next generation access affordability, and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated into provider workflows. First quarter results exemplify the success of our broad range of technology programs and support services. In Medical Surgical Solutions, our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Our core business demonstrated revenue and operating profit growth. Revenues were $2.6 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1% year-over-year and operating profit was $235 million, a decrease of 12%. First quarter results were impacted by anticipated lower contributions in the kiting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. Government\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine program and lower illness season testing, including flu and COVID-19 tests when compared to the prior year. As a reminder, the first quarter of fiscal 2023 saw an extension of the 2022 illness season, driving higher levels of illness testing and related products. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in the extended in primary care businesses, partially offset by a non-recurring expense of $12 million. Within the primary care market, we saw growth in lab solutions, equipment, and specialty pharmaceuticals. In the extended care market, growth was led by sales to new customers, which included increased volumes of nutritional supplements. We are pleased with the continued solid results, which are in line with our expectations. Our leadership position combined with operating execution positions us for continued growth across the alternate sites of care. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues in the first quarter were $3.5 billion, a decrease of 47% year-over-year, and operating profit was $90 million, a decrease of 35%. On an FX adjusted basis, first quarter revenues were $3.7 billion, a decrease of 44%, an operating profit was $95 million, a decrease of 31%. First quarter results reflect the year-over-year FX from the combined divestitures within our European businesses. Let me wrap up our segment review. Corporate expenses were $149 million in the quarter, an increase of 3% year-over-year. As a reminder, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, corporate expenses included the receipt of a payment relating to a prior tax receivable agreement in our previous joint venture with Change Healthcare. During the quarter, we had losses of $7 million or $0.04 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to losses of approximately $22 million or $0.11 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, the McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth stage digital health and services companies. We\u2019re pleased with the insights and results that we\u2019ve obtained through this portfolio. The impacts on our consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter, and as a result, the customs investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. Turning now to our cash position, balance sheet and capital deployment on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We made $124 million of capital expenditures, which includes investments in new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. For the first quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.2 billion. And as a reminder, our cash position or working capital metrics and the resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on, and therefore it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. We return $770 million of cash to shareholders, which included $696 million of share repurchases and $74 million in dividend payments. During the quarter, we successfully completed a public offering for $1 billion of notes with five and 10-year tenures. Concurrently, we retired approximately $900 million of notes that were due March of 2024. These transactions reduced our interest expense and they further support our strong credit profile as evidenced by our recent credit rating upgrades. Our Board of Directors approved two actions in July. First, the 15% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.62 per share, and second, the Board approved an additional $6 billion of share repurchase authorization, bringing the total remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $9 billion. These actions demonstrate the confidence that the Board of Directors and management have in the execution of our strategic priorities. Now let me discuss our updated outlook. The guidance I\u2019m providing today relates to fiscal 2024. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I\u2019ll discuss the key items beginning with additional details of our consolidated guidance, and a full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 13 through 17 in our supplemental slide presentation. As we\u2019ve talked about already today, we are encouraged by the strong performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. And as a result, we\u2019re increasing our earnings per diluted share outlook to a new range of $26.55 to $27.35. As a result of this, we now anticipate earnings per diluted share to increase 13% to 16% when excluding certain items. As a reminder of what the certain items include, net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, a $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023 and $1.90 related to COVID-19-related items in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical Surgical segments in fiscal 2023, and we anticipate the impact of COVID-19-related items to be immaterial to fiscal 2024. We anticipate operating profit will be flat to 4% declined compared to the prior year. When excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit to increase by 6% to 10% year-over-year. Let me discuss the outlook for our segments. Our core distribution business within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment continues to demonstrate its strong value proposition to our customers, and we anticipate further growth in specialty distribution, including our differentiated plasma and biologics business where our customers can access an expansive portfolio of plasma-derived products, biologics, oncology treatments, and other specialty drugs at competitive prices from a single source. During the first quarter, we experienced a revenue tailwind from higher volumes related to weight loss or GLP-1 drugs. Our full year outlook assumes that volumes related to GLP-1 drugs will remain elevated compared to the prior year and may vary to quarter-to-quarter. We anticipate this class of drugs will continue to be a revenue tailwind for U.S. Pharmaceutical as we support our customers through our distribution services. As I discussed earlier, these drugs have a lower distribution margin rate profile. For the full year, we now anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues to increase 13% to 15% and operating profit to increase 3% to 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increased 8% to 11%. The full year performance includes continued investment in our oncology platform and increased technology spend to support the growth of the segment. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 7% to 13% and operating profit growth of 15% to 19%, which reflects increased utilization and new brand prescription transaction volumes, including the GLP-1 drugs and strong demand for the access adherence and affordability, products and programs that we offer. We anticipate that we may continue to see quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment driven by transaction volumes, the pace and trajectory of new product drug launches and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter. In the Medical Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to be approximately a 1% decline to 3% growth and operating profit to decrease 5% to 11%. For the full year we anticipate volumes of COVID-19 tests to continue to decline compared to fiscal 2023, and the impact from the COVID-19 related items will remain immaterial to fiscal 2024 results. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 15% year-over-year. And finally in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 30% to 34% and operating profit to decline by 23% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes a loss of operating profit contribution from European businesses and transactions that we closed during fiscal 2023. As I\u2019ve previously discussed, we intended to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset the dilution resulting from the European divestitures. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $580 million to $640 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments reported in the first quarter, as well as elevated technology spend to support the growth of our businesses. Now, moving below the line. As a result of the debt transactions that I discussed earlier in my remarks, we anticipate lower interest expense in the range of $205 million to $225 million. Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expense. Our outlook incorporates plan to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares. As a result of the share repurchases activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately 133 million to 134 million. Our portfolio continues to generate strong free cash flow. We remain committed to operating profit growth and efficient capital deployment, and our 24% return on invested capital illustrates our focus on shareholder value creation. In summary, our strong start to fiscal 2024 and our outlook for the remainder of the year results in an increase to adjusted earnings per diluted share to a new range of $26.55 to $27.35. Excluding the impact of certain items and the contribution from our European operations, we anticipate earnings per diluted share growth of 16% to 20% in fiscal 2024. Our outlook further demonstrates the shareholder value creation framework that we\u2019ve discussed previously. We continue to be focused on sustainable growth and efficient deployment of capital. We\u2019re pleased with a strong start to the fiscal year. Our 50,000 team McKesson associates continue to deliver exceptional performance. Our first quarter financial performance reflects their dedication as well as the strength of our portfolio. Through our expansive oncology and biopharma platforms, we\u2019re supporting customers and patients by advancing health outcomes for all. We\u2019re delivering faster time to therapy for patients, and we\u2019re accelerating the discovery, development and manufacturing of new therapies. Our services and solutions are at the forefront of improving patient outcomes and ensuring more patients have access to quality care. With our strong underlying momentum from the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and our aligned focus on our growth strategies, we remain confident that we\u2019ll continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders. With that let me turn it back over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and good afternoon. Thank you for all the details. I just want to go back and just better understand a few things around GLP-1. So Britt, you gave us a lot of data, but when I think about the increase in the revenue from 9% to 11% to 13% to 15%, can you talk about specifically how much is coming from GLP-1s? And then I understand that between cold chain and some other things that the gross profit is less on GLP-1. But how do I think about some of the other areas that potentially can offset this? We\u2019re hearing stabilization in generic pricing right now. You talked about growth in specialty, which I also think is generally lower margin, but some of the other areas, you\u2019ve talked about procurement opportunities. So, I just wanted to understand two things : one, when we think about GLP-1s and think about the contribution to the revenue side? And then secondly, how do we try to bifurcate some of these things on the margin side, so we can have an idea of how to think about really modeling the margin going forward? Britt Vitalone : Well, thanks, Lisa, for the question. There\u2019s a lot to unpack there. Let me see if I can try to answer some of those questions for you. As we talked about, the revenue growth was very broad based across the company, but in particular, within U.S. Pharma. Certainly, we\u2019re benefiting from stronger utilization trends overall, and that does include GLP-1s. And as I mentioned, they do provide a tailwind. Just generally speaking though, utilization trends continue to be solid growth and improvement. We\u2019re certainly, as I mentioned, from a margin rate profile, GLP-1 have a lower distribution margin rate profile. But also, as I mentioned, the breadth of the portfolio that we have, we also offer affordability and access solutions within our technology segment. And those programs like prior authorization have been very well received. They\u2019re providing a lot of value to our customers. And so there\u2019s a secondary component to the services that we provide on behalf of those drugs. So just generally speaking, I think that the utilization environment has been \u2013 continued to be solid. The pricing environment continues to be competitive but stable. Our generic programs continue to perform quite well, particularly our sourcing programs. And we\u2019re benefiting from just broad-based performance across all of the channels that we provide services to. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good afternoon and thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe if I can spend a little time on RxTS. Last year, it was almost like a discovery year in terms of the moving pieces that we saw over the course of the year. This year, really coming out of the gate strong in terms of profit growth. And I know you mentioned some of the prior authorizations. Given the noise and moving pieces we\u2019ve had in prior authorizations broadly against the backdrop of GLP-1 and other areas, is that the biggest driver of growth that you see in the RxTS business? And how should we think about the, I guess, lumpiness or lack thereof that we could see over the course of this year relative to the fact that last year was a little bit more volatile than I think we would have all expected? Brian Tyler : Thanks, Michael. I\u2019ll start and talk about the RxTS business a little bit. We\u2019ve talked in the past about the importance of mix in this business, the different financial profiles of the 3PL business, which had good growth in the quarter versus the more technologically oriented solutions that we have. And so that mix will always be important and did introduce some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter over our prior fiscal year. I would say, in general though, this business is going to benefit from the utilization trends that Britt talked about. And specifically, as prescription volumes go up, as the need for prior authorization services go up, that\u2019s help for our business. And we\u2019re going to win by winning more of these manufacturer relationships, extending our relationships in the places where we have them today, it\u2019s spend [ph] more penetration, if you will. We\u2019re going to benefit from those kinds of volume-related things over time. Now as new drugs launch, as they go through their life cycles, there can be some variation into the demands and needs of the services we offer, and that\u2019s just a natural part of the business. Britt Vitalone : Mike, maybe just one other thing that I would add is, we continue to develop this segment. One of the things that we\u2019re doing is continue to add capabilities and programs within it. So as time goes on, we\u2019re offering more services, which is certainly taking advantage of utilization trends. We added Rx Savings Solutions last year, so another capability with a whole another set of economics available to us and our customers. So I think what you\u2019re seeing is the investments that we\u2019re making within the segment and the additional programs and capabilities that we\u2019re adding, and certainly the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions is just adding to the growth that we\u2019re seeing on a year-over-year basis. Brian Tyler : We also continue to make investments into this segment, and that the timing of those investments isn\u2019t always linear. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead. Eric Coldwell : Hey, thanks very much. Congrats on a nice report. So during the quarter, the health of one of your known customers, I\u2019ll leave the name out was very much in debate and I\u2019m just larger, bigger picture here. Curious if you could talk about, in general, when you see possible challenges at an account, what kind of protections do you put in place, whether it be just in time inventories, collection practices things of that sort. And also if a formal restructuring were to occur such as a chapter 11, what protections do you have then in terms of things like critical vendor status or other items? Just a lot of debate from the investor base in terms of what actually happens if a larger account has more pronounced challenges. Thank you very much, Brian Tyler : Eric, thanks for the question and I appreciate where you\u2019re coming from on this for probably obvious reasons, we don\u2019t get into the health or the economics or the situation of our customers. We do stay very close to our customers. We\u2019re always trying to find ways to help them to grow and find additional services and capabilities for them. So I feel good about the customer contacts that we have and our ability to understand their strategies and their growth \u2013 what they\u2019re trying to do from a growth perspective. And I think the broad base set of customers that we have across each of our segments that feel comfortable with how we manage our relationships. Beyond that, I really can\u2019t get into the specifics of our contracts that we have with each customer. Hopefully you can understand that. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess on the GLP-1s, I have to ask, just because it\u2019s obviously such a big driver, but do you think that your share of the market corresponds to your typical share within a category or a drug? Meaning is have you been able to secure more supply or do you have any means is your distribution channel such that you\u2019re have a greater percent share of that market than you might normally for whatever reason, whether it\u2019s contractually or just the way your mix is set up? Brian Tyler : I would think that our mix would be fairly representative of our business mix overall. We probably have our appropriate share and health systems, our appropriate share and independence, our appropriate share and large retail national accounts. This \u2013 there have been points in time where supply has been less than demand. We work closely with all of our vendors to make sure we get our representative and fair share, and that we can coordinate with them and communicate effectively with our customers. But overall, I\u2019d say we would have the mix, he would expect. Britt Vitalone : Yes, I would say that it\u2019s a fair question. And as we talked about, GLP-1s did provide a revenue tailwind for our distribution business. But I would just remind you that the growth in the segment was very broad based. It was across specialty products. It was across our generics business, and it was really across each of the segments outside of GLP-1s. And that reflects the utilization trends. It also reflects the services and capabilities that we have that we provide to our broad customer base. So certainly GLP-1s are topical and have provided a tailwind, but the business is performing quite well across really all categories and our customer base. Kevin Caliendo : Thank you. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. I want to ask a RxTS question that is somewhat GLP-1 related, which is as you see products go from tightly managed to more open access, how does RxTS\u2019 offering change? And have you seen success moving from early restricted access assistance to adherence or other offerings? Brian Tyler : Well, the \u2013 I mean, the nature of what we offer for the drug is often different at different points in its life cycle. I mean what you might want at launch will be a lot different than what you are at maturity, and it can depend on how other competitors come into the class. We like to try to think about supporting the products over the course of their lifetime. Obviously there, payer and employer decisions around how they want to treat certain classes of drugs can dictate the services that we might offer. And as these drugs are relatively new to market, speaking as an employer, I can tell you, employers out there are thinking about how they want to handle them. That\u2019s going to be different for each of the employers, but generally it\u2019s positive momentum for the business. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator, next question please. Operator : And next will be A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mr. Rice, are you on the line? Please check your mute button. A.J. Rice: Yes. Sorry. Hello everybody. I just wanted to delve a little bit into the oncology ecosystem. I think Sarah Cannon and Ontada are still in an investment mode. Is that meaningfully different from quarter-to-quarter as you lay out this year\u2019s numbers? And is it meaningfully different than the investment level from last year? And obviously, as you\u2019re putting this in place, you\u2019re expecting it to have a benefit on its own. But I wondered if you could comment on the sort of flywheel benefit to the rest of the businesses from making this push in oncology that you expect to realize? Britt Vitalone : Hey A.J., thanks for the question. Let me try and answer that for you. I\u2019ll start and Brian can add on. We have been investing principally in our Ontada business, where we\u2019re developing data and insights. And I would say that on a year-to-year basis, the overall investment is probably not vary too much on a year-to-year basis. Now quarter-to-quarter, that can certainly vary, and \u2013 but on a year-to-year basis our investment has been pretty constant. And as Sarah Cannon Research is really in the integration phase, and I talked about some of the integration costs for both of the Sarah Cannon and the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions. But the investment that we\u2019ve principally been making it and develop our Ontada business on an annual basis has been pretty constant year-over-year, quarter-to-quarter it would vary. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator : And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Grosslight : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the generics environment. You\u2019ve mentioned this a few times as a tailwind. If you look at third-party data, it seems to point to a much more benign generic pricing environment. So I\u2019m just curious what in your view is driving this better pricing environment? How are you managing potential shortages that have got some press recently? And then for the remainder of the year, how should we think about the generics environment and that impact on your revised guidance? Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thanks for the question. Here\u2019s what I would say. In terms of our generics program, it is a combination of the sourcing activities that we have, which really reflects the relationships that we have across hundreds of manufacturing partners. And then it reflects the discipline that we have on the sell-side. And the combination of that has led to some really good results. Now we\u2019ve also had some new brand or I should say some new generic launches, and we certainly participate in those new generic launches as well. And we had a few in the quarter that we benefited from. So the combination of our sourcing operations, the stability that we\u2019re seeing in a competitive marketplace has provided us the ability to create spread, at the same time providing competitive pricing for our customers with a stable supply. You mentioned shortages, and we have seen shortages for as long as I\u2019ve been with the company. From time to time, they will spike up like we had with some of the cold and flu products or the illness season products last year. Generally speaking, I would think that \u2013 I would say that the \u2013 what we\u2019re seeing now from a supply perspective is more in line with what we\u2019ve seen historically. Every now and then, you\u2019ll have a product that will be more challenged. But the broad base of partners that we have in our sourcing program allows us to manage through that quite well. And the performance that we\u2019re seeing in the first quarter, which is continued momentum from last year, that\u2019s included in the guidance that we have for the full year. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator : The next will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yes. I want to come back to oncology as well and talk about U.S. oncology. You said visits were up 19% in total, same-store was up 7%. I\u2019ll assume drug pricing was positive. So we\u2019re talking like 20% growth in U.S. oncology in the quarter. I guess can you give us a little bit more detail on McKesson\u2019s kind of exposure to oncology, kind of like the practices versus the drugs versus the GPO? And is that type of growth profile kind of in line with what we\u2019re seeing in all segments of the \u2013 of McKesson\u2019s oncology exposure? Thank you. Britt Vitalone : Hi George, thanks for the question. Let me be clear on what I provided. I provided some insight into patient visits metrics. And I thought that would be insightful. We had 19% increase year-over-year in total patient visits and 7% on a same-practice basis. I thought that would be insightful. And it also reflects the \u2013 some of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done or some of the new practices that we\u2019ve added over the last year. So again, the numbers that I provided you were patient visit metrics only, and I didn\u2019t indicate anything else besides that. I don\u2019t know, Brian, if you want to comment on the other. Brian Tyler : On the other side, I would just say, we have often referred to this as an ecosystem because we think about the very broad and diverse set of solutions that we offer here, and it\u2019s not just the practice management, it\u2019s the iKnowMed EMR, it\u2019s the GPO services. It\u2019s the revenue cycle management services. It\u2019s the contributions of those systems to managing the clinical practice of oncology effectively. We\u2019ve complemented that in recent years with Ontada, the data analytics insight business and our joint venture with Sarah Cannon. And I think \u2013 then there\u2019s the distribution business. So I think when you put those all together, that\u2019s why we call it an ecosystem because we think in many ways, they self-reinforce. And you\u2019ve seen, in the last several years, pretty good growth in the network. I think that\u2019s in part to that expansive value proposition and the attractiveness we represent to these practices as a partner to help them both provide the best patient care possible and to manage their business as well as they can. Rachel Rodriguez : And we have time for one more question, so last question please. Operator : Certainly that question will come from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. I know this doesn\u2019t impact you from a reimbursement perspective, but I was wondering if you could speak to sort of 340B and the impact on potentially on your PTS business. Is that something that sort of helps? Is it \u2013 does it have a volume fluctuation part in it? Or is it just something that as we kind of get fewer of these 340B prescriptions potentially as the market changes, that could have a modest impact, but is unlikely to really have a real \u2013 be a real driver there? Thank you. Brian Tyler : So I think you asked a 340B relative to our Prescription Technology business. And I would say I would characterize 340B as not a particular driver of that business, just flat out. I\u2019d say the impact of 340B would much more be in our resident pharmaceutical distribution business. And obviously, we\u2019ve talked a lot over the past quarters about evolutions in 340B, whether those be regulatory or commercial actions and reactions. And our best view of all that is reflected in the guidance that Britt and I have provided this afternoon. Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. Thank you for joining the call. I appreciate the thoughtful questions and your interest in McKesson. Thank you, Cynthia, for facilitating the call. I\u2019ll just wrap up by saying McKesson delivered strong first quarter results. Our financial strength is really a testament to the significant progress we\u2019ve made in advancing McKesson as a diversified health care services company. We\u2019re confident in our differentiated market position and our ability to execute and continue to create long-term shareholder value. Thanks again for joining us. I hope you all have a terrific evening. Operator : Thank you for joining today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome everyone to McKesson\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today, I\u2019m joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson\u2019s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today\u2019s earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most current recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today\u2019s earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everybody. We appreciate you joining us on our call today. We are very pleased to report another solid quarter and fiscal 2024 with adjusted results of above expectations demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create sustained value for our shareholders. In the second quarter revenues increased 10% to $77.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $6.23. When excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per diluted share increase 14% from the prior year. Our performance through the first half of the fiscal year combined with the continued momentum in advancing our company strategies gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share. Our previous guidance range of $26.55 to $27.35 has been updated to a range of $26.80 to $27.40. McKesson continues to deliver on our mission of improving care in every setting. As a diversified healthcare services company we are making important progress in strengthening our portfolio of differentiated assets and bringing more value to our customers and their patients. Before I turn my attention to our company priorities and the second quarter results, I want to briefly discuss Rite Aid's recent bankruptcy proceedings. We have been supplying Rite Aid with a majority of their pharmaceutical products for more than 20 years. As they navigate through their reorganization process, we are working closely with them to provide continued delivery of products. We are closely monitoring developments, but as Britt will describe in his remarks, we anticipate that Rite Aids bankruptcy filing will not materially impact fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share. Now let me move on to our company priorities and I want to start by recognizing our people, including the diverse dedicated and talented team we have built here at McKesson. Investing in people and culture is foundational to our strategy and we offer many engagement programs and initiatives to empower our employees and allow them to express new ideas to contribute their unique perspectives and to care for each other. We firmly believe that we achieve our full potential when our culture is diverse, inclusive and focused on best talent. Our efforts fostering a culture of belonging are well recognized. Recently, we were honored to be named by Forbes as one of America's Best Employers for Women. And for the 8th consecutive year, we were named as one of the best places to work for disability inclusion, earning a top ranking score of 100. We appreciate all the hard work and dedication from Team McKesson and we recognize the importance of helping, respecting, and caring for each other. On October 27th, we celebrated our Annual Wellness Day called Your Day Your Way. This is the third year that we've celebrated this tradition and shown appreciation for our employees by providing them with additional day off work to prioritize their personal health and well-being. Let's take a minute to review the performance of the distribution business and the progress we've made driving sustainable core growth. In the second quarter, we saw strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Over the past ten quarters, the segment has consistently delivered double digit revenue increases demonstrating our ability to serve and grow with our customers. In the second quarter, we continued to observe solid prescription volume trends, particularly in the category of GLP-1 medications, which contributed to revenue growth in the quarter. And over the past three years, we were honored to support the U.S. Government as a centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines. Our team demonstrated incredible agility and dedication and standing up a fit for purpose operation distribute the vaccines across the country. This past September, we started transitioning the COVID-19 vaccine distribution to commercial channels. We're working closely with the manufacturers to bring vaccines to patients in an efficient and timely manner. As one of the largest distributors of flu vaccines in the country, we have scaled channel reach and deep expertise in working with vaccine products. And I'm pleased to say that through October 20th, we have distributed nearly 8 million COVID-19 vaccines through our commercial channels. In the Medical-Surgical segment, we continue to support our customers evolving needs with a diversified portfolio of products and broad experience in medical-surgical and related supplies. As a reminder, while we serve many alternate site providers, the biggest channel within the segment is primary care including physician offices. We closely track market data and during the second quarter we observed general market moderations in primary care foot traffic. We also saw a year-over-year decline in instances of respiratory illness and flu which contributed to lower illness testing and patient visits in the primary care business. These dynamics impacted the segment results in the second quarter and our full year fiscal 2024 outlook. However, we remain confident in the fundamentals of the business and the strength of our scaled assets within the Medical-Surgical segment. InnoMed.: InnoMed serves : InnoMed: InnoMed: InnoMed: InnoMed: Moving on to the biopharma services platform, through strategic acquisitions and investments, we've built a set of highly differentiated assets within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment. The combination of these assets creates a powerful and scaled network that includes multiple touch points throughout the patient treatment journey. We are connected to approximately 900,000 providers, enabling solutions that help move barriers to access prescription medications. We're also connected to over 50,000 pharmacies helping patients afford their prescriptions through solutions like cash, copay and digital coupons right at the pharmacy counter. In the second quarter, we were pleased with the strong performance in the segment with double digit growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit, driven by growth in access solutions including increased volumes and prior authorizations for GLP-1 medications. The year-over-year comparison was also partially impacted by lower prior year results which as we called out in Q2 of our fiscal 2023 included higher operating expenses resulting from the timing of increased headcount to support customer annual verification activities. One of the areas where we saw significant growth in the past two quarters is our access solutions, including prior authorizations for brands like GLP-1 medications. For selected prescription drugs, patients are required to obtain approval from their health plan, which sometimes can be very manual and cumbersome. What we offer is an automated technology solution that is embedded within the provider's workflow. Our technology solution introduces efficiency to the process. More than 40% of our prior authorizations are approved instantly and approximately 65% are approved within one hour. We continue to add new features and functionalities to improve the user experience. The latest feature introduced allows providers to share prior authorization outcomes directly with their patients when a health plan makes a determination. Through improvements like this, we help remove barriers and provide greater patient visibility to the prior authorization process. Solutions like prior authorizations are great examples of the success of our business strategy. It's also a reflection of our efforts to improve medication access and ultimately advance health outcomes for all. As an impact driven organization, we're deeply committed to advancing our strategy and contributing to positive changes in the communities where we live and work. This past quarter we celebrated our Community Impact days, which is McKesson's largest annual company-wide employee volunteer event. Thousands of McKesson employees participated in various community impact projects that aligned with this year's theme, Cancer Awareness, Prevention and Support. This year marked the 25th anniversary of the event and we will continue honoring this tradition and will work to find more ways to enhance the health of those who live in our communities. So let me pull everything together. McKesson delivered a solid second quarter, thanks to the contribution and dedication of over 50,000 McKesson employees, we continue to execute against our company priorities with focus and excellence. Leveraging our differentiated services and solutions, we're well positioned to continue to improve care in every setting. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to drive continued growth and strategic advancement in fiscal 2024 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to Britt for additional comments. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian. We're pleased with our second quarter results which reflect another quarter of solid performance driven by operational execution and meaningful growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Before I turn to our consolidated results, I want to highlight one item that impacted our second quarter GAAP only results. We recorded a pretax GAAP provision for bad debts of $210 million or $155 million after tax. Within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment for uncollected trade accounts receivable related to Rite Aid bankruptcy. We anticipate recording an additional provision for bad debts of $511 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. For trade accounts receivable that McKesson recognized from sales to Rite Aid in October 2023 prior to its bankruptcy petition. We continued to provide distribution services to Rite Aid post their bankruptcy filing, providing the same efficiency and operational excellence as we have for over 20 years. We're operating pursuant to an interim agreement for distribution services which is pending final court approval, and includes reduced credit terms of seven days and certain other items as Rite Aid continues to reorganize. We are closely monitoring developments and we anticipate this customer event will not have a material impact to our fiscal 2024, adjusted earnings per diluted share results, our liquidity position and ongoing business operations. The remainder of my comments refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results unless I state otherwise. Let me start with a review of our second quarter results. McKesson delivered solid growth in the second quarter, led by strong performance in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Our focus and execution against our company priorities positioned us to generate consistent, solid financial results. We'll continue to evolve and grow our diversified portfolio through focused strategic investments in oncology and biopharma services. As a result of our operating performance and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our full year outlook for fiscal 2024, adjusted earnings per diluted share to a range of $26.80 to $27.40. Moving to our consolidated results, revenues increased 10% to $77.2 billion, led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and GLP-1 medications, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment resulting from fiscal 2023 divestitures of certain testing European businesses. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, revenue increased 15%. Gross profit was $3 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 1% and when excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, second quarter gross profit increased 8%, primarily a result of growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Operating expenses decreased 2% in the quarter. And when we exclude the impact of our European business operations including completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year, which included approximately 2% from cost related to the second half fiscal 2023 acquisitions of RX Savings Solution and the joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute. Second quarter operating profit increased 1% to $1.2 billion, again primarily driven by growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. This was partially offset by slower growth in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, including lower illness season testing and the completed divestitures of our European business operations within the International segment. If we exclude the impact of COVID-19 related items of fiscal 2023 and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 12% in the quarter. Moving below the line, the effective tax rate was 23.5%, which included the recognition of a net discrete tax expense of $12 million. Second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $134.8 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Consolidated second quarter earnings per diluted share was $6.23, which represents an increase of 3% over the prior year. Excluding COVID-19 related items during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, second quarter earnings per diluted share was up 14% over the prior year. Turning to our second quarter segment results, which can be found in Slides 7 through 11 and starting in U.S. Pharmaceutical. The U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered continued momentum and strong operating profit growth. Our ability to drive sustainable growth in this segment reflects a few factors. The efficiency of our scale distribution operations, the investments that we're making to unlock new capabilities that will further expand and strengthen our value proposition for our customers and partners, a balanced approach to managing a broad portfolio of pharmaceutical products inclusive of ClarusONE generic sourcing operations bolstering our competitive position and enabling a nimble approach to customer demands, new product launches and market movements and continued investment and expansion in our broad oncology platform. We are pleased with the growth momentum across our oncology assets from provider solutions in the U.S. Oncology Network data and insights through Ontada and expanded clinical trial capabilities through our Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture. These assets contributed to revenue and operating profit results in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations. Second quarter revenues were $69.8 billion, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Revenue growth reflected increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and GLP-1 medications. These increases were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. The growth of GLP-1 medications provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. As a reminder, we generally recognize lower margin rates for the distribution of GLP-1 medications in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, the growth of GLP-1 medications like other new brand launches has led to increased demand for our access solutions such as prior authorization services. Second quarter U.S. Pharmaceutical operating profit increased 8% to $815 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products and increased contributions from our generic programs. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 15% year-over-year. Moving to Prescription Technology Solutions. The strong results in the second quarter demonstrate the success of our product portfolio and the partnership with biopharma manufacturers that we've developed over the years. The strength of our differentiated capabilities and partnerships positioning testing to capture demand driven by strong prescription utilization trends, including the growth of GLP-1 medications. For the second quarter, revenues increased 12% year-over-year to $1.1 billion and operating profit increased 48% to $209 million. Second quarter results reflect increased subscription transaction volumes, which drove higher demand for our access solutions primarily related to prior authorization services and growth. The year-over-year growth also included higher operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which resulted from the timing of increased headcount to support customer annual verification activities. Medical-Surgical Solutions revenues were $2.8 billion in the quarter, which was flat to the prior year, resulting from anticipated lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. Government's COVID-19 vaccine program. The anticipated lower COVID-19 related revenues were partially offset by growth in the extended care business and increased distribution of pharmaceuticals in the primary care business. Operating profit was $254 million, a decrease of 17%, driven by anticipated lower contributions from kitty storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program and lower sales of COVID-19 tests. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, segment delivered operating profit growth of 5% driven by increased volumes of nutritional supplements in the extended care business. Based on IQVIA and other market indications, the second quarter exhibited moderating primary care market volumes. The Medical-Surgical Solutions second quarter growth rate reflects these market indications, which was partially related to a slower start to the illness season including illness season testing when compared to the prior year. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues in the second quarter were $3.5 billion, a decrease of 44% year-over-year and operating profit was $89 million, a decrease of 35%. Second quarter results reflect the year-over-year effects of the completed divestitures within our European business. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $159 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% year-over-year. During the quarter, we had losses of $10 million or $0.06 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to losses of approximately $3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, the McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth stage digital, health and services companies. We're pleased with the insights and the results that we are obtaining through this portfolio. And as a result, McKesson's investment may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. Turning now to cash flows and capital deployment which can be found on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We delivered free cash flow of $825 million in the second quarter and $4.3 billion for the trailing 12 months. Our cash balance and free cash flow in the second quarter included payments totaling $529 million associated with settlement agreements for opioid related claims. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on and therefore can vary from quarter-to-quarter. During the first six months of the fiscal year, we made $264 million of capital expenditures, which included investments in new and existing distribution centers as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. Year-to-date, we returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $1.5 billion of share repurchases and $149 million in dividend payments. Now let me discuss our updated outlook. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. The guidance I'm providing today relates to fiscal 2024. Our outlook assumptions can be found in Slides 13 through 17 and our supplemental slide presentation. Let me start with the outlook for our segments. For the full year, we now anticipate U.S. pharmaceutical revenues to increase 13% to 15%. And operating profit increased 6% to 8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 14%. This updated segment outlook incorporates the strong second quarter performance as well as further growth in our generic sourcing programs and specialty distribution, including our differentiated plasma and biologics business. Our full year outlook assumes that volumes related to GLP-1 medications will remain elevated compared to the prior year and may vary quarter-to-quarter. We anticipate to consolidate GLP1 medication revenue and operating profit growth compared to prior year will slow in our fiscal fourth quarter reflecting the inflection of volumes for these medications in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We anticipate GLP-1 medications will continue to be a revenue tailwind for U.S. Pharmaceutical. However, distribution of these medications has a lower distribution margin rate profile and represents a headwind to prior year results. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 7% to 13%. We have increased our operating profit growth outlook to 18% to 22%, reflecting strong momentum in our Access Solutions and strong first half performance. We may continue to see quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment driven by prescription and transaction volumes, the timing, pace and trajectory of new product drug launches, the timing and size of investments to support and expand our product portfolio and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter. Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment remains well positioned across all alternate site channels with unmatched scale, product assortment and capabilities. In the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to be approximately a 2% decline to 2% growth and operating profit decreased 12% to 16%. For the full year, we anticipate volumes of COVID-19 tests to continue to decline compared to fiscal 2023 and the impact from COVID-19 related items will remain immaterial to fiscal 2024 results. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 5% to 7% year-over-year. Our outlook incorporates the second quarter results which I discussed earlier. We anticipate the general market moderations in primary care foot traffic. In part, driven by a modest illness season may persist through the remainder of fiscal 2024. Additionally, first half fiscal 2023 results benefited from an extended illness season, which did not repeat in fiscal 2024. Our outlook includes continued investments in our scale distribution network, adding state-of-the-art automation regulatory capabilities to serve the breadth of our customer base. These distribution network investments support the breadth of our non-acute customers and broader core distribution, for example COVID vaccines for physician offices. We also anticipate further investments in data and analytics to expand the channel reach for our medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and private brand product portfolio. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 30% to 34% and operating profit to decline by 23% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes a loss of operating profit contribution from European businesses and transactions that we closed during fiscal 2023. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $600 million to $660 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments recorded in the first half of the year and elevated technology spend to support the growth of our businesses. ClarusONE: Turning to cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.7 to $4.1 million. Our outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 million of shares. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $134 million. In summary, as a result of solid performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, combined with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our earnings per diluted share outlook for fiscal 2024 $0.40 [ph]. We anticipate operating profit will be flat to 4% decline compared to the prior year. When excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit increase by 6% to 10% year-over-year. As a reminder, certain items include the following; net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024. A $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement would change health care in fiscal 2023 and $1.90 related to COVID-19 related items in our U.S. pharmaceutical and medical surgical segments in fiscal 2023. We anticipate the impact of COVID-19 related items will be immaterial to fiscal 2024 when compared to fiscal 2023. The increase to our outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share indicates earnings per diluted share growth of 14% to 17% when excluding these certain items. When further excluding the contribution from the run off of our European operations, earnings per diluted share growth is indicated at 18% to 20% for the full year. We also anticipate the fiscal third quarter to be stronger than the fiscal fourth quarter based on the development of prescription transactions, patient visits, internal investments and the recognition of discrete tax benefit in the third quarter. In closing, we are pleased with our strong first half performance. The momentum across the business, including growth in our oncology and biopharma services platforms, positions us to deliver for our customers and our partners and to create sustainable shareholder value. With that, let's move to the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. I'd like to focus on RxTS and specifically, Brett, you mentioned that the guidance reflects a strong Q2, but it sounded like there's a range of outcomes for the second half. Can you provide some context on whether revenue upside that you've seen this year on delivering on prior authorization for GLP-1 has been tied to manufactured programs versus the volume of scripts being written? And would it be wrong to assume somewhat conservative or some conservatism here on how second half developed? And last I'll ask, are there particular indicators such as denial rates or new starts that you look for as you're modeling this business? Britt Vitalone : Yes, Eric, thanks for that question. I'll start and then certainly I'll let Brian add on to that. You really touched on a lot of the factors that we look at when we think about this segment. As I mentioned we've seen continued stable and strong utilization trends that certainly drives transactions which are services benefit from. Secondly, we've seen continued growth in GLP-1 medications as an example and our services primarily prior authorization support those programs that we've seen a growth from that aspect. As I mentioned in my remarks, there are a number of things that can create some variability and certainly can drive the segment from a revenue and operating profit perspective and you touched on a few of those. As I mentioned, prescription utilization is one of those. Certainly the timing and the pace and the trajectory of drug launches, GLP-1 category being one of those drug launch categories and certainly the timing of other programs like the annual verification programs that we do for our customers in the fourth quarter. So we've seen good stable utilization trends. We've seen new drug launches like categories like GLP-1 medications that utilize the successful prior authorization programs that we have and we've certainly seen revenue and operating profit trend in a similar manner to that. Rachel Rodriguez : Next please. Operator : Thank you. And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Britt, I've got to stick on this area. Just really want to understand if I'd take the numbers that you talked about and the updated guidance for the second half of the year, it looks like the margin in Prescription Technology Solutions, what will come down pretty dramatically versus what we saw in the first half of the year, growth rate will come down. So is this conservatism? Is there incremental programs and expenses that you have? Is it, you know, any changes in the program? I'm just trying to understand how to think about this business on kind of a normalized basis and again, how do we think about first half versus second-half? Britt Vitalone : 3PL: The other thing that I would talk about is, I mentioned earlier in my remarks is that GLP-1s are flattening out year-over-year to get to the fourth quarter because that's what we anticipate. We saw a significant inflection in GLP-1 medication volumes in the fourth quarter of last year and certainly we've seen elevated levels of GLP-1 medication volumes through this year, but as you kind of get to a year-over-year begin to lap that fourth quarter inflection point, that's certainly going to be another factor for the year-over-year and a second half component. So I think there's a lot of things going on here, but if you look at the business on an annual basis, I think you'll see very good consistent revenue and operating profit growth. Brian Tyler : Yes. The only thing I would add to that Britt is that if you look at the growth in the trajectory the segment has had historically we continue to also reinvest in product extensions, new product enhancements, new products overall. We're excited about this segment. We're excited about the assets that we have and we want to make sure we continue to invest into this segment to protect future growth as well. And all those investments are reflected in our FY '24 outlook. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I'd like to ask about the Rite Aid on the reserves, I know you kind of reached a settlement with Rite Aid for ongoing supply of the pharmaceuticals for Rite Aid as they reorganize the reserves that you take in, can you talk a little bit about how are you going to approach collections on that and how should we think about that in terms of the way you reserve for it and the way we should think about that the cash flows? Britt Vitalone : Sure. I appreciate the question. Let me just go back to some of my earlier comments because I think that these are questions. First of all, we continue to provide distribution services to Rite Aid as we have for over 20 years and we're proud to be a distributor for Rite Aid and their customers. We did record a provision in the third quarter for those sales that we considered the uncollected trade accounts receivable as of September 30, that's the $210 million that I referenced. We anticipate an additional provision that will be recorded in our third quarter for those sales up until they're back to their bankruptcy filing and that's the $511 million. We have an interim agreement in place that is still pending final court approval and that interim agreement has different credit terms. They have shorter credit terms of seven days. There are other aspects to the interim agreement, but the key thing for this call for this group is that those credit terms are on 70 terms, which are different than what we had in the previous agreement. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good afternoon guys. Britt Just a quick question from me. As I think about your operating expense line, pretty good level of improvement there especially in the margin side. How should we be thinking about the sustainability of operating expenses and potential gains going forward? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Thank you for the question, but I'm not sure what you're referring to, you used the word gains. As we think about our operating expenses, we have great operating expense discipline and the efficiency of our operations allows us to drive operating margin leverage. We've been able to do that for a long period of time. The success that we've seen in many of our segments really has allowed us to continue to reinvest back into the business. Brian just mentioned what we've been doing at Rx Savings Solutions or I should say RxTS where we've been reinvesting to drive additional programs and capabilities for our customers. But as I mentioned in my comments, we've also been investing in distribution network capabilities, additional automation and regulatory capabilities that we're going to benefit not only our operations but our customers. We're also investing in data and analytics. We think that's going to be important to drive the efficiency of our operations, the capabilities for our customers. So you should expect to see us continue to deliver operating margin leverage, but to continue to invest against our programs, our capabilities on behalf of those efficiencies and our customers. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead. Eric Coldwell : Hi, this is Eric. Was that me? I had a beep here. Britt Vitalone : Hi Eric. Eric Coldwell : He I'm good. Okay, thanks. Hi guys. I wanted to hit on the Med-Surg segment specifically primary care. I think you're under -- your comments on slow start, low ramp in the illness season is I think well understood. We've seen that elsewhere. I'm curious what else you might have seen in the quarter that could lend some color on the lower primary care volumes. You know, I've heard heavy travel season from some companies. I've heard others talk about vacation schedules, just the timing of the calendar if you will, but I'm curious if you have any more details or thoughts you could add on the primary care trend? And if you could, could you quantify the rate of growth change that you saw during the September quarter? Thank you. Brian Tyler : Tripledemic: IQVIA: Britt Vitalone : And Eric, I would just also point out that we are extremely well positioned across all ultra-sites of care and the confidence that we have in that position to service our customers, we're continuing to make investments and I talked about some of the investments that we are making not only in distribution capabilities in the network, but also in data and analytics to help support our customers and the product portfolio that we provide to them. So we have a lot of confidence in the position and the capabilities that we have and the investments that we're making are a reflection of that. Brian Tyler : And we do think macro trends support the continued migration of care into these alternate sites or these more community based settings. So we are well positioned. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks for taking my question. The Pharma segment growth continues to be really impressive and I'm guessing it's more than just the typical fundamentals of pharma distribution with generic pricing or generic mix and the like. Can you talk about how the mix is evolving? Maybe is it some of your oncology businesses, some of the clinics you purchased recently that are contributing? How is that mix changing currently to drive this sort of outsized EBIT growth that you're seeing? Britt Vitalone : ClarusONE: Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Grosslight : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the Medical segment and the cadence for the remainder of the year. If I just look at guidance, it implies around a 4% increase in both revenue and AOI from the first half to the second half, so flat margins. You mentioned a less severe flu season and some investments you're making in distribution and data analytics. How should we be thinking about the cadence of AOI for the next two quarters, particularly as we think about some of those larger investments you're making? Britt Vitalone : Yes, it's a great question, Dan. I think for modeling purposes, I would guide you to model something very similar in terms of growth rates to the second quarter. Rachel Rodriguez : Okay. Next question please. Operator : And next will be Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Allen Lutz : ClarusONE: ClarusONE: Brian Tyler : ClarusONE: ClarusONE: Britt Vitalone : Yes, I'll take the second one Brian. As it relates to your question on the restructuring, we did incur certain charges in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2023. We also incurred additional restructuring charges in the first half of fiscal 2024. And so we're still in the process of finalizing the programs and the savings that we have are contemplated within our guidance. So the fact that we started this program in fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, continued the program really taking charges and organizing and integrating through the first half of 2024 and we certainly haven't seen all of the benefits from those programs to this point in time. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please. Operator And next will be Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions here. I guess, are you seeing the generic or easing generic deflation environment, has that been a material driver for you? Just to follow up on the generic side. And then on M&A, and you outlined the share repurchases, but how are you thinking about the acquisition pipeline from here? Where's the focus? What does the M&A pipeline look like? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Britt do you want to take the first part? Britt Vitalone : Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question Erin. As it relates to generics, our focus continues to be on a strong sourcing program combined with discipline on the sell side. We've been operating in a competitive but stable environment now for a number of years really and we're really not seeing any different in the second quarter from what we've seen in the previous several quarters before that. We're able to procure generics very competitively on behalf of our customers and we focused on stability of supply at the same time. So from a generics perspective, our programs are running very well. We feel very well positioned to continue to procure at a low cost and stable supply for our customers and the environment is conducive to us being able to do that. Brian Tyler : And I think the second part of the question was on M&A. Clearly, one of our top priorities for capital deployment is to support the growth and the differentiated capabilities we have in our segments to continue to extend that growth. And so we are and continue to be active on the M&A front. Now we have a very structured and disciplined way we approach that. First is it's got to be aligned to our stated strategy and particularly our growth pillars. And so if you look at recent activities like Rx Saving Solutions or Sarah Cannon joint venture, obviously both very, very tied to our stated growth priorities. And then the second step of that process is to layer over a lens of financial discipline. We have many uses for capital, some internal investment and efficiencies and technologies and tools. Obviously, we have share repurchase hurdles that we can meet. So we bring a lot of financial discipline to the acquisition process to ensure that we're getting good returns for shareholders as we deploy that capital. So it's on strategy and has the appropriate financial return. We're very interested and we continue to develop our business development funnels. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. I had two questions. One on the RxTS business, are you seeing any sort of spillover benefit from GLP-1? I'm thinking like either you know an organization that doesn't use you, that does use you because they've heard about this with the GLP-1s or sort of a cross selling across your group of services within the segment? And then secondarily, on the medical side, one of your competitors on the outpatient side has seen some ordering impact because of sort of website and sort of a cyberattack. Has that provided any kind of material change in customer ordering within that segment in the last couple of weeks? Thank you very much. Brian Tyler : So the first, I think your first question was as it relates to RxTS and this opening new avenues, I would just remind you RxTS is connected to 900,000 providers today and 50,000 plus pharmacies today. So we've had a long established relationship with them and I think we've been well known for quite a long time in that arena. So I don't think that we'd see anything material there. And then your second question was as relates to a competitor ordering challenges, I'm not really not going to get into the issues a competitor might have. I don't think -- we've spent a little bit of time talking about the trends that we saw in the Medical-Surgical business and reviewed those trends and I think those stand for themselves. Rachel Rodriguez : And we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Certainly. That question will come from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, guys, I appreciate you sneaking me and I'll say, Brian and Britt, the oncology business has really been a standout over the last several years. I was wondering if there's a chance that you guys might give us any kind of sense of the scope or scale of the business inside of the U.S. drug segment with any type of number around it? And then Britt as a quick follow up, I guess given the ongoing agreement with Rite Aid, can you tell\u2026 Britt Vitalone : Looks like he dropped off. Operator : Mr. Hill, please proceed. I think we lost him. George Hill : Can you guys hear me? Operator : Yes, go ahead. George Hill : Can you hear me now? Oh, I'm sorry, Britt, Brian, I don't know what happened there. Just the growth of the oncology business has been pretty impressive over the last couple of years. I was just wondering if you would kind of provide any color to kind of give us some sense of the scope and the scale of that business inside the U.S. distribution segment? Any color would be helpful. Brian Tyler : When we talk about our oncology business, we talk about it as an ecosystem, everything from distribution to GPO services to iMed EMR, to community to [indiscernible] to the SCRI joint venture. So there's a lot, a lot of components that go into that. I think what we have provided in terms of sense of scale and scope is 2400 plus providers operating in 27 states seeing roughly 15 plus percent of all cancer patients in the in the community settings, so I hope that helps you get an order of magnitude. Brian Tyler : Okay. Is that our last question? Great. Well, thank you everybody for the questions, for your interest in McKesson and certainly for joining our call today. Thank you operator for helping facilitate the call. I want to conclude by just reiterating McKesson delivered solid second quarter results. We saw continued momentum across the business and we're confident in our ability to deliver sustained long-term growth. As a diversified healthcare services company, we've made significant progress advancing our company priorities. And lastly and importantly, I want to make sure that I thank the McKesson team for all their contributions. It's incredibly humbling and proud to be able to leave the talented and dedicated team. Thanks again everybody. I hope you all have a terrific evening. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome everyone to McKesson\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today, I\u2019m joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson\u2019s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today\u2019s earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most current recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today\u2019s earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon to everybody. Thanks for joining our call. McKesson reported a solid fiscal third quarter highlighting the continued momentum across the business. We delivered total revenues of $80.9 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.74 both of which grew by double-digits when compared to the prior year. As a result of the recent performance and our latest outlook we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $26.80 to $27.40 to an updated range of $27.25 to $27.65. This solid financial performance is driven by that focus execution against our company priorities as a diversified healthcare services company we are uniquely positioned to improve healthcare in every setting. This includes the areas of oncology and biopharma services. We continue to make significant progress in advancing our strategy and priorities, and I'm pleased to share some of the updates with you today. Let me start where I always like to start, and that's with our focus on people and culture. I start here because it's foundational to everything we do at McKesson. In January, our board of directors welcomed Kevin Ozan as a new independent director. As the former Chief Financial Officer of McDonald's Corporation, Mr. Ozan has over two decades of experience in both strategy and finance, and will contribute a valuable perspective to our boardroom. We look forward to his leadership as we work together to deliver on our growth initiatives. Driving the growth of our company requires a talented and diverse leadership team, and equally important, a diverse workforce where each individual is empowered to bring their own opinions, their own ideas, and perspectives. Our commitment to best talent and inclusion is reflected in every aspect of our operations. It's how we build a support network for our employees and how we each live these values through everyday interactions. And I'm pleased to see our efforts being recognized. For the 11th consecutive year, McKesson was named as a military-friendly employer. We were also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greatest workplaces for diversity, and a Quality 100 award winner by the Human Rights Campaign. I'm proud of what we've achieved as a team and I'm truly grateful to the McKesson employees for upholding our culture, values, and delivering for all of our stakeholders, our patients, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, and importantly, each other. Moving on to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth, in the fiscal third quarter, we saw good performance in our distribution businesses. In U.S. pharmaceutical, adjusted operating profit grew 6%, reflecting broad-based momentum within the segment. We continue to enhance our scaled distribution network improving efficiency through investments in automation and technology. Over the past year, we opened two new distribution centers in the U.S. that are equipped with innovative technology and employee-friendly design. These enhancements will enable our facilities to pick, pack, and ship medications to customers faster, while simultaneously helping to optimize employee productivity levels by reducing redundant tasks. The investments in our foundational distribution assets continue to support the growth of our business and the success of our customers. During the third quarter, we saw solid volume increases across customer channels, which includes distribution to retail national accounts customers. At the consolidated level, prescription volume growth remains stable. Certain product categories, including specialty pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications, continue to grow at a faster pace and contribute as a tailwind to our revenue growth. As a reminder, we anticipate the growth from GLP-1 medications to slow in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting the inflection in volumes for these medications in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. In the medical-surgical segment, primary care visits showed modest improvement on a sequential basis after we observed general market moderations last quarter. The improvement was partially driven by overall increase in primary care visits. However, when compared to the prior year, patient visit volumes in the medical segment remain a headwind to this quarter's performance. In the international segment, our Canadian business continues to perform well. It has a valuable portfolio of assets, including pharmaceutical distribution, retail pharmacies, digital offerings. We're committed to strengthening and grow the business there. And as a part of that commitment, we're executing on a multi-year initiative that will modernize the distribution centers across Canada and deliver significant value to our employees and customers. Let me now continue on to talk about our oncology and biopharma platforms. We continue to build on the foundation of our core distribution capabilities, but we have strategically assembled a differentiated set of assets in oncology and biopharma services. Within the oncology business, the U.S. Oncology Network expanded its footprint by entering the state of Tennessee. Over the past quarter, we welcomed two new practices, Nashville Oncology Associates and SCRI Oncology Partners to the network. Through the combination of onboarding new practices and organic growth, the U.S. Oncology Network has grown its provider base to over 2,500, spreading across nearly 600 sites in 30 states. The expansion of the network strengthened our unique market position in community-based oncology practices and demonstrates our strong value proposition to providers. Through the U.S. Oncology Network, we provide a range of comprehensive solutions to ease the administrative and operational burden and to help enable the success of these community practices. In the past quarter, we started integrating new artificial intelligence capabilities into the network, assisting providers with revenue cycle management and evaluating clinical solutions. With the help of AI and machine learning technologies, practices have been able to navigate complex insurance coverage and reimbursement processes more efficiently, allowing providers to spend more time focused on their patients. Within the biopharma services business, we continue to see strong market demand for our differentiated solutions that help improve access, affordability, and adherence to medications. In the third quarter of this fiscal third quarter, the prescription technology solution segment delivered strong performance, primarily driven by the growth in access solutions, including prior authorization solutions for branded pharmaceuticals such as GLP-1 medications. Today, we provide prior authorization services for the vast majority of the GLP-1 medications in the market. Our integrated technology streamlines the prior authorization process and helps overcome medication access challenges that patients are facing. The main customers we serve are biopharma companies, and through our scaled network connection, we can electronically process requests both at the pharmacy counter and the provider's offices. The prior authorization solution is an example of the power of our capabilities and is part of a broader portfolio of patient support services we provide. We believe our solutions are highly differentiated and provide value to all stakeholders through a patient's journey. We're connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and approximately 900,000 providers. The scale of our network provides a strong foundation that enables us to reach key stakeholders effectively and seamlessly. The integrated solutions we offer can often be accessed through a single digital entry point. For our biopharma customers, the integration helps streamline workflows and increase transparency into how programs work together. In the past quarter, our team has been working diligently to prepare for what we call the blizzard season. For the prescription technology solution segment, our fiscal fourth quarter is usually the busiest time of year due to customer annual verification activities. The annual reset of insurance policies typically drives a large influx of seasonal volumes for many of our programs. Each year, our teams come together to tackle the challenge of these significant volume increases. I'm pleased to report that we're on track to deliver another successful blizzard season that is in line with our expectations. Our products and solutions in both oncology and biopharma services provide significant value to our customers as reflected in the continued growth of these businesses. We're excited about the market opportunities in both areas and we're confident in the scale and depth of our assets and expertise. We will continue to invest and innovate to support the evolving needs of our customers and their patients. So let me pull it all together. McKesson reported another solid quarter in fiscal 2024 that allowed us to raise and narrow our full year guidance for adjusted earnings for diluted share. We're committed to our shareholders to delivering long-term sustainable growth and this quarter's results reflect the continued progress in delivering on our commitment. Healthcare is an ever-evolving market, but thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we never stopped finding new ways to drive positive impacts on our customers and their patients. I want to thank the over 50,000 McKesson employees who are working so tirelessly to advance our mission. And with that, I'll hand it over to Britt for some additional insight and comments. Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. We're pleased with our fiscal third quarter 2024 results, which reflect another quarter of solid momentum with growth across our North American businesses. Our results exceeded expectations, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. Before I turn to our consolidated results, I want to highlight one item that impacted our third quarter GAAP only results. We recorded an additional pre-tax GAAP provision for bad debts of $515 million or $381 million after tax within the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. This provision is for uncollected trade accounts receivable from sales to Rite Aid in October of 2023 prior to its bankruptcy petition filing. We continue to provide distribution services to Rite Aid through an interim distribution agreement, providing the same efficiency and operational excellence as we have for over 20 years. We're closely monitoring developments. Rite Aid's bankruptcy will not have a material impact on our fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share results. The remainder of my comments will refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results. Let me start with a review of the fiscal third quarter. McKesson delivered solid growth in the third quarter, led by sustained strong performance in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solution segments. This year-over-year growth underscores operating execution across our diversified and differentiated portfolio, including investments in oncology and biopharma services. As a result of the third quarter operating performance and our confidence in the business, we're increasing and narrowing our full year outlook for fiscal 2024, adjusted earnings per diluted share to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65. Let me move to our consolidated results. Revenues increased 15% to $80.9 billion, led by continued strong utilization trends, growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 medications, partially offset by lower revenues in the international segment, resulting from fiscal 2023 divestitures within McKesson's European business. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 16%. Gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter and increased with 3%. When excluding the impact of our European business operations including completed divestitures and the impact from U.S. government COVID-19 programs in fiscal 2023, gross profit increased 10%. Operating expenses increased 4% in the quarter due to higher costs to support growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solution segments. When excluding the impact of our European business operations including the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year. Third quarter operating profit decreased 9% to $1.3 billion. Fiscal 2023 results included a pre-tax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare. Year-over-year results were also impacted by anticipated lower contributions from U.S. government COVID-19 programs, which were mitigated by contributions from commercial COVID-19 distribution and a non-recurring $30 million charge in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment. These items were partially offset by growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solution segments. When adjusting for these items, including $126 million or $0.65 benefit from the early termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023 and gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 7% in the quarter. Moving below the line, interest expense was $58 million, a decrease of 16% year-over-year driven by effective management of our loan portfolio. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.6%, resulting from the recognition of discrete tax benefit in the quarter. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items. Third quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 133.3 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Consolidated third quarter earnings per diluted share was $7.74, which represents an increase of 12% over the prior year. This increase includes the impacts of approximately $0.63 related to the U.S. government COVID-19 programs and the $0.65 benefit from the termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023, an increased commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution and a non-recurring charge in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment in fiscal 2024. Turning to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on slides seven through 11, and starting with the U.S. pharmaceutical. During the quarter, we experienced volume increases across all product categories and customer channels. Specialty Pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications continue to grow at a faster pace compared to the prior year. Third quarter revenues were $73 billion, an increase of 18% year-over-year, driven by increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 medications. In the quarter, GLP-1 revenues were $7.5 billion, an increase of approximately $2.8 billion or 60% compared to fiscal 2023. During the quarter, we also noted increased contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution. In our fiscal third quarter, commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution peaked in October, then declined significantly in November and December. We do not anticipate material contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution in our fiscal fourth quarter. For the third quarter, operating profit increased 6% to $828 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. Adjusting for the impact of the U.S. government COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023, commercial COVID-19 distribution in fiscal 2024, and the $30 million non-recurring charge in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 8% year-over-year. In our prescription technology solution segment, the growth of GLP-1 medications and new brand launches led to increased demand for our access solutions such as prior authorization services. For the third quarter, revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. And operating profit increased 25% to $193 million. Third quarter results reflect increased prescription transaction volumes, which drove higher demand for our access solutions, principally prior authorization services and growth in our third party logistics business. In addition to the strength of prior authorization services, year-over-year growth was also supported by increased sales to new customers and programs across our access and affordability solutions. Turning to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2%, primarily driven by growth in the primary care and extended care businesses, partially offset by anticipated lower contributions in the kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, primary care patient visits moderately increased on a sequential basis. Demand for commercialized COVID-19 vaccine distribution across the alternate sites of care that we serve was also modestly higher compared to prior expectations. The overall illnesses and dynamics, including vaccinations and testing, continued to be an operating profit headwind in the quarter when compared to the prior year. As a reminder, each illness season is unique, depending on the onset and severity of various respiratory illnesses during that particular year. Operating profit was $282 million, a decrease of 16%, driven by anticipated lower contributions from the kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program and a softer illness season as compared to fiscal 2023. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in the primary care and extended care businesses. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues in the third quarter were $3.6 billion, a decrease of 18% year-over-year, driven by divestitures within McKesson's European business, partially offset by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in Canada. Operating profit was $105 million, a decrease of 27%, driven by divestitures within McKesson's European business. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $147 million in the quarter, which included losses of $8 million, or $0.05 per share, related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio. McKesson Ventures' impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. As a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. We remain pleased with the insights and the results that we're obtaining through this portfolio. Excluding the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement in fiscal 2023, and gains and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, corporate expenses in the third quarter decreased 5% year-over-year. Turning now to cash flows and capital deployment, which can be found on slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We delivered free cash flow of $100 billion in the third quarter, and $2.9 billion for the trailing 12-months. Third quarter free cash flow was impacted by the Right-Aid bankruptcy in October, and its associated $725 million provision for bad debts. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics, and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on, and therefore can vary from quarter-to-quarter. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we made capital expenditure investments of $418 million, which included new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data, and analytics to support our growth priorities. Year-to-date, we returned $2.6 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $2.3 billion of share repurchases, and $232 million in dividend payments. Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full list of our assumptions can be found on slides 13 through 17 in our supplemental slide presentation. Let me start with the fiscal 2024 outlook for our segments. For the full year, we now anticipate U.S. pharmaceutical revenues to increase 16% to 18% and operating profit to increase 6% to 8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 14%. The impact of elevated commercial COVID-19 distribution in the third quarter, net of the $30 million non-recurring charge, also in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, accounts for approximately 2% of segment growth. The updated segment revenue outlook incorporates the strong third quarter performance and continued growth in specialty distribution, supported by stable utilization trends. Revenue growth assumes the GLP-1 medication volumes will continue to be robust, although the rate of growth will moderate in our fiscal fourth quarter. These medications are lower margin and represent a headwind to year-over-year operating profit growth. Our full year operating profit growth also reflects our leading generics program, which continues to deliver on the dual mandate of lower cost and product availability. We continue to be pleased with the strength of our scaled and broad oncology platform. This quarter, as Brian mentioned, we expanded into Tennessee with the addition of two practices. With these additions and organic growth, U.S. oncology is now over 2,500 providers. In the Prescription Technology Solution segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 9% to 13%, and we've increased our operating profit growth outlook to 24% to 28%, reflecting strong third quarter performance, continued organic growth, and higher transaction volumes across our access and affordability solutions. The quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment is driven by prescription and transaction volumes. The timing, pace, and trajectory of new product drug launches, the timing and size of investments to support and expand our product portfolio, and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter. Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment continues to be a leader across all the alternate sites of care. We anticipate revenues to be approximately flat to 4% growth, and operating profit to decrease 11% to 15%. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 6% to 8% year-over-year. Our updated outlook incorporates the third quarter results that I discussed earlier, which reflect a modest improvement in sequential primary care traffic. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 29% to 33%, and operating profit to decline by 21% to 26%, reflecting divestitures within McKesson's European business that closed during fiscal 2023. In the corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $615 to $655 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments recorded in the first nine months of the year, and elevated technology spend to support the growth of our business. Moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $220 million to $230 million, and income attributable to non-controlling interests to be in the range of $155 million to $165 million. We anticipate no change to the full year effective tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%. The timing of discrete tax item is difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning to cash flow and capital deployment, we now anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. Our outlook also incorporates the impact of the October rate of bankruptcy. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $3 billion to $3.5 billion of shares. As a result of this share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $134 million. Wrapping up fiscal 2024 guidance, as a result of solid performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Combined with our momentum, and confidence moving forward, we are increasing and narrowing our earnings per diluted share outlook for fiscal 2024 to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65. We anticipate operating profit will be a 2% decline to 1% growth compared to the prior year. Excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit to increase by approximately 8% to 11% year-over-year above the long-term target range. As a reminder, certain items include the following; $1.90 related to fiscal 2023 U.S. Government COVID-19 program and COVID-19 tests in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments. A $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023. And gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024. The increase to our outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share indicates growth of 16% to 18% when excluding these certain items. Before I close, I'd like to share some initial thoughts on fiscal 2025. The momentum we've seen across our business over the past several years is expected to continue in fiscal 2025. We anticipate the U.S. pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solution segments will be more closely aligned to long-term growth targets that we've previously provided for these segments. Demonstrating our leading market positions and stable financial performance. We anticipate that the strength we're seeing across our solution set and prescription technology solutions will lead to growth at the top end or slightly above the long-term target. In U.S. pharmaceutical, we remain confident in our long-term target of 5% to 7% growth. Supported by sustainable momentum in the core distribution business and across our oncology platform. The U.S. Oncology Network, Ontada and the joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute. As the leader in the alternate site market, we believe that the Medical-Surgical Solution segment is well positioned as care continues to move across the alternate site settings. Our experience and our relationships in every channel and setting of the alternate site markets enable us to capture the opportunity in the years ahead. We anticipate that the Prescription Technology Solution segment may perform modestly above the long-term growth target of 11% to 12% driven by organic growth as we expand our higher margin biopharma services platform. For the International segment, we anticipate continued growth in our Canadian operations. And throughout fiscal 2023, we completed divestitures of the business operations in 11 of the 12 countries that we operated in Europe. As a reminder, Norway remains the only country that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. And we intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. Finally, we will continue to materially invest in the business on multiple fronts. We will sustain the pace and cadence of investment in product development and enhancements across our oncology and biopharma services platforms. These investments will further our differentiated capabilities and market leading positions. We will also continue to invest in adding capacity and capabilities to our North American distribution footprint. These investments include increased capacity, automation, and regulatory excellence capabilities. And we will continue to invest in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in artificial intelligence. We see AI as unlocking the potential to deliver customer and foundational enhancements. Although in the early stages, we're using AI to improve patient intake and workflow, improve productivity throughout the system, including automatic clinical note generation, and several supply chain use cases, including supply chain disruption predictions, forecast accuracy algorithms, and fraud detection. Although we're in the early stages of our AI development and implementation, we're committed to increased investment to further extend our leadership positions and deliver value to our partners and stakeholders. To sum up, we see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business. We're pleased with our strong fiscal 2024 performance, and we remain optimistic about the outlook. McKesson is well positioned to continue to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term, sustainable growth for all stakeholders. And with that, let's move to our Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Obviously, strong performance in RxTS as implied in the guidance. Maybe you can kind of give us a feel for the mix between reauthorizations versus new prior-offs [ph] in that mix. And as we think about through the course of the year as kind of new category, like this is sort of a category that's kind of grown significantly over the last year or so, particularly and if we think about the launch of Zepbound as well from Lilly, can you give us a sense of what the lifecycle typically is for prior-offs [ph] overtime as products mature? What does that activity look like? And maybe give us a sense for what you kind of expect right now, particularly in this, the GLP-1 category. Brian Tyler : Thanks, Charles. I'll start, and Britt as always, feel free to add on. I'm first off, we're very pleased with the solutions that we have in this segment. We think the growth over the last several quarters demonstrates the value that they bring to providers. Just as a reminder, this segment, new brand launches, particularly high-cost drugs, are drivers for this segment. They typically require prior authorization. We have automated solutions there. So as those volumes grow, that's generally good for this business. The GLP-1s were a strong contributor in the current quarter. How the programs evolve will largely be dependent on payer decisions in terms of how frequently they require an authorization or a reauthorization. But certainly, it's been a good tailwind for us. And that's to the blizzard season. I'm pleased to say it played out in accordance to how we expected it to. It's a lot of work. The team really put their head down, had a good plan, and is pushing through that work. And we're very confident we'll end this blizzard season more or less in line with our expectations at the outset of the year. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. I appreciate the 25 initial commentary. And I wanted to focus in on specialty. I thought, coming out of the pandemic, we saw elevated growth. And you're calling out higher growth this year. And I'd like to understand how much of that is organic growth versus gaining of share and beyond oncology, an increase of share in multi-specialty. And then finally, I'd ask, with those practices you're acquiring now, I've seen you've known them for quite some time. What is it that's driving them to join today? Brian Tyler : Let me start. I guess I'll start where you ended with the practices. First thing I think I would say is, we are very pleased with the solid growth in our same store. We can obviously grow our U.S. Oncology Network in multiple ways. We can add, we could add oncologists or providers to an existing practice that we have. We could Greenfield a new practice. We could onboard new practices. And really, we've been benefiting over the last few years from all three of those. We have been very pleased with our ability to attract new members to the U.S. Oncology Network. We've added, I don't know, 500 or 600 providers over the last couple of years. We've entered into six new, we added six new practices and eight new geographies over the calendar year of 2023. Why are we able to do that? We think it's not just great practice management. We've been at this for 15 years, so we've got a leading EMR, we've got leading technology. Britt talked about investments we're making to extend that lead. But I think we also have this broad ecosystem that includes Ontada, which helps us provide insights to our providers. It includes SCRI, which brings in clinical research and trial capabilities. And so we think it's that really broad value proposition, Eric, which allows us to compel the growth we're seeing in the U.S. Oncology Network today. Britt Vitalone : And Eric, maybe I'll just add on, when we think about specialty product growth, we're certainly seeing specialty product growth across not only our largest customers, but across the mentioned [ph] health systems. And certainly as we continue to grow the U.S. Oncology Network and oncology in general, we're certainly seeing more growth in that area as well. So we're seeing growth in specialty products, we're seeing growth across the specialty providers that we service, and as I mentioned, we're also seeing significant growth from GLP-1 medication. So we're really winning across the entirety of our scaled business. And of course, as our customers continue to win, that's reflected in the volume increases also. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please. Operator : And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Great, thanks and good afternoon. I just want to go to your international business. And you talked about how strong Canada is, but there's been some speculation in the marketplace around Rexall. Can you talk about the strategy in Canada and specific to owning a drug retail? Brian Tyler : Well, I will comment obviously on rumors. Let me say this about Canada. We have a very scaled, broad and impactful healthcare services business there. It's obviously anchored in our distribution assets, but it includes specialty distribution capabilities, it includes retail pharmacies, it includes one of the best online brands in Well.ca, it includes infusion clinics, and it includes a growing biopharma manufacturer services business. So we're very, very broad in our capabilities and really one of the leading players in the Canadian health care landscape in general. We've been very pleased with the performance of the business. Britt talked about some of the investments we continue to make into that business to keep our growth trajectory going. And I'd say we're very pleased with the performance and very committed to the current strategy. Britt Vitalone : The only thing I would add is similar to our U.S. business, in Canada we have very strong strategic sourcing capabilities as well, which our customers benefit from. And it's helping our customers win and helping us drive increased distribution volume. So very similar to the U.S., we utilize our strong, scaled strategic sourcing capabilities to help our customers win. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : And next will be Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Allen Lutz : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Britt, you mentioned core operating expense growth was about 6% excluding divestitures. As we think about the current growth across your different businesses, is that 6% growth rate the right way to think about operating expense growth from here? And then is there any reason why that would tick higher or lower versus that 6%? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question, Allen. I think when you look at our operating expenses, what we strive to do and what we've been able to do over a long period of time is gain leverage on our gross profit. And so what we strive to do and what we've demonstrated is that our operating expense typically will grow at a slower pace than gross profit. Now we've been investing back in the business. And so as we've been investing not only in distribution capabilities, data and analytics, and now in accelerated investment in artificial intelligence, quarterly variability in that operating expense number, you can expect to see that. But generally speaking, you will see us generate operating leverage on a gross margin. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Maybe, Britt, just curious what you're seeing on the generic pricing front and what opportunities we should be thinking about as we think about combination of drug shortages and just broader inflation trends in generic. Britt Vitalone : Yes, thanks for the question, Brian. In generics, we continue to have a very scaled sourcing operation in ClarusONE. ClarusONE continues to partner very closely with our broad set of customers, is generating good sourcing benefits. I talked about the dual mandate that we focus on, which is driving low cost positions for our customers. At the same time, is driving the highest availability of supply. We've been able to do that over a long period of time. Our generics business continues to grow. And we're quite pleased with the sourcing spread that we're able to generate from our sourcing buy-side capabilities. And we think that our customers are benefiting as well. And we see that in high compliance rates. So it's been a competitive but stable marketplace in the generic space, but the capabilities that we have on sourcing, the ability for us to drive lower cost and high availability of product and generate spread for our customers in a disciplined way that has proven to be a good formula for us over a long period of time. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate the color on the Rite-Aid impact. I'm guessing my question is, I know we don't know exactly what's going to happen with the rest of Rite-Aid. We should hopefully know soon, but what are the assumptions built in for fiscal 2025 around the potential impact from whatever happens with Rite-Aid from here? Like, is it built in, your comments, and how meaningful can it be? Brian Tyler : I appreciate the question. I obviously can't and not in a position to comment a lot on Rite-Aid. What I can tell you is what we've talked about for fiscal 2024. And Rite-Aid is not going to have a material impact on our financial results. So I would leave it at that. And in terms of 2025, we will learn more over the next few months. We'll give you more information as we give you further information on all of our fiscal 2025 assumptions. But Rite-Aid is not material to our financial results in fiscal 2024. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : And next will be Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead. Eric Coldwell : Thank you. Good afternoon. This one I think is fairly obvious and fairly simple, but I just want to make sure. The free cash flow reduction versus prior guide, is that specifically and only due to the Rite-Aid impact? And if so, I guess the question is why you didn't take that last quarter perhaps when -- I guess maybe that's not a fair question given the timing, but I just want to make sure that's the only topic there. And then on the repo activity as well, slightly lower outlook here, three to three and a half billion versus prior 3.5. Is that also the Rite-Aid impact or perhaps due to valuation in the market or some other topic? Those are my only two. Thank you very much. Brian Tyler : Yes, I appreciate the question, Eric. And you'll note that in our free cash flow guide for the rest of the year, the reduction versus the prior guidance that we gave you is not the full impact of the Rite-Aid provision for bad debt. So it is a key driver to that. So to answer your question very simply, yes, Rite-Aid and the bankruptcy is a driver on free cash flow reduction. In terms of share repo, I'd say that there's two things that are driving that. Clearly, we are taking a look at our free cash flow guide, but going back to our principles of how we deploy capital, one of the things that we've talked about is, A, we will buy back shares when there's excess cash on hand that we can't deploy in a growth format. And secondly, we're going to be looking at the intrinsic value of the stock. We want to be in the market and we want to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases, but those two factors are going to be important to us. And so we're going to continue to be disciplined. And so a portion of that is reflected in the lower share buyback. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : And next will be Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Stephanie Davis : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I know you've given a lot of great color on this, but I was hoping we could dig a little bit more into the strong U.S. pharmaceutical growth and how to think about, in the lighter flow through the margin, is there anything beyond GLP-1s kind of doing that? And you made a comment on commercial COVID net of 30 million non-recurring, accounting for some of the growth that we saw. Could you clarify kind of any impact that would have on the margin floater? Brian Tyler : Yes, so let me comment on a couple of things. We're really pleased with our U.S. pharmaceutical results. They delivered another strong quarter. Included in that, obviously we are lapping the effects of the government program of COVID last year. This year we do have commercial COVID vaccines that peaked in October and then really fell off. And we did have a one-time non-recurring charge in the quarter. And when you net the commercial COVID vaccine contribution in that charge, it roughly offsets the government program contribution from last year. So the performance within the segment is just strong, continued utilization that we're seeing in the marketplace, continued strong growth of specialty across all of our customer channels, and the continued growth in our oncology business, as well as, as I mentioned, I provided a number on the revenue impact from GLP-1s, which again, come at a lower margin rate and have been a headwind to year-over-year. So to just sort of sum up, it's just continued strong utilization in the marketplace in general, continued good growth of our customers and channels, and continued growth within our oncology business. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : And next will be Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. So as I think about 2025, why is 5% to 7% still the right growth target for U.S. pharma, just given the specialty contributions and growth there and favorable generics environment? And just, do you think kind of the long-term growth has inflected higher at this point for longer? Or what are some of those offsets that we should be thinking about in 2025? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Appreciate the question. Let me just start by stating that at the beginning of the year when we gave guidance, the long-term growth rate for the segment was 4% to 6%. Given the performance that we've seen this year, we increased that target, that long-term target rate to 5% to 7%. What I'm trying to provide you now is an early view into some of the qualitative factors that we're looking at and some of the momentum that we see going forward in indicating that that long-term range that we increased this year, we still see that as being the right number today. Now we'll continue to do some analysis and work and we come forward with our full year assumptions. We'll give you more insight into that. But just as a reminder, we have already increased the long-term target range this year from 4% to 6% to 5% to 7%. And we're certainly pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in the segment. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Grosslight : Thanks for taking the question. One of your competitors mentioned that there may be an ability to renegotiate GLP-1 contracts as they come due to potentially extract a bit more margin for the drug supply chain. I was wondering if you could comment on your views of contract negotiations as those contracts renew and if there may be an ability to boost the margin profile of GLP-1s going forward. Brian Tyler : Well, I would say this. I think we've talked many times in these calls that the first most important thing for us to do is make sure we get fair value for the services that we provide. And then obviously we want to provide as many services as we can in support of those products. And that philosophy is no different for the GLP-1 class than it is, frankly, for all of the products that we distribute. So, we are always in close contact and communication with our biopharma partners to talk about the value that we deliver, to talk about maybe the ancillary services that we could offer in support of those programs and to find ways that we can both support the growth of our respective businesses. And that's exactly the lens we'll bring to this product class and it's really no different than the way we run the business day to day. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys, thanks so much for the question. You guys talked about continuing to invest in some of the longer term drivers of the pharma growth in terms of oncology, biopharma services, etcetera. I was hoping you could unpack that a little bit more and sort of talk a bit more about where you sort of see the most attractive opportunities versus the assets that you already have. Thanks. Brian Tyler : Sure, I'll start and then Britt can tack on. First thing I would say is, I'm really pleased over the last several years, we have been very disciplined in making sure that we made organic investment or reinvestment back into the business. And, we view that as part of good portfolio management. I mean, our goal is to continue to extend the growth that we see in our markets and to innovate, innovating new solutions as part of that. So, now when we allocate that investment capital, certainly some goes into the core where we think we can get efficiency, better services, extend our base value proposition, but a lot will go into what we call our growth pillars and that would be oncology. So in one instance, we've talked a lot, it's about, green fielding our Ontada business or our data and analytics business. Obviously we've gone inorganic with SCRI and extended into clinical trials and research. We talked a quarter or two ago about some innovations that we've made in our RxTS segment when enhancing some of our solutions and frankly building and innovating and bringing new solutions. So, much like our inorganic investment, we are tied to our strategy and committed to business cases that we think will deliver more return. I think the one area that we probably highlighted more this quarter than we have in the past is investments in technology, AI, machine learning. Obviously, the developments and advancements in that field have come on fast and when you think about a business that operates at our kind of scale, we're very excited about the opportunities we see there. And when you think about like a U.S. oncology, Britt highlighted several places where we think we can use this kind of technology to make a better patient experience, make our provider experience better, and to continue to drive efficiencies through that business. So, we will continue to be committed to investing back in the business where we see good financial returns tied to our strategy. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : And next will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Britt, first one is just kind of a point of clarification. When you say GLP-1s as an EBIT headwind, you mean to margins, not to dollars. And then for Brian, I have a follow-up question on oncology. I guess could you just kind of talk about the Greenfield opportunity that remains in the USO business and do you think more about the opportunity to add providers, kind of add regions or add services into the installed base as kind of the way to continue to grow that business? Thank you. Brian Tyler : I'll start with your second question and then Britt can come on. So, I talk about three ways to drive the U.S. oncology business. One is to acquire a practice in a geography where not, obviously, to add providers to an existing geography. And in instances where our criteria are met, meaning we think we can attract the right level scale, we can find oncologists that want to practice consistent with the way we practice oncology in our network, we are not afraid to Greenfield. Obviously, adding to an existing is faster, acquiring an established practice that we feel fits our criteria is probably second, and Greenfield would be third, but we have all those avenues open to us. And so, we look at the criteria, the population, the growth, the payer mix, these all kind of go into our formula as we identify which of those three avenues is the most viable. Britt Vitalone : And the answer to your first question is we've talked about GLP-1s previously, and today we are talking about margin rate. They usually come at a lower margin rate than other products that we distribute. And as I mentioned, they have been an operating profit headwind year-over-year. Rachel Rodriguez : And we have time for one more question, please? Operator : Certainly. That question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Carol [ph] on for Steve. Just a follow-up on the prescription technology segment of GLP-1s. Now that we're starting to come up against some harder coms, just how should we think about growth for this business tied to new versus renewed prescriptions? And what are some of the other categories we should be focused on as growth drivers outside of GLP-1s? Thank you. Brian Tyler : Well, I think as, we think about GLP-1s, obviously, four quarters ago was a big growth quarter. We're going to start to lap that. I think my characterization is there will continue to be growth. That growth may or may not be linear depending on product launches, uptakes, how commercial, government, other payers adopt policies to manage these products. So I think it's going to be growth. It's going to be slowed compared to what it has been historically. And it's probably going to be a little bit lumpier than, we would typically expect just because of the size of the class. Britt Vitalone : And I would just remind you that while the growth has been robust and we do expect the rate of growth to moderate as we go to future quarters beginning in the fourth quarter. We did increase the guide for the operating profit for the segment. So the momentum in that segment is really good. Prior authorizations in general, GLP-1s specifically, but also seeing good growth across other access and affordability solutions within the segment. Brian Tyler : Well, thank you again, everyone, for joining our call. We appreciate, as always, the great questions. I want to thank you, Cynthia, for facilitating the call. And maybe just a concluding comment. McKesson continues to make really meaningful progress in advancing our strategy and our mission. I couldn't be more pleased with the consistent and solid performance we're delivering. And we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable long-term growth. I want to make sure I acknowledge the contribution of the McKesson employees across really all our teams, all of our business. It is one team executing this enterprise strategy and I'm proud of what we've been able to achieve as a team. And I look forward to sharing more updates and more of our progress with you next quarter. Thanks again, everybody. I hope everyone has a terrific evening. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Brian Tyler : And more of our progress with you next quarter. Thanks again, everyone. Operator : Thank you for joining.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's fourth quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer, and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. Presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you Rachel and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining our call this afternoon. Today we reported our fiscal fourth quarter results, marking the close to a strong fiscal 2024. I want to thank the 51,000 McKesson employees for their terrific efforts over the course of this year, as together we drove the business and achieved significant progress in advancing our mission and our strategies. In fiscal 2024, consolidated revenue grew 12% to $309 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased by 6% to $27.44, both exceeding the expectations we set out at the beginning of the fiscal year. We're pleased with the growth across the enterprise, supported by our differentiated portfolio of assets, our innovative solutions, and our deep commitment to quality and operational excellence. We're particularly excited about the opportunities within our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services. During the year, we saw record expansion in the US Oncology Network and strong market demand for our access, affordability and adherence solutions. I'm going to start my remarks today with a review of our company priorities and then I'm going to hand it over to Britt, who will take us through more details on the financial performance and our outlook for fiscal 2025. What you will take away from both of us today is our confidence in the strength of the underlying businesses, our commitment to continue carrying out the strategy and the momentum into the next year. The first company priority I want to touch on is our focus on people and culture. Over the past few years, we've made continued progress in transforming McKesson into a diversified healthcare services company that requires us to embrace new ideas and lead at the forefront of innovation. We're honored to be recognized as one of America's most innovative companies by Fortune. We'll continue to strengthen our innovative culture, which is essential to our growth strategy overall. Recently, we were also named as one of America's greatest workplaces for women by Newsweek and a top women employer by DiversityComm Media. I am pleased to see our company wide efforts continue to be recognized externally. I'm also really quite impressed by the commitment and leadership exhibited by so many McKesson employees and the initiatives they take on to support each other and to create an open and collaborative culture. Moving on to our two strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services. These are both pivotal assets that unlock tremendous value and bring significant benefits to our customers and stakeholders. Over the years, we've been building out our portfolio of assets around oncology, spanning from the distribution of related therapies to practice management to oncology data insights and other value added services. We're very pleased with the meaningful expansion in our oncology assets as reflected in the growth of the US Oncology Network. We welcomed four practices to the network in the fiscal year, including Regional Cancer Care Associates, Cancer Center of Kansas, Nashville Oncology Associates and SCRI Oncology Partners. The addition of these new practices expands our geographic footprint and allows us to provide our services to a broader set of providers and importantly, to the patients they serve. As of April, the network has grown to approximately 2600 providers at 600 sites of care across 31 States. We grew the provider network through a combination of newly affiliated practices and the recruitment of new providers to existing practices. We saw organic growth in providers at more than 75% of the practices. With this extensive reach within the community oncology setting, the US Oncology Network now treats over 1.4 million patients each year. In addition to practice management, we also provide clinical trial services to these community based practices. In 2022, we expanded our clinical trial capabilities through the formation of a joint venture that now operates under the name of Sarah Cannon Research Institute or sometimes referred to as SCRI. In the past year, practices in the US Oncology Network participated in over 200 clinical trials through SCRI, enrolling more than 3100 patients in treatment studies across various disease states. And in February, SCRI announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca to enhance the delivery of oncology clinical trials. Working together, the two parties will implement modern solutions to accelerate clinical trial delivery timelines, reduce site burden, and enhance trial enrollment within our scaled provider network. In addition to oncology, our other differentiated growth priority is our biopharma services platform. Our portfolio of connected solutions provides unique value propositions to biopharma companies and helps them improve medication access, affordability, and adherence. In fiscal 2024, we saw strong growth in the prescription technology segment, delivering 23% growth in adjusted operating profit. More importantly, in the past year, our differentiated solutions helped patients save more than $8.8 billion on brand and specialty medications. We help to prevent approximately 10.7 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges, and we helped patients access their medicine more than 94 million times. The biopharma services platform was built through years of strategic investments. It includes targeted acquisitions that accelerated our growth strategy and internal investments that drove innovation and enhanced capabilities. One of the first assets we've acquired was RelayHealth, and it's foundational to the network and services we offer today. For those who aren't familiar with this business, it helps adjudicate prescription claims and enable the efficient delivery of prescription drugs. It's now connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and processes billions of transactions annually. The connectivity to the pharmacies provides us insights into the patient's journey and helps us develop additional solutions, programs like copay assist programs and digital coupons. We want to provide our customers not just a claims switch solution, but a robust platform that connects key stakeholders, delivers access and affordability solutions, and ultimately improves the patient's experience and outcomes. Let's move on now to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth. We have scaled and durable assets in both pharmaceutical and medical surgical distribution and we continue to deliver sustainable growth in these core businesses. In fiscal 2024, U.S. Pharmaceutical delivered solid results with 16% increases in revenue and a 7% increase in adjusted operating profit, which I'll remind you is at the high end of our long-term target for this segment. To support the business growth and the evolving needs of our customers, we continue to invest in our infrastructure, ensuring that the distribution assets are technologically equipped to maximize capacity and efficiency. And while we're still in the early stages of investing in capabilities of artificial intelligence, we've already developed tools and algorithms that apply AI in the supply chain. This is enabling us to move products more quickly and nimbly throughout our distribution centers, generating cost savings and continuing to improve our service levels. We'll continue to make these targeted and strategic investments that support the sustainable growth of our business. Our core distribution business is also complemented by a growing portfolio of services and solutions around specialty and oncology, which adds to our differentiated market position and supports our unique value proposition to our customers. And today, we're excited to talk about our strategic relationship with Optum. We started servicing a portion of Optum's business last year and we're pleased to get the opportunity to expand the scope of our services starting July of 2024. We believe this relationship is a strong testament to our differentiated capabilities and services across pharmaceutical distribution, sourcing and oncology. We look forward to the opportunity to serve and grow with all of our customers, including now Optum. As we assess investment opportunities and we allocate resources across the enterprise, we strive to ensure that our decisions align with our strategic priorities and with our mission of improving healthcare in every setting, we want to become not only a diversified healthcare services company, but also a company that enables positive changes in our communities and drives impact. In April, we launched a new initiative aimed at advancing health equity for at risk populations in underserved communities. We have a long history of working with pharmacies and providers in the community setting. Now we want to leverage our business resources and expertise to support their growth and enable better access to healthcare in many of these communities. With this project, we look to identify and address pharmacy deserts where residents face significant challenges in accessing essential pharmacy services. We chose Avondale, Ohio as our pilot activation site. We helped facilitate an expedited path to an independent pharmacy ownership in the local community, and we opened the pharmacy this past December. I had the opportunity to be there personally and experienced the joy of those who live in that community, appreciating something that most of us take for granted; a pharmacy near our house. We look forward to making a lasting difference in more communities like Avondale in the future. We also support and fund many charitable works through the McKesson Foundation. This past year marked an important milestone for the Foundation as it celebrated its 80th anniversary. During the last year alone, it funded nearly 50 organizations through its grant making program and disbursed approximately $9 million, one third of which supported direct patient care and assistance. We're also pleased to see continued increase in employee participation in these impactful initiatives. In fiscal 2024, McKesson employees put in over 44,000 volunteer hours with charities across the U.S. and Canada. I'm truly proud of what we have achieved as a team to support the communities and to live our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. So let me pull that all together. McKesson delivered performance above our initial expectations in fiscal 2024, underpinned by continued momentum across the businesses. We finished the year with a growing portfolio of oncology and biopharma services solutions and an expanded core distribution business and a stronger culture that unites us all. As we look ahead to our fiscal 2025, we're excited about the opportunities to grow our differentiated assets and capabilities. We remain deeply committed to our strategies and priorities and we're confident in our ability to drive sustainable business growth and generate attractive shareholder return. Team McKesson is more focused and more agile as we enter this new fiscal year with strength and confidence. With that, Britt, I'll hand it over to you. Britt Vitalone : Great. Thank you Brian and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal 2024 marks another year of strong execution and financial performance. We enter fiscal 2025 with a momentum to deliver growth and create value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 results. Then I'll provide an overview of our fiscal 2025 outlook. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results unless I state otherwise. We're exiting fiscal 2024 with solid performance, delivering earnings per diluted share of $6.18 in the fourth quarter and $27.44 for the full year. Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and with the earnings per diluted share guidance range that we provided on our third quarter earnings call, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. For the full year, when excluding fiscal 2023, contributions from COVID-related programs and McKesson Ventures, adjusted operating profit grew 9% and adjusted EPS increased 17%. These results were above our long range targets and reflect the strength of our products, services and operating execution. Let me start with a review of the fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues increased 11% to $76.4 billion, led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP one medications. Gross profit was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7%, primarily a result of specialty distribution growth within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including our leading plasma and biologics business. Operating expenses increased 11% to $2.1 billion, driven by higher costs to support growth across the businesses. During the quarter, we recorded a reserve for environmental matters of $0.09 per share for increased remediation cost related to McKesson's former chemical business, which we disposed of several years ago. The environmental reserve was recorded in our corporate segment. Operating profit was $1.3 billion, which was flat to the prior year, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment offset by increased corporate expenses which included the previously outlined environmental reserve. Year-over-year results were also impacted by anticipated lower contributions from U.S. Government COVID-19 programs in both the U.S. Pharmaceutical and medical-surgical solutions segments when compared to the prior year. When adjusting for the COVID-19 programs and a modest McKesson Ventures loss in fiscal 2023, adjusted operating profit increased 4% in the quarter. Moving below the line, interest expense was $75 million, an increase of 7% driven by higher short-term borrowings of commercial paper compared to the prior year. The higher short-term borrowings resulted from lower average cash balances, in part due to the impact from the Change Healthcare outage. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%, which is in line with our previous guidance and driven by a discrete tax item. Fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 131.6 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, earnings per diluted share was $6.18, again in line with the implied earnings per diluted share that we provided on our third quarter earnings call. While this represents a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year, fourth quarter results were principally driven by a higher tax rate and lower COVID-19 program contributions in fiscal 2024, partially offset by a lower share count and growth in U.S. Pharmaceuticals segment. Turning now to our fourth quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 11 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $68.8 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications. As we've previously guided, GLP-1 medications continue to show growth year-over-year, but despite this increase, the rate of growth continues to moderate. In the quarter, GLP-1 revenues were $7.5 billion, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion, or 24% compared to fiscal 2023. However, GLP-1 revenues were flat on a sequential basis. For the quarter, operating profit increased 5% to $901 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and increased contributions from our generics program. CoverMyMeds: Results in the fourth quarter reflect organic growth across our access solutions, including prior authorization services, as we extended existing partnerships with biopharma manufacturers. In addition to the strength of our access solutions, year-over-year performance was also supported by higher volumes across our affordability solutions. Operating profit decreased 3% to $212 million, driven by higher costs and investments to sustain the momentum and growth across the biopharma services platform. This included incremental infrastructure investments and cost to deliver increasing levels of ROI for our customers. Operating profit was also impacted by lower third party logistics performance in the quarter as compared to the prior year. Turning to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% and operating profit was $248 million, which was flat versus the prior year. Fourth quarter results reflect growth in the primary care and extended care businesses, including higher volumes of illness season testing, partially offset by lower contributions from the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. Government's COVID-19 program compared to the prior year. As a reminder, each illness season is unique depending on the onset and severity of various respiratory illnesses during that particular year. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues were $3.5 billion, an increase of 6% and operating profit was $94 million, an increase of 18%. These strong results were driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business compared to the prior year. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $193 million in the quarter, an increase of 30%, driven by the previously discussed environmental reserve and higher technology, infrastructure and compliance spend. Let me now turn to cash and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow, including $687 million of capital expenditures, which included new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. During the quarter, several of our customers were impacted by the Change Healthcare outage, delaying billing functions and claims payments. This outage created a timing impact on McKesson's cash flows. However, the impact was less severe than we had previously indicated. We continue to focus on capital deployment to drive value for our stakeholders. In fiscal 2024, we returned $3.3 billion of cash to shareholders. We returned $3 billion through share repurchases at an average price per share of approximately $436, including $678 million of share repurchases in the fiscal fourth quarter. Additionally, we paid dividends of $314 million for the full year. When combining share repurchases with dividends paid, we returned approximately 92% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2024. Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, we have returned $16.2 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, approximately $14.5 billion has been returned through share repurchases, reducing our total average shares outstanding by nearly 36%. The strength of our balance sheet and strong credit metrics, supported by our strong operating performance and disciplined and balanced financial policy, was recognized in the quarter by the recent Moody's credit rating upgrade to A3 from BAA1 and we are now A rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies. Our strong balance sheet and consistently robust cash flow generation, along with disciplined capital allocation, continues to provide us with the financial flexibility to invest in our growth initiatives, pursue strategic opportunities and return capital to shareholders, all while maintaining a durable capital structure. Now, let me discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook. The breadth of our capabilities and leading portfolio of assets across oncology and biopharma services have led to value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders over the last five years. Our fiscal 2025 outlook is a continuation of this momentum. Let me start with our segments. We anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues to increase 16% to 19% and operating profit to increase 8% to 10%, propelled by sustainable momentum in the core distribution business and growth across our oncology platform. We continue to make investments in the core distribution network to deliver more efficiency and value for our stakeholders. The strength of our value proposition was highlighted by the recent agreement to build on our existing pharmaceutical distribution partnership with Optum. This five-year contract begins on July 1 of 2024. The fiscal 2025 segment outlook incorporates stable growing prescription utilization trends bolstered by further growth in our generic sourcing programs and specialty distribution, including our leading plasma and biologics business. Ontada: In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment we anticipate revenues to increase 18% to 22% and operating profit to increase 12% to 16%. This outlook reflects organic growth across our solutions and services as we expand and extend partnerships with biopharma manufacturers and increase the number of brands utilizing our access, affordability and adherence programs. Throughout fiscal 2024, we continued to see increased demand for our access and affordability solutions, particularly those related to GLP-1 medications. As a reminder, McKesson's prior authorization products serve the majority of the brands for GLP-1 medications. Our products continue to generate value for our partners. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we anticipate that this demand will remain elevated yet lessened as the rate of increase will be slower than prior years for GLP-1 medications. The Medical-Surgical business remains well positioned to leverage the breadth and depth of its services and assets across all alternate sites of care, including growth in the primary care business and our comprehensive private label portfolio. We anticipate Medical-Surgical Solutions revenues to increase 4% to 8% and operating profit to increase 6% to 8%. Within the primary care market, we anticipate continued growth in lab solutions and specialty pharmaceuticals. Our scaled sourcing and distribution footprint has propelled expansion and growth of our private label portfolio, providing superior value for our customers while maintaining sound economics for McKesson. In fiscal 2025, we're making investments in the segment to support the recent acquisition of Compile, a healthcare data platform that captures and aggregates data to provide insights and analytics for biopharma. We believe there's an initial use case across the breadth of the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. The Medical-Surgical Solutions segment has broad relationships with providers and extensive data sets, leading to opportunities to develop incremental value creation opportunities. Longer term, there are increased opportunities to integrate the capabilities and commercial applications across our oncology and biopharma services platforms. These investments will deliver meaningful returns to the segment and to the enterprise. In fiscal 2025 we anticipate that these investments will account for an approximate 2% operating profit headwind in the medical segment as compared to the prior years. Finally, the International segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 4% to 8% and operating profit increased 6% to 10% year-over-year. Our diversified set of assets within our Canadian business, including the scale distribution business, continues to support growth in the International segment. We continue to make investments in our Canadian technology footprint to create a more custom and integrated supply chain for specialty drugs. As a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country in Europe that we have not entered into an agreement to sell, and contributions related to operations in Norway are included in the fiscal 2025 outlook for the segment. We intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $580 million to $640 million, which includes increased technology spend to support the growth of our businesses and infrastructure and compliance investments. We will also continue to invest in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in artificial intelligence. We are leveraging AI to increase the efficiency across our operations and increase automation and productivity for our customers. Our investments in AI and other advanced technologies play an important role in improving customer service and provider productivity. We continue to build these tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates. One example where we're implementing AI is in our oncology platform. The InnoMed [ph] EHR contains structured data that can often be sparsely entered for patient's longitudinal records. Instead, unstructured data such as uploaded documents and provider authored notes are used to capture details on patient's disease condition in response to treatment, as well as many core clinical factors. They have complete longitudinal patient records for real world research. Core variables are required to be extracted from the unstructured data into a well-organized database. Natural language process is the only scalable solution to achieve more than 100 million documents in InnoMed [ph] today and growing at the rate of 1 million documents per week. The application of AI reduces clinicians exhausted burden in finding related documents for care and reimbursement workflows, ultimately leading to practice efficiencies and better patient care. This is just one example of many where we're using AI to power insights and deliver clinical and financial value to our stakeholders. We've been pleased with our progress to date as we work to develop and implement various AI technologies, and we remain committed to increased investment to further extend our leadership positions and deliver value to our partners and stakeholders. Now, moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $220 million to $240 million, and income attributable to non-controlling interest to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million. We anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 18% to 20%. And as a reminder, the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict and therefore we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning now to cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Our working capital metrics and result in free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter and are impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $2.8 billion of shares in fiscal 2025. As a result of this share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $128 million to $130 million. The strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flows provides the financial flexibility to incrementally invest both organically and inorganically for growth as well as return capital to our shareholders. Wrapping up fiscal 2025 guidance, we anticipate revenue growth of 15% to 17% and operating profit growth of 9% to 14% as compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2025, we anticipate earnings per diluted share of $31.25 to $32.05, which represents growth of 14% to 17% as compared to fiscal 2024. We expect earnings per share will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate the first quarter to have the lowest contribution. As a reminder, we had a lower effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to a discrete tax item. In summary, we see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals across our businesses. Our sustained financial performance over the past several years has been bolstered by the strength of our financial position and the consistent operating execution leading to compelling value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders. We're pleased with the strong fiscal 2024 performance and the fiscal 2025 outlook reflects our continued confidence in the operating profit growth momentum across all segments of the business, supplemented by the strength of our balance sheet and strong financial position. McKesson is well positioned to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term sustainable growth for all stakeholders. With that, we can move to Q&A. Ontada: In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment we anticipate revenues to increase 18% to 22% and operating profit to increase 12% to 16%.

We're pleased with the strong fiscal 2024 performance and the fiscal 2025 outlook reflects our continued confidence in the operating profit growth momentum across all segments of the business, supplemented by the strength of our balance sheet and strong financial position. McKesson is well positioned to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term sustainable growth for all stakeholders. With that, we can move to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate all the color on the guidance. I just want to delve into a little bit of the pharma growth increase. How much of that is related to Optum and were there any onboarding costs associated with bringing contract like that on board? Meaning did it dilute the impact this year? And then as a quick follow-up, I noticed you didn't mention Optum as being part of the Med-Surg guidance. There is some belief that that was also a potential contract win for you or an incremental contract win for you there. Is that not true or is there just no impact this year? Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question, Kevin. I'll start and maybe I'll go in reverse order. Our win of the Optum contract, and we're certainly pleased to extend and expand our partnership, as Brian mentioned, is pharmaceutical related only. As we think about next year, Optum is included in our guide. As you know, we do not specifically talk about customer contract details, and so we have not provided specific contributions for Optum, and we don't intend to do that going forward. This is a recent contract win. We have not incurred any costs yet related to that transition. We do expect that there will be some costs in the transition, but not material and certainly included in our guidance. Operator : And next will be Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Allen Lutz : RxTS: Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start and certainly Brian could add to this. I think when we, we've talked about this segment in the past, there are many different things that go through this segment, one of those being our 3PL business. Our 3PL businesses we talked about in the past is slightly more than half of the revenue. And as I mentioned in my comments, the 3PL performance was lower than the prior year for various customer and contract considerations. We're certainly pleased with what we're seeing in our prior authorization business. We continue to see growth in that business. We continue to see growth in our fiscal fourth quarter as well. We did make a number of investments, as I talked about, and we also made some investments for future years to continue our growth and continue the value that we're providing to our customers. So underlying all of that, we had a very strong year. The business grew on the bottom line 23% year-over-year. So there's great momentum there prior authorization business as part of our access solutions did have growth in the first quarter, but as I mentioned, we had slower 3PL performance and we continue to make some investments into the business for future growth. Brian Tyler : As it relates to payer and frankly employer behavior as it relates to the coverage of these drugs. I think you've got to probably bifurcate it into diabetes, which is a more mature indication. Weight loss, which is kind of emerging, keep tracking follow on conditions that it may or may not be applicable to, so I think it's in the early days of employers and payers figuring out how to handle this, and across that spectrum, it can be quite different. Rachel Rodriguez : Question please? Operator : And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. I just want to go back to the pharmaceutical operating profit for 2025. If I go back and I look at your long-term out like you talked about 5% to 7% growth, you're now talking about 8% to 10%. One, I know you don't want to talk about specific customers, but is this tied to the new customer win or is there something else that's propelling that? And then, as I think about Optum, your comments were that you started a relationship last year. You've increased the scope of services you're now doing, sourcing, distribution, oncology. Can you maybe just help us understand, one in winning that business and secondly, how we look at Optum versus maybe some of your other clients and any incremental opportunities you see with Optum going forward? Brian Tyler : Thank you, Lisa. I appreciate the question. Look, we're obviously really excited to get the privilege and the opportunity to expand our relationship with Optum. And I think it's a testament to the differentiated services and solutions, the breadth of our diversified healthcare service offerings. Optum itself is a big, complicated entity with lots of services and lots of solutions. So we're really happy to have the opportunity. I do think it's a reflection on the investments that we've made over the past several years and the efficiency of our core operations, our commitment to continuing to make those investments, not just in efficiency, but in innovations and thinking about how we use our tools to solve different problems. This is very much today a distribution agreement. We'll be servicing home delivery, Optum Infusion, Optum Care, The Specialty Pharmacy. So it's very broad with that regard. But I do think it's a reflection of past investments that we've made, not just in distribution, but in the portfolio of capabilities that we offer. Britt Vitalone : Lisa, maybe I'll answer your question. You know, maybe I would just start with just a little bit of a foundation building here. If you think about the U.S. pharma segment, over the last four years, the adjusted operating profit has grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 6%, so really right in the middle of the long-term targets that we provided. There are long-term targets for a reason. It's what we expect as a sustainable growth rate for the segment. We're certainly pleased with the growth that we saw in FY 2024. If you exclude the impact of COVID-related programs in FY 2023, segment grew 12%. So we certainly have a lot of momentum in that business as we enter into FY 2025. As Brian mentioned, we're certainly pleased with the opportunity to serve Optum as well. So this is a business that we've been making a lot of investments in. It's a business that we have some expertise that we're continuing to add to in terms of our sourcing capabilities, providing value back to our customers and we have a lot of momentum in this segment. And so I think the growth rate that we've outlined here for 2025 is a continuation of the momentum that we've seen now over the last several years. Rachel Rodriguez : Question please? Operator : And next will be Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Ontada: As you think about the totality of the assets now, the ability to build off of that platform, how does that dovetail with your ability also to utilize your ever growing free cash flow to continue to drive inorganic growth on top of organic, and within that portfolio of, again broad based oncology assets, what are the best areas you have to continue to expand beyond where you already are. Brian Tyler : Yes. Thank you, Michael. I appreciate that. We talked about many times our cap, our capital allocation strategy, and our first priority in that strategy is to invest, to grow the business, either through internal development and investments in innovation or inorganic opportunities. Certainly, when we look at inorganic opportunities or M&A, we like that to be very, very tightly aligned to our articulated strategy, with the associated proper financial returns of course. And so oncology is one of those growth areas and one of those growth priorities. And being a pretty significant player in the oncology space in general, and leading player in the community oncology space, we're very familiar with a lot of what I would call emerging tools, technologies and companies out there and anywhere that we can find an asset that's aligned to our strategy in community oncology that we think is additive to either the footprint that we have in U.S. oncology or our leading EMR, or our ads capability to our data insight business or accelerates clinical trials would be very much a sweet spot for us. And Britt actually referenced in his comments some internal stuff we're doing around AI, and we have made some small acquisitions in the past that bring us capabilities in this area that are helping us improve our interface with patients, our efficiency in serving those patients, and improving the practice quality or the lifestyle basically, of our oncologists. That practice is part of U.S. oncology, and we think that part of the overall formula that's been really supporting and enabling, well, quite frankly, the record growth that we had last year. Rachel Rodriguez : Question please? Operator : And next will be Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back to RxTS, obviously looking at a really positive outlook, but thinking about the preliminary fiscal 2025 guide you kind of gave for this segment last quarter, the final guide actually is a little bit better here. Any sort of comments on what is driving sort of the increased optimism here? Is it solely just as we're thinking about maybe GLP-1s or maybe can you talk about sort of any kind of gains at RelayHealth as it relates to the Change Healthcare outage? Any comments there would be helpful. Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start. So the AOP growth guide that we provided you for FY 2025 is really right in the range of what we've seen for growth over the last four years, maybe just slightly below. We had 16% compound annual growth rate in this business on operating profit since FY 2020. And so the growth rate that we've provided you this year is really kind of right in line with that. And we intend to continue to make investments in this business as we go forward to develop additional solutions and capabilities for our customers. So we expect that our technology, solutions and services will continue to grow as they have over the last few years. The value that we're providing for our partners is continuing to resonate and we see stable prescription growth that's really underpinning a lot of the programs and solutions that we have. And the growth rate that we expect for next year is really in line with what we've been able to deliver over the last several and we'll continue to. As Brian talked about, we'll use our free cash flow to invest in our growth opportunities as we go forward. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please? Operator : And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. A question relative to competitive intensity and specifically contract movement we've seen, I think with Optum there was a real concern that the contract could even be outsourced or elements of specialty could be outsourced and yet here it comes to you. And we've also seen CVS outsource and scale to you. So my question would be, do you believe that you've developed a scale advantage in mail and specialty that is unique relative to other distributors, and/or how important is the specialty footprint in driving the value that has led to these significant gains? Brian Tyler : Thanks, Eric. Well, look, I'm not going to comment much on the competitive set, but I can say, you know, we have made pretty significant investments in the business and to modernize our distribution infrastructure. Think about cold chain and how you handle cold chain efficiently, have a highly compliant distribution network. We certainly have scale, and in this business, I've been in this business 28 years, and scale does tend to help. But I really come back to the fact that we've made the investments in core distribution excellence. We clearly understand this piece of the market quite well, and that we think of ourselves as a solution oriented, value-added kind of partner and try to paint a broad picture of not just what we could do if we had a relationship, but how we could grow that relationship through time using an array of the capabilities represented within McKesson. Britt Vitalone : Eric, I would just add to that if you think about the strategy that we've executed on over the last several years, we've been very disciplined and focused and really growing our capabilities in oncology and pharma services, including the investments that Brian spoke of in terms of our distribution network. So the breadth of capabilities that we have today is more significant than it was a few years ago. And, the value that we're able to provide now through the investments that we've made through some of the other acquisitions that we've made in, like oncology as an example, we believe that that value is what is attractive and the breadth of capabilities that we have as well. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please? Operator : And next will be Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Stephanie Davis : Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question and congrats on a really good guidance. I was hoping to get a little bit more color about the nature of the biopharma investments you're making in the prescription transaction business. Just kind of nature of it whether these are more of a recurring expense like headcount compared to more near-term pockets of spend like platform development and anything you can give us on that? Brian Tyler : Yes, so I'll start and if Britt wants to add anything, he can. I mean, we have a pretty differentiated set of assets in this business. Multiple scaled networks is what we call them, which includes connectivity into provider workflow. And we very much fundamentally think part of our job is to continue to innovate off of those, to both enhance the value and the return our products provide to biopharma and to continue to solve new problems for them. So we have historically always invested in this business, and when we see an opportunity ahead of us, we are not afraid to increase that investment to run at that, because we think these differentiated assets allow us to solve problems in unique ways. Most of this investment has been in technology, and that's probably about all I would say. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please? Operator : And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys, thanks so much for the question and congrats on a nice guide. I was intrigued by your comments about the Med-Surg segment and sort of how you're thinking about data and the use of assets with the new acquisition you just made. It seems like a little bit of a shift into more sort of additional value-added services in that segment. Could you give a little bit more color on that and sort of how you see that evolving over the next couple of years? Brian Tyler : Sure. I mean, in many ways we thought of Compile as a foundational data investment for us, and we liked the business by itself. But we also thought given some of the other data sets, transaction sets that reside in the company, we could augment and add and accelerate that. We chose a first use case in the medical business where we have, extensive, hundreds of thousands of relationships with providers and data that complement their already strong provider data service offering. So we think we can both augment that and unlock unique value because of the footprint and reach in Med-Surg and so we're making an investment into that thesis. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please? Operator : And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Grosslight : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to a question that Charles asked on RxTS, but really on the top line you're seeing a material acceleration in growth next year, while as you mentioned, the adjusted operating income is kind of in line with where you've been historically. So it does imply a bit of a degradation in margin. So I was hoping you could find a finer point on the growth acceleration on the top line and margin compression you're seeing, is that mix shift to lower margin businesses? Is that the increased investments you're making? Any color there would be great. Thanks. Brian Tyler : Thanks for that question. I can answer that. The growth that we're seeing next year on the top line is more accelerated growth in our 3PL business. As we've talked about before, the 3PL business generally represents a little more than half of the revenue in the segment, but less than 10% of the adjusted operating profit. So as we expect to win some additional business next year and see some of our customers continue to grow, that revenue will be faster rate than we've seen in prior years. And given the mix that that represents in this segment is, driving faster top line again at a lower margin rate on the bottom line from that particular business, 3PL business. So the underlying technology businesses are continuing to grow in a consistent manner and we're really pleased with the growth that we're seeing there. What you're seeing is a mix impact in FY 2025 from the 3PL business. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question please? Operator : And next will be Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. I wanted to get a little bit of color on what you're seeing and what's embedded in your guidance in terms of the pricing environment on the U.S. pharma business and what assumptions you're making in terms of generic pricing trends and environment that you're seeing as well as kind of on the branded side? I know that's less of a swing factor for you, but how is that playing out relative to your expectations here? Thanks. Brian Tyler : Sure. Happy to answer that question. As we think about the pricing environment for branded products, it is going to be, our anticipation is to be very consistent with what we've seen in the past several years, so stable and competitive branded price environment. In the generic space, again, we look to drive value for our customers through our sourcing operations, looking to drive the lowest cost at the highest availability supply. And we believe that the, in our outlook for FY 2025, we expect to see a competitive and stable environment in the generic space as well. So we don't see a lot of changes in the environment for both branded and generics pricing in our outlook versus FY 2024. And we anticipate that we can continue to drive good value in the generic space for our customers. Rachel Rodriguez : I think we have time for probably one more question. Operator : Certainly. That question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hey, thanks for the question. A question of guidance, I wanted to ask one on the quarter, just on the pharma revenue growth rate. I was wondering if you could help us think about any impact you might have seen from insulin list price changes in the quarter. It sounds like that was probably a headwind to your revenue growth rate. And any contribution from commercial COVID vaccines in the quarter that we should be mindful of? Thanks. Britt Vitalone : Yes, nothing really specific to call out there, Stephen. And as it relates to COVID vaccines, as I mentioned, we are lapping the COVID programs that we had last year and from the commercial vaccines perspective, lower contribution than we saw in the third quarter, really a non-material amount of contribution to our fourth quarter results. Brian Tyler : Hey well, thanks again everyone for joining our call this evening. We appreciate your ongoing interest and support of McKesson. I want to thank you, operator for facilitating the call. McKesson reported solid performance in fiscal 2024. I'm really pleased with the momentum across the segments and the continued commitment to our company's priorities. Looking ahead to 2025, I remain confident in our ability to consistently execute against our strategies which will support and sustain growth in the long term.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rachel Rodriguez : Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's first quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer, and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. Presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Tyler : Thank you, Rachel, and I'll extend my good afternoon to everyone as well. Thank you for joining our call today. Earlier today, we reported first quarter company revenues of $79.3 billion, reflecting 6% growth year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 8% to $7.88 above our original expectation. As a result of our performance in the first quarter, we're raising our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per diluted share from $31.25 to $32.05 to a new range of $31.75 to $32.55. The continued business growth and strong cash flow generation allow us to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders. We're also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend and additional share repurchase authorization up to $4 billion. This brings the total share repurchase authorization to approximately $10 billion as of July of 2024. Underpinning the financial performance is our continued execution on our company priorities. It was nearly five years ago when we centered our strategy around four company priorities and embarked on the journey of transforming into a diversified healthcare services company. We've been consistently executing against these strategies, driving enhanced value to our customers and delivering sustained financial growth across our operating segments. Course transformation and execution is a lot of hard work, takes the efforts of the full team and the path to sustainable growth is not always perfectly linear. During the first quarter, we saw solid operating performance led by our pharmaceutical distribution business in the US and Canada. Meanwhile, we experienced some headwinds in other parts of the business. In medical-surgical, growth in the primary care channels was really slower than we anticipated, resulting in a year-over-year decline for the first quarter. In Prescription Technology Solutions, adjusted operating profit was unchanged from the prior year, driven by growth in affordability solutions, offset by lower contributions due to the mix of the services within our access programs and higher expenses to support future growth. We remain committed to our long term growth targets. We have strong conviction in our strategy and confidence in the strength of our differentiated capabilities across the enterprise. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2025, our focus remains on our company priorities and advancing our role as a diversified healthcare services company. We are investing in the business, especially where we can leverage technology to enhance product offerings and improve operational efficiencies. We've made great strides in these areas and I'll plan to share a few examples before I hand it over to Britt. Let me start though, with our focus on people and culture, we firmly believe that people are the foundation for everything we do here at McKesson as we strive to become the best place to work in healthcare. Recently, we were named one of America's Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes, recognizing our dedicated efforts to fostering inclusion, caring and belonging in the workplace. We also take a very thoughtful and strategic approach to attracting and retaining talent across the company. And this, of course includes our Board of Directors. In June, our Board of Directors welcomed Doctor Deborah Dunsire as a new independent director, serving on the Compensation and Talent Committee as well as the Finance Committee. She brings decades of experience in biopharmaceuticals and in oncology specifically. She's a highly respected healthcare industry leader. As the former CEO of multiple biopharmaceutical companies, we're grateful for the unique experience that Doctor Dunsire brings to our board as she joins us on this exciting journey of growth and innovation. Moving on to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth in our distribution business, during the first quarter, we saw solid growth in us pharmaceuticals. Segment adjusted operating profit grew 6%, driven by growth in specialty pharmaceuticals and strong results in our oncology platform which includes us oncology network Ontada provider solutions and the Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture, which we often refer to as SCRI the results demonstrated the diversity and breadth of our oncology assets. Also in the Pharmaceutical segment, one of the achievements I really want to highlight is the successful on-boarding of a large distribution customer this past July. This is a significant endeavor that requires close coordination across much, many, many parts of the organization. I'm deeply grateful for the dedication and the commitment of the teams at McKesson. They worked hard to ensure an efficient and smooth transition for our customer and most importantly for their patients. This is an example of the terrific execution McKesson is known for. Moving on to the International segment, we saw growth in the quarter above expectations, primarily driven by the performance of our Canadian business, which includes pharmaceutical distribution, retail pharmacies and technology enabled capabilities. We're pleased to see organic growth in the business supported by the stable trends in pharmaceutical volumes throughout the quarter. The team also identified opportunities to apply technology and artificial intelligence in areas like inventory control and supply chain management. We're still at the early stages of application, but the opportunities ahead of us are exciting. Let's turn to the Medical-Surgical segment. Market environment over the last several years, which obviously included the COVID-19 era, has been pretty dynamic and introduced volatility. But generally it was very favorable for our medical business. As market conditions continue to normalize. We've seen some general market weakness in the primary care channel, which impacted our first quarter. We're taking actions to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts. These efforts will enhance our core distribution capabilities while continuing to invest in efficiencies to better serve our customers, partners and patients. Despite a weaker than expected start to the year, we remain confident in our assets and unique positions in the alternate site markets and our ability to drive long term growth. Moving on to our two strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services, we are steadily executing our strategy to grow our oncology platform and improve patients cancer care experiences. Building upon the foundational distribution services, we have built extensive capabilities spanning a patient's journey in cancer treatment. We're driving strong momentum across the oncology platform, demonstrating our differentiated value propositions and unique positions in this space. During the first quarter, we aligned all the oncology related assets and teams, including the US Oncology Network, Ontada provider solutions and scriptures, into one organization to further align our oncology platform. We view this as a a natural step as we accelerate our go to market strategies across our oncology capabilities. It will also allow us to better execute on our oncology strategy and deliver a connected and seamless customer experience across this diversified portfolio. One of the foundational assets in the oncology platform is the US Oncology Network. In the past year, the network saw significant growth, as reflected in the addition of new practices, the growth in physician numbers, and steady increases in patient visits as both patients and providers continue to recognize the value of the network. In the last fiscal year, we welcomed four practices to the US Oncology Network, expanding our geographic footprint and increasing access to lower cost oncology care, and we're pleased to see the momentum continuing. We announced earlier today we welcome the Tennessee Cancer specialist to the network, bringing the total number of providers in the network to now exceed 2600. In addition to practice management, we also support the community practices through the Sarah Cannon Research Institute Joint Venture, a fully integrated oncology research organization aimed at expanding clinical research and increasing access to clinical trials. SCRI's research network brings together more than 1300 physicians who are actively enrolling patients into clinical trials at more than 250 locations in 24 states across the United States. In the past year, practices in the US Oncology Network participated in over 200 clinical trials through scripture and earlier this year, SCRI announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca that will introduce modern solutions to accelerate clinical trial delivery timelines, reduce site burdens, and enhance patient enrollment. Let's move now to biopharma services, our second strategic growth pillar, which focuses on improving medication access, affordability and adherence through a scaled and connected network. During the quarter, adjusted operating profit in the Prescription Technology Solutions segment was unchanged year-over-year growth in our technology services products, particularly within the affordability solutions, was offset by lower contributions due to the mix of services within our access programs and higher expenses to support future growth. Leveraging our differentiated physician, pharmacy and patient networks and our transaction scale, we believe we are strategically well positioned to continue to deliver value to biopharma. In the first quarter, our affordability programs have saved patients nearly $2.2 billion in out of pocket costs. In addition, we continue to offer a variety of services and capabilities that help patients get the medicine they need to live healthier lives. Many of our products achieve this by integrating automation and technology into the existing processes. We support more than 650 biopharma brands and have a strong footprint in key therapeutic areas, including oncology, neurology, gastroenterology, endocrinology and cardiology. Our provider network is able to reach more than 50% of the specialists in each of these growing therapeutic areas. To improve the efficiency of our solutions and enhance customer experiences, we continue to explore more use cases for technology and AI. One of the more recent examples includes the implementation of a chatbot, which leverages AI to answer common user questions about the prior authorization status. We're also leveraging AI to improve internal forecasting of customer demand, allowing us to better plan for operations and staffing needs. We really think that pairing AI with humans further differentiates our capabilities and will best position our business for the future. Now, let's pull everything together. We're pleased with the continued progress in advancing our company priorities. Despite the somewhat mixed segment results in the quarter, we are confident that we have a clear and robust plan to deliver on our financial commitments. We have a strong business foundation, a well defined strategy, and a track record of execution. With dedication and excellence, our differentiated offerings will continue to drive better health outcomes for our customers and their patients. With that, I'll hand it over to Britt. Britt Vitalone : Thank you Brian and good afternoon, as Brian mentioned, McKesson had another solid quarter with earnings per share results that exceeded our expectations, resulting in an increase to our full year guidance. These results reflect the continued growth in our US Pharmaceutical segment, including our leading oncology and specialty capabilities and our Canadian pharmaceutical distribution operations within the International segment. I'm also pleased that our Board of Directors approved two actions in July 1 a 15% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.71 per share, marking the eighth consecutive year of dividend increases and second, an additional $4 billion of share repurchase authorization, bringing the total share repurchase authorization to approximately $10 billion as of July of 2024. These actions demonstrate the confidence that the Board and Management have in the execution of our strategic priorities as we continue to focus on capital deployment to drive value for our shareholders. My comments today refer to our adjusted results. Unless I state otherwise, I'll start with the consolidated results, followed by a review at the segment level, and conclude with an update on our outlook. Consolidated revenues were $79.3 billion, an increase of 6%, led by growth in the US pharmaceuticals segment resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail, national account customers and GLP-1 medications. Gross profit was $3.1 billion, an increase of 4%, primarily a result of specialty distribution growth within the US Pharmaceutical segment, including our provider solutions business, and higher distribution volumes in our Canadian business included in the International segment. These were partially offset by lower contributions from the primary care channel. In the Medical-Surgical solutions segment, operating expenses increased 7% to $1.9 billion, principally to support growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment. Year-over-year results were also impacted by increased technology investment across the enterprise and the lapping of prior year integration costs. Result related to the script joint venture and arc savings solutions operating profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of 12% driven by $110 million of pretax gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments included in corporate expenses compared to pre-tax losses of $7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Year- over year results benefited from continued growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower volumes across the primary care channel. In the Medical-Surgical solutions segment, interest expense was $70 million, an increase over the prior year resulting from higher average balances of our loan portfolio throughout the quarter and a prior year gain on debt extinguishment of $9 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 13%, driven by the recognition of net discrete tax benefits of $125 million in the quarter. As a reminder, we had a net discrete tax benefit of $147 million in the first quarter of the prior year. As we've discussed previously, we provide annual effective tax rate guidance as the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict. First quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 130.7 million, a decrease of 4%. Wrapping up our consolidated results, earnings per diluted share increased 8% to $7.88 ahead of our expectations, driven by pretax gains associated with McKesson Ventures Equity Investments, a lower share count and operating profit growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment. Turning to first quarter segment results, it can be found on slides seven through eleven and starting with US pharmaceutical. US Pharmaceutical segment delivered solid revenue and operating profit growth. Once again, first quarter results demonstrate the continued momentum across all customer segments and our ability to drive sustainable long term growth. Revenues were $71.7 billion, an increase of 7%. Revenue growth reflects positive utilization trends leading to increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products retail national account customers in GLP-1 medications. In the quarter, revenues for GLP-1 medications were $8.8 billion, an increase of approximately $1.8 billion, or 26% when compared to the prior year. On a sequential basis, revenues for GLP-1 medications increased $1.3 billion, or 17%. As supply constraints moderated in the quarter, we anticipate continued GLP-1 medication growth year over year, however, with variability from quarter to quarter. For the quarter, operating profit increased 6% to $815 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. Within the US Pharmaceutical segment, our comprehensive platform of leading oncology assets continues to grow and deliver value for customers and patients. Our ongoing investments in the oncology platform further differentiate our capabilities. More than 2,600 providers in the US Oncology Network continue to experience solid growth with same site visits increasing 6% in the quarter. US Oncology Network is further strengthened by a set of broad capabilities including provider solutions, GPO services data and insights through Ontada and clinical trial capabilities through our Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture, which includes clinical trial matching and accelerated clinical trial setup. We remain excited about our leading and differentiated oncology offerings and intend ongoing investment to sustain the growth and progress we're seeing against our strategic priorities. Moving to Prescription Technology Solutions, Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered revenues of $1.2 billion, an operating profit of $223 million, both flat to the prior year. First quarter results reflect growth across our technology services products, including increased demand for our affordability solutions, including growth in e-voucher and e-prescribed ; revenue included 18% sequential growth in third party logistics. However, these results were lower than anticipated due to drug product launch delays, which had an approximately 7% impact on segment revenue growth in the quarter. Operating profit was impacted by lower contributions from our access solutions due to the mix of transactions and services we provide across our access program and higher expenses to support future growth across the business. We remain confident that the segment operating profit will grow at or above the long term growth target rate on an annual basis. Turning to Medical-Surgical solutions, first quarter results in the segment were below our expectations. Revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 1% and operating profit was $200 million, a decrease of 15%. These results were driven by higher volumes of specialty pharmaceuticals, offset by lower volumes across the primary care channel, including customer mix and product demand shifts and the lapping of prior year nutritional product strength in the extended care channel. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues were $3.7 billion, an increase of 6% and operating profit was $102 million, an increase of 13%, driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business compared to the prior year. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $35 million in the quarter, which included pretax gains of $110 million, or $0.62 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to pretax losses of $7 million, or $0.04 share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As we've previously discussed, McKesson Ventures impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter to quarter, which may result in gains and losses, the timing and magnitude which can vary for each investment. Let me turn to cash and capital deployment, which can be found in slide twelve. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. For the first quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.5 billion, which included $167 million in capital expenditures in the quarter free cash flow was impacted by the timing of tax payments and working capital investments. To support the on-boarding of new customers in the US Pharmaceutical segment, we returned $609 million of cash to shareholders, which included $527 million of share repurchases and $82 million in dividend payments. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and the resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on and therefore can vary from quarter to quarter. Now, let me discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook. We continue to make progress against our strategic priorities, leveraging our broad capabilities across the enterprise. As a result of our first quarter performance and confidence in the outlook over the balance of the year, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per diluted share to $31.75 to $32.55. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2025. We remain confident in our differentiated oncology and biopharma services assets and our strategy to advance McKesson as a diversified healthcare services company. Let me start with our segments. In the first quarter, we experienced strong momentum across our US Pharmaceutical segment, including our broad oncology offerings. The breadth of our capabilities and leading portfolio of assets across oncology have led to value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders over the last five years. Our fiscal 2025 outlook for the US Pharmaceutical segment is a continuation of this momentum. Our outlook also contemplates the impact of the distribution contract with Optum that went into effect in July of 2024. Thanks to dedicated effort from our employees, we delivered a seamless onboarding experience in July. As we previously outlined, start up costs associated with this contract implementation were not material to first quarter results. However, we made investments in working capital during the quarter in advance of the contract start date. We are pleased to expand our pharmaceutical distribution relationship with Optum and this is a testament to our leading distribution and sourcing capabilities, including our strong customer value proposition. We now anticipate us pharmaceutical revenues will increase 13% to 16% when compared to prior guidance. We anticipate lower contribution from branded pharmaceuticals, which includes lower volumes for HUMIRA, and we anticipate operating profit to increase eight to 10%. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 14% to 18% and operating profit to increase eleven to 15%, a modest decline from the prior guidance. The updated outlook for the segment reflects the lower than anticipated first quarter results and the impact of product launch delays during the first quarter. Demand for our access solutions, including prior authorization volumes related to GLP-1 medications demonstrated a slower rate of growth compared to the prior year, including the mix of transactions and services across our various access programs and volatility driven in part by product delays and shortages. These results were lower than our expectations in the first quarter. As we've previously communicated, we remain confident in the long term growth rate targets on an annual basis. However, we anticipate the growth trajectory in this segment will vary from quarter to quarter, driven by several factors that include utilization trends, the timing and trajectory of new product drug launches, the evolution of a product's program support requirements as it matures, which could result in the shift to other services or a program termination, product delays and supply shortages, the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter and the size and timing of investments to support and expand our product portfolio. We see solid market demand for our differentiated suite of solutions and services that help improve patients access, affordability and adherence to medications, as well as help to support biopharma manufacturers throughout the lifecycle of their products. We continue to build differentiated, technology enabled solutions that can seamlessly be used in the workflow of payers, providers and pharmacies. We remain confident that our market leading assets, depth of services and capabilities, and continued investment in innovation position us for growth in line or modestly above our long range targets. Moving to Medical-Surgical solutions, we anticipate revenues to increase three to 7% and operating profit to be at the low end of the initial guidance range of six to 8%. Over the last few years, including the period covering COVID, the Medical-Surgical environment has been dynamic and experienced volatility across the customers and products within the primary care channel and sites of care. McKesson's unparalleled breadth of services and capabilities led to strong performance as market conditions have normalized. We've noted instances of general market weakness in the primary care channel. This led to lower sales and operating profit contributions in the first quarter. Our updated full year outlook reflects the results from the first quarter and the trends we are seeing in the market, and we anticipate that these trends will continue through the second quarter. As Brian noted in his remarks in response to the market conditions, today we are announcing a series of initiatives within the Medical-Surgical solutions segment to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts. In addition to delivering improved operating performance, these actions will result in greater alignment across the organization while continuing to invest to better serve our customers, partners and patients. We estimate total charges between $100 million and $150 million, consisting primarily of employee severance and other employee related costs, facility and other exit related costs as well as long lived asset impairments. This restructuring program is anticipated to be substantially complete by the end of the first half of fiscal 2026. These initiatives will lead to improved margins, a streamlined infrastructure and operating leverage. We anticipate the benefits from this program will begin in the second half of this fiscal year. We are well positioned with leading assets and capabilities across all the alternate sites of care, and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering long term growth. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to increase four to 8% and operating profit to increase 8% to 12%. We are pleased with the first quarter performance in our Canadian business and anticipate continued growth in fiscal 2025. We also remain committed to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. As a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country in Europe that we have not yet entered into an agreement to sell. Contributions related to operations in Norway are included in the fiscal 2025 outlook for the segment. In the corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $495 to $555 million, which incorporates the impact of $110 million of pretax gains related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio in the first quarter, as well as increased technology spend. We're pleased with the development and contributions from our enterprise technology organization, including the pace of our technology investments focused on supporting growth, innovation and efficiency. Our investments in AI will continue to focus on improving the customer experience. We continue to evaluate the enterprise technology operating model approach to effectively support the development of our strategy and needs of the organization, our customers and partners. We anticipate an increased level of investment in the technology operating model to accelerate the organization and improve business continuity, compliance and operating efficiency. Wrapping up our outlook, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $245 to $265 million, reflecting the impact from increased average balances of the company's loan portfolio and higher interest rates throughout the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2025. We anticipate income attributable to non-controlling interest be in the range of $175 million to international segment 185 million, reflecting the success of ClarusONE's generic sourcing operations, and we anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 17% to 19%, reflecting the positive discrete tax items recognized in the first quarter. As a reminder, the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict and therefore we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning to cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter to quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of quarter. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $2.8 billion of shares in fiscal 2025. As a result of this share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately 128 million to 130 million. We will continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, creating value for our shareholders. This discipline has led to a return on invested capital approaching 28%. Wrapping up fiscal 2025 guidance, we anticipate revenue growth of 13% to 15% and operating profit growth of ten to 15% as compared to the prior year, fiscal 2025. We anticipate earnings per diluted share of which represents growth of 16% to 19% as compared to fiscal 2024. Our guidance assumes that the first half of the fiscal year will deliver less contribution than previously anticipated, with the second half delivering approximately 53% of the full year earnings. In closing, our fiscal 2025 outlook incorporates continued momentum across the business. We remain confident in our leading positions and growth pillars across oncology and biopharma services platforms. We are confident the actions we are taking now will sustain the growth we have delivered over the past several years. We have a strong and stable financial foundation which positions us to execute on our capital allocation strategy and we remain positioned to deliver for our customers and our partners and to create sustainable shareholder value. With that, we can move to the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. I'd like to jump right into RxTS. And Brian, can I help you -- can I ask you to help us understand the mix of services within access? I think we've talked about mix between access and 3PL, but it sounds like there was a mix of services in access that is different. And then, Britt, relative to the GLP-1 mix, is this in part the value of new scripts versus annual re-ups? Or are you seeing any manufacture pushback on price as volume expands? Or any impact from the advent of these direct manufacturer programs? Have those been factors? Brian Tyler : Thanks, Eric. Thanks for the questions. So I think the first part of your question was relative to mix within the access portfolio. And here, I would just say these programs -- this isn't a single program offering. Each program can have nuance to it. It can be based off different sorts of transactions and interactions with the patients. We can get paid differently. It's really a manufacturer program. So they have a hand in how they want to design and what metrics they want to track, and then that translates to the transactions that we can build for. This quarter, the mix of those services shifted on us in a way that was unanticipated at the beginning of the year. Britt Vitalone : As it relates to GLP-1s, Eric, I don't think we're seeing anything that we haven't seen over the past few quarters. I think maybe I'd just go back and talk about and just maybe reemphasize some of the things that go on in this particular segment. And I think specifically, as you think about our access and affordability programs, clearly, utilization is the foundation building block, and utilization has been stable and growing over the last several quarters. But a couple things that I would point out. Clearly, the timing and trajectory of new product drug launches is an impact. And I referenced in my opening comments that we had product delays in our 3PL business. We also have product delays that relate to our access programs. Icodec is a good example of a product that we have a program in place for, and that program has been delayed. And that has an impact on our prior authorization programs throughout the rest of the year. And if you think about product evolution, so there's also the maturity of products over time. Prior authorization programs, depending on the particular drug and the needs of the biopharma manufacturer, they will vary in terms of the length of that particular product. We had a drug, Trulicity, that was a prior authorization program for 9 years, and the manufacturer determined to shift the funds for that particular program to other programs within RxTS. Nine years is a long time for a prior authorization service. So it's not unusual that we will see either a funding shift to other programs or, in some cases, just terminate. So you have that kind of variability that goes through the segment. It's not necessarily transaction or pricing variations that are driving that variability, but it's certainly the launch timing and trajectory as well as the types of services and programs and the drugs within those particular buckets. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : The next will be Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yeah, hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask two quick ones on the U.S. Pharma segment, the profit growth there at 6%. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about the factors that are going to drive it up into the 8% to 10% guidance range for the year in a bit greater detail. And then if we were to look at the revenue revision, I guess, if you were to exclude GLP-1s in HUMIRA, is there any sense you can give us whether the decline in your revenue outlook would be the same or different? Or maybe there wouldn't be a decline at all? Britt Vitalone : Well, maybe I'll take those in reverse order. In the case of the lower contribution from branded pharmaceuticals, specifically HUMIRA, that impact is the difference between our current guidance, the guidance that we had previously. There's no really other change to the revenue profile within the segment. As it relates to the first quarter, the performance that we had in the first quarter was in line with our expectations. I would remind you that that's also in line with the long-term growth rate guidance that we've provided previously. Again, it's being driven by a lot of the same factors that we've seen over the last several quarters, growth in specialty, growth within our oncology business. And as we think about the rest of the year, we anticipate that we'll have continued growth in those areas, continued strength in our generics program. And the 8% to 10% guide for the full year, again, is unchanged from our prior guidance. So we feel good about the position that we have, the customer set that we're serving as well as the continued growth in a key strategic area for us, which is our oncology platform. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : The next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Britt, just as a follow-up to that. When you talk about the branded HUMIRA, is it that the price is coming down because of the biosimilar? Or it's just circumventing your channel altogether? That's just really not a question, just a follow-up. And then my real question is just if you can help -- you or Brian, can help us to understand what's happening in the MedSurg business. You talked about product demand mix in primary care and shifts there. You talked about the fact that you're putting in new cost cutting, et cetera, on that. But what's really shifting and changing in that market? Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Lisa, for the question. Let me start with your first question. This is simply a formulary change that a customer made to shift from brand to the biosimilar. And so that's the impact that's happening to the revenues is that formulary change to the biosimilar. I'll start on Medical. And as we talked about, we were coming off of a pretty dynamic period of years in the Medical segment. One of the things that we're seeing is, just give you one example is, as we've come through this COVID period, there is a significant less demand for COVID-type products, such as COVID test kits and testing in general. And what we have seen is, as we've normalized -- begun to normalize in the environment, and we've come out of this COVID period, that demand for those test kits and other types of testing related to COVID simply has not come back. It's just soft. We see good -- continued good growth within most of our segments, but there are particular product segments, such as testing and test kits and other related COVID services, that have remained soft. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : The next will be Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow-up on Lisa's relative to MedSurg. As you think about the activities you're taking to improve profitability, where, specifically, within the organization, customer area, are you focused on those activities? And I guess, with the primary care softness, can you just give us a little bit more color on what's been going well in MedSurg? And as what you think is going to keep trend accelerate trend as part of the guidance into the back half of the year? Brian Tyler : Yes. Well, I would just remind everybody, we've got a very extensive alternate site business that plays in multiple channels : primary care, extended care, surgery center, clinic settings, et cetera. And we have on top of that a broad product offering, who, core, obviously, commodity, medical products, equipment, pharmaceuticals, specialty pharmaceutical. We have been seeing some good growth in the pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical that, that creates some margin mix challenges for us. But it's a really well-scaled business, I think, outstanding customer service and reputation with customers and diversified across the channels. Now as Britt described and said quite well, we've been having patient mobility we called it at one time, demand utilization in the channel. And we've just seen it soften over the course of our first quarter. It could be lots of contributing factors to that, right? It could be impact to the economy and inflation on patients in postponing care. It could be staffing challenges in health care, which I think are quite well known. The reality for us is, is to just deal with what we see in the marketplace and make sure that we respond in the right way. So stepping back, aligning our go-to-market strategies, aligning our operations, thinking about the way we go to market with these mix of products. And as you would expect, we're taking essentially all of those actions, and that was the program that Britt referred to. Britt Vitalone : Yes. I think maybe just to add on to that, as we think about, as Brian mentioned, as we see these trends, we want to meet the customer where they're at and meet the demands for that are changing within this marketplace or that we see changing in this marketplace. And so we have an opportunity, as we always have, to drive sustainable efficiency through our cost structure, align our organization and align our organization to the customers to drive more velocity, efficiency, as well as aligning our infrastructure or real estate portfolio, reengineer the real estate portfolio to also meet these demands. So we just want to be responsive to that. We think that these are the right actions to do that, and we are comfortable that they're going to drive significant benefits into the organization beginning in the second half of the year. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : The next will be Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Allen Lutz : Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Another one for Britt. I wanted to follow up on HUMIRA. It looked like gross profit at the enterprise level was a few percentage points below the Street. Can you talk about how gross profit came in relative to your internal expectations? And did the formulary change with HUMIRA impact your gross profit at all? Britt Vitalone : Yes, thanks for that question. As I think about it, the primary driver would be the growth rate and trajectory for GLP-1s. And we talked about, in the last few quarters, that we anticipated that GLP-1s would continue to grow year-over-year, but we had seen a moderation in that growth. As I mentioned in my comments that what we saw in the first quarter is we actually saw a sequential growth in GLP-1s that was a little bit higher than we had anticipated. I think gross profit, generally, was pretty much in line with what we anticipated, but there was a little higher growth in GLP-1 distribution transactions than we had anticipated. As I mentioned, we had sequential growth quarter-to-quarter. That's the primary driver. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : The next will be Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Stephanie Davis : Hey, guys, thank you very much for taking my question. I was just hoping to dig in, again, to some of the product launch delays in Prescription Tech. I get that it's based across both 3PL and access. But given it's still early in the year, what gives you confidence that this is a full year pushout? Is there any chance that it ends up flowing back in the back half of the year? Or any conservatism baked into that? Or is it a bit more predictable? Britt Vitalone : Yes. So we have moderated our full year guidance slightly. So you see that the guidance is down about 1% at the midpoint. We have a broad portfolio of services beyond prior authorizations. We support specialty drugs through hub and reimbursement programs. We have affordability programs. So it is a very broad portfolio of services. The access programs, like prior authorization, clearly are an important part of that. But again, we have a broad set. We also have an annual verification program in our fourth fiscal quarter that has been very successful over the last few years. So as we step back and look at all of the services and programs that we have, we believe that taking our guide down at the midpoint moderately is the appropriate thing to do at this time, reflective of a slower start to the year than we had anticipated. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : The next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Grosslight : Hi, thanks for taking the question. You guys mentioned this a couple of times now that GLP-1 growth this quarter was better than expected. And it does seem that supply constraints are abating a bit. I'm just curious, as GLP-1s become more widely available and the channel becomes more important to the manufacturers, i.e., keeping it out of the mail channel, I'm wondering if there's any opportunity in the near term for you to improve buy-side economics there and capture a little more of kind of the operating profit benefit from GLPs? Brian Tyler : Well, we have seen really in the last several weeks, I would say, improvement in the supply situation. Obviously, as it relates to our financial relationships with the manufacturers, I mean, we always strive to get fair value for the services that we lend and support of getting these cold chain products to market and to get to the patients. And quite proud of the service and the service levels that we do provide in that regard. We are always in ongoing dialogue, a lot of it around access, availability, what we can do to support the manufacturers and these drugs, which really would have tremendous patient impact and impact on people's lives. So we are continually in discussion. Some of those discussions around the core distribution, others will be about additional services, like we provide through our Technology Solutions businesses to support them. But it's all about access and getting access to patients to get the uptake in the products. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : The next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Lisa, please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, sorry. Hi guys. Thanks for the question. Yes, just a follow-up. Sorry, I was on mute. I was wondering if you could comment on sort of some of the changing mix you've talked about in the market and what impact that has on ClarusONE? And how you guys think about the contribution from ClarusONE and kind of the new services and things that it can bring as the market continues to evolve from a mix perspective with biosimilars and oncology in that? Britt Vitalone : Thanks for the question. We're really pleased with the performance of ClarusONE now for several years. The partnership that we have with some key customers of ours, the partnership that we have with really hundreds of suppliers on the buy side, we think that ClarusONE positions us well, not only for competitive low cost for our customers, but also they focus really heavily on the availability of supply. And we think that ClarusONE will continue to partner well as we bring on new partners in our distribution business. We believe that they'll continue to partner well on the manufacturer side. And as I mentioned in my comments, part of the full year guide around non-controlling interest is reflective of strength in ClarusONE. So we're really pleased with how ClarusONE positions us across all generic products. We think that there could be opportunity to expand those services, but we're really focused on serving our customers with their generic needs from an availability of supply and a low-cost perspective. Rachel Rodriguez : Next question, please? Operator : The next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good afternoon, Britt, maybe just on RxTS. I'm looking at your guidance adjustment, right? And the decline in operating profit is notably lower than the revenue change. So suggesting that there's better margin in what is in the business left. So just curious what those margin dynamics are that we need to be thinking about, that impact of the delta in the guidance? Britt Vitalone : Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. As I've talked about before, if you look at the revenue composition of this particular segment, more than 50% of the revenue comes from our 3PL business, which is less than 10% of the operating profit contribution. So we anticipate that our other programs around access and affordability and some of our adherence solutions, which have higher margins for us, will drive a lot of that improvement over the second half of the year. Again, the 3PL business, although it has grown sequentially, we do anticipate that it will grow year-over-year. The impact that it has on our operating profit is not material. Rachel Rodriguez : We have time for one more question, please. Operator : Certainly, that question will come from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Thanks for taking my question. So I want to switch gears a little bit to U.S. oncology and in sort of the specialty offering the news around the Tennessee Cancer Specialists today, what that adds for you and what your appetite for similar deals are going forward? And just your effort also that you talked about to consolidate the specialty offering as well and have this cohesive offering. I guess, will you be breaking out more for us in terms of the disclosure on that front as that becomes a bigger part of the growth algorithm for you? Brian Tyler : Great, great question. I appreciate it very much. We've been very pleased with the growth of the U.S. Oncology Network over the last several years. As we mentioned, we're now in over 600 sites, 31 states, 2,600 providers. And really, it's been multiple years of steady growth. And we continue to think that the network has tremendous attraction to community-based oncology providers. We look to add to that network through either acquisition of practices through managed agreements with them, where we find a practice that has relevant scale in the geography, and we think can practice clinical oncology consistent with the quality standards we have in the USON network. So we can acquire a practice, we can attract physicians to existing practices, but I think we've consistently demonstrated over the last year is that's a key part of our growth strategy. Now when we've talked for several years about the ecosystem or the complementarity between our various oncology assets, not just the network, it's the Ontada data and insights business that we started 4 years ago. It's the joint venture with Sarah Cannon that we entered into a couple of years ago. It's the iKnowMed EMR system that we have. And I think as we've just seen these begin to mature, we saw the opportunity to more naturally bring them together under coordinated leadership to just sort of accelerate this ecosystem or this network effect across the businesses. And I'm very excited about this move. I think it brings more clarity. I think it's going to bring more speed. It's going to bring more focus. So when we think about where we invest as a company, we want to deploy capital against our strategic priorities, and expanding the network is certainly one of those and will continue to be one. Okay. Well, look, thank you, everyone, again, for joining the call. Thank you for the excellent questions. I want to thank Cynthia, our operator, for facilitating the call. Look, McKesson's reported first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share, which exceeded our expectations. We are very focused on executing against our strategy and our company priorities, which enable us to navigate through a dynamic environment with confidence. Looking ahead, we're confident in the strength of our underlying businesses, the differentiation of our assets and where they sit in the market in terms of positioning. I cannot end this call without thanking the 51,000-plus McKesson employees for their dedication and contribution to advancing our mission. So to team McKesson, thank you very much. Okay. I hope everyone has a terrific evening. Thanks again for joining the call. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",
