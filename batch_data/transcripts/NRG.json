First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chad Plotkin, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chad Plotkin : Thank you, Shannon and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you to NRG\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast which can be located on our website at www.nrgenergy.com. You can access the call, associated presentation material, as well as a replay of the call on the Investor Relations section of our website. Because this call, including the presentation and Q&A session will be limited to one hour, we ask that you limit yourself to only one question with just one follow-up. In addition, as this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG\u2019s perspective. Before we begin, I urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor statement provided in today\u2019s presentation which explains the risks and uncertainties associated with future events and the forward-looking statements made in today\u2019s press release and presentation material. We caution you to consider the important risk factors contained in our press release and other filings with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements in the press release and this conference call. In addition, please note that the date of this conference call is Tuesday, May 5, 2014 and any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law. During this morning\u2019s call, we\u2019ll refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures of the company\u2019s operating and financial results. For complete information regarding our non-GAAP financial information, the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a quantitative reconciliation of those figures, please refer to today\u2019s press release and this presentation. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Crane, NRG\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. David Crane : Thank you, Chad. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Joining me today are Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer, and Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer, and both of them will be participating in the presentation. Also with me is Chris Moser who runs Commercial Operations for the company and will be available to answer any specific questions you have in that regard. So let's get right into it because as usual we have a lot to talk about today. So if you are following on the presentation, turning to Slide 3 I mean clearly we had a good first quarter. The strength of our financial performance which you anticipated has been commonly attributed to the severe weather which we experienced during the quarter no more by you out there than by we ourselves. Indeed, in the first draft of the quarterly press release I think the exceptional weather was mentioned at least eight times. But there are lessons to be learned from the different financial outcomes experienced by the power companies active in our core markets that operated their businesses under the very same weather conditions. First and foremost of these lessons is the reaffirmation of the point that we have been making about the merchant generation business for the past decade which is that the best way to out earn your cost of capital in the IPP business is to operate and trade a base load fleet that runs on multiple fuels. In other words, from a commodity perspective, NRG makes money by selling coal and uranium at natural gas prices. And that proposition worked very well for us in the first quarter of 2014. The atmospherics, if you will, around the first quarter weather also have tended to obscure the fact that it took an exceptional operating performance from both our plant operations folks and our commercial operations team to navigate successfully through the unprecedented technical challenges and commercial volatility that we experienced this quarter. So first I want to express my profound gratitude to Mauricio and his entire operations team for their total dedication and magnificent performance during the quarter. NRG's success is their success. Personally, I had absolutely nothing to do with it. My role was only to sit on the sideline and to applaud. Second, I am very mindful of the fact that our customers had a difficult time of it this winter. Individual monthly energy bills this winter averaged hundreds of dollars in excess of recent winters. There is little consolation I can offer these customers in respect to this past winter but in terms of the future, I want our customers to know that NRG is moving fast to put itself in a position to offer a full range of distributed generation and comprehensive home and efficiency solutions that have the potential to meaningfully reduce people's energy bills over time. Now turning to Slide 4. While we were very focused during the quarter on keeping the lights on for our customers and delivering a positive upside to our shareholders, it also was a very active quarter for us in terms of positioning NRG for future success. Most notably through the three strategic acquisitions which appear on this page. The biggest of the acquisitions to close was obviously the Edison Mission Energy transaction. With respect to EME's base load plans in and around Chicago, we are well into duplicating the evaluation process we used during the early post-closing stage of the GenOn integration. As you will recall, in GenOn it took us six months to fully assess our options and only then did we announce our asset synergy plan. In the case of Midwest Gen, the good news is that we do not believe it will take us another six months to develop an articulate a fully thought out asset plan. The less good news is that it will take us more than the five weeks that we have had to date. So I promise you that as soon as we have an asset plan with respect to Midwest Gen that we are comfortable with, we will brief you on its contents and its projected financial impact on the company. Moving to Slide 5. I would like to make one observation about the political and regulatory situation in Illinois as it affects the Midwest Gen fleet. A few weeks back at an event in Chicago, I made some comments on Exelon's public policy positions with respect to their distressed nuclear assets in Illinois. Press reports of my comments focused almost exclusively on the fact that I perceived great irony in the fact that Exelon seemed to be seeking some sort of subsidy for their existing nuclear plants, ostensibly on the grounds that nuclear is zero carbon energy, at the very same time that Exelon was actively lobbying for an end to several tax breaks for zero carbon wind and solar. My main point that day in Chicago however was different and it's worth clarifying here today. I am not fundamentally opposed to subsidies if the primary goal of the new subsidy is to ensure that enough existing base load capacity is retained in the market to provide reliability even during severe weather events affecting the system. But in this regard I would note that our coal plants on the outskirts of Chicago can keep the lights on as well if not better than operationally inflexible nuclear plants located further away from the load center. As a result, it is our opinion that any scheme devised in the future to keep existing solid fuel fired capacity alive in Illinois as a necessary base load complement to all the wind generation coming into Illinois from the Dakotas, should treat Midwest Gen's fleet as well if not better than economically marginal nuclear plants. What is going on in Illinois is basically a question of how do we maintain base load fuel diversity long-term across all markets in a world which is becoming increasingly carbon constrained. The obvious solution is to take the carbon out of the existing coal plants post combustion. Today I am very pleased to inform you, and this is shown on Slide 6, of Petra Nova, our carbon capture to enhanced oil recovery or CCEOR project at our giant Parish coal-fired plant outside Houston. The Petra Nova project effectively will sequester 1.6 million tons per year of carbon into nearby oil fields. In so doing, it will enable oil production that will provide the economic return we need in an environment where there is not yet a price on carbon. Petra Nova is scheduled for financial closing and notice to proceed in just a few short weeks. Petra Nova is a win-win-win project and that\u2019s just from NRG's perspective. First it's a win for us because it provides a meaningful carbon hedge for Parish. Second, it's a win for us in that it diversifies our commodity exposure and allows us to realize our economic return from the project through the price of crude oil. And third and finally as you can tell by the map on this page, our three major coal plants on the Gulf Coast which are amongst the youngest and more important of all the coal plants in our fleet. Each sit astride oil fields that are candidates for enhanced oil recovering using CO2. In my opinion, the ability to economically capture carbon post-combustion at these three plants is not only a potentially lucrative source of additional revenue for the company. It means that the average remaining life of these coal assets or their residual value for the (indiscernible) will be significantly greater than it was before carbon capture became a reality. We will brief you more fully about Petra Nova at the time of the deal closing, which as I said we expect later next month. Now turning to Slide 7. We have made no secret in recent years of our belief that the future of competitive retail energy supply lay in providing a broader range of energy and energy related products and services, both inside the home and on the home. And the key to future success in retail will be to win the hearts and minds and loyalty of home-owners in all of the markets in which we participate. We have been hard at work growing our mass retail business organically. Adding net customer counts, staying top decile in customer satisfaction surveys and expanding into new markets. And importantly, becoming good and leasing and the other critical behind the scenes aspects of residential solar. In the second quarter this year we bought Roof Diagnostics Solar which is involved all across the residential solar value chain but whose particular strength is both customer acquisition and installation. These areas of expertise are both critical points of differentiation for NRG from the perspective of turning residential solar from a primarily local business supplied largely by self-employed roofers and HVAC companies to a big, fast-growing and exciting business being performed by reputable companies like NRG which are in a better position to stand behind their performance for the long term. We have worked with RDS as partners even before the acquisition and I am convinced that working together under one roof so to speak, we will build a top tier residential solar franchise that both will benefit and benefit from very close association with our conventional retail businesses. Our goal of course is to seamlessly offer residential solar to our three million conventional retail customers and conversely to offer system power and other energy products and services to our much smaller but very fast growing roster of residential solar customers. Finally, on Slide 8, we are highlighting one of the most value optimizing opportunities from within the EME deal, the high quality wind asset portfolio with long-term contracts which provides yet another substantial pipeline of contracted assets eligible for drop-down to NRG Yield. We have been hard at work since the NRG Yield IPO last summer and making sure that energy yield is the highest quality vehicle of its time with the most diverse set of operating assets and an attractive growth pipeline. All these goals were amply served by the EME acquisition. We remain convinced that the highest growth opportunity for NRG in solar, wind and other clean energy solutions is migrating from the utility scale deals that have previously been our principle focus, to the business to business and business to consumer solar markets, both of which are potentially enormous. In these markets, NRG Yield and the certainty and competitive cost of capital that it can offer for bundled portfolios of B2B and B2C deals, will be an enduring competitive advantage for NRG. So let me conclude on Slide 9 with a bit of a situational analysis on NRG's positioning within the American Energy industry from the perspective of a potential investor in this space. I have been very open over the past several months in stating my conviction that our industry is on the cusp of disruptive change. That new energy technologies now cost effective and available to be deployed at scale will transform the traditional power sector and the vertically integrated utilities which have dominated it since the 1930s. Every day I see developments in our business and our society that convince me that this disruptive change is now upon us and that there is no turning back. As a result, our priority internally has been to move faster and more effectively so that we can win in energy future that is going to be significantly cleaner, more distributed and less uniform than the present command and control, one size fits all system. From your perspective as investors it must be an incredibly exciting time filled with investment opportunity. Think of 50 million American homes each with a distributed solar system at $20,000 a pop on average. That represents a trillion dollar market opportunity. And certainly the valuation levels ascribed by the market to early movers in the distributed generation space indicates that the stock market recognizes the extraordinary blue sky potential of distributed generation. But trying to invest in the market opportunity of distributed solar right now as a public company investor basically means investing in the very few pure play residential solar companies that have gone public. And that strategy is not without risks. You are betting that the early movers continues to be the market leaders even in the face of bigger companies like NRG coming into the space. You are betting that the distributed generation market has a breakout sooner rather than later and you are betting that the path to real and sustained profitability in the distributed generation space not only eventually reveals itself but reveals itself in the business of the company that you have chosen to invest. On the far other side of the power industry sits the traditional investor-owned utilities and independent power producers. As the EEI itself correctly foretold in January last year, investors in the conventional power sector contemplating a long-term investment in the electric supply industry will soon realize that they are not being paid enough to take the risk of systemic disruption that suddenly confronts the conventional power companies. There are plenty of power companies in addition to NRG who performed well during the Polar Vortex and achieved a strong first quarter result. But what is the long-term future for companies that depend exclusively on the sale of system power delivered over an increasingly obsolete and unreliable grid to a population of consumers and businesses that more and more will be relying less and less on grid delivered power for their energy needs. Conventional power companies should have a long-term strategy for that and as we look around the industry we just don\u2019t see it. And that leaves the field clear, at least clear of incumbent power companies for NRG. So NRG in my opinion represents a very different and increasingly unique value proposition. A proposition that is demonstrated both in terms of current financial performance as measured in the incontrovertible reality of our robust free cash flow. And the almost limitless future potential growth opportunity that distributed energy represents for us. We expect to realize on this opportunity by harnessing the reciprocal benefits of fusing our nearly 3 million retail customers, conventional retail franchise, with our emerging residential solar capability as I have mentioned before. No one else has the platform we have in this regard and we intend to leverage our strategic advantages quickly and as completely as possible. So if you are an investor contemplating investment in this space, we hope you will consider investing in NRG, NRG Yield or both and come along on what we expect to be an exciting ride into the clean energy future. With that I will turn it over to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : David, thank you and good morning everyone. As you all know during the quarter we experienced extreme weather conditions and unprecedented price volatility in our core markets. But it was the diversity of our generation portfolio, our integrated business model, and most importantly the excellent performance from our plant operations and commercial operations teams that allowed us to deliver record financial results for the quarter. I want to thank all my colleagues for their outstanding performance. And while we are only now sharing this success with you, I want to assure you that everyone at NRG has already turned the page and we are now focused on getting ready for the summer. The events of this past quarter brought out the best of NRG but it also helped highlight some of the shortcomings of our electric system. It is clear to us that we need to improve the coordination between power and gas markets, recognize the value of fuel diversity through competitive market signals as David pointed out, and ensure a reliable transition as we implement new environmental regulations that could lead to significant capacity retirements. We are working closely with regulators and stakeholders to continue improving our competitive markets. Our integrated platform performed significantly well during the quarter with the wholesale business more than offsetting the challenges faced by retail, given the increased price volatility and higher loads. But the fact that we were able to sustain retail margins under these circumstances is an example of how robust our risk management capabilities are. With all the changes that we have made in our portfolio over the past 18 months and since I know many of you have asked about the recent ruling by the Supreme Court regarding CSAPR, it seems appropriate to provide you an update on our environmental compliance plan. This is an important year for us with over $230 million of CapEx planned for this year, primarily at Big Cajun, Conemaugh and our New Jersey [peaking] (ph) assets. All of which are on-schedule and on budget. In total, we are still projecting $326 million in environmental spend over the next four years excluding any impact related to the closing of Edison Mission. With respect to Edison Mission, we are also working diligently to optimize the existing environmental compliance planned for the Midwest Generation assets. We are applying the same optimization process used with GenOn across all the new assets not just environmental compliance, and expect the same good results in terms of operational synergies but in a much shorter timeframe. With respect to the CSAPR decision, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision that had vacated the rule and extending it back to the lower court for further proceedings. This is clearly a win for EPA but there is still a number of open issues that need to be resolved. We do not expect any significant change to our current environmental compliance plan from the resurrection of CSAPR. We anticipate the existing [care] (ph) program to remain in place for sometime while some of the legal and procedural issues are addressed. Turning to operational performance on Slide 12. We had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with a 110 out of 121 facilities without a recordable injury. This is particularly gratifying given the severe weather conditions under which our plant operations people were exposed through during the quarter. While these results don\u2019t yet reflect our newest assets, Edison Mission has a strong safety culture and we look forward to integrating them into NRG and the opportunity to learn from each other to continue improving our program. Solar generation was significantly higher from last year driven primarily by the east region which was up 39%. Colder weather in the east couple with gas supply constraints proved out the value of fuel diversity and optionality as we saw unprecedented dispatch in many of our units from coal to oil to gas. Right behind it but no less impressive was Texas with generation 30% above last year, driven primarily colder than normal weather and improved availability at our South Texas project plant. It is important to note that we continue to optimize our maintenance outage days during lower price periods. So that we take full advantage of the peak price opportunities such as the ones caused by the Polar Vortex. Over the past three years, we have increased the number of maintenance outage days and believe that the benefit of getting this outage is done with little opportunity cost and increasing the reliability when it matters the most, more than offsets the negative impact on our annual availability metrics. For example, during peak price days in January and February, our coal and nuclear availability was over 90% demonstrating the value of our strategy. Coal and nuclear reliability improved 30% year-over-year to 9% for the quarter and our gas fleet also performed exceedingly well with 97% starting reliability while doubling the number of starts. Once again, this performance was achieved under severe weather conditions. With a portfolio of over 53,000 megawatts of generation and more than 140 plants, the execution of our planned outages are critical. We have been focused on executing the 159 outages that we have planned for the spring season in order to get ready for the important summer months. Moving on to Slide 13. We were quite pleased with the performance of our retail platform. Despite increasing wholesale prices, extreme weather and ongoing competitive pressure in the C&I segment, we delivered $108 million in adjusted EBITDA, $5 million more than the first quarter of 2013. Extreme weather conditions covered all the markets we served throughout the quarter with the Polar Vortex in the Northeast and sustained cold weather in Texas. At the same time, power prices were up between 50% and 150% year-over-year. Challenging conditions to say the least. Through these, however, we continued to execute as we leveraged the strength of our marketing and sales channels as well as our margin management and integrated wholesale and retail capabilities. The results is that we held retail unit margins overall and increased them in Texas while growing customer count in both Texas and the Northeast. This is one of the key reasons why we felt comfortable expanding our platform even further with the closing of the Dominion retail electricity business. This acquisition extends our leading multi-brand business in Texas and nearly doubles our Northeast customer base, enabling us to bring innovative products and services to an additional 500,000 mass customers. In the C&I segment, we continued to maintain our discipline in this intensely competitive segment and are extending our product offering to include advisory services and comprehensive solutions to our customers beyond system power, including backup generation, solar and demand response. We have now 14 consecutive quarters of customer growth, our ability to maintain margins and customers along with the overlap of our generation portfolio and our retail footprint, we are well positioned to continue expanding our franchise and extend the value of our customer relationship. Moving to our market update on Slide 14. Overall, we are seeing some bullish signals in our markets. Unlike what we have seen in quite some time. Starting with gas and the obvious impact that this whole winter had on storage levels, we remain at 50% of the five-year average, levels not seen in a decade. Real concerns about the ability to refuel storage to a reliable level will develop unless injections begin to ramp up soon. And if we experience a hot summer, strong injections may be very difficult to incent without further increasing prices. You can see the insert chart in the upper left hand chart showing historical weekly injections and the high level that is necessary to achieve the storage number we saw in 2013 of 3.8 Bcf. This fundamental picture and the strong pricing we saw in Q1 have affected the forward power markets. Both dark spreads and spark spreads have expanded benefitting well diversified portfolios like ours. The upcoming PJM capacity auction continues to highlight many changes that extend our bullish view. The combined effect of higher requirements and limits on demand response, the limits on capacity imports and the significant levels of un-cleared coal megawatts are positive signs in PJM. Finally, as you know, we have not been overly bullish on the prospects of the Midwest. But COMED is becoming a growing source of opportunity for us. In fact, we think this opportunity goes beyond driving value for our proven synergy model. We have nice rally in the market over the past few months potentially signaling a state of transition in the market dynamics. Accordingly, we are looking forward to updating you in further detail over the quarters as we refine and complete our operational synergy assessment. Moving to our hedging disclosures on Slide 15, we now have added the expected fuel and generation numbers for the Edison Mission assets and the respective impact on the sensitivity charts. As you can see, we have increased hedges in our coal and nuclear fleet for the balance of 2014, where we took advantage of the commodity rally and executed hedges against the Midwest fleet. Beyond 2014, the hedge levels have decreased slightly reflecting the open position in the Midwest. During the quarter, and despite the additional demand from this [cold] [ph] winter, our commercial team remained focused on integrating the Edison [portfolio] [ph]. At the end of 2013, we recognized rail performance issues with some carriers that could impact operations in 2014. As a result and in collaboration with the railroads we took the necessary steps to ensure adequate levels of inventory as we go into the summer peak burn periods. Another example of the strength in our scale and ability to react quickly to emerging risks. Before I close, I once again want to say, hats off to the entire operations team for extraordinary performance in this record quarter. A quarter never before witnessed by many of us who have worked in this industry for many years. Thank you all and with that I will turn it over to Kirk. Kirk Andrews : Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 17. NRG delivered record adjusted EBITDA of $816 million in the first quarter of 2014 or more than doubling our EBITDA performance of a year ago. The bulk of this increase was driven by outstanding results from our wholesales business which generated $639 million in adjusted EBITDA as NRG's expanded east fleet in particular delivered strong operational performance during the extreme cold weather and volatile power prices in the first quarter. Despite the colder weather and the resulting increase in supply costs, our retail businesses also performed well delivering EBITDA of $108 million for the quarter while NRG Yield delivered $69 million. For the quarter, NRG generated nearly $500 million in free cash flow before growth or nearly half of our previous guidance for the entire year. These strong quarterly results lead to increased expectations for 2014 financial performance which I will review in detail further. Our total liquidity after adjusting for the cash used to fund the EME acquisition which closed on April 1 now stands at approximately $3.2 billion. Continuing our focus on prudent balance sheet management, we took advantage of the continued strength in the debt markets and through April successfully executed two senior unsecured notes offerings, totaling $2.1 billion both at a 6.25% rate, a new low for us in terms of unsecured coupon. These financings not only provided the $700 million in cash funding from new corporate debt we have planned for the EME transaction, the remaining proceeds permitted us to fully refinance our 2019 senior notes, reducing annual cash interest by $26 million and further extending corporate maturities in the process. Finally, we have now executed a definitive agreement for the first drop-down of three right of first offer assets to NRG Yield for $349 million. We expect this all cash transaction to close later this quarter augmenting NRG's capital for allocation while helping NRG Yield deliver on its dividend growth objective. The proceeds from NRG Yield's successful issuance of $345 million in new convertible debt will be used to fund the transaction. And with the recent $390 million increase in NRG Yield's revolver to $450 million, NRG Yield now has increased capital flexibility to help fund additional drop-downs for NRG later this year. Turning next to the guidance overview on Slide 18. Following our record first quarter results and taking into account the expected contribution from strategic acquisitions, we are pleased to announce a substantial increase in both our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance for 2014. We now expect 2014 adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. This $500 million increase over our previous guidance is driven in equal parts by the change in outlook for our wholesales business driven primarily as a result of the first quarter out performance and by the expected impact of our recently completed acquisitions. The expected contribution from Edison Mission makes up substantially all of the $250 million expected EBITDA impact from acquisitions as we do not expect any significant contribution from Dominion Retail as we transition the Northeast customer base through the remainder of the year. Beyond 2014, however, we expect the net addition of $500,000 retail customers from the Dominion Retail acquisition which also includes the Cirro franchise in Texas to deliver a run rate of $40 million to $50 million in adjusted EBITDA. I would also like to touch briefly on our expectations for residential solar following the acquisition of the Rooftop Diagnostics Solar platform this past quarter. The RDS acquisition represents an important step in better positioning NRG to benefit from the growing opportunity we see in residential solar. Specifically, RDS provides us expanded sales and installation capabilities which are critical in managing customer acquisition and system installation cost in order to realize the net returns from residential solar leases. As many of you are aware, the infrastructure and near term cost of growing this business do not translate into positive EBITDA in the near term. Rather, the value proposition is realized by growing the portfolio of long-term lease cash flows. As a result, we would expect a modestly negative EBITDA impact as we ramp up our efforts in this area. Which is taken into account in our 2014 revised guidance. Later this year we expect to provide you with additional details regarding our residential solar efforts including cost, expected returns and capital requirements beyond the current year. Finally, turning to NRG Yield. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $292 million is unchanged as we will update guidance to reflect the impact of the drop-down following the expected closing of the transaction later in the second quarter. As a reminder however, any changes to NRG Yield EBITDA guidance resulting from the drop-down will not impact consolidated NRG guidance. Our 2014 free cash flow before growth guidance is also increased by $250 million or more than 20%, driven by our increased expectations for adjusted EBITDA and partially offset by an increase in maintenance and environmental capital expenditures as we begin to deploy the capital necessary to ensure environmental compliance at the Powerton plant acquired as a part of the EME transaction. In addition, cash lease payments associated with the Powerton and Joliet plants also impact free cash flow over the remainder of 2014. Beyond 2014, cash lease payments will fall to less than $1 million per year delivering run rate free cash flow accretion from the EME acquisition. Turning to Slide 19. After taking into account the net cash component of the EME acquisition, NRG's current liquidity is approximately $3.2 billion. Cash used to fund the EME transaction represents approximately $1.5 billion of the $1.725 billion in acquisitions and growth investments shown in the sources and uses table to the right of the slide. In addition, as an update on the cash balances at GenOn, which I reviewed on our fourth quarter call. Driven by the solid first quarter results in the east, GenOn consolidated cash increase by $149 million during the quarter and now stands at just over $900 million. Taking into account the first quarter results, GenOn has now passed the trailing 12-months restricted payments test and is able to make distributions to NRG should we decide to do so. GenOn Mid-Atlantic which at quarter end held $337 million in cash has also passed its restricted payment test and we expect GenOn Mid-Atlantic to make a distribution of $250 million for GenOn this quarter in order to rebalance liquidity across the various GenOn entities. Turning to Slide 20. I am pleased to announce that we have executed a definitive agreement to complete the first drop-down of assets from NRG Yield. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, upon closing which we expect later this quarter, NRG Yield will purchase three ROFO assets for $349 million in cash plus the assumption of approximately $650 million in aggregate project debt. These assets include El Segundo, a 550-megawatt combined cycle plant under a tolling agreement with Southern California Edison with just over nine years remaining on the contract. And the TA High Desert and Kansas South solar facilities of 20-megawatts each, each with 20-year PPAs. The transaction purchase price of $349 million which will be funded by NRG Yield using cash on hand will enhance capital for allocation at NRG and represents approximately 1.6 times the $225 million of net NRG equity invested in these three projects, all of which either came online or were purchased within the last year. In addition, we also expect NRG will receive an additional $15 million in cash for aggregate working capital balance at closing. The purchase price of $349 million combined with debt assumed implies a total transaction value of approximately $1 billion and represents slightly more than ten times adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million. And on a combined basis these projects will add approximately $30 million in annual cash available for distribution helping NRG Yield achieve its dividend growth objectives. Taking into account our revised expectations for NRG's financial performance, we expect our balance sheet metrics will remain in line with targets and do not anticipate the need to allocate any of the proceeds from this transaction towards delevering. The successful process towards completion of the first ever drop-down to NRG Yield represents an important initial step towards realizing the true potential of this important part of NRG's long-term growth. We anticipate announcing additional drop-downs by the end of the third quarter which we expect will likely include some of the EME assets while deferring the dropdown of the remainder of CVSR to 2015. However, at a minimum, we expect to execute additional drop-downs of assets representing at least the remainder of the $55 million in cash available for distribution we originally announced as being earmarked for drop-down over the course of this year. And finally, updating our capital allocation progress on Slide 21. The net proceeds from the first three drop-down assets combined with the $250 million increase in 2014 free cash flow before growth, served to increase expected 2014 cash available for allocation to $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. $268 million of this capital will fund scheduled debt amortization largely at the project level. Approximately $1.45 billion of capital has been allocated towards M&A and growth investments including $840 million of cash towards EME and other acquisitions including Dominion retail. While integration costs now also include expected cost related to EME and Dominion. Finally, taking into account the 12.7 million shares issued in connection with EME, $181 million of capital is allocated to NRG's recently increased common dividend of $0.56 per share on annualized basis. After these allocation items over the course of 2014, NRG has $823 million to $1.023 billion in excess capital remaining. We would expect to revisit any potential increases in return of shareholder capital following the second drop-down transaction which we would expect to take place in the third quarter. And with that I will turn it back to David for his closing remarks. David Crane : Thank you, Kirk. Shannon, I don\u2019t have any closing remarks because we want to make sure we have about 15 minutes for questions. So please if you could open the lines we would be happy to take everyone's questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. You may begin. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Congrats on a great quarter. Following up on all the announcements here, I'd be curious, when you think about future capital deployment opportunities, how do you think about buybacks relative to further acquisitions to enable the DG renewable growth that you've been talking about? And in particular, how did you think about redeploying the cash that you're getting out of the NRG Yield sales of late? David Crane : Well, I am going to turn that to Kirk to answer or not answer the question as he sees fit. But Julien what I would tell you from my perspective is that, to your question, number one, it's actually a pretty good time right now to be a buyer in the market. I mean we see sort of opportunities to create value. I guess someone who did three acquisitions in the first quarter would say this, but we do see opportunities across our space. What I would say though is, to the extent that you know for a long time on the generation side we wanted to have a bigger and better core generation fleet in PJM and that was a big, strategic priority. But what I would say right now is, well, again to the point both on the generation side and on the retail side, where we have all the capabilities we need, we are in all the places where we need to be. And so it's a question of executing with what we have. And so I would say as a general rule, my view towards acquisitions right now is pretty opportunistic. If we can see something at a price that really makes sense, we will add to what we have. But we are really -- we are again at a point where we have a very limited number of gaps that we see to fill in terms of the capabilities we need to have. And even the gaps that we continue to perceive, which I am not going to tell you what they are because we don\u2019t want people to see us coming. The amount of money that it would take us to fill those gaps from outside acquisition is not a huge number compared to the amount of cash that Kirk has amassed over there. So with that sort of set up, let me turn it over to Krik. Kirk Andrews : Well, I don\u2019t have to add very much to that other than the fact that the capital that we amassed as I know you are aware Julien, both with the combination of the actual receipt of the drop-down proceeds as well as our free cash flow generation, tends to be disproportionately loaded towards the backend of the year. Which is why we are kind of deferring addressing the return of capital to shareholders question until we realize the bulk of that free cash flow and drop-down proceeds. And I think depending on how the opportunities that David spoke to play out over the course of the year, as well as where our share prices combined with realizing that capital later in the year, we take all that into consideration in terms of balancing between opportunistic deployment of capital on the M&A side or acquisition side with returning to share repurchases. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Great. And, Dave, just a quick follow up here. As you think about power, I just heard your comments about COMED. Where do you remain the most constructive on power upside, if you will? David Crane : Julien, I don\u2019t want to give a wrong -- could you say the question -- where are we most constructive on the... Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Yes. I suppose we have heard some comments from Exelon amongst others, saying we see x amount of upside in the market, etcetera. I suppose are you still as constructive on Texas or you're shifting towards PJM? And where do you see the most amount of upside or do you continue to see upside in power market? David Crane : Well, you know everything -- it's like going to a movie Julien. Everything sort of relative to your perception is going in. I mean we went to great pains when we bought the Edison Mission portfolio to say, don\u2019t confuse this with us being bullish on the situation in the Midwest on the wholesale side. But as Mauricio said in his comments, there are signs of life in the COMED market. But I have to tell you, if you are just looking across our portfolio, clearly the east has been a pleasant surprise for us since the GenOn acquisition. But in terms of just basic fundamentals that you can sort of look at and reach out and feel and touch, we remain bullish on Texas. I mean the demand growth in Texas on a weather-adjusted basis was enormous. While it was 3% -- I mean 11% in non-weather adjusted, 3% weather adjusted. You know announcements like -- I was out in California last week on the day that Toyota announced that they were moving 5000 - you know they had 5000 people employed in North America and they are picking up shop, closing shop in California and moving to Texas, so if you look at fundamentals I would say that the part of the country we are most bullish on remains Texas. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Cohen of ISI Group. You may begin. Jon Cohen - ISI Group : Congratulations, guys. I don't see how that quarter could have gone any better for you guys. David Crane : Okay. Thank you for your question, Jon. Jon Cohen - ISI Group : I guess the first question maybe is for Mauricio. We've seen in the past couple of weeks or the last week particularly, a pretty huge move in the forward power markets. I was wondering if you had any color on what's going on there exactly? How much of this is real fundamental buying, how much of it is maybe some other technical factors? Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Jon. So I think I referred to it on my script but the move in power is actually, I would say there are two points. The first one is on the back of natural gas. And as you have seen natural gas has gone through a pretty significant rally and given the storage levels where we are, we think that if we get some early heat, we will see probably another leg off on natural gas. So that\u2019s the first driver of power prices. And as you can appreciate that has helped significantly dark spread or base load generators like us. The second one which is probably a little bit more recent is an expansion in heat rates. And we saw that right after the CSAPR announcement. So I think markets are realizing that there may be more scarcity and better fundamentals shorter than what they believed in the past. But that clearly benefits some of the spark spread price. Those are two very discrete, I guess drivers that we have seen in the power space. With respect to liquidity, I will tell you that liquidity is probably the worse I have seen in many, many years. The balance of 2014 remains probably the best market and I think the prices, the market prices reflect to some extent decent volume. But beyond 2014 I would caution about the pricing that we are seeing because I think they are affected by liquidity. Jon Cohen - ISI Group : Okay. So, you're saying we've seen a big move but on pretty poor volumes in the out years. Mauricio Gutierrez : In the out years, yes, but in the front years I think the volume has been relatively decent. Having said that, the move that you have seen are supported by the fundamentals. Jon Cohen - ISI Group : Okay, great. And then one other question on the distributed generation strategy. I was wondering if you had any, David, internal milestones or goals about how quickly you want to grow that business. I think on the last call I think you said it would be two years before you had cobbled together enough of a portfolio to drop into NRG Yield. Since then you've announced a few acquisitions. I wonder if maybe the timing of that has accelerated. So, what should we be looking for in terms of how you're executing there? David Crane : Well, Jon, one, I don\u2019t want to be totally specific but the second thing is -- well, let me just tell you the way we are thinking about it. And some of this is anticipatory in terms of where we see the price going you know in terms of the expansion to the, sort of legendary price competitive with the retail price electricity in 20 to 25 states. The way I sort of think about it, by the end of this year we want to be in a position to compete in all the states where it makes sense for people to put residential solar on the roof. With all the tools that we need to sort of create value and bring the value to us. I mean one of the problems in the residential solar space for the last few years is, there is always some place in the value chain where value is being created but it's usually being created somewhere else. So for a while it was the installers that were sort of capturing the benefit of solar module prices dropping like a stone and all that. And so we wanted a platform where the value that exists in the value chain sort of comes to us not to somebody else that we than enable. So we want to have our capabilities in place, totally in place in all the markets we want to be in by the end of the year. And then in 2015 we want to execute and we want to be a market leader. And whatever lead in the market is and in the industry that\u2019s facing exponential growth, I would rather not put a number on it other than to say, if you think of at least 2 million American homes that economically should have solar on their roof by 2015 and the current market leader Solar City is doing 30,000 a year, I don\u2019t need to take business away from Solar City to see that there is a market opportunity that\u2019s just almost infinite in its potential. Jon Cohen - ISI Group : Right. Are there any capabilities that you think you're still lacking or are all of the pieces in place now? David Crane : There is one or two. Thank you for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley : Good morning and congratulations. I wanted to talk about capacity prices in general and talk about your EME assets. I know you're going to come back with a more specific plan but we had, I guess, it's fair to say, fairly disappointing pricing last year. Would you need to see materially better capacity prices for the entire fleet at EME to be economically viable or do you think, given where we've seen recent trends, that they would be viable? Do we need to really see an uplift there to see the entire fleet viable? David Crane : Hey, Stephen, Chris Moser is going to answer that. Chris Moser : Hey, Stephen, it's Chris. First things first, I think PJM is moving a lot of levers to try and make sure that we see good prices out there. I mean FERC has accepted hard caps on DR. They have accepted the capacity import limits there. I know that there is still a couple of things pending in terms of the operability and changes to the incremental auctions. Last year at $59 out there in RTO, and that was on the low end of things, obviously we are hoping for better numbers than that. But keep in mind there is both energy and capacity as well. So it's the combination of those two. And we would like it obviously to hit good numbers in both of those. And a lot of the forecasts out there now have the capacity moving up against that 59 mark from the 16, 17 auction. And we are certainly hopeful that it does. But don\u2019t forget the wind in the sails back there is as David said, selling coal at natural gas prices and as gas continues to move up then that\u2019s going to help those assets as well. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley : I see. So, the improved energy margin helps in that equation as well. As a follow up, just on your chart on page 14, looking at the PJM auction. I was curious about one of the remarks you made about new generation facing challenging economics, especially given the improvement in forward margins that we've seen. Could you expand on that a little bit? Chris Moser : I think on the challenging economics side I think we struggle with seeing some of the newbuild costs relative to I think where we expect to see them or where we look at when we are trying to do are looking at projects ourselves and I think that\u2019s what that references to. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley : Okay. So, as you see the capital costs even with the improvement in energy margins, you struggle to see how the newbuild can make sense potentially. David Crane : Yes, I mean Steven, I got to tell you, it doesn\u2019t matter what market you are in, even in Texas. I mean we are acquiring assets at deep discount to replacement costs. And so as prices get better we obviously have an opportunity to earn back the money we put in but we are not seeing things approach, pricing approach new entrant pricing. So how people are doing Greenfield in the merchant market, it's baffling to us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs : Can you review the changes in strategy of what assets you're going to drop down into NYLD in 3Q? I know originally it was CVSR but it sounds like it might be some of the Mission assets now. And I don't know if you can answer this question from NRG's perspective, but in your view will NYLD require equity to fund that next round of drop-downs? Kirk Andrews : Well, in terms of the assets as I mentioned in my remarks, yes. Having now closed the EME transaction we expect the next phase of drop-down to include some EME assets and defer CVSR to 2015. I think it's safe to say if we have a bias within that portfolio, we would lean towards the shorter duration assets within that portfolio as being kind of the first in the queue if you will among the EME portfolio for drop-down. As far as equity issuance is concerned, certainly having basically used the proceeds from this first drop-down, additional drop-downs will require obviously additional capital at NRG Yield. We have the ability to some extent to bridge that capital using the expanded revolver I spoke to but ultimately the anticipation is, I think it's likely we will probably see an equity issuance kind of in the back half of the year. But we will revisit that in greater detail as circumstances unfold. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs : Very helpful. And then on coal, Mauricio, you talked about how you were able to address some of the rail disruptions to ensure adequate supply in 2014. Can you talk about how you did that? And then PRB prices seem to be ticking up here as you look at the forward curve, particularly 2015. So how does that impact the way you think about contracting? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, well, you know PRB in shorter term has been oscillating close the marginal cost of production. Historically there's been a [contango] (ph), though that has been tempered over the past 12-months. So as gas prices go up and certainly the announcement of CSAPR, you know lower sulfur coal becomes more desirable for generators. We are evaluating our hedge profile. As I said, we wanted to take care of 2014 given the increase in gas prices. We are now in the process of assessing 15 and beyond. We like the position that we are in. We have constructive gas fundamentals I already explained. So at the end of the day we are more concerned about the dark spread and less concerned about the absolute price of each of the commodities. With respect to the railroad I think it is fair to say that we have, given the size and the scale of our portfolio, we were able to identify these potential risks in terms of deliveries. Regarding front of it, we have very constructive dialog with the railroads and we were able to bring our units at inventory levels that we feel are adequate as we go into the summer. I mean I cannot give you any more specifics. We have in the past disclosed inventory levels on a unit by unit basis and we are not going to do that given the competitive nature of it. But I think it's fair to say that we feel comfortable as we approaching the summer months. David Crane : Shannon, we have a shareholders meeting in about 5 minutes, so I think we will take two more calls. Operator : Our next question is from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. You may begin. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Congrats on the good quarter. My question is directed towards Mauricio. You kind of talked about how maybe NYHUB heat rates moving up have a fundamental reason to them and there could be something changing with the load around that area. Could you maybe talk about what's changing that could maybe make you more bullish on the Midwest market? Mauricio Gutierrez : Look, I think it's more on the generation side than the load. The load hasn\u2019t been particularly impressive in the Midwest and to the extent in the Northeast. We think that given some of the economic challenges and the higher penetration of wind and negative pricing, we believe that there is probably -- we are entering a transition period where additional retirements from base load resources that can cycle will happen particularly on units that are marginal, small with high fixed costs with little flexibility. So I think the market is starting to recognize that and you can clearly see it on the heat rate expansion. And I put the chart on the historical pricing and the forward pricing on COMED and I think it clearly has a awkward momentum to it. Now keep in mind the other one is, as I already said a couple of times, natural gas is right behind the price of power sold. So that perhaps is also something to look at. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: When you talk about these units are you speaking more about nuclear, coal or what type of generation? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, all of the above. I think coal and nuclear. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Is there an update on any kind of the repowering opportunities in California? David Crane : Well, we remain optimistic but there is not really any specific update. But certainly I would hope to have one by the next quarterly call. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Trahan. You may begin. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan : Just, first curious if there's any update on the Maryland environmental rules going into the auction. David Crane : Do you want to answer that? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Good morning, Steve. What I can tell you is that we have a had a very constructive dialog with MDE. We are taking that into consideration with the plans that we have around our Maryland units and I think that\u2019s pretty much about as much as we can say around the state of the Maryland units. But I can assure you that it's been a very positive dialog between the two of us as of late. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan : Okay. So, you have more clarity you think on the future for those two units at least? David Crane : Well, I think in relative terms we have more clarity, we don\u2019t have absolute clarity. So I think that\u2019s really all we can say right now, Steve. But since we didn\u2019t really answer your question, why don\u2019t you take (indiscernible)? Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan : Yes. The other question is just -- you mentioned that we have the revival of CSAPR in some form and we're going to get these EPA THG proposed rules soon. When you think about the context of NRG overall in light of some of these new environmental rules, could you just maybe, again, give us your messaging on how you think about your company in context of kind of refocus on environmental rules? David Crane : Well, I am not sure if this answers the question but I mean we are, in terms of the conventional system and the generation assets, I think we have to keep in mind that the average age of an NRG coal plant is 41 years old. So when we think of the long-term strategy of the company, it's not built around 41 year old assets but those 41 year old assets are very critical to the short to medium term and to keeping the lights on this year and next year. So I mean our environmental strategy is geared towards the amount of time that we expect the assets to continue to perform their functions. So with expect to the specific rules, we think we have a good -- you know we are not spending and insubstantial amount of money. And so we are complying with the various environmental laws that seemingly come and go. But we are also not investing in stuff thinking that these plants are going to be there 40 years from now. So guess I am not sure if there is something more specific about that that you would like me to focus on. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan : You know I was thinking more in terms of the breadth of portfolio of assets that you have and your non-power. Net-net, do you think, obviously we don't know the details of how CSAPR will be implemented or how THG rules might be implemented. But do you think overall your portfolio benefits net from these rules or gets hurt by it? David Crane : Well, I mean since we are in pretty good compliance position with the new rules, to be Machiavellian about it, the new rules drive other peoples plans out of the market than that will be beneficial to us. What I would say is one of the big lessons for us and hopefully for the public policy makers and I try to make this point in the context of Illinois is that, we have always made a virtue of being multi-fuel. The conventional system is clearly trending to an all gas all the time system. And the gas, now it's simply not prepared for that to happen. And so to us there is tremendous value in not only having gas plants but having coal plants continue and nuclear and even our oil plants. I mean we ran our oil plants more this last winter than I think in the last several years cumulative. And so the first and foremost, no matter how much we focus on sustainability and being green and all, the focus of a power company is always on keeping the lights on. And to me having a multi-fuel fleet of generation is the way to do that. So we certainly are going to try and do that but you can't keep plants open if they are just losing money, hand over fist. And you don\u2019t want to invest hundreds and millions of dollars in an asset that has left couple of years of life. And so that\u2019s the reality that we juggle everyday at this company. And I think every other power company does as well. Anyway, I am sorry but I think we got to go. We are a few minutes late for our shareholders meeting. So thank you all very much and if there are any questions that we could not answer, my friend Chad here is sitting next to me, he would be happy to answer to questions at length. So thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Chad Plotkin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chad Plotkin : Thank you, Ben. Good morning, and welcome to NRG's second quarter 2014 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located on the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. [Operator Instructions] As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor statement provided in today's presentation, as well as the risk factors contained in our SEC filings.

With that, I'll turn the call over to David Crane, our President and Chief Executive Officer. David W. Crane: Thank you, Chad, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm joined here by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer; and Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. They will both be giving part to the presentation as usual. I'm also joined by Chris Moser, who runs Commercial Operations for the company; and Elizabeth Killinger, who's responsible for our Retail business for all of our brands, and both of them will be available to answer any questions that you might have. I'd like to start on Slide 3 by giving a quick -- my quick take on our second quarter performance. I'm going to be quick about it because both Kirk and Mauricio will be discussing these results in more detail, but also because I want to spend a little more of my allotted time than usual on the strategic positioning of NRG going forward. I'm choosing this opportunity to talk about strategy because some of our most recent developments in our business provide a good context for how we think about the plentiful value-creating growth opportunities that we see in front of us and what is sometimes loosely called the alternative energy sector at a time when we see weakening long-term fundamentals in our traditional, conventional generation grid-based business. But first, let me start by focusing on our performance year-to-date. Never before in my 11 years at NRG do I recall a first half of the year where we were so whipsawed by the weather. A severely cold winter followed by a summer, which, to date, through the second quarter and so far into the third quarter, has been completely devoid of extreme weather in any of our core markets. Fortunately, to some degree, our diversification away from being exclusively a wholesale generator, first, into retail and then into clean energy, has increased the resilience of our earnings in the face of mild weather and tepid wholesale electricity demand. Under these circumstances, I am very pleased with the $671 million of adjusted EBITDA that we are reporting for the second quarter and the $1.487 billion of EBITDA year-to-date. As this summer has so far failed to materialize in the forward commodity prices affecting our wholesale generation business have weakened, NRG share price in recent weeks has dropped 20%, reflecting the continued strong correlation between NRG share price and natural gas prices. At the same time that NRG's stock prices dropped under the pressure of weakening commodity prices, NRG Yield has stood strong with the share price well more than 100% above the price that it IPO-ed at just 12 months ago. As NRG stock has dropped, NRG Yield, in just the past 2 weeks, has gone to market with 2 vastly oversubscribed capital market issues, a 10-year green bond that priced at 5 3/8% and upsize due to market demand and a secondary equity issue that priced at $54 a share, even though the stock had closed at under $52 a share at the beginning of the day of announcement. NRG Yield, of course, consists of contracted and regulated assets not subject to commodity price risk. But for this purpose, what interests me is that many of the assets of NRG Yield had existed within NRG for many years. Before Yield, the value of our contracted assets has never been recognized by the Street as they were buried under the weight of close to 50,000 megawatts of wholesale generation assets that were subject to merchant price exposure. Now as we look at the exciting opportunities that present themselves to us outside of the merchant generation space, we are intent on taking the first step to duplicating the success of NRG Yield with the other high-growth segments of our business. If you would turn to Slide 4, you will see how we are thinking about NRG and our businesses going forward with, from the shareholder's perspective, as many as 6 distinct value propositions, each with exciting growth opportunities of its own, each with a focused management team dedicated to win in its own competitive environment and each, ultimately and down the road a bit, a candidate for value recognition on Wall Street in the same manner as NRG Yield. We call this new structure the NRG Group of Companies, and in shorthand, the 3 plus 2 plus 1 structure, to reflect the fact that we are organizing into 3 main businesses called NRG Business, NRG Home and NRG Renew, which are differentiated from each other principally by the nature of the energy consumer that they each serve. The way energy is procured at the office is obviously quite different from the way it is procured at the home. The 2 and the 3 plus 2 plus 1 represents the 2 special purpose companies, Petra Nova and eVgo, that have very distinct businesses, capital structures and technological bases, but also have symbiotic connections to our 3 core businesses. In the case of Petra Nova, through turning our coal plants' greatest liability, their carbon emissions, into a highly profitable revenue-generating asset, and in the case of eVgo, by creating a legion of forward-leaning, clean transportation enthusiasts into end-use energy consumers aware of, and hopefully, loyal to NRG. The 1 and the 3 plus 2 plus 1, obviously, is NRG Yield, which already has its distinct identity and value proposition on Wall Street. NRG Yield going forward is a critical member of the group in enabling and enhancing the value of all the 5 companies by providing a highly competitive source of capital for their contracted assets. Today, that means NRG Yield acquires from NRG contracted, combined cycle assets, opportunities in our new structure, which will arise through NRG Business, and also utility scale renewable projects, opportunities in the new structure that would arise through NRG Renew. But as we go forward, we expect to offer NRG Yield an even broader range of assets benefiting from long-term contracts and arising, not only out of NRG Business and NRG Renew, but also possibly out of NRG Home or even NRG Petra Nova. This, of course, would be in addition to NRG Yield having continued success in its own third-party acquisitions, which has the advantage of providing enhanced cash distributions back to NRG. There is more about this new structure that can be illustrated on this Slide 4 or installed in the time I have available, so I'm going to concentrate my remaining time today with a brief explanation of NRG Home and NRG Petra Nova. As to the other 4 companies and the full rationale behind the totality of this reorganization, we will lay that out for you in considerable detail over the coming months. Let's start with NRG Home on Slide 5. At NRG, our Retail businesses have been working for some time to differentiate themselves, first, through offering renewable energy at Green Mountain, through offering affinity programs at NRG Plus. And most recently, our focus has been on becoming a key player inside the smart interconnected home of the future. And with the formation of NRG Home, we aim to focus on this objective all that much harder. NRG Home, in short, is going to combine under one roof the almost 3 million retail customers currently served through all of NRG's retail brand, with our much smaller but fast-growing residential solar company, NRG Home Solar, in order to realize the obvious synergistic benefits that each can bring to the other and to capture the sustained double-digit growth that we believe will be realized by the top tier companies in the residential solar space, as the American public increasingly embraces the idea that they can make a difference in the race to the clean energy economy with their individual energy decision-making. Even though as depicted by the name, the initial focus of NRG Home will be on bringing seamless energy solutions, both systemwide solutions and distributed solutions, into the stationary environment of the home. NRG Home will also be focused, as Reliant already has begun to do, on bringing mobile and clean energy solutions to the end-use energy consumer with the ultimate goal for us being wherever you are, whatever you are doing, for however how long you are doing it. And without regard to whether you are able to tether yourself to an electric outlet through an electric cord, we want to be your energy supplier. You should expect to hear a lot more about this aspect of NRG Home in the weeks and months to come. Now turning to Slide 6 and shifting gears, let me turn your attention from the end-use energy consumer end of our growth opportunity spectrum back to the other end of the spectrum, wholesale generation, and specifically, the future of big, solid fuel-fired power station that represent the backbone of both NRG and of the status quo grid-centric hub-and-spoke power system that Americans have relied on since the 1930s. When it comes to conventional utility scale generation, a lot of the trends are not good. Since electricity remains the only commodity that cannot be stored, wholesale generation is, at its core, a primitively basic business completely ruled by supply and demand fundamentals. Rebecca Smith recently reported a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal about the rupturing of the historic correlation in the United States between GDP growth and electricity demand growth, quoting the CEO of AEP as referring to this as the lost decade of electricity demand growth. Her article focuses on the fact that the utility business model is under strain because it is entirely dependent on more or less continuous demand growth in order to cover the ever-rising cost of operating and maintaining the grid. What her article did not mention, but is obviously also true, is that while the long-term supply-demand wholesale fundamentals and trends paint a bleak picture for vertically integrated utilities, the same future is bleaker still for the purer wholesale IPPs, which face the same weak fundamentals but lack the iron dome of rate-based regulation protection that covers the investor-owned utilities. On top of the challenge of weak long-term supply-demand trends, there is the particular challenge to coal plants raised by potential environmental regulation. While it is early days yet in the promulgation of greenhouse gas regulations by the EPA from stationary sources, the long-term trend towards a carbon-constrained world is clear. And to state the obvious, that trend is commonly perceived as not being good for coal plants, and to be equally obvious, at NRG, we own a lot of coal plants. However, if we can turn carbon emissions from a long-term liability into a high-margin, free cash flow generative, commodity risk-mitigating, long-term assets, then we will have accomplished quite a bit in terms of enhancing the longevity and the value of our coal-fired fleet. This is exactly why we are investing $300 million of NRG cash and in-kind equity in the WA Parish carbon capture to enhance oil recovery project. The Parish project, first and foremost, is a carbon monetization play. In this case, we monetize through oil. Our economic return will be a function of the increased productivity of the carbon-flooded field times the realizable price of the oil produced. NRG, which currently has minimal commodity price exposure to crude oil, gets paid through the oil sales with the current forward price curve, providing sufficient cushion against an oil price downdraft, as depicted in the bottom right of this Slide 6. The secondary benefit of the Parish project, obviously, is that it is a highly effective carbon hedge and the way we think about that is shown on the upper right portion of Slide 6. If and when a carbon price is imposed, the impact on Parish will be to reduce the oil price necessary for NRG to earn its minimally acceptable equity return on the project. But in light of the problems and costs -- turn to Slide 7. In light of the problems and cost overruns at other carbon capture projects, we are being asked, what about the risk? The key features of the Petra Nova project, as depicted on Slide 7, that distinguish it from the 2 other high-profile CCS projects built in recent years in Indiana and Mississippi is that the Parish project involves more established post-combustion carbon capture technology rather than precombustion IGCC technology. And the Parish project makes no attempt to alter the steam balance of the existing coal plant to provide energy for the carbon separation process. Instead, at Parish, steam for the process will be provided by a dedicated gas-fired steam generator. And that is why Parish is actually a gas-to-oil price arbitrage play rather than a coal-to-oil project. Finally, what distinguishes Parish from the projects in Indiana and Mississippi, which were both built by rate-based utilities, is that Parish is structured on classic project finance terms, with the various risks of the project warned by the partner best able to mitigate them. The technology and EPC risk of the project, in particular, is borne by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries under a fixed price, fixed schedule guaranteed performance contract. We have a very high degree of confidence in MHI and their technology, which underpins our investment in this project. In short, our Wholesale and our EPC group are very focused on making the Parish project a success, not only because it represents a sizable investment for NRG, but also because harnessing the potential of this technology is likely to be the key to the long-term longevity of our coal plants in a world where electric demand is tepid and carbon constraints, in the form of carbon pricing, are an ever-growing risk. So let me conclude my part of the presentation on Slide 8 with a few bullet points. First, our core businesses have executed superbly in the first half of the year, with solid first half financial results to show for effort. But in this, the commodity end of our business, we remain subject to the vicissitudes of the weather. Second, as we have said repeatedly over the past few years, ever since the Great Recession in fact, we see the potential for value creation in our space swinging from the wholesale side to serving the end-use energy customer, and today, NRG is taking the next big step in organizing ourselves in a manner that gives us the best chance to capture that opportunity to the maximum of our potential. Third, our sector, which is already modestly carbon constrained on the regional level, is certain -- eventually to become more carbon-constrained, and we are taking affirmative steps now not only to prepare for it, but to profit from it. And fourth, and while I did not have the time to discuss this in my comments today, the leading corporations of our time, like Unilever, all have made major commitments to sustainable behavior, including mass adoption of clean energy, and NRG is very well positioned to assist these companies in achieving their global sustainability goals. And fifth and finally, we applaud the success of NRG Yield, which continues to serve as a critical cost of capital competitive advantage for the NRG Group, and we will continue to act to ensure that NRG Yield remains the premium company in the emerging class of publicly traded yield vehicles. The future indeed is bright for NRG. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we were focused in executing our spring outage plan, a significant endeavor now that we have over 50,000 megawatts in operation, and particularly important given the hard rounds we had this past winter. We were busy integrating the Edison Mission plants into our operations. And finally, we were focused on evaluating operational improvements in our Midwest generational fleet. All of this was done while maintaining an excellent safety record well within the top decile of our industry, an accomplishment that makes us all very proud at NRG. As David pointed out, mild weather so far this summer has affected spot and forward curves, but I am pleased to say that we fared well during the second quarter. We continue to monitor and assess the prospects for the balance of the summer, but I take some comfort in the fact that our commercial team took advantage of the opportunity provided by the market after the polar vortex to increase significantly our hedges in 2015 and 2016 at prices above the current market. Finally, we continue to execute on our fleet-wide revitalization program, and most importantly, as we promised you during our last earnings call, our plants around the Edison Mission portfolio. Today, we are announcing a comprehensive operational improvement and environmental compliance plan for the Midwest Generational plants. We're doing this after only 4 months of ownership and are confident that we're putting the pieces in place for a long successful ownership. Turning to Slide 11. As you may recall, in June of last year, as part of the outcome of our operational improvement plan around GenOn acquisition, we embarked on an effort to economically optimize certain of our older facilities by converting them to different fields, with a purpose to reduce costs, comply with the new environmental regulations and respond to pricing as provided by the market. As such, I want to provide you an update on this important strategic initiative. Previously, we announced the field conversions at Avon Lake and New Castle and the reliability contract for Dunkirk. We're now moving forward with 2 additional field conversions at Portland and Shawville, one to oil and the other to gas. These units will provide needed capacity and fuel diversity to the PJM system, as well as demonstrating during the winter months. In addition, we have executed a 10-year agreement with National Grid to repower the Dunkirk station with natural gas. Moving to Slide 12. We are announcing today our optimization and enhancement plan for the Midwest Generation portfolio. This plan takes into consideration the prevailing market conditions, environmental regulations and the impact on our communities and our employees. As a result of the actions we're taking today and the $545 million that we're investing, this plan will significantly reduce our environmental footprint by lowering emissions for carbon dioxide by 60% and for SO2 and NOX by 90% and 65%, respectively. All these while expanding fuel diversity in the region. You can see the details of the plan on the left side of the slide. Powerton and Waukegan will remain on call, with upgrades to the back-end controls, specifically dry sorbent injection or DSI to control SO2 and enhancements on the electrostatic precipitator to improve particulate collection to enable us to comply with the more stringent air regulations under MATS and CPS. Joliet will be converted to natural gas, with an expected online date of 2016. Finally, and after careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to retire Will County Unit 3 by April 2015, and we plan to keep the second unit in operation as long as we can comply with all applicable environmental requirements. The closure of Will County is a difficult decision for us, but the economics simply do not work in the current price environment, given the back-end capital investment that would be required. We will do everything we can, as we have done in the past, to make open positions around the company available to the dedicated employees at Will County, and Midwest Gen will be affected by this decisions. This plant is consistent with our core strategy of streamlining costs, repowering or closing marginal facilities given the current market environment, maintaining or expanding fuel and geographic diversity in our portfolio, reducing the environmental footprint and extending the life of existing assets that otherwise would have shut down due to more stringent environmental regulations. Importantly, and as you can see on the right side of the page, this plant and the investments required to implement will be completed with an attractive economic profile, driven by optimizing the cost structure of the remaining coal plants, driving out fixed costs through fuel conversions and by taking advantage of improved market fundamentals. We believe our investment will be completed at a very low multiple, driving significant accretion to you, our shareholders. Turning to operational performance on Slide 13. We had another quarter of strong safety results with 113 out of 126 facilities without a recordable injury, ending the quarter well within top decile performance, a significant accomplishment given the fact that we executed 171 planned outages and 614 maintenance outages so far this year. Generation for the quarter was down slightly from last year, driven primarily by a combination of planned and unplanned outages, including an extension on the refueling outage of South Texas Project Unit 1, but we had to do additional work in the stator at the main generator. The unit returned back to service in time for summer operation and has been running well. Unit 2 has also been running well, with 99.5% availability factor for the year. With the size of our fleet, it is easy to overlook great performances by individual plants. On this note, I want to take a moment to recognize the entire team at Limestone for the recent run at Unit 1, which lasted 340 consecutive days. Congratulations on a great accomplishment. As we have mentioned before, given current market conditions, we have increased our number of maintenance outages during low price periods to ensure we are available when it matters the most. This, of course, has an impact on our availability metrics, but we have been able to improve on our reliability performance during those periods, as you can see on the bottom left chart. Our gas fleet continues to perform exceedingly well with over 97% starting reliability for the year and 950 more starts compared to last year. Moving on to Slide 14. Our Retail business delivered a solid second quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $173 million, $33 million higher than last year. We delivered another quarter with robust customer growth, demonstrating the continued momentum we have in attracting and retaining customers. In addition, we were able to maintain retail margins with operations and maintenance cost per customer for the quarter down over 13% year-over-year, demonstrating results from operational improvement efforts and the scalability of our Retail platform. On a regional basis, we grew customer count in Texas by 16,000 customers for the quarter as a result of effective execution and expansion of innovative products and services, where we have observed retention rates improving by up to 25% for the customers enrolled in these products. Total volumes compared to last year were relatively flat, with the mass volumes up 26% quarter-over-quarter due to the Dominion acquisition and the C&I down by 15% due to continued discipline and commitment to profitability. In the Northeast, we grew customers by 19,000 organically for the quarter, in addition to the Dominion customer growth. Overall, the integration of Dominion's retail energy business is going well and we're seeing better-than-expected earnings and customer retention. Now turning to Slide 15, and starting with ERCOT. The second quarter was 8% cooler than the 10-year average, and so far this summer, we have not seen a single day above 100 degrees in Houston. In our power markets, it is not unusual to see an overreaction in the forwards to what is happening in the spot markets, and we believe that is the case in ERCOT, where mild weather has impacted both spot and forward prices. As you can see in the upper left chart, forward pricings are well below new build economics and do not reflect the near-term fundamentals in the market. We show spark spreads, both historical and forwards, plotted against the number of days above 98 degrees in Houston as a proxy for hot weather. Only 1 year in this chart supported new build economics. Difficult to rationalize in a market where historical net operating reserve margins have been in the single digits and forward reserve margins are at or below targets. This summer, we have the implementation of the operating reserve demand curve, designed to improve price formation during scarcity events. So far, a major disappointment to the market where the ORDC price adder has averaged less than $0.10 per megawatt hour across all hours through July. As we said on previous occasions, we support any structural changes that improve price formation in the market, but it is clear to us that ORDC is a scarcity price formation mechanism and not a resource adequacy solution. The weather forecast for next week looks better as temperatures will move into a normal range, pushing 100 degrees in several Texas cities. We believe there is plenty of time still for ORDC to be of some value this summer. As I said, the near-term fundamentals in ERCOT remains strong, as you can see in the lower chart, with reserve margins hovering around the current target reserve margin. This, in part, due to the new generation brought online this summer, which we believe was, in large part, from the hope for a potential capacity market and the expiration of the production tax spreads for wind. The natural question is, what could potentially change this perceived stable outlook? First, is the decreasing likelihood of new projects moving forward given the current and historical prices, as well as the lack of any headway on resource adequacy; second, is the increasing possibility of additional retirements, given the lack of scarcity pricing; and finally, increased probability that low growth saw prices to the upside, especially compared to what, from our perspective, looks like a low official forecast. Now moving to PJM. The results of the capacity auction was somewhat dated now, where a key component of the asset optimization plan that I discussed previously. We saw strong prices driven in large part by a decrease in imports and demand response, disciplined portfolio bidding and unit retirements offset somewhat by new gas generation. Given these capacity results, the spark spreads required to incentivize new builds are getting close to current market, and in some cases, were achieved briefly after the polar vortex. We believe the market is providing the right price signals, given the amount of generation that it needed to replace marginal coal units, and we applaud PJM for letting the market work. We remain constructive that PJM market and forward prices support our plans for the Midwest Generation fleet. Turning to our commercial update on Slide 16. We took advantage of the rally in power and gas prices resulting from the cold weather -- winter and increased our power hedges during the quarter by 33% and 15% for 2015 and 2016, bringing our total hedge levels to 84% and 40%, respectively. With respect to coal, we felt it was prudent to rebalance our coal hedges to match our power position and lock in large spreads for our plants. Coal inventory levels remain adequate for the summer, with rate performance showing some improvement. Some brief comments on the PJM '17, '18 capacity auction. There were some speculation about the number of megawatts that we clear in the auction. While in the past we have not provided specific numbers, I wanted to provide you some assurance that the results were a net positive for NRG and that we clear virtually all megawatts that we offer into the auction. As we move through the summer, all of us at NRG stand ready to take advantage of any summer weather and its corresponding market opportunity. We're moving to execute on the plan that we laid out for you around the Midwest Generation fleet and will continue to manage our commodity exposure, given current market conditions for 2015. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk. Kirkland B. Andrews: Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 18, NRG is reporting second quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA of $671 million, including $389 million from Wholesale, $173 million from Retail and $109 million from NRG Yield. Through the first half of the year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.487 billion, approximately $1 billion from Wholesale, $281 million from Retail and $201 million from NRG Yield. Turning to highlights. At the second quarter end, we successfully completed the first drop-down transaction with NRG Yield for the first 3 ROFO assets previously announced in the first quarter. This transaction resulted in $357 million in cash consideration, increasing capital available at the NRG level. NRG now intends to offer this quarter a second set of additional assets to NRG Yield, representing approximately $120 million in adjusted EBITDA and $35 million in annual cash available for distribution, or CAFD, allowing us to target closing the transaction and the resulting NRG capital replenishment by the end of this year. Over the past 2 weeks, NRG Yield successfully priced and closed its first-ever equity follow-on offering in an inaugural green bond offering resulting in approximately $1.1 billion in total net proceeds, not only fully funding the cash needs for the upcoming close of the Alta Wind transaction, but providing a significant capital surplus at NRG Yield, which can be used to fund future drop-downs. Finally, as Mauricio reviewed earlier, we have now completed our review of capital expenditures for the 4 Midwest Generation assets and plan to spend approximately $545 million in total to ensure not only environmental compliance, but efficient operations and long-term financial performance at these facilities. Approximately $130 million of the total capital spend from Midwest Gen will take place in 2014 and is already reflected in environmental CapEx in our free cash flow before growth investments guidance. Turning to guidance on Slide 19. We are maintaining our guidance ranges for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for 2014. However, absent above-average weather over the balance of the summer or colder weather later in the year, we expect our actual financial results for 2014 would be towards the lower end of these ranges. While our guidance range for Retail remains unchanged, we've made equal and offsetting changes to both Wholesale and NRG Yield guidance to reflect the impact of the successful completion of our first ROFO drop-down on June 30. Specifically, we're reducing the Wholesale component of guidance by $100 million with a corresponding increase to NRG Yield guidance. This shift in EBITDA is based on GAAP accounting requirements and reflects the full year contribution of the 3 ROFO assets to NRG Yield's financial results. We will follow this approach, which merely reflects the accounting impact to both historical results as well as guidance for each drop-down, regardless of when these transactions might close within a given year. Our EBITDA and free cash flow guidance also reflect the expected impact of our growing residential solar business. In total, the residential solar component of 2014 EBITDA contained within the Wholesale guidance is approximately $40 million in negative EBITDA. As I mentioned on our first quarter call, the residential solar business does not lend itself to traditional financial metrics such as EBITDA, which, largely, in that business, consist of customer acquisition and overhead expenses incurred in driving robust lease revenue growth in future periods, while current revenue is a function of leases previously placed in service. As the business grows and matures, we expect the positive cash flow from leases augmented by cross-selling benefits from the NRG Home platform will outpace expenses to deliver positive cash flow to NRG. We will be providing additional detail in the coming months on how we see this business adding to shareholder value, including our expectations for lease volume growth, plans for monetizing future cash flows to realize cash benefits on a more immediate basis, cross-selling opportunities, capital cost and net value to NRG. Turning next to the liquidity update on Slide 20. NRG's total liquidity on a consolidated basis stands at approximately $3 billion as of June 30, 2014, prior to the impact of the excess proceeds from the NRG Yield equity and debt offerings following the quarter end, which we expect to contribute an additional $188 million to overall liquidity. During the second quarter, we continued our efforts to extend NRG unsecured debt maturities, while taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce overall interest cost on an opportunistic basis. NRG's issuance of $1 billion of 10-year senior notes permitted us to redeem approximately $780 million of our 2019 senior notes via tender offer during the past quarter, and we have subsequently issued a call notice to redeem the remaining $225 million of the 2019 notes. In addition to more than doubling the maturity versus the notes redeemed, this refinancing transaction will result in additional interest savings of $16 million annually, which, when combined with our successful refinancing of $400 million in the first quarter, represents approximately $25 million in total annual interest savings from refinancing transactions this year. Subsequent to the quarter end, NRG Yield successfully completed its first follow-on equity offering, raising $630 million in net proceeds at a share price of $54, and just last week, Yield successfully completed its first-ever bond offering, a green bond, raising approximately $500 million in 10-year notes at a 5 3/8% coupon. These 2 capital raises by NRG Yield generated approximately $1.1 billion in net proceeds, which significantly exceeds the estimated $934 million cash funding needs for the Alta Wind transaction, which we expect will close this quarter. The resulting $188 million of additional surplus liquidity at NRG Yield can be used to support future growth, including NRG's planned offer to NRG Yield of a second group of assets this quarter. Turning to an update on progress and intended timing of future drop-downs to NRG Yield on Slide 21. NRG intends to offer a second set of assets from the portfolio of NRG Yield eligible assets we acquired on April 1 for acquisition by NRG Yield later this quarter, building on the success of our first-ever drop-down and anticipated to further increase capital available at the NRG level. Specifically, during the quarter, we intend to offer NRG Yield Walnut Creek, a 500 megawatt natural gas-fired asset, under a 10-year capacity contract with Southern California Edison; Tapestry, a 200 megawatt portfolio of wind assets under 20-year contracts with various off-takers; and Laredo Ridge, an 81 megawatt wind asset also under a 20-year PPA. These assets, comprising approximately 800 megawatts in total, are expected to generate around $120 million in annual EBITDA and approximately $35 million in annual cash bill for distribution, bringing the total CAFD made available to NRG Yield by NRG from drop-downs to $65 million in 2014. Following the second drop-down, which we are targeting to negotiate and close prior to year end, NRG still has NRG Yield eligible assets totaling approximately 1.3 gigawatts and representing an additional $100 million of CAFD and $215 million of adjusted EBITDA, which we intend to offer to NRG Yield over the course of the next 5 years, hoping to drive dividend growth at Yield, while continuing to replenish capital at NRG. Given the strong liquidity at Yield now augmented by the excess cash from recent offerings and our current equity ownership of approximately 55% following the recent equity issuance at Yield, we would expect a consideration to NRG for the second drop-down later this year to consist entirely of cash. Finally, updating our capital allocation progress and plans on Slide 22. The excess cash proceeds from the NRG Yield debt and equity offerings serve to increase overall 2014 capital available for allocation by $188 million versus the prior quarter update. To date, we have allocated approximately $1.8 billion of 2014 available capital, $1.1 billion of which has been towards value-enhancing acquisitions such as Edison Mission, with the remainder balanced across debt repayment activities, which now includes the cost related to our successful unsecured refinancing at NRG earlier this year; return of shareholder capital via dividends; and reinvestment in optimizing our generation assets. The remaining $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion of available capital, which is important to remember is the projected number at the end of 2014 rather than the excess cash available right now, resides at 3 different levels of the consolidated capital structure for which we have different priorities based on the needs and opportunities at each level. I've broken out these 3 levels at the bottom of the slide based on the midpoint of our total remaining excess cash across 2014. First, at GenOn, we expect to deploy approximately $440 million of the $650 million 2014 excess to fund completing the previously announced fuel conversions at Avon Lake and New Castle and our latest fuel conversion projects at Portland and Shawville, hoping to improve the future cash flow profile at GenOn. Turning to NRG Yield, we expect approximately $280 million in excess cash by year end, which can be used to help fund the purchase of the second set of drop-down assets I spoke about earlier, the total purchase price for which we increase capital dollar-for-dollar at the NRG level. Finally, at the NRG corporate level, where we expect the balance of $305 million and remaining excess cash, which would be augmented by drop-down proceeds, we continue to see potential opportunities on the M&A front, but expect this would be more likely taking the form of smaller bolt-on type transactions across all of our businesses rather than acquisitions from big conventional power plant portfolios. The remaining surplus capital provides potential base for our 2015 commitments, which include the majority of the capital spend for Midwest Gen optimization. With that, I'll turn it back to David to move to Q&A. David W. Crane: Thank you, Kirk. And Ben, I think that we used a lot of time, but I think we've got 15 or 20 minutes left for questions. So why don't we open the phones for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : This is actually Paul Zimbardo. Question on Slide 12, with the $545 million compliance plan, can you kind of share some background on your thoughts for where that splits up between those plants and just kind of what your thought process was on undertaking each plant's project. David W. Crane: Mauricio, go ahead. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, so we took a couple of things in consideration. One of the gating items, clearly, was the capacity auction results from the '17, '18 auction, but more importantly, the previous 3 years that gave us some visibility and some comfort on the outlook that we have for the PJM market. For us, the value proposition for Powerton and Waukegan is to remain on call and make the investment on the back-end controls to comply with MATS and CPS. Joliet, clearly was a -- we cannot justify putting the back-end controls. We looked at which of these assets have better access to natural gas supply, and Joliet was the one that had the best location for that. And with respect to Will County, first, is the, I guess, justifying the environmental CapEx for Will County was just not possible under the current market conditions. We're moving forward to retire that Unit 3 on '15 and then we'll continue to operate Unit 4 so long it just -- it complies with MATS. But we did a comprehensive analysis of all the plants. We look at which ones could be converted to a different fuel. We took into consideration capacity and current market prices. We look at the spend optimization that we could do given the -- we did a pro forma benchmark analysis on all of these facilities to evaluate what fixed cost we could take out, and basically, this was a result of that entire analysis. Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, great. And do you have a timeline for the testing on Will County Unit 4? David W. Crane: You mean, how long it can continue operating with -- do we have a specific timeline on it? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, we're looking at -- we're doing the testing, as we speak, right now. We believe that we will be in compliance for MATS and that's why we're laying it out for operation through 2018. David W. Crane: Paul, I mean, I do want to just generally add to what Mauricio said. I mean NRG on the wholesale generation side, I've always thought that the best way to be in that market was with a fuel-diversified portfolio, and certainly, the lessons from the polar vortex this winter was having a fuel-diversified portfolio was definitely the way to go. So we've taken into account all that Mauricio mentioned, but we also -- we very much want to continue to be multi-fuel in all of our core markets because we think that's the best way to play constraints on the fuel side, whether -- particularly within natural gas, whether it be with the commodity itself or with the transportation in times of scarcity. So we think, both with the GenOn assets and now with the Midwest Gen assets that, that's sort of the overriding theme that we're trying to accomplish. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research : You didn't mention anything about California. We saw in late July that San Diego Gas & Electric requested the approval for a PPA for your Carlsbad Energy Center. And also, we haven't really heard from SoCal Ed [ph] about their portion of gas-driven replacement for SONGS. Could you comment on your potential contracts there? David W. Crane: Well, Angie, it's always best to -- we always like to promise things that we know we can deliver on it. We're very pleased with San Diego Gas & Electric's submission of the power purchase agreement. But if we were to comment on, we would have been commenting on when do we think it'll be approved by the California Public Utility Commission and predicting when government acts is something that we just don't get in the business of. But we're very excited about that project. We think it's a very good project for the state of California. We think it's a very good project, ultimately, for NRG Yield, and we look forward to the day that the California Public Utility Commission acts upon that PPA, so that we can continue to add to the stability of electricity supply in Southern California. As to the Southern California Edison procurement, I think that, adversely, everything that happens in the Southern California Edison procurement is subject to confidentiality agreements. So I think I would limit myself at this point to say we don't know when they will make decisions. I think it would be fair for you to assume that NRG was responsive to virtually every aspect of what Southern California Edison was looking for in their request for a proposal. And we'd actually be very excited to participate in both conventional generation and what I think they referred to as preferred resources. So you may have to ask them as to what their timing is, but certainly we're excited about it. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research : So -- but SoCal Ed [ph] has made announcements about renewables. How much of gas-fired capacity are they trying to procure? David W. Crane: I'm not sure I can answer that question, Angie. Let us -- we'll get a response back to you on that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Dave, you wrote on your blog a bit about carbon and some of your thoughts there. I'm wondering if you could just apply that to Texas and give us at a high level your thoughts on the implications, if the EPA rule passes as is enacted as proposed, how you think about the implications for the Texas business. Obviously, Petra Nova is a great strategic step to consider that, but can you just talk more broadly about your Texas business in carbon? David W. Crane: Well, I mean the first thing, which is -- I think it's fair to say we submitted comments to the EPA rule, and we don't think that the EPA rule is currently promulgated as fair, and we particularly think it's unfair to the Gulf States and to Texas. So I would start by saying my hope that the rule doesn't get promulgated exactly as it is today. If it does get promulgated, it sort of depends on where the price of carbon lays out to. It's clearly not good for the coal-fired plants in Texas. I'm not sure that there's a way for Texas to comply with the rule as provided without significant retirement on the coal side. What knock-on implications that has for a state that -- contrary to my sort of doom and gloom in my opening comments about how they're weakening fundamentals, sort of Texas is the exception with 300,000 people moving into Texas every year and all that. So I would definitely call a strain on the system from our perspective. I mean that's -- as you alluded to, that's why Petra Nova is such an important project because coal plants in the United States are getting to a point where it's very Darwin-istic, it's survival of the fittest. And if putting carbon capture on the back of Parish, which is our biggest coal plant in our entire fleet, I think it's the biggest coal plant or the second biggest coal plant in the entire country, if that can help Parish and certainly we've contemplated the same at Limestone, survive in a market where other plants are having to come offline, it should just add to the value of those plants. And so that's our strategy, Stephen. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Understood. And shifting over to solar, it sounds like in the coming months, you'll speak more specifically to it. I wondered if you could just talk at a high level in terms of how competitive you see the playing field there. It looks like it's a very large addressable market and very small penetration rates. But just curious, as you look at both commercial and residential opportunities, does it -- do you often run into competitors? Is it relatively competitive? Or does it feel like the -- because the penetration level is so low, that the opportunity set's pretty rich? David W. Crane: Yes, there's a lot there, Stephen. And you're right. For the most part, we're sort of trying to avoid too much discussion about our strategy and our implementation plan and the sort of distributed solar space until we're fully ready to go because it is a highly competitive market and it's a very fluid market right now. With the success that SolarCity has had in the -- basically on Wall Street, there's a lot of shaking out just within the residential solar space. So what I would say there -- and the market does actually divide quite neatly on that front, is that residential solar, it seems a lot like distributed solar in terms of business-to-business, but apart from the solar panel, it's really a completely different business. It's sold differently, it's financed differently and all that. And in our company, you'll be handled by 2 different parts of the company. So you're right, even though there's very little penetration, I think I don't -- I think SolarCity, who's obviously the biggest player in the field, is saying they're going to do 80,000 installations this year. That's in a market, an addressable market that's been estimated across 20 states as 16 million homes. And so while you do focus on the next guy more for sort of internal morale purposes, more than one company has room to succeed in the residential solar space, and certainly, we expect to be one of those companies. And like I said, we'll talk more about that in the future. For us, on the business-to-business side, Stephen, the key is how do you downsize and do a lot of projects quickly, and our focus in that area is because, the age-old maxim, a 1 megawatt project requires as much structuring as a 100 megawatt project. That applies in renewables, as well as in conventional. But what we're looking to do -- and we've announced sort of starter deals with Starwood and Unilever is sort of getting into a world of one customer, multiple projects. So our first deal with Starwood was 3 hotels within their chain, but it's not lost upon us or them that they have 1,200 hotels worldwide. So that's really our -- what we're focused on in the business-to-business side, and it's early days there, but we certainly hope to be very successful and have a lot to talk to you about in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra of TPH. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division : On the Midwest Generation side, does the asset optimization include kind of all the synergies that you guys have looked at in the business? Or is there possibly more kind of cost reductions to make that imply the EV-to-EBITDA multiple look better? Mauricio Gutierrez : No, I mean, we took a holistic view of the entire Midwest Generation portfolio, and it does include all the operational synergies from reducing fixed costs to the spend optimization initiative to field conversions and the current market conditions, given the outcome on the capacity auction and the recent dark spread. So I mean, it is a comprehensive look at the value proposition for Midwest Gen. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division : Got it. And then with the Dominion retail customers, you mentioned that you're getting better-than-expected earnings and customer retention rate. Can you just outline the drivers behind that? What has kind of been the upside surprise? David W. Crane: Neel, Elizabeth Killinger is going to answer that question for you. Elizabeth Killinger : Yes, so we are seeing better-than-expected retention, in particular in our Northeast markets, driven probably by the experience they're having with the transition and that is that we're delivering on their commitments and giving them a warm welcome. On the earnings side, we attribute that to our effective margin management and understanding what the customer segments need to -- in order to stay with us. So we're real excited about that and look forward to that being a very successful integration over the coming months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Cohen of ISI Group. Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Question, one of your competitors on their earnings call just announced a big new combined cycle project in PJM, and on current forward curves, it looks like it's a pretty decent return on equity near term. But given your view on how the power market is going to evolve with low demand and more distributed generation, is that something that you would ever consider, like putting that much money to work in baseload assets, 20-year life assets? David W. Crane: Mauricio? Mauricio Gutierrez : Look, I mean the way we understand the project, it's a brownfield development and it has a cost competitive advantage vis-\u00e0-vis a greenfield development project. So I think I said that the market in PJM is getting close to cost of new entry. We had very strong capacity results. Spark spreads have been trending closer to greenfield development. The one thing -- and you pointed it out, I mean these are investments that have gone over 25-, 30-year length -- in length. Clearly, one data point is not going to justify making that investment. What we're seeing is, we're just very constructive on the PJM market. We think margins and -- capacity prices and margins are more sustainable than what we may have heard from other folks, and that's why we also went ahead and did the investment on the Midwest Generation fleet. Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And do you -- I mean, have you looked for similar sort of brownfield-type opportunities where you have some cost advantages for new build or... David W. Crane: Jon, yes, I mean, look, I think in terms of building new power plants, our advantage -- I mean, we have more projects than anyone. I mean basically -- in fact, brownfield versus greenfield, I can't actually remember the last time that we actually looked at a greenfield. I guess it was the one in [indiscernible]. So we are looking at brownfield all the time, and we ask and expect through our regional organizations that every power plant that we have had sort of the best option for either repowering, renewal, and so we're all about brownfield. But every brownfield we've done, we take advantage of the cost advantage in brownfield just like our competitors because it's real. But I mean every one we've done in recent years has a long-term contract. I do think there would be opportunities to make money in terms of conventional wholesale generation in the future, but particularly in the Northeast, they're going to come up because there's going to be imbalances created when sort of too many plants like -- retire. And I think if you look at the history of the curve, cost of new entrant pricing is not reached as often as -- the peaks are much more limited than the valleys. And so when the peaks come, you pretty much have to be there with megawatts at that time. You can't sort of say, well, this is a good time for me to start permitting a plant and then take 3 years to build it. And so one of the things I like about the -- we're not -- certainly, as you know from today in terms of the investment in the Midwest Gen fleet, we are by no means starving the Wholesale side of our business from capital to sort of succeed over the next 20, 30 years. But in terms of even where the business is repositioning, one of the things I like about the Retail side of the business is the best earned is large in terms of hundreds of millions of dollars in a merchant plant, hoping that you'll be right over the next 30 years. So I very much like the balance of our capital allocation in terms of how we're investing sort of across from Wholesale to Retail. Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And just a high-level question. It seems like over the last few years, NRG has kind of evolved and has become a very big and complex company, multifaceted and fingers in a lot of different pies. Do you worry that at some point, the company becomes too difficult to analyze or the story becomes too difficult to tell and that you start to turn off certain investors? David W. Crane: Yes, I mean I think we were -- I mean I think that the -- I mean I think that's a different way of saying what I tried to say today is that, I mean the revelation for us for Yield, which we -- we struggled with the Yield idea for 2 years and worried about how the market would ever value our contracted solar assets, and we knew the market didn't pay any attention to our contracted assets, which I think, before Yield, consist of about 15% of our -- the market can only look at so many things. So even just within generation, they look at the 85% merchant exposure rather than the 15% contracted. So we actually think that while sort of the way we're organizing that was announced today may seem more complex, to us it simplifies the story, both from the investor's perspective but also from a management perspective. The way we're organized going forward allows senior executives of the team to sort of focus in their area and win in their area because each area is pretty distinct. I mean they're mutually reinforcing, but each has different competitors. And each -- as Kirk was going through, you can't value residential solar success on an EV-to-EBITDA basis. So we actually are very mindful of we want to get the benefits of having the multiplicity of assets and opportunities we have, but we want to simplify it for purposes of investment and value recognition, as well as value creation. So we're trying, Jon. And any advice you have on that, feel free to send us an email. Ben, we've gone past 10 :00 and knowing it's August, I don't want to burn people too much, but we'll take 2 more calls if we can, and I'll try and be briefer in my answers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Can you give us a little bit of the puts and takes when we start thinking about capital spending for next year and maybe even for '16? What's different now than anything you've kind of previously disclosed? Just trying to kind of balance things up in terms of what's happening on the CapEx side for the next couple of years and what that means for free cash flow. Kirkland B. Andrews: Well, first of all, we'll certainly provide you specific guidance around free cash flow in '15 as we normally do in the third quarter of the year. But looking ahead of that, which is why, as David talks about priorities and I, in answer, disclosure around exactly where that remaining capital resides, and as I said, those priorities are a little different. I think how it's evolved is we're much more focused on the future of the business, not ignoring opportunities to continue to enhance generation. But as we've said, the capital allocation focus is going to be on kind of smaller bolt-on -- bias towards a smaller bolt-on acquisition side as far as M&A is concerned. And the capital spend, certainly, we're mindful of, in the relatively near term, rounding out and completing the capital spend for Midwest Gen optimization and also the expanded asset optimization from the GenOn portfolio I spoke to you before. So I think we're much more focused on the future of NRG, especially around NRG Home on the Retail side, that's a small bolt-on acquisition, and just completing the optimization plans as we move forward. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And if I think about what's happening on just CapEx and not total capital allocation, but just -- and I know this is just kind of one narrow window of it, but it seems that there's what could be a pretty decent and material uptake in CapEx in 2015 and maybe 2016 on the existing fleet before things start kind of coming back down in the 2017 and beyond time frame. I mean, I'm just trying to -- I think about maintenance capital then the CapEx on Edison Mission, really the Midwest Gen units, as well as some of the work Big Cajun related and then things could -- should kind of tail off. Am I kind of just directionally thinking about that right? Kirkland B. Andrews: I think you're thinking about it exactly right. I mean in 2015 and 2016, it would represent the bulk of that remaining largely environmental CapEx, and in addition, that environmental CapEx is actually, as you know, above the line in terms of what we define as free cash flow and then obviously allocating it towards the operational improvements we spoke about before. So I think the capital intensity on that front is really most acutely focused in those 2 years, '15 and '16. David W. Crane: Well -- and Kirk, asking Michael's next question for him, I mean, but -- and even between '15 and '16, with the real focus, the blip that Michael's referring to actually being driven by this Midwest Gen and the -- and even finishing off the GenOn asset management, I mean that's much more '15 and '16, isn't that right? Kirkland B. Andrews: Yes, the bulk of that, especially on Midwest Gen, is certainly in '15 and then it begins to tail off a little bit more in '16, yes. David W. Crane: Yes. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Gregg Orrill of Barclays. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : So on the Joliet repowering and synergies on the Midwest Gen portfolio, the $120 million of asset optimization, et cetera, how much of that is the Joliet conversion in there? And then I had one other question. Kirkland B. Andrews: Yes, I mean I would say that we're not going to break out the overall $545 million across individual assets. But obviously, that $545 million, within that number is the smaller subset that we previously committed to as part of the PoJo leases. So that obviously conforms to what we committed to the lease holders, therefore, Powerton and Joliet as well. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. So a decent share of the $100 million to $120 million? Kirkland B. Andrews: Yes. I mean I would say it's relatively ratable across those, but I'm not going to break out the asset optimization impact that comes off of that on an individual asset basis. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then maybe the elephant in the room a little bit, just in terms of the capital allocation, just following up there. You didn't mention anything about a buyback of any size. How are you thinking about that? David W. Crane: Well, I think the way we're thinking about that right now, and it sort of goes back to Michael's -- the answer to Michael's question is, as we look forward in the immediate future, we see a need for available capital that we think have greater long run value than share buyback. We have a record of doing a lot of share buybacks over the last 10 years and so -- I think 7, in fact, in the 10 years that I've been here. So we'll come back to that issue in 2015, but I think for now we -- or the capital allocation is going to be pretty much like laid out by Kirk at the end of his -- of the presentation. Anyway, Ben, thank you very much, and I appreciate everyone taking the time, and sorry, we went 10 minutes over, but enjoy the rest of your summer, and we'll look forward to talking to you in the fall. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.",

Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NRG Energy Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chad Plotkin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chad Plotkin : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, and welcome to NRG's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located on the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. [Operator Instructions]. As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may be -- that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumption that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor statement provided in today's presentation as well as the risk factors contained in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. During this morning's call, we will also refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures of the company's operating and financial results. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release and this presentation. And with that, I'll now turn over the call to David Crane, our President and Chief Executive Officer. David W. Crane: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this last earnings call of 2014. As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and they'll both be giving part of the presentation. In addition to Kirk and Mauricio, Chris Moser who runs our Commercial Operations, Elizabeth Killinger who's Head of Retail are available for questions. And lastly, making his first, but hopefully not his last appearance on a quarterly earnings call is Kelcy Pegler, Jr. who runs NRG Home Solar. He also will be available to answer any questions you have in his area. Turning to Slide 3. On our last earnings call in early August, we noted that through the first part of the summer, there had been nothing in the way of extreme heat in any of our core markets. As a result, there had been no scarcity pricing of the type that our Wholesale generation depends upon. Scarcity pricing is particularly important in an energy-only market like ERCOT where it is intended to act as a de facto capacity payment. With the summer now well past, you know by now that across all of our power markets, summer never materialized. The predictable consequence of the moderate summer we report today, adapting of our third quarter financial performance and a softening of the forward curve near term adversely affecting the outlook for the balance of 2014. Under these weather circumstances, I think our financial results for the quarter were as good as could be expected, and while today, we are reducing our full year EBITDA guidance by 5%, and I take no satisfaction in reducing guidance, I do take a little comfort from the fact that our full year guidance, as revised, actually remains at the high end of our original guidance for fiscal year 2014 even when excluding the impact of the acquisitions we closed earlier in the year. This is highlighted in the bar chart on the bottom right quadrant of Slide 3 in order to permit an apples-to-apples comparison. What makes me more positive than the revised 2014 guidance are 2 other factors : first, notwithstanding the third quarter headwinds associated with the weather, our Wholesale generation fleet performed up to our very high expectations on virtually every metric and that is a result of the culture of continuous improvement instilled by Mauricio and his operations team; and secondly, I feel good about our prospects to grow the business in 2015 and beyond across all of our various lines of business. As such, I'm pleased to announce the 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. This guidance, I would note, excludes the impact of our fast-growing Home Solar business, which is, at this point, in the evolution of the residential solar business build-out, a sector in which negative EBITDA is the norm for the leading industry players and financial success is measured by other metrics, which Kirk will discuss later. Lastly, as we acknowledged on our last quarterly call, we recognize and appreciate that NRG is a complicated company to understand and properly value at this stage. We are dual focused, both on winning the short- to medium-term future of our business based on the current 20th century conventional grid-based paradigm while also preparing to win the medium- to long-term future of our industry as its 21st century paradigm takes shape. So rather than expand on my thoughts on this earnings call, I'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting our first Investor Day in over 5 years this coming January. You will hear more of the details from Chad and the IR team about this must-attend event in the coming weeks. Moving to Slide 4 and coming back for a moment to our strength of execution. Last quarter, we spoke about the Edison Mission transaction and how our integration and asset optimization capabilities led us to an improved outcome from our original expectation. We've also stated on several occasions that our efforts on integrating the Dominion retail acquisition were also trending favorably, as well. As these 2 acquisition integration efforts, which I might point out we're implementing almost simultaneously, reach their completion, I'm pleased to report that, in each case, we have not only delivered on our commitment to you but exceeded our expectations. We are ahead of schedule and we are exceeding our targets in respect of key financial and operating metrics. I think our success in a management and systems-intensive endeavor like large-scale integrations demonstrates that this company and our people across the organization continue to be singularly focused on getting the task at hand done quickly and efficiently. Moving to Slide 5. We are pleased to announce today that NRG West has been awarded a number of contracts totaling 440 megawatts in aggregate in Southern California Edison's recent RFP for fast-start gas units and what they refer to as Preferred Resources. The 178 megawatts of Preferreds' Resources, which encompasses demand response and energy efficiency, is a particularly important win for us because we believe, California, as it has so often in the past, is a trendsetter in this area. In just California alone, the public policy is shifting towards Preferred Resources, making it 50% of all future resource procurement. By winning this award and winning big, we are positioning NRG for first-mover advantage with all the benefits that, that entails as Preferred Resources become a more significant part of the energy mix for load-serving entities across the United States. The other part of the award, the 262-megawatt Mandalay project now joins our 600-megawatt Carlsbad project, which is currently awaiting CPUC approval, as critical examples of how NRG is replacing and updating its aging conventional generation assets with smaller, more flexible, renewable-friendly, fast-start peaking units on long-term contract. It also obviously demonstrates our ability through intrinsic growth from development to restock the pipeline of NRG Yield-eligible assets, ensuring that NRG can maintain NRG Yield's double-digit growth profile into the next decade. Most of all, our success in this critical solicitation from SCE, one of NRG's most valued customers, shows that NRG is prepared to fulfill our role as an integral player in the critical California market now and well into the future. Turning on to Slide 6 to the Residential Solar business. We've made no secret of the importance that we attach to success in this area. We've been developing our capabilities in residential solar for a few years, but we have been very light on detail when it comes to speaking with you on how we think you should be thinking about this business embedded as it is within NRG. Obviously, a good deal of our reticence was driven by our desire to build the capabilities we felt we needed in this area outside of the public eye. As a big player relative to the companies currently in the field, we did not want to telegraph our approach to the business. While there continue to be many market-sensitive details of our approach that we are not prepared to disclose, on this Slide 6, we begin to pull back the curtain. The first thing you need to know is that while the graphs on Slide 6 focus almost exclusively on home solar performance metrics, you will see that our home solar business is going to be about so much more about than just solar panels on the roof and we consider that one of our greatest advantages. Our homes solar business is going to be about marrying up, cross-selling and seamless integration of solar-driven home energy solutions, including complementary grid system sales, backup generation and other energy products and services. And in this regard, unlike other residential solar companies that talk about offering more than just solar to their customer base, we already have the capabilities in place to offer effectively many of these complementary products and services. You can safely assume that we will expand upon our efforts to provide an appropriate level of detail about our home business -- our home solar business at our Investor Day. So let me just give you a brief overview of where we are and where I see our activities leading over the coming year. Focusing, as I said, purely on the home solar business itself for today, we have created a very strong business platform. Starting with our original NRG residential solar solutions and now combined with both RDS and Pure Energies through acquisition, we now believe we have the premier one-stop shop for customers seeking a high-quality solar experience at their homes. We have the multichannel customer acquisition engine necessary to achieve the appropriate scale. We have the systems necessary to accommodate rapid expansion and we have the financial acumen in place to finance our growth in an optimized manner. Specifically, on the financing side, we are ramping up with tax equity financing, either closed or in negotiation, to support nearly $600 million of residential leases in the near term. On the operations side, we are driving down installation timing and improving the customer adoption process so that we can reduce substantially the wait times from customer sale to install completion. By the end of this year, we expect to have over 10,000 installations, which is about 70 megawatts. By the end of 2015, we expect to grow that amount by 3x with an objective of a total of 35 to 40,000 installations or roughly 280 megawatts. Lastly, and given our focus on operational excellence and continuous improvement, we see our costs coming down to where we can install and offer residential solar between $3.20 to $3.30 per watt in 2015 with further cost reductions occurring in the years beyond. We look forward to updating you more on that -- on these efforts in January. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, David, and good morning. We delivered another quarter of strong results despite the lack of weather and the corresponding weak prices. More importantly, the relative varied sentiment from the summer was more than offset by the positive activity on the regulatory front. Changes in capacity markets stemming from reliability concerns, post-polar vortex, implementation of environmental regulations and the uncertainty around demand response are all contributing to a robust future across the wholesale markets. Throughout the quarter, we continue to focus on repositioning our Wholesale portfolio to win in both the short and long terms, either by extending the life of assets through fuel conversions or repowering facilities at a significant discount to greenfield economics. These actions give us an opportunity to withstand low commodity prices like the ones we experienced this past summer while standing ready to participate in market recovery. Given the circumstances, our portfolio performed quite well. The diversity in our generation portfolio, our hedging strategy, the integrated platform between Wholesale and Retail and our focus on operational improvements all contributed to achieving a solid quarter. Turning to our operational performance on Slide 8. I am particularly pleased with the safety performance of the organization. After 2 years of continuous integration, we're back to top decile levels. We had 146 out of 161 facilities that finished the quarter without a single recordable injury. Overall, generation for the quarter was slightly down, driven primarily by lower coal and gas generation in both Texas and the East despite better reliability and availability metrics. This was somewhat offset by higher gas generation in the West and South Central regions, but particularly the significant increase in renewable generation. Also our gas portfolio experienced a significant decrease in the number of starts due to lower cycling at Cottonwood and lax scarcity pricing in the East. This again highlights the value of our balanced portfolio between contracted and merchant assets during periods of low power prices. Turning to Slide 9. Our Retail business performed quite well and met our expectations for the quarter when factoring in both the impact of the Dominion acquisition as well as continued organic growth relative to the same period in 2013. More importantly, however, we achieved these results by realizing higher retail margins despite the introduction of the Dominion portfolio, which generally came in with lower-margin customers. As David mentioned earlier, the Dominion integration is now complete and performance has exceeded expectations. Since the close of the deal, Retail has retained higher-than-planned customer count and realized favorable EBITDA contributions with customer retention and expense management being the key drivers of much better-than-planned results on EBITDA and customer count. The Northeast drove the customer count overperformance with Texas driving the cost efficiencies. Lastly, with the closing of the Goal Zero acquisition in September and momentum building with NRG Home Solar, we have expanded the breadth of bundled products offerings across our markets. Our Home Solar team began selling system power along with residential solar and experienced nearly 50% success rate in cross-selling. At the end of the third quarter, 20% of Texas customers were buying more than 1 product from NRG and were gaining momentum with cross-selling in the Northeast. Overall, as more and more customers subscribe to multiple products and services, we expect our Retail platform to demonstrate enhanced growth and improved retention, allowing us to realize more value from each customer. Moving on to Slide 10, and as we mentioned before, it was another summer of weak prices and lack of weather across the country. While, on the surface, weather was slightly below normal in the Northeast and close to normal in Texas, the number of hot days was unusually low and as you can see in the lower left-hand chart. In some cases, like in Texas, the first 100-degree day occurred well into the summer, resulting in much lower spot power prices, particularly when you compare them against the same forward prices before the third quarter. This milder weather, combined with lower gas prices due to the higher production coming out of the Marcellus Shale, put some downward pressure on forward power prices during the summer. Since then, we have seen some recovery in forward prices, particularly in the Northeast, where they are back to presummer levels due in part to upcoming environmental regulations and concerns of cooler weather this winter. I want to take this opportunity to remind everyone about our summer hedging policy. While we increased our hedges in the aftermath of the polar vortex, we maintained a long reserve opening for the cash markets as a matter of prudent risk management. These megawatts were affected by the lack of scarcity pricing and therefore exposed to weak spot prices. This is something we implemented a few years back to ensure NRG would benefit from higher wholesale prices despite operational issues or higher retail levels. While we manage the size of this open position based on prices, we will continue to lean long in future summers consistent with our view. Moving on to Slide 11 and starting with PJM. We see a number of positive trends in our Wholesale business. The implementation of environmental rules like MATS, IPP or CSAPR next year, in combination with the uncertainty around demand response, most likely will take megawatts out of the supply stack and provide a positive momentum for both energy and capacity prices. In addition, PJM is in the process of making significant improvements to their capacity markets. It was clear that in the aftermath of the polar vortex event, units that provide a reliability and fuel certainty were at risk of retiring due to economics under the existing market structure. PJM recognized this shortcoming and it is recommending improvements to explicitly recognize the value of these units provided to the system. The new capacity performance market, while still under works, is designed to compensate generation resources that provide fuel certainty and reliability during peak weather conditions. We believe this is an important and necessary enhancement to the capacity markets, particularly if the system becomes more dependent from natural gas for power generation. We continue to work closely with all stakeholders and believe the market redesign is getting close to achieving the desired objectives. In Texas, fundamentals remained strong, particularly on the demand side. Demand grew 2.7% on a weather-normalized basis for the year and market design changes, including higher price caps and the implementation of an operating demand curve, are positive improvements for the energy-only market. Although we continue to believe they're not adequate long-term solutions to address resource adequacy issues, these measures should improve pricing as to better dispatch the electric system. As you can see on the upper right-hand chart, neither historical nor forward prices support long-term greenfield development. Market participants continue to focus on brownfield sites where cost advantages are necessary to manage the low-price environment that we have seen in the past couple of years while getting access to the fundamentally robust Texas market. Earlier this year, we announced the mothballing of our Bertron plant in Houston given the lack of support for capacity markets. With the benefit of hindsight, it proved to be the right decision given the lack of scarcity pricing this summer. But as we move forward, we need to renovate our fleet to remain competitive in the evolving Texas market. Our development efforts are predicated on either long-term contracts or units with a significant cost advantage where we don't have to take disproportionate market risk. Today, we are announcing the construction of a 360-megawatt peaking facility at the former PH Robinson brownfield site, which will be operational in late 2015. In natural gas, fast-start combustion turbines will help the state of Texas integrate the growing intermittent renewable generation while using no water for cooling and taking advantage of higher price caps and potential scarcity pricing. The plan meets our criteria of an ideal location in Houston and it is suspected to be built at a significant discount to traditional, new-build economics. Finally, on October 23, the D.C. court lifted the stay imposed nearly 3 years ago on the CSAPR rule. All arguments to address open issues are scheduled for March of next year. While this rule will continue to be contested and it is difficult to speculate on the final outcome, particularly pertaining to Texas, the EPA intends to start the rule in January 1, 2015. Our compliance program is a multi-pronged strategy, which includes using allowances, optimizing existing back-end controls, fuel switching and the use of low-sulfur PRB coal. We don't expect the rule to have a significant impact on this batch economics in the near term, but it could become a catalyst for additional coal retirements in lignite-heavy states like Texas, if implemented. Turning to our hedge disclosures on Slide 12. We decided to increase our coal and nuclear hedge levels for both gas as a proxy for power and heat rate for 2015 and 2016 in light of the weak summer prices and increasing gas production. We now stand at 94% hedge in 2015 and 45% in 2016, significantly reducing our exposure to near-term market dynamics. Coal hedges remain well balanced and fuel inventories are being replenished ahead of the winter months despite some of the rail performance issues that have affected our industry. We're focused on executing our fall outage season and reassessing the asset optimization projects that we have shared with you in previous calls in light of the changes in capacity markets across our core regions. We will update you in the near future once these changes have been finalized. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk. Kirkland B. Andrews: Thank you, Mauricio. I'm beginning with the financial summary on Slide 14. NRG is reporting adjusted EBITDA of just over $1 billion for the third quarter with $678 million from Wholesale, $196 million from Retail and $140 million from NRG Yield. Through the first 9 months of 2014, adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.5 billion, with $1.683 billion from Wholesale, $477 million from Retail and $341 million from NRG Yield. Despite the lack of price volatility and lower generation during the quarter, total consolidated EBITDA was flat compared to third quarter 2013 due to higher contributions from Retail, which benefited from increased margins from Dominion as well as continued customer growth. EBITDA from the newly acquired EME assets and NRG Yield, combined with these higher Retail results, serve to offset lower Wholesale EBITDA for the quarter. For the third quarter, free cash flow before growth totaled approximately $0.5 billion, driving just over $800 million in free cash flow over the first 9 months of the year. Turning to highlights and updating our progress on drop-downs to NRG Yield, we're pleased to announce that we've now executed a definitive agreement for the drop-down of a second set of assets for $480 million in cash, which we expect to close by the end of the year. This transaction, when combined with the previously executed drop-down in the second quarter, will bring total cash proceeds from drop-downs during 2014 to $830 million, providing significant capital replenishment to NRG while driving dividend growth at Yield. As previously announced, NRG Yield also closed the acquisition of the Alta Wind assets on August 12, which will further support Yield's growth through $220 million of incremental run rate adjusted EBITDA and $70 million of annual cash build for distribution by 2016 once the remaining 2 PPAs for Alta 10 and 11 are in effect. In addition, following the quarter end, NRG closed a new tax equity facility permitting us to immediately monetize future tax benefits, consisting largely of PTCs to be generated primarily by the NRG Yield-eligible wind assets we acquired earlier this year as a part of the EME transaction. NRG received approximately $190 million in net cash proceeds from the transaction, in effect, representing an advance on monetizing these assets through future drop-downs to NRG Yield and further replenishing capital to NRG in 2014. This tax equity facility is structured to maintain the level-ized cash available for distribution from the wind assets, thereby preserving our ability to monetize these cash flows from the assets through drop-downs to NRG Yield beyond 2014. Finally, while executing on value-enhancing, bolt-on transactions and completing our refinancing of NRG's unsecured notes during the third quarter, we maintained NRG's continued strong consolidated liquidity position, which is largely unchanged at $3.6 billion as of quarter end and now further enhanced by the wind tax equity proceeds, which closed subsequent to the quarter. Turning to the guidance overview on Slide 15. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, in the absence of warmer summer weather and higher prices over the balance of the year, our expectations for 2014 adjusted EBITDA were trending to the lower end of guidance. The lack of extreme heat and scarcity pricing and resultant lower EBITDA over the balance of the summer, combined with expected results over the balance of the year, has placed our 2014 expectations now at or modestly below our prior guidance range, and we are revising and narrowing our 2014 EBITDA guidance to $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. The reduction in Wholesale guidance is partially offset by NRG Yield, which has been revised upward to reflect the partial year impact of the Alta Wind transaction, which closed during the third quarter while Retail remains on track with prior guidance with a slightly tighter range of $620 million to $650 million. Our 2014 EBITDA guidance also includes the impact of approximately $50 million in negative EBITDA from the home solar business, reflecting overhead and customer acquisition costs as we position the business for significant growth next year. Our revised EBITDA guidance range net of the contribution from the EME transaction, which as you'll recall was approximately $250 million this year, still places us on track to the upper end of our original guidance range for 2014 as the positive impact from operational performance during the first quarter more than offset the impact of lower prices and generation later in the year. We are also reducing and narrowing our guidance range for 2014 free cash flow before growth, based in part on the reduction in EBITDA guidance as well as other revisions to free cash flow expectations over the balance of the year. These revisions total approximately $150 million and consists of 3 elements : first, the impact of interest expense from both the Alta Wind transaction as well as interest expense resulting from the timing of the final redemption of our 2019 senior notes completed in September; second, mindful of the critical need for preparedness, which benefited us during the colder weather in the first quarter, we've accelerated a portion of our oil and coal inventory build from 2015 into 2014 in advance of the winter months in order to insulate the portfolio from any delivery challenges, which may result from higher rail demand or other potential transport disruptions over the winter; finally, changes in working capital largely due to the expected timing of Wholesale revenue now later in the year, partially offset by changes in timing for environmental capital expenditures, make up the balance of the expected changes for free cash flow this year. The majority of these changes are timing-related and should reverse as we move into 2015. Importantly, the proceeds from the wind tax equity transaction more than offset these largely temporary differences in cash flow, helping to maintain over $1 billion in consolidated excess cash available for allocation over the balance of the year, which I'll review in greater detail shortly. Turning to 2015. We are initiating full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion, including Wholesale EBITDA of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion; Retail, which is expected to deliver $625 million to $700 million in 2015. NRG Yield, which makes up the balance of our guidance range, reflects an increase of $130 million primarily due to the full year impact of the Alta Wind transaction. Our 2015 guidance excludes the anticipated impact of NRG Home Solar, which we expect to generate approximately $100 million in net operating costs as overhead and customer acquisition costs reflect the rapid growth in lease volume only partially offset by gross margin from leases in service through 2015. Next year, we expect an incremental 25,000 to 30,000 home solar installations, which, net of tax equity proceeds, will require less than $150 million in incremental NRG capital in 2015. Including fully allocated overhead, we expect NRG return, net of tax equity, in excess of 8%, positioning NRG to capitalize on low-cost opportunities for further lease monetization at a premium to fully installed costs. And we will provide further details on this at our upcoming Investor Day in January. Our 2015 free cash flow before growth guidance, which is net of maintenance and environmental capital, including planned spend on Midwest Gen fuel conversions and back end controls, remains a robust $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for 2015. Turning to Slide 16, I'll review in greater detail the second drop-down of assets to NRG Yield for $480 million in cash. These assets represent the first drop-down and monetization of Yield-eligible assets acquired from Edison Mission consisting of Walnut Creek, a fast-start natural gas-fired facility under a 10-year contract with Southern California Edison; Tapestry, a portfolio of wind assets in West Virginia and Oklahoma under 20- to 25-year PPAs; and Laredo Ridge, a Nebraska-based wind facility under a 20-year PPA. This second drop-down portfolio is expected to generate approximately $120 million in adjusted EBITDA and $35 million in cash build for distribution at NRG Yield, helping to drive near-term dividend growth at Yield. An additional $100 million in cash available for distribution remains available through drop-downs over the balance of the NRG ROFO assets and the EME-eligible wind assets beyond 2014, providing Yield the means to deliver on its long-term growth targets. In connection with the transaction, at closing, NRG Yield will also assume approximately $746 million of nonrecourse project debt. This debt balance includes a pro forma increase of $40 million of incremental debt at Laredo Ridge, resulting from a pending refinancing of the existing project debt, which will close prior to drop-down. This refinancing, which takes advantage of the lower prevailing financing rates, maintains existing debt service and CAFD while cash proceeds from the increased project debt will be paid as a dividend to NRG prior to the drop-down, supplementing the $480 million in proceeds from the transaction. The cash purchase price and assumed debt implies a transaction enterprise value of approximately $1.2 billion or just north of 10.2x 2015 adjusted EBITDA while the equity purchase price implies a CAFD yield of 7.3%. NRG Yield will fund the transaction using excess cash on hand of approximately $280 million with the balance of the purchase price funded to be a temporary draw on NRG Yield's revolving credit facility, which had approximately $420 million in capacity at quarter end. NRG Yield expects to repay the revolver in 2015 from the proceeds of its next capital raise. And finally, updating our capital allocation progress on Slide 17. NRG's 2014 remaining consolidated cash build for allocation, which is net of $2 billion of capital previously committed, stands at approximately $1.1 billion. $700 million of this cash resides to GenOn level and is primarily earmarked to fund committed growth investments at GenOn beyond 2014, specifically the planned fuel conversions at Portland, Shawville, Avon Lake and New Castle. Following the closing of the new tax equity facility and the fourth quarter drop-down to Yield, the remaining $400 million in excess cash will reside at the NRG level as NRG Yield will use its excess cash to help fund the drop-down. This NRG level excess cash provides a base of support for our growing residential solar business and Midwest Generation investments next year. We'll provide an overview of the 2015 capital allocation in the first quarter. And with that, I'll turn it back to David. David W. Crane: Thank you, Kirk, and thank you, Mauricio, as well. Before we open the lines for questions and I think we'll go till 10 :00 because I think Duke reports at 10 :00 and we don't want you to miss that, I want to turn your attention to Slide 19. As we begin to feel the cold breath of winter here in Central New Jersey, let me give you a sense of where we feel that we are in terms of our performance against our 2014 strategic goals, which we articulated in our first quarterly call last February. Obviously, 2014 remains a work in progress with 2 months remaining until the end of the year and we continue to strive against all of the goals that we articulated. While I won't elaborate on each of the 12, you will see from our self-assessment that we feel that we have been pretty successful. We've achieved meaningful and identifiable advances against each of the 4 strategic pillars of our strategy. There are only 2 of the 12 areas where we would have liked to have accomplished more and we will endeavor to do more in the months to come, and those areas are utility scale renewables and capital allocations, specifically share buyback. With respect to utility scale renewables, our relative lack of success in this area has been caused by a relative lack of opportunity as the last couple of years have witnessed an ever-increasing number of wannabe wind and solar developers piling into the big renewables space. These new entrants are making bargain basement bids based on excessively optimistic assumptions on the price track for solar equipment. We continue to look for big renewable deals ourselves, but -- where we can create value because we think that Tom Doyle and NRG Renew are very, very good at this end of the business, but we won't chase deals that may look good upon announcement, but end up destroying shareholder value once implemented. We are confident that this is an area of further value creation for NRG Renew in the years to come. Indeed, we remain very bullish on business-to-business solar, specifically single-customer, multisite opportunities that we can scale up and believe that our platform is well positioned to capture meaningful value in the near to medium term. With respect to share buybacks, as you know, for a variety of reasons, we have not had the opportunity to buy back shares this year and this being for only the second time in the 11 years that I have worked at NRG. As we look forward to 2015, clearly, we already have committed a significant amount of our available capital to investment opportunities which we believe will create significant shareholder value over time. Equally clearly, a mismatch currently exists between the multiple sources of shareholder value currently embedded within the NRG Group of Companies and the NRG share price, which, as it traditionally has done, continues to move primarily in correlation to volatile, near-term natural gas prices no matter how modest and declining in relevance those short-term swings in gas pricing are to our performance or to our prospects. As we continue to replenish our coffers after taking into account the current program of committed investments, we will revisit share repurchases as part of our capital allocation plan throughout 2015. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator. Shannon? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Just in terms of thinking about the 2015 guidance in the light of the volatility and the guidance you had this year after a great first quarter and then the lack of opportunity in Q -- in the summer anyway, what type of extrinsic value assumptions are baked into your 2015 expectations being cognizant of the fact that you guys want to make sure that you don't have to move your numbers around a lot in the future? David W. Crane: Greg, I may ask Kirk to address that question specifically. But sort of the context in which you asked the question about the guidance, I'm sure that you're frustrated as everyone on the phone should be frustrated with moving the guidance around. We are frustrated as well and it just makes no sense to us, as we look at our performance. I mean, everything that we could control is right on track, yet we've had to change guidance twice this year because of weather : once up because of the winter and once down because of the summer. If we had done nothing, but announced guidance last November, right now, we'd be sitting here at the upper end of our range. So one of the things that we want to look at between now and our Investor Day and hopefully report back to you is if there's a more accurate way that we could look at guidance in terms of doing guidance with sensitivity to weather, so you could track it with your own following of the weather. But having given that slightly off-topic answer, Kirk, you want to answer the extrinsic value aspect? Kirkland B. Andrews: Sure. The Wholesale component of our 2015 guidance is based upon the forward curves at this time in terms of what we see in our core markets, in particular, in the Northeast and Texas. If anything, I would say that the upper end of that guidance range, specifically on Wholesale, does incorporate, in a way of saying, the bandwidth of the range of guidance does incorporate some extrinsic value allowing for the possibility of volatility in the portfolio. But overall, our guidance range, especially towards the bottom end of the range is simply based on the forward curves and the implied gross margin that we see from those at this point. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And then on the Retail side, you're assuming slightly higher range of outcomes in 2015 versus 2014. Is that -- can you give us sort of the puts and takes there? Is that primarily the accretion from the Dominion retail, offset by assumed margin decline in other areas? And are there assumptions about incremental product margins in there as well? Kirkland B. Andrews: To some degree, yes. But I think overall, the way you summarized at the outset of your question, interpreting the guidance is correct, and that is that the upside includes the contribution from Dominion, which, I think, as I said, on the second quarter call, while we didn't see a whole lot coming from Dominion as we transition the portfolio this year, we saw the upside and then that's reflected in the guidance range, slightly offset by some declines or contraction on the margin side, particularly on the C&I side where I think we've consistently said we don't see compelling margins in that particular business, which is why we're repositioning our approach to C&I more comprehensively as a bundled product offering, not off the back of strictly grid power. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in greater detail at the Investor Day that David alluded to earlier. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Great. Final question and I'm sure you're getting a lot of follow-ons on this. Obviously, the growth rate from '14 to '15 in your Home Solar installation aspiration is quite high. Can you give us a sense of what you think the 3- to 5-year growth rate is? Or are we going to have to wait for the Analyst Day? David W. Crane: Well, I'm going to ask Kelcy. I don't know how he's going to answer the question, but I would tell you, I mean, in any of these super high-growth industries, that Kelcy is in a better position to answer your question than I am. But even his answer is going to be a guess. But Kelcy, go ahead. Kelcy Pegler, Jr.: So I would say that we're preparing ourselves to compete at the top tier of the sector. And we see the guidance that our industry gives for growth trajectories of the whole residential solar space and we see ourselves in the top tier of that. David W. Crane: And we have no reason to disagree with what the other people in the industry are saying? Kelcy Pegler, Jr.: Correct. David W. Crane: Yes, I mean, if anything, I would say, as optimistic as they are, they could be bigger. So anyway, it's obviously great. [indiscernible] It's just exceedingly high growth and what we're more focused on, as Kelcy is saying, is make sure that if the growth comes that we can accommodate it without any deterioration of service. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So following up a little bit on Greg's last question on the energy home business, how do you think investors should look at valuing the EBITDA and cash flow properties of the solar business in aggregate? Obviously, it's a little bit different from the conventional thermal business. What are you saying? David W. Crane: Julien, the first thing I would tell you is that -- answering that single question more than any other reason is why we're having an Investor Day in January so that we can go through it because I'm not sure if it's susceptible to a 30-second answer but, Kirk, go ahead. Give it your best shot. Kirkland B. Andrews: You can start telling me now. So first of all, from our perspective, as we alluded to, which is part of the reason why we've excluded the negative EBITDA moving forward in our guidance range, it doesn't -- that business, because of the high growth and because of the long-term cash flows, doesn't really lend itself to kind of traditional EBIT to EBITDA--type metrics. And for that reason, we've started to give you a little bit of sense of what the net capital from NRG that's slightly less than $150 million is the expectation off of that lease volume next year. And given we see a pretty robust return, as I alluded to, of greater than 8% off of that residual cash flow stream, I think the rest of the story, which we'll expand upon at the Investor Day, is translating that fully installed cost into a full monetization, if you will. So the way we think about it is monetizing our cost at a premium is the best way to translate value in the near term. David W. Crane: Julien, if I could just add just one point. I mean, we see one of our big tasks for all of our investors and actually for our business over the next couple of years is to demonstrate what we think is this extraordinary potential synergy between what Kelcy and NRG Home Solar have to offer and what Elizabeth in NRG Retail have -- who to offer it to. So her 3 million customers with its increasingly cost-competitive and attractive idea that people can monetize the solar value of their real estate, we think that's a great combination. And how you all should be thinking about -- how you should be valuing it, that's part of the thing that we want to present to you in January. But we're also aware that we all live in the show-me state. We actually have to demonstrate to you that it actually can be done. So that's what we're really focused on in this area and that's why we've put them both together under NRG Home. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great. Well, you've certainly whet my palate to hear what you have to say next. Separately, though, could you address briefly the PJM performance scheme as you're thinking about the opportunity to participate both in the transition auctions and in the subsequent 18, 19 auction with the portfolio and especially the GenOn assets? Will they all quantify is basically the question. Mauricio Gutierrez : Julien, this is Mauricio. Look, I mean, as you appreciate the rules and the guidelines for the capacity performance continue to change, the first draft, as you know, was very prescriptive in terms of who qualify for that market. That have changed and that -- I guess that change we see that positively. The requirements are less. They focus on fuel certainty, and clearly, reliability will be part of the bidding cost for lack of a better term on the auctions. We provided an indication in terms of what could potentially qualify under this capacity performance on the table on the slide where we show by fuel mix, whether coal, nuclear and dual fuel and oil, I believe it's on Slide 11. But again, I mean, I think that's going to -- until we have the final rules, we'll have more certainty in terms of what can qualify and not. I think it's important to say that we are reviewing all the project that we announced in previous calls around GenOn and Edison Mission because of the capacity performance and the expectation of potentially much higher revenue stream from our capacity markets. So that process is underway right now. But until we have final rules, it's really difficult to pinpoint. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Wanted to talk about the financing at NYLD of the asset drop-downs. Can you, Kirk, give a little bit of color in terms of what portion of that purchase price will be financed with debt relative to equity? Kirkland B. Andrews: Well, as I said, we're going to use the NRG Yield revolver capacity to supplement the cash on hand as we move forward. And as you run the math on what I had laid out there, that's sort of, rough order of magnitude, roughly $200 million relative to a little over $400 million in capacity on the revolver. And as I characterized, that's a temporary draw, which we'd look to repay with the proceeds from financing. Given the fact right now, though, that I'm not going to be specifically predictive about exactly what form of financing we'd take, that'll depend upon the profile of the portfolio at that time. But right now, as we talked about before off the back of the Alta Wind transaction and putting in place the holdco unsecured debt, we are basically on par with our balance sheet targets there. So the extent to which we had capacity in those balance sheet targets, we'd supplement with debt. If not, we'd be biased towards the equity side and we'll make that determination next year. Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Understood. And secondly, I want to follow up on Julien's question on PJM and kind of the flip side of it that, as you see the penalty language as it now stands, when you assess your portfolio, do you think there's probability of some of your assets more prudently being shut down to avoid penalties? Do think that is the very low probability situation, i.e., you're very confident that all of your plans, risk-adjusted, should stay online and be able to withstand the penalties? Just curious how you think about the penalty side of things. Mauricio Gutierrez : So Steve, I mean, 2 -- I guess 2 dimensions on that. First one is the field certainty. And if you look at the information that we provided on the table, most of our portfolio, as long as coal, nuclear or some sort of dual-fuel capability, we feel comfortable we're bidding those assets in the capacity performance. The second one is the penalties. And if there is one concern that we have on the existing rule is, I guess, the relative size of the penalty compared to the revenue and we've provided those comments to PJM. But ultimately, depending on the expectation of reliability of these assets, that will be priced into the bids that we're submitting to the auction. So to the extent that we have an asset that is unreliable, I think that's going to be factored in. And if the market doesn't need that asset, then it won't clear. I mean, I think it's as straightforward as that. Christopher S. Moser: Steve, this is Chris. Just to echo what Mauricio was just saying, too. I mean the penalties are definitely stiff at 1.5x net CONE, but the current suggestion is that the offer cap is going to be net CONE, which is a heck of a lot more space than we have today. So I would think that we'd be able to price in a lot of that risk and then we'll see where the market clears. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research : I actually wanted to ask additional questions about this capacity -- the new capacity product. So how should we think about it? So you're showing us growing Retail and growing margins while you expect higher and probably more volatile energy prices and higher capacity prices. So how does -- how do you reconcile these 2? Do you basically assume that you price in the higher payments or how about the contracts that have already been signed? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, I mean I'll let Elizabeth talk about the Retail. But I think, in general terms, the changes on the capacity performance market will be a net positive to our Wholesale portfolio. In terms of Retail, particularly in the Northeast, it's heavily weighted towards the mass residential market. That tends to be very short term in nature. So any potential market changes from the capacity performance will start happening in 2016 and beyond. And that's well within the period where you can actually price it in, but Elizabeth, I don't know if there's anything else there? Elizabeth Killinger : Mauricio, you covered it. We benefit from our integrated model -- in our wholesale/retail integrated model, in circumstances like this and we feel comfortable that we can manage any risk associated with that. Christopher S. Moser: And Angie, this is Chris again. Don't forget that just the sheer size of the comparison of the portfolios, I mean, if we're serving 12-some thousand megawatts in Texas and we got 11.5 or so thousand megawatts down there, that's pretty well balanced. When you get to the Northeast, we are preponderantly long generation there, 17,000 megawatts in PJM alone, not counting New York and New England. And the load that we serve up there is a fraction. So really, if capacity goes up, we're a multiple winner just from the sheer leverage of that. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research : Now, I mean, talking about the potential upside, I mean, if you're truly -- if you truly have 15 gigawatts of capacity that's eligible and looking at the sensitivity scenarios that PJM is showing, I mean, we're talking about $400 million-plus of potential upside in earnings. I mean, my question is that does that look a little bit too good to be true and I know I'm not accounting for the penalty side here. But I mean, what type of a response and how sustainable do you think that, that level of earnings stream is actually starting in '18 and beyond when that definitely also lines up the pockets of potential new-build projects? How do you think that this pickup that you could see in incremental auctions is sustainable going forward? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Angie. Well, a couple of things. Number one, I don't think we need to wait until 2018 to see some of the impact on the capacity performance. As you know, there will be a transition period. Hard to think that the 15, 16, I think, is going to be more a target megawatts, always going to have some upside and then there's going to be some sort of pro rata for the 2 auctions that are already clear. So the impact is going to be felt before that. In terms of the size and the magnitude of that, I mean, it is really hard to pinpoint from this point, and yes, I mean, the rules continue to change. There was yesterday an open meeting with PJM in terms of getting comments back from stakeholders. Clearly, we think it's not a small change in our revenue expectation. I think it is rather large. So far, I guess, we have the quantity in terms of the number of assets that could potentially qualify under the capacity performance. We don't know the price. We don't know the bidding behavior. I already said that it is a significant change in terms of what are the items that can be now priced into your bids. And ultimately, I guess, the price will work itself out when we go through the auctions. But I think it's important to say that the impact is pretty significant for us. We think that our portfolio is well positioned. And when we get the right pricing, then we'll be in a better position to tell you that. Now keep in mind that this capacity performance also is going to attract new builds and it's just a -- I mean, at this point, we will be speculating on the absolute impact on our portfolio. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research : And then my last question here would be, would you consider bringing back some of your coal plants that are either already shut down or actually slated for retirements in PJM? David W. Crane: Angie, I mean, the plants that aren't operating, I mean, some are mothballed, some go into full retirement. Once they go into full retirement, you can't bring them back. But I mean, I'd say, in general terms, obviously we're continuously looking at the circumstances that exist and if we can create value by bring plants back or bringing them back on a seasonal basis, we've been doing that in Texas for a few years. We'd do that in the Northeast to the extent that we can. I mean, to me, that is one of the premier competitive advantages we have on the Wholesale generation side. We have such a large and varied portfolio that we can find where the value is and get after it. So we'll be constantly looking at that. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Fremont of Jefferies. Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I guess being a fan of the Texas market is a lot like being a Mets fan. It always comes down to wait until next year. What seems to be changing in your opinion, given sort your new-build announcement, Calpine new build and Exelon new-build announcements there? David W. Crane: Well, that's sort of a loaded question. I come from the north side of Chicago where to be a Cubs fan makes being a Mets fan look like being an optimist. But I mean, look, I think Texas, I mean, you've sort of mentioned it. I mean I would say that the new build that we're talking about today at Robinson at $400 installed capacity. It's a brownfield site with equipment obtained in the secondary market. I mean, not too many people can do that. So I'm not sure that what we've seen is a huge flood of new supply unleashed yet, so we have reason to be optimistic in the short to medium term because Texas does grow. It usually is affected by extreme weather in the summer and occasionally in the winter. So I mean we like the Texas market. But you do point to the fact that it's hard to have a sustained advantage in the Texas market on the Wholesale side for years and years because the barriers to entry in terms of new build are low in Texas. And they've always been low. And that's where I think that the premiere advantage that we have over others is the combined wholesale retail model. Because when prices are subdued on the wholesale side, Elizabeth does well. So overall, it's a good market, but you're right, I mean, Texas will never be in a multi-year scarcity of generation situation because you can build quickly there. Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And then my other question is, I mean, it seems like your outlook on the core generation business seems a lot more optimistic on this call than it did on the last call. What accounts for that? David W. Crane: Well, what accounts for that was that I wasn't clear enough on the last call in terms of what sort of time frame that we were talking about. On the last call when I was talking about how we were going to reorganize the business -- I was talking about how we were going to reorganize the business and I sort of forgot 2 words, for the \"long term.\" I mean, short- to medium-term, I'm quite optimistic if you look at -- I mean, not every regional market. One of the things that's been going on, on the wholesale generation side is it's very difficult to talk in broad-brush terms about all the markets as if they're the same. The Gulf Coast, the East Coast and the West Coast, they all have completely different dynamics, which is a big change in our industry from when I got going in this industry 15 years ago. So you'd almost have to go region by region, but my fundamental view on the outlook for our Wholesale portfolio short- to medium-term, has not changed between this call and the previous call. It's just I wasn't talking about the short- to medium-term on the last call and you and many other people didn't hear me sort of distinguish that and that was my fault and I'm going to try and be much clearer in the future. So I'm properly chastised. So Paul, we've got to move on. We know -- we don't want to run into, conflicting with the Duke call, so we have like one more -- we'll take one more caller, and I apologize to the callers who did not get on. But Chad and the team would be happy to follow up and if you need to get Mauricio and Kirk and myself involved in the answers, we'll get involved as well because we want to answer everyone's questions, but for now, Operator Shannon, can we take 1 more call? Operator : Our next question is from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Just a question on the NRG Yield side on the expansion of some of these California projects, et cetera. And I think you said you now have a growth backlog through at least the end of the decade per mid-teens. Could you just give a little more flavor on the YieldCo-eligible cash flows that you now have for NRG Yield? Kirkland B. Andrews: Sure, Steve, it's Kirk. And I think that David's remarks about enabling us to sustain that double-digit growth into the next decade, we're clearly focused on that and we're optimistic about the potential contributions to enable that specifically from the projects that were announced around SCE. Although we're not at a point now that we're going to provide specific guidance in terms of what the CAFD and the economics. We're early days. Obviously, we have to go through the CPUC approval process and the like. But the guidance I give you, if you look at the megawatts of those different projects, with the exception for Preferred Resources, a little bit of a different profile there. But as far as the Mandalay and also the Carlsbad projects, roughly 265 megawatts and 600 megawatts, respectively, a good proxy for at least the EBITDA contributions of those is off the back of the existing projects that are down there where I think Marsh Landing, El Segundo, rough order of magnitude, kind of EBITDA per megawatt. Roughly kind of 15% of megawatts translates into EBITDA and that's probably a good proxy for how to think about the contributions from those plants. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: And then also with respect to NRG Yield in the scheme of the new NRG Home Solar businesses, could you give a little bit of flavor on how they will likely participate? Kirkland B. Andrews: Only as to say, as I've alluded to in the past, that we're focused on, as I said on this call also, monetizing the remainder of that capital and the residual cash flow stream after-tax equity. There are a number of different options available and we're evaluating all of those. But specifically for NRG Yield, we think the potential is very great for NRG Yield to play a part in that monetization, both from the standpoint of highlighting the value in the near term, as I alluded to before, and also given the return profile that the cash flows, the duration there, 20 years long-term contract, I think it has a lot of the elements that are very consistent with the NRG Yield portfolio. So I would say at this point it has high potential and more to come as we move into '15. David W. Crane: Thank you, Steven. And Shannon, I think we have to conclude here. And I appreciate everyone taking the time. And like I said, we'll follow up with whoever couldn't get on the call. So thank you, and we'll look forward to seeing you in January. Bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to disperse this conference call. Mr. Chad Plotkin, you may begin. Chad Plotkin : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone, and welcome to NRG's full year and fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located on the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. Because this call will be limited to one hour, we ask that you limit yourself to only one question with one follow-up. As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor statement provided in today's presentation as well as the risk factors contained in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. During this morning's call, we refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures of the company's operating and financial results. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release and this presentation. And with that, I'll now turn over the call to David Crane, NRG\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. David Crane : Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Chad. Even before I go through the familiar ritual of introducing my colleagues, I want to draw your attention to the latter part of today\u2019s earnings release, where we announced that Chad Plotkin is stepping down from being Head of Investor Relations from both NRG and NRG Yield in order to take up a position as Head of Finance for NRG Home Solar. Chad came to the IR position three years ago as a rising star in our strategy and M&A group at a time when we decided that our company and our investors were best served by an IR Head who had been deeply and directly involved in the business of the company. And in two years, Chad has worked tirelessly to explain the complexities of NRG to our current and hopefully future investors, but Chad has been more than that during his tenure, he has been a trusted advisor to Kirk, Mauricio, myself, and the rest of the Executive Leadership team.  As he moves through a clerically important finance position in Home Solar, our loss becomes Kelcy Pegler and Steve McBee\u2019s gain. For our part, we wish him well in this new position and for your part as investors in the NRG group of companies; I think you should expect doing counter him again. Chad\u2019s successor Matt Orendorff who liked Chad before him rises out of our strategy and M&A group is similarly a rising star deeply immersed in and familiar with the key initiatives of the company. But I will wait to see other good things about him until he proves himself in his new position. As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Additionally in making his first appearance on earnings call, I am pleased to have Steve McBee, President of NRG Home with us as well. Additionally and available for questions are Chris Moser, Head of Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., Head of NRG Home Solar. Before I begin I first want to thank everyone for participating in our investor event just six weeks ago. And since our strategy hasn\u2019t changed appreciably in the intervening weeks and since there have been no strategy altering intervening event since then, I will keep my prepared remarks as brief as possible. So let\u2019s get to it. Turning to slide 3, as we\u2019ve discussed over the past few quarters, our core power markets experienced quite a roller coaster ride in 2014 with a particularly severe winter and an extraordinarily mild summer. I am pleased to report today that due to faultless execution across our core wholesale and retail platforms, we successfully delivered on our fiscal year 2014 financial guidance as revised our last year\u2019s third quarter call.  Further and as we indicated at our Investor Day, even in the phase of continued softening of our core commodity prices, we again are reaffirming our 2015 financial guidance with its prospect of the year-over-year growth from 2014. There has been concern about softening commodity prices in the early days of this year, but our excellent operational execution over the past few months combined with the benefits of our diversification away from 100% reliance on conventional wholesale generation makes this possible for NRG, makes reaffirming guidance possible in a way that is not always possible for our pure play IPP peer group. Building on that theme and turning to slide 4, our strategic actions in 2014 continue to lay the foundation for NRG as we build the future of our company in response to transition that we now believe to be clearly underway in our industry, by the way I am still on slide 3. Following the strategic blueprint provided to us by the winners in the telecom revolution, we have been a big and successful consolidator in the conventional power sector while pushing forward into key phases of the new more, distributed more sustainable and carbon-constrained world of personal power.  We deliver on all of our integration targets for our two most significant 2014 acquisitions and did so more quickly than we originally thought possible. We enhanced NRG Yield and we began to process through NRG carbon 360 of providing a long-term future for our younger coal plants even in a de-carbonizing world. Now, you should turn to slide 4. Furthermore, we have been on a strategic path at least since 2010 to diversify our financial performance away from pure commodity risk. Back in 2007 or 2008 if you would ask me to explain in the most simple terms what NRG did to make money, I would have told you that we sell coal and uranium at natural gas prices. And while I still believe that for the most part in most markets, it\u2019s preferable to sell coal and uranium at natural gas prices than it is say to sell natural gas at natural gas prices, NRG has in the ensuing five years become so much more in just a natural gas commodity play. As illustrated on slide 4, we have grown our economic gross margin by 70% over those five years all in a relentlessly subdued natural gas price environment while reducing the contribution of natural gas exposed margin by roughly 30%. This is a trend both in terms of growing gross margin and reducing natural gas price correlation that we are working hard to perpetuate. So in a market like we have seen over the past few months, where natural gas has again declined to under $3 per million BTU, we remind you that NRG is not just a natural gas story but it\u2019s increasingly an investment in the clean energy future which means among other attributes that we are built to weather volatility in gas prices while preserving the upside in the power markets when they materialize. Moving to slide 5, because I\u2019ve referenced our Investor Day and recognize that not all of you were able to join us in Houston, let me close by reiterating what we took 7 hours to tell you down there into 70 seconds. Here is my pitch and hopefully this becomes your NRG investment thesis. Our industry is in the early, but unmistakable stage of a technology driven disruption of historic proportion. This disruption ultimately is going to end in a radically transformed energy industry where the winners are going to be that those who offer their customers whether they be commercial, industrial or individual customers, a seamless energy solution that is safer cleaner and more reliable, more convenient, and increasingly wireless. And I might add just generally more personally and what is currently being offered to energy consumers through our current commanding control centralized one size fits all, wire and wooden pole system invented by Thomas Edison and seemingly last improved upon in his era. NRG through our multiple initiatives in the Smart Home with Home Solar distributed generation reliability solutions micro grids, electric vehicle charging in portable solar and energy storage products is positioning itself to win this long term future in a way that no other power company is attempting. In the short-to-medium term, we continue to execute across our consolidated and unrivaled asset platform in a manner that will allow us to win the next few years as the power plants of the Post World War II era create a retirement tsunami washing across our core markets that will benefit us as one of the last man standing. Thanks to our substantial investment in environmental remediation over the past 10 years. With that I will turn it over to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. The extreme market conditions that prevailed in 2014 highlighted some of the strength of our integrated platform. Our diverse fleet in the Northeast benefited from the severe cold weather earlier in the year and our integrated wholesale retail platform combined with our commercial and operational performance help mitigate the impact of a very mild summer and allowed us to deliver our 2014 financial results. Perhaps more relevant to you today is the fact that we aggressively hedged the portfolio for 2015 during the fourth quarter allowing us to reaffirm guidance. While it is still early in the year, I am pleased to say that we are off to a good start with a solid performance during the most recent quarter. Slide 7 returns to goals that I provided to you last year and as you can see with the levered across the board on our safety operational and commercial metrics. We successfully integrated Edison Mission\u2019s 8 gigawatt portfolio delivered on operational synergies and announced a comprehensive asset optimization plan for the mid-west fleet at attractive economics. On our distributor generation efforts, we successfully integrated the Omaha District Energy System and were awarded a contract for 178 megawatt for preferred resources in California. We now have a full suite of distributive solutions for businesses. These combined with our commercial wholesale platform and access to low cost capital through Energy Yield, positions the growth for a significant growth in 2015. You will hear more about these efforts in the months to come. The critical part of our strategy is the repositioning of our portfolio to out survive the current way of retirements and benefits from changes in capacity markets and repowering opportunities. Slide 8 provides a summary of our comprehensive asset optimization and development plan. We current have close to 12,000 megawatts of generation targeted for fuel conversions, environmental retrofits or repowering opportunities. These initiatives are consistent with our goals of streamlining cost, maintaining or expanding field diversity, reducing the environmental foot print of our portfolio and extending the economic life of asset. The projects are progressing as planned, but some of them are driven primarily by capacity revenues. The outcome of the upcoming capacity performance auction in PJM could change our plans going forward. Turning to our operational metrics on slide 9 and beginning with our most important metrics, safety. I want to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues for another great year of safety performance finishing in the top quartile. We have 128 out of 161 facilities without a reportable injury. This is an outstanding result considering the significant winter conditions in the east and the Edison Mission integration efforts beginning in April. It was the second best performance in the last eight years at a rate of 0.73. While our fleet continues to grow in size and diversity the one constant continues to be our strong safety performance. I want to recognize our distributor group for a perfect safety record with fewer recordable injuries. Well done. Our overall generation was up 4% year-over-year on a normalized basis despite the lack of summer demand. The increase was driven primarily by higher generation in the west, the record production year at STP Unit 2 and the higher runs experienced during the polar vortex in the east. This highlights the importance of our well diversified portfolio. We continue to balance operational performance with marginal risk and overall spend throughout this low commodity price environment. Our coal and nuclear availability was down year-over-year to 82%. However, the fleet showed strong performance during peak pricing periods. This is evident in the improved year-over-year coal and nuclear reliability performance. In the third and final year of the current fornrg program we leveraged best practices from the operational synergies efforts in the general facilities and expanded that for the rest of the organization. We achieved an outstanding result of $198 million for the year, compared to a goal of $100 million. This success was driven primarily by improvement delivered by plant operations and Texas retail. Thank you to you all, of our colleagues who provide the commitment and execution behind our continuous improvement culture. We are confident we can continue to deliver the same value to our shareholders in the next iteration of the fornrg Program. Moving to our market update on slide 10, I want to start with natural gas, given the recent decline in prices. As David mentioned, we have been very successful in diversifying our margins away from natural gas, but it continues to be an important driver, so let me share a few thoughts. In the start of the Shale gas revolution six years ago the industry has focused almost exclusively on the amount of supply flooding the market. While impressive by any standards there has been very few catalysts on the demand side until now. Over the next few years gas demand will likely see a swift change coming primarily from four sources, the power industry, LNG, Exports to Mexico, and industrial demand. This incremental demand would commence earlier this year with additional coal to gas switching and the implementation of more stringent environmental regulations that will drive coal and oil retirement. Our current head position allows us to weather this low commodity cycle and be ready for a more favorable market environment. Turning to the east markets, the IFOs are redefining the capacity products and requiring generators to perform during shortage conditions. The changes will allow for higher compensation, but will also hold them for higher penalties for non-performance. As a generator with a large diverse portfolio, strong operational track record, and fuel onsite we support and welcome these improvements. The result from the recent New England capacity auction for 1819 were quite encouraging with prices increased significantly year-over-year. PJM still awaiting resolution from FERC on each proposal, which is expected to happen sometime in early April. We are excited about our prospects for our portfolio with 17 gigawatts of generation in the region, not only for the many option, but also for the transition auctions for the year that have already cleared. The recent coal front in the northeast once again proved the value of our diversified portfolio where unlike gas generation our coal and oil assets benefited from spikes in gas and power prices. Our strategies extent the life of our assets and maintain a cheap option on energies that can benefit from short-term dislocations in the market like the once we experienced in the past two winters.  Now moving onto Texas on slide 11, demand grew by 2.4% on a weather normalized basis in 2014, driven primarily by the residential and commercial sectors. While low oil prices will undoubtedly have an impact on the Texas economy. This will be somewhat muted by the diversification that Texas has been able to achieve in recent years. A lot has been said about the robust demand in Texas and the need to build new generation, but given the implementation of new environmental programs like maps, CSAPR, and EPAs proposed regional hedgerow [ph] for Texas it is important to talk about the potential impact to the supply stock. Make no mistake, we expect coal to be impacted by these regulations. But as you can see in the table, our portfolio is well positioned to comply with these rules and not only out survive the competition but benefit from the retirement of our units. That leaves me to the forward market where prices seem to reflect very little risk premium for the next few summers as you can see on the upper right hand chart. For the past three years, we have experienced no scarcity pricing despite having single digit operational reserve margins every year. From our perspective, Texas fundamental remain robust and you will not take much change in the supply demand balance to lead to scarcity pricing in the near term. Turning to our hedge disclosures on slide 12, we increased our hedges prior to the winter which insulated us from the recent drop in natural gas prices. 2015 is well hedged leaving us in good shape to weather the current downturn. We expect to see some coal to gas switching but the financial impact will be muted for us. Just like we did in 2012, we are diligently working with fuel and transportation suppliers to ensure that our coal plants remain competitive during this extreme low natural gas price environment. Finally, our goals for 2015 are pretty clear; execute on our asset optimization and development plan, and grow our distributor generation business by leveraging our wholesale portfolio. With that, I will turn it over to Steve for the NRG Home review. Steve McBee : Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning everyone. As we discussed recently at our Investor Conference in Houston and as David mentioned this morning in his remarks, it\u2019s our view at NRG that traditional centralized energy service models are significantly at risk. We believe that the future eventually will belong to demand driven decentralized models of service that empower individual consumers through sustainable energy solutions that are affordable, personalized, convenient and reliable. NRG Home will continue to serve our customers through a robust traditional retail electric service franchise while at the same time position the business to win in a world where we believe at growing share of the market is going to want and expect to generate and manage a larger share of their own energy. As you can see from the data on page 14, our strong performance in 2014 positions us well to achieve both our near and longer term strategic and financial objective. Our Home Retail platform delivered at the upper end of our original financial guidance with adjusted EBITDA of $604 million enabled in part by customer and product growth as well as by our ongoing commitment to continuous operational improvement to drive material reduction both in per customer cost and in bad debt. Our recurring customer account grew by 28% driven primarily by the Dominion acquisition which included customer contracts in the Northeast as well as the Cirro business in Texas. We are pleased with the success of the Dominion acquisition which beat estimates of earnings and customer count delivered in 2014. We expect to continue to report the Dominion customer contracts separately to 2015 as many of the Northeast customers will roll off during the year\u2019s precious term contracts expire. Our customer growth also positions us retail business to accelerate and deepen cross selling of new products and services that will strengthen our business going forward. In that regard, we are exciting that our Home Retail platform which currently provides retail electricity and Home Solar will be in the market with new offerings this year that include portable power solutions, new battery products, and a variety of additional home services. In 2014, NRG Home also established NRG Home Solar, a leading residential platform formed to the combination of NRG\u2019s legacy residential solar solutions team and the acquisition of RDS and of Pure Energies. We ended the year with over 13,000 Home Solar customers. Our success in ramping the business was a result of rapid and successful integration of our new and legacy Home Solar businesses, our strong kitchen table and telephone sales capabilities, our ability to leverage our key strategic partnerships and our ability to integrate additional NRG home services into our conventional Home Solar offering. We also demonstrated early cross selling success between Home Solar and Home Retail with about 50% of eligible Home Solar customers supplementing their solar production with NRG\u2019s retail electricity. The strong foundation established for a residential solar business in 2014 positions us to be a top tier player in this rapidly growing space in 2015 and beyond. If you flip to page 15, I\u2019ll quickly outline our priorities for 2015 before turning it over to Kirk. In 2015, we are confident that we will deliver on our Home Retail financial expectations and that we will establish our Home Solar business as a tier 1 player in the rapidly growing residential solar market. We will also operationalize the NRG Home platform towards our longer term goal of strengthening per customer EBITDA by further accelerating cross sell systems that increase tenure and by establishing common operating systems wherever we can to continue to incrementally reduce cost structure, and we will seek and pursue opportunities to scale our organic customer advantage and to enrich our existing product portfolio as we position NRG Home to become the dominant brand for clean and sustainable personal power solutions and services. Thank you very much for your time this morning. And with that, I will turn it over to Kirk. Kirkland Andrews : Thank you, Steve. Getting with the financial summary on slide 17, NRG is reporting fourth quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA of $625 million, with $382 million from Business & Renew, or $165 million from Home Retail, a $34 million negative contribution from Home Solar as we continue to position that business for growth, and $114 million from NRG Yield. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.128 billion with $2.134 billion from Business & Renew combined, $604 million from Home Retail, a full year of negative contribution from Home Solar of $65 million, and $455 million from NRG Yield. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, Business & Renew performance was down $26 million primarily from milder weather but partially offset by the acquisition of the EME assets, full commercial operation of CVSR and Ivanpah in 2014, and lower operating cost across the fleet. Retail EBITDA was lower by $15 million also driven by milder weather which was partially offset from the incremental margin from increased customers following the Dominion acquisition. Yield results improved by $21 million driven by the acquisition of the Alta Wind assets while we increased our investment in Home Solar by $32 million in the fourth quarter as compared to 2013. Free cash flow before growth totaled $951 million for the full year with $139 million inflow in the fourth quarter. Turning your attention to our 2015 guidance and as discussed at our Investor Day, given our hedge levels, we are again reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion which now excludes the expected negative contribution of $100 million from investment in our growing Home Solar business. Free cash flow before growth guidance is also reaffirmed as we continue to expect between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2015. Turning to slide 18, I\u2019d like to review a shareholder proposal by NRG Yield which is contained in the preliminary proxy statement filed by Yield last evening. This proposal which has been recommended by the NRG Yield independent directors and has the full support of NRG involves an important recapitalization of NRG Yield intended to achieve two important objectives. First, to preserve and maintain the strong strategic support of NRG Yield by NRG; and second, to enhance NRG Yield\u2019s flexibility to efficiently access capital to fund growth without the need for capital allocation by NRG towards additional investment in NRG Yield. This proposal which requires the vote of a majority of the Class A shares of NRG Yield involves the creation of two classes of low vote NRG Yield stock which will be issued through a recapitalization of Yield\u2019s equity. NRG Yield would intend to use this new low vote as its primary means of raising equity capital to fund growth going forward. Basically the proposed recapitalization will take the form of 2 :1 stock split of both classes of NRG Yield\u2019s stock. The Class A stock which is held by the public as well as the Class B stock which is held by NRG, thereby doubling the total number of NRG Yield shares outstanding. The new low vote shares will be issued in two distinct classes due to the two classes stock current held by NRG and the public shareholders. NRG totaled approximately 42.7 million Class B shares will receive an equal number of Class D shares each with 1/100th voting right. As NRG\u2019s economic interest is held exclusively through its direct interest in NRG Yield LLC, the new low vote Class E shares to be issued in NRG will have no economic rights. Each Class A shares held by the public will receive one share of Class C stock with the same economic rights as the Class A stock and a 1/100th voting right.  Immediately following the stock split, each shareholder will through their combined ownership of the classes of stock at the exact same economic and voting rights as they do today. Going forward NRG yield will be able to issue third party equity using C shares to fund acquisitions without the need for investment by NRG, as these types of acquisitions are best suited for NRG yield, while the focus of NRG\u2019s capital allocation to fund growth is focused on other core areas.  The enhanced flexibility this provides is consistent with the rationale behind the original creation of NRG yield and preserves the important strategic partnership. NRGs economic ownership will be diluted through future issuances of Class C shares by NRG Yield to help fund growth. However, the proposed plan will allow for approximately $21 billion of equity to be issued based on today\u2019s share price before NRG\u2019s voting interest would fall below 50%, providing substantial headroom for additional equity capital. In addition to the proposed recapitalization plan, NRG has agreed to add additional assets to the Right of First Offer Agreement. This expanded ROFO pipeline provides additional visibility in the NRG Yield to long term dividend growth and total return in order to preserve its low cost of capital advantage. The assets added to the expanded ROFO pipeline include NRG\u2019s Carlsbad and Mandalay repowering projects, recently awarded in the ongoing RFOs for new contract to generation in California. Following CPUC approval, NRG will develop and construct these assets, which at COD may be offered to NRG yield, providing additional asset diversity in the years beyond the expected completion of the original ROFO pipeline. These types of projects enabled by and a testament to the strength of the NRG and NRG Yield partnership underscore the need for the enhanced flexibility for proposed recapitalization we will provide. In terms of next steps, NRG Yield expects to file and distribute a definite proxy statement on/or about March 26. NRG Yield has conditioned the proposal so it does require the approval of majority of the Class A shareholders at its Annual Meeting on May 5 of this year. NRG strongly supports the proposal as approved by the independent directors of NRG Yield and we ask for the support of the public shareholders of NRG Yield in this important step in building on the tremendous success of the NRG, NRG Yield relationship. Finally updating our capital allocation progress on slide 19, NRG ended 2014 with an excess cash balance of $1.26 billion. This excess cash balance, which is net of minimum cash at NRG GenOn and NRG Yield when combined with NRG\u2019s increased 2015 free cash flow before growth investment guidance leads to $2.46 billion in consolidated cash available for allocation during 2015. Of this amount, we have committed nearly $1.7 billion of capital, including $250 million or approximately 20% of our 2015 free cash flow to be returned to shareholders through the combination of our recently completed stock buyback program announced last December, and a 4% increase in our annual dividend. Our growth investments guidance of $900 million for 2015 is primarily driven by operational improvement initiatives across the fleet. Approximately $150 million of investment in Home Solar installations, as well as continued investments in Solar, Carbon 360 and eVgo. $800 million in remaining cash available for allocation, which is prior to any proceeds from NRG Yield drop downs in 2015 consisted $600 million at the GenOn level versus intended to fund our ongoing fuel conversation initiatives with the remaining $200 million at the NRG level. Importantly, this balance does not reflect the impact of NRG Yield dropdowns in 2015. As we intend to offer NRG Yield, the next portfolio of ROFO assets, which we expect to consist of the remaining wind assets from the EME acquisition during the first half of 2015. The capital replenishment from this transaction will further increase NRG\u2019s excess capital. Specifically, when combined with the residential solar lease drop down, currently under evaluation at NRG Yield, the proceeds from the wind assets are expected to generate between $250 million and $300 million in cash to NRG. Once this drop down is finalized in the first half of the year, we will revisit further capital allocation decisions based on conditions and opportunities at that time, which maybe further augmented by a second ROFO portfolio likely the remaining in stake in CBSR in late 2015. With that I will turn it back to David for his closing remarks. David Crane : Thank you Kirk. Let me close by turning to slide 21. Every year on this call I set forth my overarching goals across the enterprise so that you can follow our progress during the year. Given the reorientation of NRG into the NRG Group of companies, this year I\u2019m providing our key goals, or summarizing our key goals in the context of each of our businesses. Now in the sphere of my opening remarks because we have taken up a lot of your time already, I will spear you from going through each of these sets of goals, but I will leave with the following. We remain steadfast as in orientation delivering on our commitments and while there are many goals on this page, we hope in excess effect that by the end of the year many of the newer initiatives that we have been nurturing and growing over the past few years will reach a size in the level of momentum where they will start to have a meaningful positive value impact on the overall NRG group alongside the intrinsic value of our almost 50,000 megawatts of conventional generation and our nearly 3 million retail customers. And with that, Kevin, we are happy to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Capital. Angie Storozynski : Yeah thank you. I have two questions here. First of all on the new share structure at NRG Yield, I mean it seems relatively complex and I\u2019m a little bit struggling here why wouldn\u2019t NRG be willing to simply accept a share of future equity issuances from NRG Yield, I mean in lieu maybe for cash and that way you could maintain not only your voting rights, but also the economic interest and best cash flow that will be flowing from NRG Yield. So, why wouldn\u2019t you want to actually keep the share of cash going forward? David Crane : Angie do you want to give us your second question too, so we can get time to think about. Angie Storozynski : Yeah the second one is about residential solar, so it seems like NRG Yield would be just a tax equity investor in those projects and also it seems like you might have actually augmented the size of the residential portfolio since the Analyst Day. Thank you. David Crane : Well, so I think Kirk is going to answer the first question and half the second in terms of - I think you had a question about the growth trajectory of Home Solar as well? Angie Storozynski : Yes. David Crane : Yes, so Kelcy will address that as well, but Kirk can you go ahead. Kirkland Andrews : Sure. Angie the first part of your question as I think you know largely due to the successful equity issuance to fund the Alta Wind acquisition that being a third party acquisition, our current ownership stake in NRG Yield was about 55% and while we recognized the possibility at the offset that when we dropped down assets in the NRG Yield we may take some portion of that consideration in kind, it is a different proposition entirely to consider the possibility of incremental cash investment in NRG Yield to help support that ownership relationship. What I mean by that is if you extrapolate it forward on a potential third party acquisition the size of the Alta Wind for example, in order for NRG to remain - to maintain its 50% plus ownership that would require NRG to actually allocate capital and invest in Yield equity, effectively investing in those types of projects over the long run and while certainly those projects are financially compelling. It was a very motivation behind the creation of NRG Yield to separate those kind of investments so that they reside in a vehicle that\u2019s properly positioned for that kind of risk in a return profile. So - because those assets are high EBITDA multiple that would be tandem out to NRG investing capital or allocating capital towards a high EBITDA multiple. This allows us to allocate that capital appropriately towards the types of investments conventional in the life and towards some of the growth initiatives at NRG that are more appropriately our core focus. I think on the second part of your question although I think we\u2019ve outlined the structure within the relationship between NRG and NRG Yield the important distinction here is we plan of tax equity financings, primarily the tax attributes from residential solar leases as they drop down to NRG Yield.  NRG Yield\u2019s participation in that is actually investing in the residual equity after tax equity. So, NRG Yield is not providing tax equity and using tax equity allows us to manage effectively the duration of that tax holiday or that tax run way if you will. We have the flexibility from time to time to drop down assets without tax attributes giving NRG Yield the ability to augment its tax yielding ability, but I think given the nature of the broader portfolio we use tax equity to out manage that. David Crane : Kelcy, do you like to say about sales. Kelcy Pegler : Sure. So in 2014, we\u2019ve really focused on building out and optimizing our platform for the residential solar space as we talked about in Investors Day, and we finished 2014 with over 13,000 cumulative customers of which 9,000 were acquired in 2014. As we look forward to \u201915, we will continue this momentum and we continue to target 35,000 to 40,000 cumulative customers for 2015. Angie Storozynski : Okay and then just one follow-up to that again David, the recapitalization of NRG Yield, should we imply from it that there is basically a big third party acquisition coming that you don\u2019t want to chip in with cash and hence the change in the share structure. David Crane : Angie, Angie, Angie. Do you know, we never comment on anything that\u2026 Angie Storozynski : I have to try. David Crane : May or may not be happening, but having said that I won\u2019t comment on it \u2013 I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s the right premise in terms of any specific thing. This recapitalization is just forward-looking looking at how suboptimal it is to use high cost NRG equity capital in NRG Yield, but we are trying to maintain alignment on the control side. I would say though while you\u2019re not going to wake up tomorrow and read about some massive NRG Yield acquisition, it is a target rich environment for NRG Yield, small, medium, large, there is a lot of things knocking about. So we are active in that market, but this was not driven by any specific transaction that may or may not happen. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning. David Crane : Morning. Greg Gordon : Looking at the full year results and then trying to compare them back to the third quarter guidance ranges for the segments and then bridging for the new segments, just want to make sure I am reading correctly that Business/Renew came in more or less inside the range but it looks like you\u2019re may be still a little bit more upfront on Home Solar and you are initially projected and came in a little light in Retail. Is that the correct read or the wrong read because while the outlook for \u201915 looks great, you came in on a low side of the guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth in \u201914. Kirkland Andrews : Sure. Greg, its Kirk. And I am just referring you back to some of my remarks at the Investor Day presentation where we went through recasting the components of those segments. We\u2019ve recast the segments on a historic basis in 2014 to reflect Home Retail as oppose to what we used to call for Retail. That segment that was Retail that was comprised of our guidance contain about $50 million of EBITDA from the C&I business. That $50 million, that portion of our performance, is now reflected in the business segments. So that $604 million you see from Retail in 2014 is simply the mass retail component of that. And yes, the $65 million in negative EBITDA contribution from Home Solar is slightly ahead of what we expected, but that was due to some advanced investments in cost initiatives and marketing like as we position ourselves continually to realize that significant growth objective in 2015. Greg Gordon : Great. And on that front, it does seem to appear that you\u2019re slightly ahead of plan in terms of the number of Home Solar customers you signed up into the end of the year, is that right or not? Kirkland Andrews : I think we are right within the ballpark of the growth trajectory through the full year of 2015. Greg Gordon : Great. And the cross selling opportunities you mentioned earlier, are they significantly accretive to the base case plan you laid out. Are you seeing more cross selling opportunities than you would have expected in the base case plan at this juncture or is it more or less along the trend of that plan? David Crane : Greg, I would think that the way you should think about cross selling and I got to tell you the number of ways within our company that see cross selling opportunity is the number of permutations and combinations. I mean the obvious one may be between system power retail and solar power, but the correlation between solar power, Home Solar and electric vehicle charging is a 58% correlation. But in terms of impacting our results, what I would tell you right now is, we feel in the cross selling area that we have to prove with you and get it to a scale where it\u2019s actually having impact before we start asking you to value it. And I will say right now, we will consider ourselves more in the demonstration phase. Kelcy is working with Elizabeth, they\u2019re going to be working with the electric vehicle charging folks and so we are just proving things out and we are just telling you that stay tuned. Kirk, do you? Kirkland Andrews : Yeah. I think, Greg, one of your questions about our performance in 2014 if I recall I think I may have missed addressing the question you had on free cash flow, is that correct? Greg Gordon : Yeah. Kirkland Andrews : Yes. Our free cash flow before growth in 2014 of $951, obviously that\u2019s within the range of guidance we provided obviously towards the lower end of that range. That\u2019s primarily due to the fact that despite when we guided in the third quarter in anticipation of potential colder weather learning from the lessons and the success we had of the polar vortex. We chose to make some additional investments in a be prepared strategy specifically in our fuel inventory going into 2015 actually around oil in anticipation of potential colder weather, and that\u2019s primarily the reason why the free cash flow before growth for 2014 although within our range was trending toward the lower end. Greg Gordon : Got it. Thank you guys. Kirkland Andrews : You bet. David Crane : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with UBS. Paul Zimbardo : Hi, thank you, good morning. David Crane : Good morning, Paul. Paul Zimbardo : A follow-up question on the proposed change in share classes? Just a high level question, where there any kind of lessons learned from some of the subsequent yield curves that you tried to add to the structure or was there some reason why you didn\u2019t opt to try and add some permutation of incentive distribution right. Kirkland Andrews : Well, I think in terms of the other structures that are out there, I think we feel comfortable with the incremental impact on the governance perspective that\u2019s quite in line with the governance provisions contained in some of the yield curves that followed. But as I\u2019ve said a number of times, our primary goal is to ensure that NRG Yield has a maximum competitive advantage and low cost of capital. And from our perspective, the best means to do is for NRG Yield to realize the maximum incremental potential CAFD without the drag if you will of an IDR. The other element of that is that the NRG level because the IDR would basically be cash flow or EBITDA back to NRG which obviously goes back to an entity with a lower EBITDA multiple, we wanted to maximize that portion of the cash flows that was associated with those contracted plans to ensure that it traded at the higher valuation. And we think the absence of an IDR addresses that issue as well as the fact it ensures the NRG Yield can be more competitive and we will have a competitive advantage from a realization of accretion relative to some of the other competitors out there whose IDRs can deter or detract from the accretion when we compete for assets and third party market. David Crane : Hey, Paul, can I just add something more general to what Kirk saying because this question of IDR, while Kirk just tried to explain the IDR is about 16 times and I am just mentally and capable of understanding. But I would tell you in general terms when it comes to yield curves, we monitor closely all the activity in the general yield coal market. And it seems to me and you probably could tell me, you can certainly tell me better if this is true or not that the market is now to the point where as oppose to buying every yield curve that comes out, they are starting to differentiate between quality yield curves and lesser quality. And we are committed at NRG that NRG Yield is going to be a top quality yield curve. So on every basic metric that the yield community is looking at, we want ours to be in the top tier and so we are constantly following the situation, that\u2019s goal and we\u2019re going to stick to it. Paul Zimbardo : Okay great, thanks. I appreciate the color. And then a follow-up question on the Home Retail and Home Solar, for the target of the 35,000 to 40,000 customers, is that based primarily on conversion and cross selling of existing customers or is that expansion to new customers. David Crane : Kelcy? Kelcy Pegler : No, it\u2019s not based on cross selling. I think the cross selling initiatives that Elizabeth and I are working with Steve on are really in the developmental phase where we are getting proof of concept. The customer count of the 35,000 to 40,000 in \u201915 is not based on the cross selling initiatives. Paul Zimbardo : Okay, great. Thank you very much for the time. David Crane : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Good morning. David Crane : Steven. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to start on Texas and just get your thinking on environmental regulations, looks like your coal fleet is in very good shape. Just curious as you think about all of the rules that are coming down the road here CSAPR and regional haze and clean power. Which in your mind are likely to be most impactful to your competition and what\u2019s the general timeframe we should be thinking about in terms of the impact to your competition in the state? David Crane : Steven, thanks for the question and Mauricio is going to do the heavy lifting and answer the question. But I do want to say as a general rule may be for some of the investors on the phone that don\u2019t follow this space as closely as you, because all of these environmental regulations either proposed in the court stay federal level, it\u2019s very complicated. But I would say to you a general rule, even with the coal plants that we own because of our investment in the back and controls as you alluded to in Texas.  For us as well as the rules that are imposed in a fair and reasonable way, tightening environmental regulations actually enhances relative to our competition. So with that general statement as to your specific question about I think you asked what is the most impactful of the environmental rules that may or may not come back. And is your question specifically about Texas or across the fleet? Stephen Byrd : Texas. David Crane : Okay. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey, Stephen, good morning. Stephen Byrd : Morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : I think from our perspective and your question was the most impactful to our competitors. Stephen Byrd : Really more to your competitors and thinking about\u2026 Mauricio Gutierrez : I think it was primarily our competitors given that as you already alluded and we tried to highlight that on our earnings slide. Our portfolio is pretty well positioned to comply with both maps, CSAPR and I think the latest one is regional haze. I think it\u2019s fair to say that regional haze will have a significant impact on our competitors and not necessarily at NRG. With respect to Parish, we don\u2019t think that is going to be applicable because even if we install scrubbers don\u2019t have a significant impact on visibility. So take Parish shop and Langston will require minimal upgrades on the scrubbers that we have today. So I mean all of them will have some impact, right. The question is the timeline and the implementation of all these rules. But I think during Investor Day, we actually quantify the potential impact of each of these regulations on coal markets and what I would say is, most of that impact will happen on coal plants that are not owned by NRG. Stephen Byrd : Okay, great. Thank you very much. David Crane : Thanks, Stephen. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Yeah, hi, good morning. David Crane : Hi, Steve. Steven Fleishman : Hi, couple of quick ones. First, at the Analyst Day I think you said you are tracking to the upper half of the 2015 guidance range. I don\u2019t think I heard you say that again, is that still true? David Crane : To correct the record, we actually said to the upper most quartile. So, okay, Kirk, Steve Fleishman has called you out. What you\u2019re going to say now? Kirkland Andrews : Yes, Steve. You can infer which I\u2019ll confirm right now by reaffirming our guidance that we also did on the Investor Day that, yes, our expectations are still consistent with that upper quartile. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. David Crane : Steve, what I deal with here, how hard it is to get him to say something. Steven Fleishman : And then just on the new structure for NRG Yield, I guess it\u2019s for Kirk, will you still be consolidating it from an accounting standpoint and also does it change anyway that it\u2019s treated from credit rating standpoint for you guys? Kirkland Andrews : First of all, we don\u2019t expect that to have much of an impact on the credit rating although early days and so we get some feedbacks from the rating agency, but I would not expect that to have an impact other than the fact that obviously it doesn\u2019t entail or give some greater transparency of the lack of at least necessity for capital allocation towards maintaining that ownership by buying more NRG Yield shares if you will. So I don\u2019t expect that to be the case.  And forgive me, Steve, would you remain me your other question? Steven Fleishman : Accounting consolidation. Kirkland Andrews : Oh sure, yes. Because this structure is really a structure that impacts economics and not vote and it is vote that is the determinant of consolidation from a GAAP perspective, we will continue to consolidate NRG Yield going forward. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then lastly, I think Mauricio mentioned on the repowering and the like something about GCP capacity auction outcome maybe being reported to data point for some of them at least and continuing them, could you elaborate a little bit more on that? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Steven. Good morning. As we articulated on the Investor Day, we are looking at repositioning the portfolio particularly around field conversions and environmental CapEx. And as you can appreciate, some of those investments are focused primarily on capacity revenues. So the outcome of the capacity performance auction is pretty important. Now, we are encouraged by the data point that the most recent New England capacity auction provided to us. So while we have all the economic analysis and we have put out \u2013 we have outlined the asset optimization plan, we want to have some certainty in terms of what is the final rule and I guess the rules of the game before we make any incremental capital commitment. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. David Crane : Thanks, Steve. And Kevin, we want to end really at 10 o'clock as we have a 10 :30 NRG Yield call, and we got some things to do in the meantime. So we will take two more questions please. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold : Hi guys. Quick one on, you are not going to need to purchase more NRG Yield shares, but could you and under what circumstances might you consider selling down some of your interest post the conversion or should we just anticipate that the ownership percentage of decline is yield growth? Kirkland Andrews : Addressing that reverse order, yes, that is what the expectation is, is that our ownership stake will reduce overtime as NRG Yield issues equity, not as NRG sells down equity. The latter of those two is not our intention, however just to be clear the structure affords us the ability to do so. We have to convert the units that we own into shares but that is not our intention at this time moving forward. Jonathan Arnold : Thanks. Is the split is simply just for liquidity and future issuance optimization, is that right? Kirkland Andrews : Basically, yes, that\u2019s right. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Thank you. David Crane : Thanks, Jonathan. So last question. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Gregg Orrill : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just following up on the Carlsbad comments, you said you expect that to come online in fall of \u201917. Just I guess may be more specifically how do you expect to run the facility and how much would your \u2013 the powering cost and how should we think about the benefits of that? Kirkland Andrews : Sure, Gregg. It\u2019s Kirk. We haven\u2019t yet provided the capital cost of that. The best thing that I can give you is that, the Carlsbad project is a little over 600 megawatts in total size for that. And the one thing I can say is that and I provided guidance similar to this when folks have asked us about some of the conventional plants that were in the ROFO portfolio and how to think about things like CAFD. And certainly we expect the project to finance that using a construction facility in permanent amortizing loan in similar fashion we\u2019ve done in the past. My expectation is that the cash available for distribution or the equity cash flows coming off of that project will be similar on average cash flow per megawatt basis. And to give you a sense if you look back and I\u2019ve made these remarks before in addressing this question with respect to the assets that are in NRG Yield today, that range on our equity cash flow or CAFD per megawatt basis is in the $35 to $45 kw range. Gregg Orrill : Thank you. David Crane : So, Kevin, I think we are reaching the top of the hour. So I just want to thank everyone for participating in the call and for those who are going to participate in the NRG Yield call at 10 :30, I am not sure there will be all that much more new information there, but at least you will get to see us wearing our NRG Yield hats if you choose to join. And thank you very much and we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NRG Energy First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Matthew Orendorff, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matt Orendorff - Managing Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's first quarter 2015 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located on the Investors Relations section of our website at www.nrg.com, under Presentations & Webcasts. Because this call will be limited to one hour, we ask that you limit yourself to only one question with one follow up question. As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor statement provided in today's presentation, as well as the risk factors contained in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. During this morning's call, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures of the company's operating and financial results. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release and this presentation. And with that, I will now turn the call over to David Crane, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As always, joining me today and participating in the presentation are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Additionally, and available for questions are Chris Moser, who heads our Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, who's the head of Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., who's the head of Home Solar. Somewhat unusually, we're actually communicating with you from multiple locations, so if we run into some technological issues, please bear with us. We've got a lot of great news to update you on today, and I realize we're starting slightly later than normal and during market hours, so we're going to get right into it and try and get through it as quickly as we can, give you all of the information you need. Starting on slide three of the presentation, the story of NRG's first quarter 2015 is quite simple : record financial performance, $840 million of adjusted EBITDA, breaking our previous record which was set just last year. This achievement is truly remarkable given that that previous high in 2014 had received a substantial boost from the polar vortex which occurred in January of that year. But what's even more remarkable is that we beat the existing record in the face of very, very soft wholesale pricing in our core markets. Average on-peak prices in PJM in the first quarter of 2015 were just 50% of what they were in the first quarter of 2014. In ERCOT, in the first quarter, the average on-peak prices were just 40% of what they were last year. In my mind and hopefully in yours, this is proof positive of the superiority of our integrated wholesale/retail business model. But of course, the right business model only gets you to the starting line. Our record first quarter performance is entirely attributable to the superb execution of our Plant Operations and Commercial Operations teams from the first day of the quarter to the last, so I wanted to publicly thank Mauricio, Chris Moser, Fran Sullivan and their respective teams for a quarter very well done. And I especially want to thank Elizabeth Killinger and her entire team at NRG Retail for simply hitting the ball out of the park with the stunning $166 million of adjusted EBITDA. Moving to slide four, I want to note a couple critical issues on the slide that Mauricio and Kirk will cover more completely in their sections of the presentation. We realize that we're talking in the midst of a persistently challenging commodity price environments and NRG's conventional businesses are for the most part exposed to commodity price curve-based valuation. For that reason, it has become common in the market over the past several years for analysts to evaluate businesses like ours on an open EBITDA basis. While I have no particular problem intellectually or otherwise with open EBITDA analysis, it obviously fails to take into account the value of a savvy hedging program well executed on a timely basis. And that is what we have at NRG and that's what we've demonstrated. For years, it's been the strategy of NRG to smooth out as much of the downward price curve volatility as we can through this active baseload hedging program. This quarter has been no exception. I'm very pleased with what our hedging team has accomplished, both with respect to the balance of 2015 and into 2016. As you all know, spot natural gas prices are indeed very low in particular, but we have seen this movie before back in 2012. We did okay then, and I'm confident we will do okay again now. And we'll navigate our way through this trough successfully thanks in significant part to the hedging program that Mauricio will shine some light on later. The other topic I address on this slide, which also will be touched upon by both Mauricio and Kirk, is cash flow and capital expenditures. NRG always has been a cash flow generative machine. And indeed from the beginning of the new NRG era in 2003, I told our investors that we always would manage NRG for cash, and that has not changed. It has, however, been obscured recently by the fact that we are right in the middle of a three-year spike in our CapEx, arising largely out of the GenOn and EME acquisitions, as we spend an unusually large amount on major maintenance, environmental remediation, fuel conversions, and repowerings of our expanded fleet. While we're not yet quite at the end of the tunnel with respect to this program, we are almost over the hump. Mauricio will show how the reinvestment program wraps up in 2016. And come 2017, NRG shareholders will experience the twin benefit, both of the EBITDA generated by those repowered and converted assets and also of the substantially greater free cash available for other allocations. Since we do expect to have substantially more capital to allocate, I think it's long past time that we, and particularly me, provide you with some simplified clarity as to how we think about capital allocation at NRG in the past and into the foreseeable future. So if you turn to slide five, you will see two simple ways to think about capital allocation at NRG, what we call the 70%/20%/10% principle and the one-third rule, or the thirds rule. First, with respect to 70%/20%/10%, since NRG embarked on its present strategic course four years to five years ago, namely to continue to consolidate and flourish in the conventional power sector while positioning ourselves as an early mover in clean energy, we settled on a rough rule-of-thumb for our capital expenditures : 70% reinvestment in the assets and businesses that generate the preponderance of our current cash flow, 20% invested as equity capital in contracted assets that constitute the best and most realizable growth opportunities for NRG in the post-merchant era, and 10% invested into more speculative, early mover projects and businesses that have the potential to meaningfully expand the universe of opportunities for our business. When describing the 70%/20%/10% rule internally, which is something we actually do a lot, it's not uncommon for us to draw the analogy to allocation of labor in agriculture. 70% of the time spent on harvesting, 20% of the time spent growing, and 10% planting seeds. While 70%/20%/10% is more a guideline for us than a hard and fast rule, it's a good metric and we believe it has served us and our shareholders well in terms of the current positioning of the company, and we plan to continue with it. We introduce it to you here to help you understand how we are thinking about reinvesting this cash-generative business over the next few years. On the bottom half of slide five, I turn to a more recent and high-quality phenomenon, what to do with the substantial amount of cash proceeds to be returned to NRG as a result of asset dropdowns to NRG Yield. This is a highly relevant issue, as we expect roughly $600 million of dropdowns to NRG Yield to be announced over the balance of 2015. The way we think about this is that the removal on an unconsolidated basis of NRG's contracted and non-commodity exposed cash-generative assets over time from NRG's balance sheet to NRG Yield's balance sheet requires us to think about the pro forma NRG balance sheet left supporting the merchant, i.e., commodity exposed side of our business. Without the contracted assets, it seems to us that the prudent thing to do is some right-sizing of that pro forma balance sheet, with such right-sizing involving both voluntary debt reduction and equity retirement. We also, of course, have to allocate some dropdown proceeds to restocking the pipeline of contracted assets for future dropdowns. As such, and Kirk will explain this further, we are announcing today a third, a third, a third rule associated with the receipt of future dropdown proceeds. On a final note, and to amplify something I said on this topic when we announced the $100 million Phase II of our share buyback program in March, was that we believe, given how much the company's businesses have evolved over the past several years, there remains a significant disconnect and distortion between the company's performance and prospects on one hand and the commodity price curve lens through which Wall Street views us and anticipates our future performance on the other hand. Witness, for example, the fact that we can be announcing here a record first quarter, projecting a full year result well in excess of $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA and clearly becoming a real player in the red-hot home solar space, and our stock is down some 50% since last summer, largely, I believe because we exist in a sub-$3 natural gas price environment. Surely there have been other contributing factors contributing to our abysmal share price performance, some of our own making, some of my own making, but this gas price environment looms largest notwithstanding its demonstrably reduced relevance to our near-term financial performance. With the $80 million we added to the buyback bucket today and the $200 million of dropdown proceeds connected from buybacks that we expect to recharge the buyback program as the year goes on, I want to reiterate that we fully intend to enter the market to snap up our stock when it can be had at the exceptional bargain and current price levels. With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a good start in 2015 with our integrated platform performing exceptionally well during the quarter. A combination of higher retail loads in Texas, opportunistic hedging, and solid operational performance allowed us to once again report record financial results for the quarter. But more importantly, reaffirm guidance for the year. Keep in mind these results were achieved despite the fact that wholesale power prices were 50% lower than last year, underscoring the importance of our integrated platform that performs under multiple price and weather scenarios. During the quarter, we also significantly increased our hedges in 2016, effectively protecting our earnings for the next two years, given our concerns on lower gas prices for this summer. In addition, our wholesale asset optimization and development program, which I will discuss in more detail in a few slides, remains largely on track. Moving to our wholesale operational metrics on slide seven, we had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with 147 out of 167 facilities without a single recordable injury. Total generation was down 12% for the quarter on a pro forma basis, driven primarily by lower generation in the East where power prices were 50% lower than last year. In the Gulf, generation was flat as nuclear and gas generation offset lower coal production. And in the West, generation was impacted by the retirement of our Coolwater plant. Reliability improved during the quarter, demonstrating our efforts to ensure that our units are available when it matters the most, during peak price periods. Over time, these metrics will become more relevant under the new capacity performance construct (13:59). The Operations team remains focused on executing our spring outage season with nearly 173 planned outages, a significant logistical task when you have more than 150 sites across your portfolio. Turning to Home operations on slide eight, I am pleased to report that our Retail business had another strong quarter delivering $166 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding last year's first quarter by $51 million. These results were driven by effective margin and risk management combined with colder than normal weather and lower supply costs. Margins were strong and consistent with last year's quarterly performance despite the addition of lower margin Dominion loads. One year later, we continue to achieve better than expected results from the Dominion acquisition on both customer counts and EBITDA. Our customer count is performing in line with plans, given the anticipated Dominion contract expirations which we expect to be complete by year-end. Additionally, we continued to make progress across our Home Solar segment. During the first quarter, our customer base increased to over 16,000 customers, an increase of 21% at the end of 2014. More importantly, however, during the month of April we entered into a new partnership with NRG Yield and executed on additional tax equity financings to help facilitate our growth through the end of the year. Kirk will discuss these in more detail. Moving on to our market update on slide nine, and starting with the Northeast of the most immediate opportunity for our generation portfolio. As you can see in the left-hand chart, we're seeing very robust forward energy prices in PJM as supply tightens due to stricter environmental regulations benefiting our entire 17-gigawatt portfolio. In the medium term, the opportunity turns from energy to capacity margins with implementation of capacity reforms in PJM and New England, which focuses on higher reliability during shortage conditions. This premium capacity product will most likely result in higher prices in exchange for higher penalties for non-performance. As a generator with a large and diverse portfolio with fuel onsite, we welcome these changes. Furthermore, our fuel conversion and compliance strategy enable us to capitalize on these opportunities. Turning to our costs, I want to highlight the value of our integrated platform as a key differentiator versus solid generators. Not only were we able to outperform during a period of very low commodity prices, but in a time of lower liquidity in the market, we have a natural hedge between our wholesale portfolio and our retail franchise. In the medium term, we believe our portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from a very fragile situation in Texas. Currently, there are two divergent views in the market. ERCOT recently released their latest CDR report where they see reserve margins expanding by 5% in 2018 and beyond and putting them well above target reserve margins. This outlook, from our perspective, is a best case scenario, requiring three assumptions to happen at the same time : low load growth, incremental new supply and zero retirements. We're skeptical about this. Over the past few years, loads grew at an average of 2% on a weather-normalized basis. We expect less than forecasted newbuilds as participants respond rationally to a very depressed forward market, and we expect greater than zero retirements given the challenging price environment and stricter environmental rules. When we do see a supply rationalization, our Texas fleet of surviving coal and gas units will be well-positioned to capture additional value. Moving to our hedging disclosures on slide 10, we have turned our focus to 2016 where we have increased significantly our hedge levels to roughly 75%, effectively reducing our commodity risk and cash flow variations for the next two years. This is particularly important as we progress to higher than average CapEx years for our wholesale portfolio. I want to take a moment and briefly explain the 2015 hedge levels of 109%. Remember that this percentage represents the amount of hedges sold against our currently expected generation, and I emphasize the word, expected. There will be times when the expected generation decreases due to market changes. And unless we immediately buyback our hedges, this will result in a hedge level above 100%. It is not that we over-hedged the portfolio but rather a timing issue on when we report results and when we buy some of our hedges back. On the fuel side, we have seen significant decreases in commodity, fuel surcharges, and transportation costs this year. We're working closely with our coal supply chain partners to layer in additional hedges to balance our power sales. Finally, on slide 11 is a summary of our asset optimization and development plan that I discussed with you on our last earnings call. I want to highlight three points that may not be fully appreciated. First, we're deploying this capital at very attractive returns. Attractive repowering (19:52) opportunities are good NRG Yield candidates where capital can be replenished at a premium, and the asset revitalization program in the East is done at very lower multiples compared to newbuild economics. Second, and as David mentioned in his remarks, this plan represents a significant commitment to our conventional business given the repowering opportunity that we see and the changes in capacity markets. And finally, as you can see in the bottom right-hand chart, this plan is front-loaded in 2015 and 2016. Beyond that, there is very little incremental environmental CapEx to comply with existing regulations. Of course, as we identify new opportunities or see new environmental regulations, the outlook can change, but for now, there is a significant decrease in committed capital beyond 2016 that translates into additional free cash flow for the company. As we turn our attention to the summer months, I want to reassure you that we are focused on executing on near-term market opportunities, repositioning our generation portfolio and leveraging our integrated platform. With that, I will turn it over to Kirk. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on slide 13, for the first three months of 2015, adjusted EBITDA totaled $840 million, which is an increase of $23 million over the same period in 2014. NRG's record adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2015 was achieved thanks to outstanding results from our wholesale and retail businesses and augmented by contributions from the assets acquired in the EME, Alta Wind, and Dominion transactions, which combined to more than offset the impact of the extreme weather in the first quarter of last year. For the first quarter, free cash flow before growth totaled $364 million. Supported by our substantial hedge position and the strong start to the year, we are once again reaffirming both EBITDA and free cash flow guidance with our expectations continuing to track to the upper quartile of those ranges. NRG also made substantial progress during the quarter on a number of fronts. Earlier this week, the public shareholders of NRG Yield approved a proposal to create two new share classes via a stock split, providing both ongoing capital replenishment for NRG and substantial funding capacity for Yield without the need for further NRG investment. With this important step now behind us, we are pleased to announce a new framework for the allocation of the portion of NRG's excess capital equivalent to future dropdown proceeds to be committed towards a balance of share repurchases, corporate debt reduction, and reinvestment in future NRG Yield-eligible projects. Going forward, we expect residential solar leases to represent a meaningful portion of future dropdowns, thanks to a newly established partnership with NRG Yield, which will permit our Home Solar business to benefit by accessing more competitive cost of capital while providing a new source of CAFD growth for Yield. And having meaningfully expanded our Home Solar tax equity runway with two new facilities, we have the two key pieces in place to realize value at NRG today in excess of the capital requirements of this fast-growing business. We have also established a similar new $100 million partnership with NRG Yield for future dropdowns of DG solar assets, which we expect to occur over the balance of 2015, providing further value realization at NRG and expanded growth for Yield. We will provide more details on this important partnership in the next quarter as we initiate our first DG solar dropdown. Finally, having completed $56 million of the $100 million second phase of our 2015 share buyback program, we are pleased to announce an increase of $81 million to this second phase; thereby, increasing remaining capacity to $125 million, providing us additional repurchasing power, which will be further augmented by future repurchases enabled by the NRG Yield dropdown one-third rule David mentioned earlier. Turning to slide 14, I'd like to provide a few highlights of the recently approved NRG Yield recapitalization, which provides significant benefits to both companies. The creation of the 1/100th vote Class C shares provides NRG Yield a substantial source of equity growth funding without reliance on NRG capital. These new C shares will be the primary source of future equity at NRG Yield, and the low vote structure gives Yield the ability to raise over $20 billion in new public equity without jeopardizing the strategic relationship with NRG. The two-for-one stock split at NRG Yield will be effective May 14 with no change in total dividends paid. As a result, we have now also expanded the pipeline of ROFO assets to include 900 megawatts, consisting primarily of the EME wind assets which we expect to offer NRG Yield later this quarter. The expanded pipeline now also includes up to $250 million in residential solar and DG portfolios and 800 megawatts of long-term contracted gas comprised of our Carlsbad and Mandalay projects in California expected to reach COD in 2017 and 2020. On slide 15 is a summary of the expected impact of our tax equity facilities and new NRG Yield partnership in realizing the key objective I first introduced at Investor Day in January : monetizing leases at value to NRG today. Partnering with Yield provides Home Solar access to competitively advantaged capital while enhancing NRG Yield's CAFD growth. We've already dropped down approximately 2,000 existing leases to NRG Yield for $26 million in proceeds and, in addition, the $150 million equity commitment from NRG Yield and the associated tax equity proceeds provide capacity to monetize approximately 13,000 additional leases at value in excess of our expected capital requirements, leading to $100 million in near-term value to be realized by NRG in 2015. This should also put us well along the path to realize total value which also exceeds G&A and marketing expenses for all of 2015 as we expect to seek future authorization to fund our ongoing leasing efforts over the balance of the year. NRG Yield will benefit from a targeted 7.5% CAFD yield over the lease term which equates to approximately $11 million in annual CAFD from its initial $150 million investment. Turning to slide 16, I'd like to provide some additional details on the 70%/20%/10% capital expenditure guideline David mentioned earlier. The chart shows capital expenditures by year, which include maintenance and environmental CapEx as well as the growth investments portion of capital allocation. These are categorized by conventional, which is primarily wholesale and retail; proven growth, our contracted assets; and high-growth opportunities. To provide some historical perspective, I've included 2013 and 2014. Turning to 2015, NRG has committed $1.7 billion in capital expenditures. Approximately 70% is a reinvestment in our conventional businesses which provide the bulk of NRG's cash-generative power and is largely comprised of our asset optimization projects, environmental capital which includes the Midwest Gen assets, and maintenance to ensure reliability across the fleet. We've committed 20% to Yield-eligible contracted assets, including residential solar and DG solar and approximately 10% to eVgo and our Carbon 360 projects. In 2016, we expect $1.6 billion in total CapEx, consistent with 70%/20%/10% as we complete our environmental and asset optimization programs and bring Carbon 360 to COD in early 2017. We expect to continue our Yield-eligible investment program in 2016, Yield on (28:27) our one-third rule which will then include spend on our California contracted gas plants. Beyond 2016, as I mentioned on Investor Day, having completed our environmental programs to bring the fleet to current compliance, we expect a significant reduction in currently committed capital of over $500 million which is also aided by the completion of the Carbon 360 project and the reduction in maintenance CapEx. This should provide significant capital allocation flexibility and help ensure the continued delivery of robust free cash flow. Turning to slide 17, NRG expects to offer assets to NRG Yield over the remainder of 2015 with anticipated equity proceeds totaling approximately $600 million. These dropdown proceeds are expected to be realized in two equal tranches to be offered in the second and fourth quarter of the year with the first consisting primarily of the EME wind assets, and the second anchored by the remaining stake in CVSR, currently held by NRG. We also expect to drop down residential solar and DG portfolios over the course of the year. In order to provide greater clarity, maintain our target ratios and continue to return capital to shareholders, we are announcing a new plan as a part of capital allocation based on future dropdown proceeds. We will allocate capital in an amount consistent with these proceeds in thirds towards share repurchases, corporate debt reduction, and investment in future Yield-eligible projects. The allocation to debt reduction is sized to offset the impact on corporate EBITDA from the portion of CAFD which will support dividends paid to NRG Yield's public shareholders, thereby allowing us to maintain our key credit metrics following each dropdown. Sizing our capital allocation to share repurchases should help further clarify the direct benefit of NRG Yield to our shareholders. These future buyback allocations are incremental, the expansion of Phase II of our buyback program we announced today. Recycling the remaining proceeds helps replenish the dropdown pipeline with greater capital efficiency. Turning to slide 18, by adding the expected proceeds from dropdown offerings over the remainder of 2015, NRG's gross capital available for allocation is just over $3 billion this year. Inclusive of the impact of the one-thirds plan and the expanded Phase II buyback program, we have committed $2.2 billion of this capital, nearly half of which is allocated to preserving balance sheet strength and returning capital to our shareholders. Committed growth of $960 million represents the growth component of the 70%/20%/10% capital expenditures guideline I reviewed earlier. Of the $860 million in excess capital then remaining in 2015, $500 million resides at the GenOn level, a portion of which will fund the completion of our operational improvement program there in 2016. NRG level excess capital is $360 million, which includes the portion of the one-thirds plan earmarked for future NRG Yield-eligible investment. And in summary on slide 19, in addition to our excellent quarterly performance, our enhanced capital allocation program, NRG Yield recap and new NRG Yield partnerships place NRG on firm footing to ensure continued balance sheet strength and expanded return of shareholder capital while harnessing the power of the NRG Yield cost of capital to benefit our growing Home Solar, DG, and contracted asset initiatives. With that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thank you, Kirk, and thank you, Mauricio. And operator, I think I'll dispense with closing remarks so we can just take questions from people on the phone. So if you'd open the lines? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, and congratulations on multiple fronts. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to just talk about leveraging your Retail business in the pursuit of your clean energy growth. Can you just talk a little bit about lessons learned, and how is that actually working day-to-day in terms of being able to use that Retail platform? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Stephen, it's a great question, and I could go on about how excited I am about the prospects there, but since we have the two experts in the room, why doesn't Elizabeth give her impression first and then Kelcy? Elizabeth Killinger - SVP & President, NRG Retail, NRG Energy, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, Stephen. So we really are making strong progress on cross-selling, and as you've heard from us before, we've been working on this together. And I'll give you two examples. The first is the example of selling our electricity customers an incremental product. And in Texas, we have seen great success there with about 22% of our customers buying more than one product from us. And we have moved out of our trial phase and really are gaining momentum in the East where we are selling our solar customers electricity products, and we are also generating solar leads within our electricity conversations and sharing them with Kelcy's business. And at the end of the day, those are just examples of our kind of our plus concept. So if a customer starts with us as an electricity customer, the plus there would be home solar or backup generation or some of our warranty products or other new products we offer. And on \u2013 if they start as a solar customer, we can add electricity or backup generation or, again, other products. So I'll toss it over to Kelcy for anything else he might add. Kelcy Pegler - President-NRG Home Solar : Yeah. I think Elizabeth covered it well. We're moving from the early days into some meaningful progress, especially in the lead transition of sharing within the business groups. And I think overall, from the cross-selling, the bundling, and the up-selling perspective, with recent news around solar-plus-battery being a winning concept, I think we feel validated in the solar-plus or electricity-plus strategy because we think it's a little more comprehensive of being able to put electricity, solar, EV charging, portable power, backup generation, which could include a battery, or natural gas generators. So we feel validated in our strategy there. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And I just wanted to shift over to the partnership on distributed generation. Is this the form of relationship that we should be thinking on a going-forward basis? Or is this more opportunistic in the near-term? Just wanted to get a better sense if this is the sort of model that you all prefer going forward here with distributed generation? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You mean in terms of the way that the Yield and NRG are working together on Home Solar leases, and down the road on business to business? Is that... Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Kirk, do you want to address that? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Stephen, the high-level answer to that is, yes, and is for the same reason for both distributed solar and residential solar. And that is just the ongoing continual nature of the opportunity set combined with the fact that, as you know, now that we've shifted from cash grants exclusively, really into ITCs, that requires that the equity funding basically be locked down once we reach COD. So for that reason, it's important for us to have capacity to be flexible and nimble when those opportunities present and they tend to do so on a sort of a rolling and ongoing basis, and so that affords us the ability to be nimble on both DG and residential solar. And broadly speaking, the structure of those two partnerships in terms of the sharing of cash flows between NRG and NRG Yield, especially NRG towards the residual as we retained the recontracting ability will be similar between those two partnerships. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. And maybe just to follow up on the structure, Kirk, in terms of the return threshold at which there is that effective flip, is there any color you can provide or are you not quite at that point that you want to provide that (37:15). Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The only thing \u2013 I'd say it this way is that the CAFD yield, which is an average, and I'm using the example more tangibly from the residential solar partnership, that 7.5% yield is a good way to think about the economics, or at least the sharing, the cash flows, that are represented by that 95% that goes to NRG Yield. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Daniel Eggers from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning, guys. I \u2013 just on the buyback update, which was helpful, can you walk us through, in addition to the recycling of the cash from drops to NYLD kind of how you're thinking about an allocation of cash between the free cash generation from the business as well as the proceed dropdown? So are there buckets we should be thinking about more comprehensively of all the cash you're generating? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Kirk, do you want to take that? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. The committed piece, and I'm speaking specifically \u2013 I think your question, Dan, was directly on the buyback front, the predictable component of that, the committed piece of that is the one-thirds of the dropdown proceeds that is earmarked for share repurchases. And while certainly we can opportunistically supplement that with additional capital allocation is really anchored by the free cash flow, a good example of which is the $81 million we added today, we maintain that flexibility. But the committed part of it is the one-thirds piece from the Yield dropdown. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So the free cash generation from the core business is going to follow the same strategy of using it as you see the best and brightest use at that point in time. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. I think that's a safe summary, yes. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then I guess just on the Carlsbad plant, the CPUC deferred a decision yet again. What is your thinking as far as where their holdouts are on that project, and are there alternatives to you guys if they decide not to approve development of that property? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, certainly we hope, I mean in a world of getting things approved in California, this is pretty much a par for the course and we certainly support President Picker's alternative decision, and I think that they're now going to make a final decision in just a couple weeks, I think May 19 or May 21 or something like that, so we certainly hope it goes the right way because we think the plant is obviously the right solution for Southern California in the absence of the SONGS plant. But I mean, if it does go the other way, I mean, the project's not dead yet, it's just that the path to approval becomes longer and a little bit more opaque, and so at the very least I think there would be a delay, and we certainly hope for our sake and for the sake of California, that that's not the case. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. I'll stay to my two questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Could I just ask about the Home Solar customer adds? It looks like you added less than 3,000 in the quarter. Is it seasonality, weather-related, or should we just expect the ramp to really pick up later in the year? Just how we kind of view that Q1 result in the context of what I guess is like 20,000-odd adds you wanted to do this year? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Jonathan, I mean Kelcy \u2013 I'll ask Kelcy to address the question looking forward, but certainly I think your assessment of the first quarter is correct. First of all, we always anticipated a high ramp rate quarter-on-quarter during the year, but there's no doubt that our Home Solar business, which is a little unusual compared to the other main home solar companies in that we start as an East Coast-based home solar company, and you can imagine that no one in Massachusetts which is one of the biggest markets was thinking about, or executing on putting home solar on their roof from about the first of February through mid-March. So it was definitely weather impacted, but I mean we're confident for the rest of the year. And Kelcy can give you a little flavor of that. Kelcy? Kelcy Pegler - President-NRG Home Solar : Yeah. Thanks, David. And I think you've framed it properly. We were impacted by Northeast weather which was extreme in states like Massachusetts and Connecticut especially. They had snow on the ground for better parts of four weeks at a time. But we've always recognized that our full year will have a ramp through that full year. If we experience similar growth rates from what a 2014 experienced, we're confident we're right in that ballpark for our full year number in 2015. We did gain considerable ground on some meaningful progress with both the partnership with Yield which you heard Kirk talk about, and extending our tax runway. So there's a lot of progress, and not the least of which is really gaining a foothold in the California market which will help mitigate that seasonality that we experienced in Q1 in future quarters. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Can I just ask about Carlsbad? Is the spending in the numbers? Not in the numbers? How should we think about that? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Kirk? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Jonathan, there is no meaningful amount of spend currently in that, as it would ordinarily be the case in the growth investments component of capital allocation. We expect the preponderance of that spend to really begin in earnest in 2016. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jon. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just one simple question. Back at the Analyst Day, I think you had highlighted for 2015 that you were already kind of tracking to the maybe the upper half of the range for this year. And maybe you could just comment on that. Obviously, the first quarter was very good. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I actually think we said to the upper quarter of the range. And we're still tracking to that same upper quarter. But if I didn't say, or if Kirk didn't say upper quarter, then we're saying it now. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I actually did. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. I'm not going to ask questions about solar for once. But there is, you guys have shown us this integrated platform between the generation assets and the retail assets, especially your cash flows and earnings and volatility associated with natural gas prices. And we're seeing that one of the UK utilities has just put a big retail business in the U.S. for a strategic review. And I know that there's a bit of an overlap in retail services territories. And I know you don't comment on specific transactions, but could you, in general, tell us is it possible for you to enlarge your retail presence, especially in Texas? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Wow. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, I think certainly we would look to expand retail where we could do so at value. I mean, we like the platform we have. I mean, unlike when we bought Green Mountain or Energy Plus, I mean, we have the brands, and we have what we need. But we would look at other portfolios. I don't \u2013 I'm not sure I actually even know which portfolio you're talking about, but I can guess by the way you frame the question. I don't actually have any insights on whether or not there's a market share issue. But it's safe to say that if there's not a market share issue, we would look at anything in the retail space. Elizabeth, do you want to comment on that? Elizabeth Killinger - SVP & President, NRG Retail, NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I think you hit it on the head. But I would add, we are passionate about our Retail business and the Texas market. And to the degree, we can acquire either additional customers through acquisition or normal channels, we always look at opportunities to do so. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And the second one, more generic about M&A as well. So if you now have new classes of shares for NRG Yield that could allow you for third-party acquisitions. How should we think about it if you were, if both of the companies were to acquire existing portfolio of operating assets, would it be immediately dropdown into NRG Yield, and as such, boasts near-term distribution growth. Or would it be, in a way, warehoused at NRG or at some other facility in order to be preserved for future dropdowns in order to basically expand the growth of distributions into the future? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Angie, it's a very situationally-specific answer to that question. I mean we've really looked at every situation. I mean led by the independent directors at NRG Yield, they have repeatedly said they want to remain true to the idea that there's very specific risks they're willing to take, and a lot of risks that they're not willing to take. And if there's a big acquisition, half merchant, half contracted, and it has a lot of integration that has to be done and all that, they want to see that done at NRG first, and then receive the contracted assets when they're settled down. On the other hand, they've done direct acquisitions of assets which they perceived, and we perceived, didn't require a lot of new risk taking on their part. So it's really case by case is the best I could tell you. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So wanted to come back to the conventional portfolio for a quick minute here. On Maryland, just if you could give a little bit more of an update around intentions there and the latest on the regulations, as well as at the GenOn fleet on Bowline? Is it your intention still to move forward there and bring that unit back up? Or fully back up, shall we say? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mauricio, do you want to take that? Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, David. And good morning, Julien. So as you know, Maryland implemented an emergency ruling for 2015 setting up a specific limit that can be complied across the entire portfolio. We continue to work with MDE in a solution that doesn't necessarily require a unit-by-unit NOS (49:01) limit that could potentially lead to additional environmental equipment or potentially fuel conversion of that, and these market conditions are not economic. So we will continue to work with them to find a solution that is consistent with other federal regulations in terms of compliance at a total portfolio level. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : And then on Bowline? Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : On Bowline, I mean we are \u2013 we're moving and rerating our units. We have invested already that capital at very attractive multiples, and we are bringing additional megawatts given the pricing conditions that we're seeing in the lower Hudson Valley. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then a bigger thematic question here; obviously, a lot on storage of late, but I'm curious, how big of an opportunity do you all see it? And then I suppose, specifically given the diversity of your current businesses, where do you see the best opportunity? Is it the C&I space? The utility scale space? I mean just curious how you all are thinking about tackling that opportunity here? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. You \u2013 I'm sorry. You said, specifically in storage? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Yes, indeed. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean I think that we see the biggest opportunity, and we've had some success there in sort of California's preferred resources where there's a contract for it. I mean from my perspective, and particularly the more distributed you get, sort of merchant storage, if you will, is \u2013 I think is still some ways away from being a significant opportunity. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I only have one question, but it's in 27 parts. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, thank you, thank you, we appreciate that. It's \u2013 well that's just what we wanted on a Friday after \u2013 Friday morning. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Oh, three quick ones. Just to clarify your answer to a prior question. The $1.6 billion of CapEx in 2016 currently budgeted, that would go up if Carlsbad were approved? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : David, you want me to take that? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry, Kirk. Go ahead. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Greg, I would not expect that to \u2013 the approval to have an impact on the $1.6 billion. From a timing perspective, while there may be a small amount of capital towards the end of the year, in any circumstance, I would still expect the bulk of the capital towards Carlsbad to really be in earnest in 2016. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But he asked... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : In 2016 or in 2017? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: He asked in 2016. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Oh, forgive me. I thought you said 2015. Yeah... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...so it would \u2013 yes, it would start in 2016. Sorry about that. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So that would be \u2013 you would \u2013 so the $1.6 billion would go up? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : The second question was with regard to the excess capital remaining, the $860 million of which $500 million is at GenOn and $360 million at NRG. You said \u2013 I think you said $200 million of that is associated with sort of the replenishment of NRG Yield eligible assets, so that means for all intents and purposes there's $160 million for the balance of this year that's unallocated? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Kirk? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So when you're looking at the $360 million that's at the bottom there, that's correct, although I would say within the $960 million of committed capital that's on the growth investments page, that really includes the line of sight we have right now on the remaining NRG Yield-eligible assets. So while $200 million of that $360 million is the one-thirds component that goes towards Yield-eligible assets, I would expect those dollars more likely to be spent in 2016 and moving forward. I don't see a significant increase right now in allocations or towards Yield-eligible investments other than that which is already subsumed within that $960 million of growth capital. I do want to go back to your question. I apologize for the confusion over 2015 and 2016. When you go to the slide on capital expenditures, I said that Carlsbad would be an increase, that \u2013 I want to clarify that point. We provided that 2016 number for a reason and part of the committed capital in there is the Carlsbad plant and the Mandalay plant. So forgive me for misunderstanding your question. That is included in the 2016 capital expenditures. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. That was exactly what I needed. Thank you. And the final question for Mauricio, I think in the first quarter vis-\u00e0-vis how the stock price traded, people definitely forgot how strong a sort of countercyclical hedge your Retail business is relative to your wholesale position in Texas. Look, you haven't changed your 2015 guidance for Home Retail, but if we continue to see depressed gas prices and depressed spark spreads, depressed wholesale prices in Texas for an extended period of time, given the tenor of your contracts, how do you think you trend in that $575 million to $650 million guidance range through the rest of the year? Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, I mean, keep in mind that you need two elements for an over performance in Retail. Not only do you need lower commodity prices that translate in lower supply costs, but you also need higher loads given to extreme weather conditions. In the case of Q1, you have colder than normal weather. So as we look at the rest of the year, I think it's a little too early to tell how weather's going to play out, and I'm not going to \u2013 I mean, it's a little disingenuous to start making predictions about whether it's going to be hotter than normal or not. But certainly, if those two elements present themselves in the summer, we can expect retail to over-perform. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thank you, gentlemen. Have a good morning. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Chin from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: My questions were asked and answered. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Caylor from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ryan Caylor - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Hi. Good morning. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Ryan Caylor - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: So my questions were answered regarding Carlsbad, but regarding the other California repowering project added to the NYLD ROFO list, given there's CapEx allocated to both in 2016, can you provide us with an update, I guess, on Mandalay and whether there's any read-throughs from the Carlsbad process? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. That's a good question. I don't know of any \u2013 I think they're quite independent of each other, but I would say I'm not perfectly informed on that. Mauricio, do you have any viewpoint on that? Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. I mean, I think the Mandalay project is back at the end of the decade, so what we provided to you is in the next two years. The capital required for that project would be in the latter part of the decade, so I don't think it's reflected on the numbers. Kirk? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Not reflected on the numbers, and I'm not aware of any read-through in terms of the situation with the Carlsbad project onto Mandalay, no. Ryan Caylor - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to David Crane for any closing remarks. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well thank you, operator, and thank you all for participating on this Friday morning, and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. And thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NRG Energy Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Orendorff, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please begin. Matt Orendorff - Managing Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Latoya. Good morning, and welcome to NRG's second quarter 2015 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located on the Investors Relations section of our website at www.nrg.com, under Presentations & Webcasts. Because this call will be limited to one hour, we ask that you limit yourself to only one question with one follow-up question. As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Such statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor statement provided in today's presentation as well as the risk factors contained in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. During this morning's call, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures of the company's operating and financial results. For the information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most recently comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release and this presentation. With that, I will now turn the call over to David Crane, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us an hour earlier than our usually 9 :00 scheduled time. As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Both of them will be giving part of the presentation. Additionally, Chris Moser, the Head of Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, the Head of NRG Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler Jr., the Head of NRG Home Solar are joining me here and will be available to answer your questions that pertain to their parts of our business. So, starting with the slide deck on slide 3, if you're following along with that, I'm pleased to announce today that NRG has continued the positive momentum started in the first quarter of the year by reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $729 million, which gives us $1.569 billion of adjusted EBITDA through the first half of 2015, and keeps us on track to achieve a full year result comfortably within our $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion guidance range, notwithstanding the very challenging commodity price environment that we have been in for the entire year. As noted in our press release, this favorable financial result has been spearheaded by our retail franchise, led by Elizabeth Killinger and her retail management team, who have gone from strength to strength, not only preserving healthy retail margins, but also by retaining and acquiring customers at rates that have exceeded both our expectations and previous year's performance. Of course, this good financial news has been significantly tempered by the fact that, to date at least, our shareholders haven't benefited from our improvement in year-on-year financial performance, as our share price, like others in our industry, is significantly down since the beginning of the year and since our second quarter 2014 call 12 months ago. What this means, of course, taking the liberty of converting our adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow off page, is that we are now trading at a price that implies a mid-teen free cash flow yield, actually 16% for 2015. And the good news is that given the consistency of our base load hedging program and the strength of our core wholesale/retail combination, we are confident that were these share prices to persist, we would continue to be realizing mid-teen free cash flow yields, if not higher for the remainder of the decade. As we look ahead over the remainder of the year, we see more reasons for optimism and even bullishness. And those are listed on this page. We expect significantly more proceeds from NRG yield dropdowns, fueling more buybacks, more delevering and more reinvestment in contracted assets. There's the long awaited PJM auction, occurring in just a few days, that under the new rules, places a financial premium on dependability and should favor an operator like ours that operates a fleet, does so reliably and includes power generation facilities not dependent on an interruptible gas supply, like many others in the market. There is our home solar business, which is ramping up quickly, our daily bookings 90% higher at the end of the second quarter than at the first quarter. And we're achieving almost all that having barely begun to scratch the all-important California home solar market. And finally, there's the fuel conversions and other fleet repositioning projects that are proceeding at pace and remain on track to come on line over the balance of 2015 and calendar year 2016 with a significant dropoff in capital spend to follow and the commensurate increase in free cash flow yield. All in all, it's an optimistic picture for NRG that belies the market pessimism arising out of the low commodity-price environment currently gripping the entire NRG commodities complex. Kirk and Mauricio will talk more about these financial results and the stellar operating performance that underpins them. Plus, they will discuss what's to come in terms of dropdowns, PJM auctions, home solar bookings, and plant conversions. But before I turn it over to them, let me make just a couple more points. Turning to slide 4. Speaking today as we are one day after the president's announcement of his clean power plan, it seems clear to us that the one true path for an incumbent power provider like us is to build an edifice of new clean energy technologies, capabilities and assets on top of a rock-solid foundation of multi-fuel, multi-market across the (6:51) conventional generation. In doing all this, timing matters. We and the rest of the industry continue to bear the responsibility of keeping the lights on in the short to medium-term, which in turn depends for the foreseeable future on the sustained excellence we have demonstrated in the reliable operations and maintenance of our conventional fleet. But to prepare for the future as a 21st century energy company, there are three essential capabilities which we need to continue to strengthen and grow. First, there is retail. There simply is no substitute in the coming age of energy choice in personal energy alternatives to having a positive energy relationship with the end-use energy consumer. And the more end-use energy consumers we can have a relationship with, the better. Second, renewables. And by renewables I mean mainly solar as the future is going to be increasingly solar-powered and increasingly distributed. If you think about it, it's amazing how quickly we have gone from hearing how prohibitively expensive solar power is just a couple of years ago to how often we don't hear about how expensive it is now. And third, there's the yield vehicle, because even with the recent market glut of yield paper and the ensuing sell-off, NRG Yield still provides us with a competitive cost of capital to deploy for contracted assets that our immediate competitors cannot match. So while some of our competitors have taken steps in our direction, and certainly more will have to follow if they wish to be relevant deeper into the 21st century, at NRG we have been building these capabilities for six years now and are more equipped than anyone to not only address the changes in the industry but to make them our competitive advantage. We have had advances and we have had setbacks, but as we sit here in the middle of 2015, I feel confident that we are advancing on all fronts, gathering momentum as we go. And as we go, our principal focus remains to ensure that our shareholders realize the value of what we have been building and will continue to build in the months and years to come. Finally, on slide 5, I reiterate the principles articulated on our previous earnings call. Quantifying how we are thinking about capital allocation in connection with building a clean energy business on the foundation of a conventional generation platform, we are, as Kirk will talk about later, on track this year to adhere to the 70/20/10 guideline, which governs the balance of our capital reinvestment strategy, between reinvesting in our foundational strength of conventional generation assets and investing in the newer customer-facing, clean energy businesses that we have been building on top of our base. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, David, and good morning. Following on the good start we had for the year, our integrated portfolio delivered another quarter of strong results, allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. These highlight the strength of our diverse generation portfolio and complementary wholesale/retail model despite the fact that commodity prices remain close to half of what they were last year. The hedging program and risk-management activities executed by our commercial team protected the value of our wholesale business while our retail business outperformed expectations through good margin management and lower supply costs. This quarter is yet again another example of how our complementary business model performs well under adverse price and weather scenarios. During the quarter, we increased our hedge levels in 2016 and 2017, effectively protecting our earnings for the next two years. This is particularly important over the next 18 months as we progress through higher than average CapEx years while executing our asset-enhancement strategy, which I will cover in more detail in a minute. This strategy positions our portfolio to benefit from critical market developments like PJM's capacity performance, which will be implemented later this month. Moving on to our traditional operational metrics on slide 7. We had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with 151 out of 167 facilities without a single recordable injury. Conventional generation was down 6% versus the same period last year, driven primarily by an unusually active plant outage season and soft commodity prices. The soft prices significantly influenced the units dispatched throughout our fleet, resulting in an 18% decrease to base load generation relative to the same quarter last year. This was partially offset with a 52% increase in our gas and oil fleet output over the same period. On a regional basis, Texas generation was higher by 8% thanks to better performance by STP and our gas portfolio, while the East and South Central were lower due to some faulty gas switching and environmental retrofit outages. The operations team remained focused throughout the spring, completing 173 planned outages, including complex environmental compliance and repairing outages. Despite the reduction in generation and service hours, our base load units availability improved and performed when the market needs them. Slide 8 provides a more detailed update on the progress made on our development and asset optimization efforts. It's been an important six months. In the first quarter, we completed the environmental retrofit at Big Cajun, Parish and Limestone. This quarter, we completed the coal-to-gas conversion at Big Cajun II Unit 2, just in time for the important summer months, and the environmental retrofit at Waukegan 8, Sayreville and Gilbert. We also restored 388 megawatts of incremental capacity in the premium, lower Hudson Valley capacity zone in New York at very attractive economics. This was the direct result of the market providing the right price signal required to have not only reliable capacity but increased fuel certainty and fuel flexibility in a high-demand zone. Turning to slide 9, the second quarter was another strong quarter for NRG Home where we delivered the best second quarter results for the retail segment since NRG's purchase of Reliant retail in 2009. Total customer count was in line with expectations with a decline of 18,000 customers, driven by less than expected attrition from the lower-margin, northeast Dominion customers that we acquired last year. When excluding those contracts, the recurring customer count grew in Texas and the East by a total of 19,000 customers, demonstrating the continued strong momentum we achieved in attracting and retaining customers with innovative products and services. One of the reasons for our strong retail performance has been the subdued wholesale prices in ERCOT, our largest retail market. Very little has changed since the last update, as you can see on slide 10. Demand in ERCOT remains strong with close to 2.5% growth for the quarter despite lower oil prices, as you can see on the upper left chart. While we have tempered our expectations for the balance of the year, we have yet to see the impact of on-power demand. On the supply side, there are not many new projects beyond the ones announced on the back of potential capacity market and cost advantage brownfield development. As you can see on the lower left hand chart, both historical and forward spark spreads now expanding over seven years do not support the economics of even (14:38) brownfield projects. This will not only make future projects less likely but also puts existing plants at risk of mothball or shutdown. This supply rationalization prompted by economics and potential stricter environmental rules could tighten the fundamentals even more so and increase the probability of scarcity prices sooner rather than later. While our large, low-cost and environmentally controlled portfolio remains competitive and well-hedged for the next two years, we will not hesitate in making the right economic decision on behalf of our shareholders if the market continues to behave in such an erratic way. For now, all eyes are on next week with temperatures rising in Texas over 100 degrees for several consecutive days. Now moving to our hedging disclosures on slide 11, we continue our focus towards the next two years and have significantly increased our hedge levels to 84% in 2016 and 40% in 2017, effectively reducing our commodity risk and cash flow variation for the next two years. On the fuel side, we continue to see decreases in commodity cost, fuel surcharges and transportation cost. We continue to work closely with our coal supply chain partners to layer in additional hedges to balance our power sales. Our commercial team has done a great job in insulating us from the recent drop in gas and power prices and has contributed significantly to our retail outperformance by effectively managing supply cost. They are now focused on the remainder of the summer and getting ready for the upcoming PJM capacity performance auction. So a few words on the PJM auction on slide 12. As you all know, FERC approved the PJM capacity performance proposal in June. While we were disappointed by the delays in the transitional auction, the time line is now set for the base residual auction, with the transitional auctions likely to happen in early September. We have listed some of the main variables that participants will take into consideration during these auctions, which could provide some direction on price expectations. We have not been shy on our support for a stricter capacity market that ensures reliability. As with any competitive market, there will be winners and losers. A characteristic of our portfolio in terms of fuel certainty, reliability, and scale, which allows us to better manage the penalty risk of underperformance, puts us in a great position to significantly benefit from this necessary change in the market and recognizes the value that our portfolio brings to the system. So, to close, the prospects of improved capacity markets, a diverse and environmentally controlled portfolio, complemented by retail and opportunistic risk management activities, has the foundation for strong results during this low commodity cycle and sets us up for even stronger results in the medium to long run. With that, I will turn it over to Kirk. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on slide 14, NRG delivered a total of $729 million in adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter and over $1.5 billion through the first half of the year. Our second quarter results were highlighted by a record $204 million in adjusted EBITDA from Home Retail, a 30% year-over-year increase, yet again highlighting the success of the integrated business model as results improve due to favorable supply costs. Business and Renew combined for $338 million in EBITDA for the quarter, while NRG Yield, which was impacted by historically low wind speeds which continued through quarter-end, contributed $187 million. Despite the subdued summer power prices and a reduction in expected wind production over the balance of the year, thanks to strong Home Retail performance combined with effective wholesale hedging, we are again reaffirming our guidance ranges of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in free cash flow before growth for 2015. As the next step towards achieving our objective of $600 million in dropdown offers to NRG Yield during 2015, on July 24, we offered Yield the opportunity to acquire a 75% stake in a portfolio of 12 wind projects, consisting primarily of assets acquired as a part of the EME transaction. Subject to approval by NRG Yield's independent directors, we anticipate the 75% stake will close by the end of this quarter with the remaining 25% to be offered in 2016. We expect this transaction, combined with completed and ongoing dropdown to business-to-business distributed solar and residential solar to result in approximately $300 million in incremental proceeds from NRG Yield through September 30. Finally, during the quarter, NRG completed $107 million in additional share repurchases, which when combined with our quarterly dividend, amounts to $156 million in capital returned to shareholders during the quarter. We have $51 million in remaining share repurchase authorization, which we expect to be augmented by an additional $200 million in repurchase capacity or one-third of our targeted $600 million in dropdowns based on our previously announced capital allocation program for NRG Yield Proceeds. Turning to an update on 2015 NRG Capital Sources and Uses on slide 15, and moving from left to right, NRG expects approximately $3.8 billion in cash available to fund capital expenditures, debt repayment and return to shareholders during all of 2015. That cash basically consists of three components. First, excess cash at year-end 2014, which is net of minimum cash reserved for liquidity. Second, 2015 operating cash flow, which is basically the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance prior to deducting maintenance and environmental CapEx. And third, expected cash proceeds from NRG Yield, which we continue to expect to be approximately $600 million. 2015 capital expenditures, as shown in the second column, total approximately $1.7 billion, and include both maintenance and environmental CapEx, as well as growth investments as a part of capital allocation. As we reviewed last quarter, about 70% of these capital expenditures represents reinvestment in our core generation fleet. This includes approximately $800 million in maintenance and environmental CapEx to ensure reliability and environmental compliance across the fleet, while the remainder is allocated toward growth investments, primarily fuel conversions at GenOn to help ensure both ongoing eligibility for capacity payments and environmental compliance. About 20% of 2015 CapEx is being invested in long-term contracted projects, which we expect will ultimately be dropped down into yield. And finally, slightly less than 10% is allocated toward high growth investments like eVgo and our Carbon 360 project in Texas. The remaining $2.3 billion in 2015 capital funds the balance of capital allocation. Over $1.2 billion, or slightly more than half of this amount, is allocated equally towards debt reduction and return of capital to shareholders in 2015. This includes the expected impact from our capital allocation program relative to anticipated proceeds from yield. Over $600 million is expected to be returned to shareholders during 2015, and represents more than half of NRG's 2015 free cash flow before growth guidance. This consists of NRG's $200 million annual dividend, nearly $190 million of shares already repurchased with $51 million in remaining authorizations and up to $200 million in expected additional capacity related to the anticipated proceeds received from NRG Yield. We expect approximately $900 million of remaining excess capital. $500 million of this excess is at the GenOn level, which we expect will help fund the completion of our fuel conversion projects across that part of the fleet beyond 2015. The remaining capital at NRG will be available either for additional allocation in 2015 or to help support capital commitments in 2016 towards the NRG portion of the 70/20/10 capital mix. Turning to slide 16, I've provided an illustration to help underscore a point we first raised during our Investor Day and which has been an ongoing focus of discussions with many of you over the course of the year. In short, the expected decline in NRG's maintenance and environmental CapEx over the next few years as we complete the Midwest generation environmental projects provides a powerful cushion to help sustain the robust free cash flow which has long been a cornerstone of the NRG story. In order to highlight this point, we have assumed consensus adjusted EBITDA estimates beyond 2015 for illustrative purposes only, which when combined with interest payments remaining relatively constant and the expected substantial decline of over $400 million in annual maintenance and environmental CapEx by 2017, demonstrates NRG's ability to sustain robust free cash flow despite the near-term decline in EBITDA implied by these consensus estimates. Importantly, our free cash flow is prior to the expected ongoing receipt of drop-down proceeds from NRG Yield, which based on over $165 million in remaining right of first offer CAFD and an illustrative 8% yield, implies over $2 billion in proceeds from future drop-downs, serving to (24:37) significantly augment this compelling cash flow story. With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Kirk. And Latoya, I think we'll go directly to answering everyone's questions. Operator : Thank you. And the first question is from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys. Just can you maybe help us understand, I guess, when we should expect the board to think about authorization of expansion of the share buyback program? And then that $400 million that Kirk laid out in his slide, how you guys are looking at using that capital? And when do you think you might come to terms with what to do with it this year? Unknown Speaker : Kirk, do you want to...? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, as to the $400 million, the second half of your question, Dan, as I indicated, that is available for further allocation in 2015. We have, including the anticipated impact from the dropdowns of yield, over $250 million remaining repurchase capacity, which obviously gives us the ability to utilize that towards share repurchase over the balance of the year. As we continue to execute on those share repurchases, we would look at that remaining $400 million as additional capital allocation as we complete those share repurchases either towards additional growth CapEx or, if compelling, to augment our share repurchases subject to approval by the board. It's also, of course, available to fund the remaining growth capital, which, pursuant to our conversation in the first quarter, is still relatively robust in 2016 in similar amounts as the 2015 numbers across the 70/20/10 complex. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And I guess even if you look at \u2013 as you guys showed the mid-teens free cash flow yield on this year's numbers, how you rank out the return profile of other investments you're making, whether it be on the more green side of the business, the conventional side, versus the free cash flow yield being offered in the stock particularly as you look out over the forward years where that number seems to get bigger? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think our approach certainly through returns on any capital allocation towards growth investments is done on a risk-adjusted return basis. So when we look at contracted assets, which are obviously earmarked for yield, certainly they reflect the lower cost of capital as yield. But specifically and looking at more conventional traditional investments that comport with kind of the core generation portfolio, we do, and then our discussions with the board are informed by our current share price, which I've said in past conversations represents an opportunity cost. And so we look and proactively compare the risk-adjusted return on our own portfolio as represented by the opportunity to deploy capital towards repurchases, relative to the risk-adjusted return we see in similar investments on growth investments, and that's exactly the way we think about that comparison on an apples-to-apples basis on growth investments versus repurchasing or expanding repurchases of our own stock. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. So the view is that the investments you're making are risk-adjusted as compelling as buying back share at the margin today? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to talk about Texas a bit. Mauricio, you had mentioned just given the very low prices that we're currently seeing that, over time, NRG wouldn't hesitate to make the right decisions for shareholders, but you also noted you've got an excellent hedge position. When you think about the pain caused by low prices, there are obviously others that have generation assets in the state. Many of those assets are not in full environmental compliance. When you think about sort of the pain and how that may shake out, how do you think about your portfolio relative to the competition in the state? And sort of over time, would it be likely that others would effectively feel that pain first and there'd be some more rationalization or how should we think about that? Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey. Good morning, Stephen. I think as I said on my remarks, and I will re-characterize it again. Our portfolio \u2013 the scale of our portfolio, the size of our plants, they are environmentally controlled, and they're in the low cost of the stack. We think that we are very \u2013 pretty well-positioned to weather this low commodity price scenario, and we expect to see other portfolios succumb to these very low prices. Just look at the second quarter as an example. I think you would agree with me that prices were significantly low with gas tinkering around $2.50 per MMbtu. I mean, our generation was higher in Texas quarter-over-quarter from last year to this year. And if you dig deeper, our coal generation was just slightly lower; I would say less than 5%. So we really didn't see a lot of coal to gas switching in our coal suite. On the other hand, our gas and oil units increased by over 60% in Texas, so that tells you the strength of our portfolio and the cost-competitive advantage that we have. So I guess my point is : look no further to Q2 to just give you a glimpse on how competitive our portfolio is vis-\u00e0-vis other portfolios and, yes, while the hedges gives us a runway for two years and protects the financial outlook of our portfolio, keep in mind that we dispatch our units against market prices, not necessarily against whatever hedges we put in place. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great color. Thank you. And then, just shifting over to solar. I wanted to talk about the cash drag from growth in solar. You're making a big push into California. Should we think about the cash drag as subsiding in 2016 as you start to get in \u2013 get larger scale and some of those costs start to fade (31:18) in your scale increases? How should we think about that cash drag? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Stephen, well, first of all, you obviously correctly identify, I think, where that extra cost is is that as we look at our options to create a stronger positioning in the California market, which, as you well know is more than 50% of the total Home Solar market in the United States, you could acquire your way in, in which case, based on recent market comparables, you would have to pay an enormous premium, or we chose a different approach, which as you said is to go for a bit of a marketing and surge in. Certainly, as we sit here today, we don't have reason to believe that that's a recurring cost that we'll have to duplicate every year, but we'll see how it goes. But it was more planned as a one-off just to get the ball rolling to get the momentum. Kirk, did you want to add to that? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The only thing I'd add is, given what we have in place currently with Yield, which we intend to continue and ramp up the pace of as our pace of installations begins to grow. But proceeds, and more importantly, the comparative proceeds from the combination of NRG Yield and tax equity relative to the capital cost to put those leases in place \u2013 as I laid out, that first 13,000 leases results in approximately $100 million of proceeds from those two sources in excess of that capital \u2013 building that volume of installation in an order of magnitude so that the aggregate premium proceeds, if you will, meet and then ultimately exceed that overhead cost. And our expectation is that will be the way that that offset or the positive cash flow ultimately comes to pass at NRG, especially as we move into 2016 and our volume and the installations move commensurately higher to offset and exceed that fixed overhead, including marketing and G&A. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : One ticky-tack question. The free cash flow before growth number hasn't changed despite the surge in spending in California because there's a reduction in what you're \u2013 in one of the other line items which was \u2013 and so, can you explain what that is, that offset? I'm looking for it in the slides here. Bear with me a second. It was with distribution to non-controlling interests. Sorry. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. There is a slight change in distributions to non-controlling. It's just some of that has to do with timing. Some of it has to do with one of the tax equity facilities that we inherited as a part of the EME transaction. But overall, in 2015, in particular relative to, let's say, 2014, the benefits we get from the reduction in net working capital, in particular as you'll recall, we built greater inventories specifically on the oil side, as well as on the coal side moving into 2015. As we move throughout the year, we benefit from the fact that we have less investments in working capital and, in fact, a reduction in working capital, and that helps to serve to offset some of that increase in Home Solar cash flow. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. And, David, I just wanted to ask you a bigger picture question. It's on a lot of people's minds given the significant decline in the share price. I personally think that there's dis-synergies for doing some sort of aggressive corporate separation to reposition the company to be more attractive to investors who want a pure-play green-co versus, let's say a pure-play brown-co? I think the sum of the parts are greater than their whole. So I agree with your perspective on it, but how long do you wait before you sort of say, look, the market is not realizing the value and even though there are just synergies to creating pure play, that's the way we need to go? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Greg, I mean, you sort of hit the question on the head. The first thing I would say is : I agree with you that there is, while it may not be immediately apparent there, there is actually industrial logic to keeping the conventional side of our business to get the renewable side, together with the renewable side. And I tried to allude to that in my comments. The world of energy is trending green at a very decisive pace, but the one thing that trumps being green for everybody is making sure that the lights stay on, making sure that you have electricity. And the best companies that can do that, given the fundamental intermittency of renewable power, companies are doing both conventional and doing green. So the industrial logic to me favors the path that NRG is on. But we are a public company, and we suffer whether you call it the conglomerate discount or the constant refrain that we hear that we are more complex than some of the people that Wall Street can invest in. So we have to \u2013 value maximization for shareholders is what being a public company is about. So I can't put a precise date on it, Greg. What I would tell you is : it's a combination of when does it become clear that Wall Street has difficulty digesting the idea of a conventional company going green. But the second half of the equation is having a green company within NRG that not only can survive on its own feet as a public company but can win the battle field, can be as competitive as possible. So what we're about right now in 2015, and I think we're making great progress, is building \u2013 everything within our portfolio is strengthening every day. And when we get to that point, and I don't think we'll get to that point in 2015. And I would say probably in 2016 if we have, as you say, the sum of the parts where each of the parts or some combination of the parts is strong enough and if that's the path that is going to result in shareholder value maximization, then we'll take it at that time. So we're looking at it every day. Everything's on the table, but right now the instruction within the company that everyone here at this table will say is, the primary focus for everyone is building the strongest business that they possibly can in the area that they compete in. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thank you, David. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Hey, guys. One question, just trying to think through the hedging detail you provide in the back of the slide deck. You've basically increased the amount of hedges kind of pro rata but decreased significantly the hedged price. Is there a scenario where you would just say, you know what, I think the market's wrong; I'm willing to stay a lot more open than maybe I am currently. And kind of taking more of a directional view relative to continue hedging at what seemed like depressed pricing? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Michael, it's a good question and I can always count on you to try and ask another hedging question that you know Mauricio and Chris won't answer with any specificity. But nonetheless, here they go, not answering your question. Christopher S. Moser - Senior Vice President- Commercial Operations : Yes. Sadly, actually, I had an answer to the question. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, you have an answer. Christopher S. Moser - Senior Vice President- Commercial Operations : Yeah. Not to throw a wrench into that; now I don't know \u2013 okay. So what you have to think of, Michael, is, first, yes, of course, we take an opportunistic view on the hedging and we will leave things open if we think it's not priced very well. But in direct answer to your question, some of the hedging that happened between Q1 and Q2, you have to remember \u2013 yeah, between Q1 and Q2, you have to remember that we have assets in a lot of different markets, and some of the markets are higher priced than others. So to the extent that we are hedging in areas which are not as highly priced, you're going to see the average hedge price come down. Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : And Michael, just, I mean, keep in mind that the hedging decisions are not just based on a directional view on the commodities. It's also a combination of the free cash flow profile that we want to have and, honestly, the absolute level of CapEx. So in the next two years we're executing a significant amount of environmental retrofits and repositioning our portfolio to benefit from very positive market developments. We felt compelled to really have more visibility in these two years. But make no mistake, I mean, if \u2013 when you go out 2017 and beyond, we're very open and I think that basically tells you a little bit our point of view in terms of the future of commodity prices. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. One quick environmental CapEx question. We've seen one or two of your peers, when talking about long run environmental CapEx, they kind of have the Post-MATS skip in the 2017-2018 timeframe but then a little bit of a re-ramp due to coal ash and maybe one or two other items. Can you just give an update on where you stand position-wise for that? Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Michael. Look, when you look at the environmental regulations that we know now, MATS, CSAPR, we feel that the CapEx that we have provided to the Street is what we're going to require to be compliant. When you think about the other rules, and you talked specifically about ash, there's two things that I should remind you and investors. Number one is it was a very positive development to see EPA not to have ash as hazardous materials. And then, number two, that we at NRG don't necessarily have final disposal of wet ash in the company. I mean, it's hard to tell what would be the impact of the ash rule right now. From what I can see now, probably it will be in the tens of millions, not in the hundreds of millions, but that's going to depend on the testing and the monitoring systems that we're going to put in place or that we're going to go through in the next two years to three years before we need to put a compliance plan or a mediation plan by 2018. So I don't expect to see the same ramp-up of environmental CapEx that we've been through the last couple of years and that we're going through right now beyond 2017. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So, first quick question, maybe to follow up on Greg a little bit. As you're thinking about the potential to break apart this business, what is the gating item? Is it really going to be a decision around how the Street perceives the company or is it more around reaching maturation in the business itself? So I suppose the key question here is, given the cash burn associated with NRG Home this year, how do you think about the spin of a company that has cash burn this year and prospectively ramps up? What's the ideal \u2013 how much \u2013 what's the ideal timing? How long do we need to wait? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the specific question about the cash burn, Kirk will add to that. But I mean, the other factors you mentioned, what are we waiting for or what's more important in terms of timing, the industrial logic or Wall Street receptivity or lack of receptivity to the company as it is currently structured. It's really hard to weigh those two since they are both important variables. I'd say there is actually a third variable, Julien, which is how receptive is the company to, let's call it, a green NRG based on what we see with other companies out there. Because, obviously, there are pure play solar companies out there which sometimes seem to be in great favor and other times it would be seen in less favor. So it's really those three factors that we have to weigh all at once. I mean, for now, I mean, from our perspective, the key is to get ourselves in a position where we have the option to do something like that in fairly short order and then see how it goes. In terms of the impact of the cash burn on the overall decision, Kirk, do you want to specifically address that? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, what I would say is, as I mentioned in response to Greg Gordon's question earlier, that is : we are focused on the same thing with the Home Solar business with NRG that we would believe any pure play investors should be focused on. And that's demonstrating the ability to monetize those leases at a compelling premium that meets and exceeds the amount of operating cash flow drag we have there. So we are focused on building those volumes and demonstrating the ability that that pace of installations is on a trajectory and a run rate that will allow us to demonstrate the ability to do exactly that, and that is have the proceeds from monetization exceed the operating cash flow so that the comprehensive cash flow story is a positive and growing one. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. And perhaps the follow-up, just to think about the investment, the $175 million in NRG Home, and both in terms of targets, how are you ramping as you think about the expansion in California? How does that jibe relative to what you discussed earlier this year at the Analyst Day? And then separately, related to that, to what extent is your NRG Home disclosures and prospective cash flows coming from these leases somewhat similar? And can we think about it in terms of guiding forward to peers in terms of the cash flow generated by these leases (46:23)? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, on the second component of that question, Julien, if I understand you correctly, partially because we believe given that NRG, as I went through on the final slide of my presentation, is all about free cash flow, that's part of the reason why we have focused on telling the story around Home Solar as a comprehensive positive cash flow story along the lines of what I just discussed. That is, the receipt of proceeds from monetization of leases exceeding the operating cash flows is what we're focused on, rather than necessarily focusing on the residual value on a per-watt basis. And so that is the reason why we've kind of talked about things in that fashion. And as we move closer, and I'll ultimately give guidance in 2016, you should expect to see us provide you at least a more comprehensive view as we ramp into higher volumes in 2016 as to how that plays out in that positive cash flow story. I'm not sure if that answered completely your question. I may ask you to repeat the first part of it because I'm not sure I exactly followed what you're asking in the first piece of it, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. I simply asked : how are you doing relative to the targets you laid out at the Analyst Day given the decision to move into California? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, what I would say, compared to where we were on Analyst Day, and, Kelcy, I don't know if you want to add to this, is as we disclosed on the last quarter call, I mean, when we were at Analyst Day, we gave sort of a target for the year. Since our business is an East Coast business that \u2013 which the strongest sales channel is door-to-door \u2013 we got off to a very slow start with the weather situation in the East. So I would say, in terms of achieving the total number of installations or bookings over the year that we talked about in the Analyst Day in January, it's probably too early to say whether we'll get fully where we wanted to get because it was a very ambitious goal. So to get there from where we are now is a long putt. But in terms of the rate of growth, our \u2013 by the end of second quarter on sort of a daily run rate, we were up 90% over the end of the first quarter. So we're sort of blowing and going in terms of our momentum. And that's really before hitting California. And so, California is upside to that. Kelcy, do you want to add to that? Kelcy Pegler - President-NRG Home Solar : No, I think what's been discussed here today is we are a growth business, positioned in this sophisticated corporation. And we're tasked with building the strongest and most sustainable Home Solar business with what's complete awareness for our position in the space with our pure play competitors. But really, we're resolved in building a long-term sustainable approach around some of the competitive advantages that we have and certainly the customer base that exists. I think the past year, what we've seen is the top tier has really come into focus. A year ago, if you said : who are the top tier players; there'd probably be double-digit companies that were vying to be included in that. Today, I think what you've seen is this top tier, which would be four or five companies, gain share, us included in that. And the rest of the space has moved backwards. So we're pleased with the success we have, which has mainly been built on our East Coast performance, and we're excited about a lot of the seeding and developments that we've done in half one, that we believe will deliver results. And that conviction is built on best months in business consecutively both June and July. So we have a lot to be optimistic about. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just on the PJM auction and your conversions, do you still have flexibility to kind of adjust your conversion plan in the event the auction goes one way or the other, or are you kind of full bore no matter what? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The answer to that question, Steve, is the shortest answer I've ever given on a \u2013 is yes. We have flexibility. And you are right in assuming that the auction represents an important set of indicators for us. So, yes, you're right. The next month is important and decisions will be made based on what we see. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, just maybe, I apologize, one other question on the Home Solar. So just the actual individual contracts and leases that you're signing, just how is that \u2013 ignore the customer growth, et cetera. Just how are the pricing and returns relative to what you anticipated? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : From a returns perspective \u2013 it's Kirk. They are in line with our expectations. The dropdowns, for example, the best illustration is the dropdowns that we have achieved during the second quarter are consistent on those leases that we did drop down that were installed, with the overall guidance that we showed on aggregate proceeds relative to capital expenditures. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Okay. Thanks. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you, Steve. Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: My main question was asked. But I'd like just to follow-up on Home Solar, right? On your slide you say that what you are showing is where you've either installed or contracted to install. And one of your main competitors sort of called out the difference between installs and deployment and changed the basis of guidance this quarter. Can you just talk to what's the \u2013 how different would your number be if it was actual installs? And are you also seeing some challenges getting systems up and running when they're already on the roof, effectively? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Kelcy will certainly be answering the second part of that question. But I mean \u2013 and he probably will answer the first part of the question, too. But I mean it's a good question that we talk about here often because as you can imagine, when you're increasing your pace of sales, 90% by quarter-on-quarter, the difference between \u2013 and it's roughly \u2013 what, Kelcy, still somewhere between 70 and 100 days to full installation from booking. The number between bookings and installations is dramatically different by quarter. So do you want to start with the second half of this question and move backwards? Kelcy Pegler - President-NRG Home Solar : Yeah. What I can say is this also would be a California-centric topic. What you see in California is more market maturity with permit authorities and interconnection utilities. What you see on the East Coast beyond seasonality is some longer time lines. I think we fare well competitively as it refers to time, but we're committed to time cycle reduction. We used to \u2013 a year ago, I think you could say it would be at least 90 days. I think today you see a path to around 75 days is where we're living on timed install from signature to energization. And as California becomes a more material portion of our business and as we continue to focus on time cycle reductions, both those metrics will continue to improve. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And just one thing to add to that, and, Kelcy, correct me if I'm wrong, but if you think about how long it takes to get solar energized on your roof from the time you order, there's almost no consumer decision in America that takes longer to create consumer gratification. So it's something that we are very focused on, and in fairness to the other people in our industry, they're very focused on it as well. But the single biggest delay within that period is beyond the control of the solar installer. It's the time that the utility takes to interconnect. And there's been some recent study of that in the press that indicates at least one East Coast utility that's the worst at getting systems energized. And so the more that a light is shined on the fact that that has a potential to hurt customer satisfaction, then I think that's important. I draw the analogy : it's like when you ask for the check at the restaurant and you're anxious to get home and they take half an hour to give you the opportunity to pay for your meal, it's very frustrating to the customer. So that's probably the main thing within the time cycle that we'd like to see shortened. And right now, it's beyond our control. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just the pace of these kind of energized graphics sort of looks similar though. I guess that's, in essence, my question. Or is the lag sort of dampening the growth? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You mean, is this a real inhibitor to sales that when you - Kelcy Pegler - President-NRG Home Solar : The graph would look similar. It would trail about a quarter right now, so if you were to look at energized systems graphically, it would show similar to booking. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sort of a 1,000 to 2,000 lag by the sound of it. Kelcy Pegler - President-NRG Home Solar : That's fair. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thank you. And Latoya, we're very close to the top of the hour. And so, I think we'll conclude the call here. Again, we appreciate everyone taking the time, starting an hour earlier, and we'll look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NRG Energy Incorporated Q3 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Chad Plotkin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin. Chad S. Plotkin - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Liz. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's third quarter 2015 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located on the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. Because this call will be limited to one hour, we ask that you limit yourself to only one question with one follow-up. As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor statement provided in today's presentation as well as the risk factors contained in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. During this morning's call, we will also refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures of the company's operating and financial results. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release and this presentation. And with that, I will turn the call over to David Crane, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Chad, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on this, our third quarter call. Today joining me are Mauricio Gutierrez, the company's Chief Operating Officer, and Kirk Andrews, the company's Chief Financial Officer, and both of them will be participating in the presentation. We also have available to answer any specific questions you have in their areas Chris Moser, who runs the company's Commercial Operations business; Kelcy Pegler, who runs our Home Solar business; and Elizabeth Killinger, who runs the company's retail business. So with just over six weeks passed since we hosted the NRG Reset call, we're going to do our best to be brief so that we can provide you with ample time to ask the questions that you have. However, with the unabated selloff in our stock and across the entire sector during the quarter, I want to begin by acknowledging how difficult a time it has been for you, our shareholders. In truth, in this market environment, I don't know that I can predict what exactly will cause the stock to turn around and recover to some level that approximates fair value, but I can tell you that NRG's operational and financial performance has been strong and solidly within expectations, that our current liquidity is as strong it has ever been at over $4 billion, and that our Reset program has passed through the planning stage into implementation with every aspect of it well on track, albeit still in the early going. It is certainly our hope and expectation that's a gradual accomplishment of various aspects of the reset, the cost-cutting, the freeing up of committed capital through various measures, the allocation of capital particularly to the reduction of debt, all will provide a continuous impetus to the recovery of our share price. And after that preliminary comment, let's move on to discuss how our business has performed through the third quarter of 2015. Turning to slide three in the business update, I'm pleased to report today that we are narrowing our 2015 full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, solidly in the middle of the original guidance range. Our financial performance in the ever-important third quarter was just tremendous, and demonstrated once again the resilience of having a matched retail-wholesale platform. In a period of subdued wholesale power prices, our retail business, alongside our outstanding commercial operations team, excel. Indeed, our retail business delivered its best quarterly result since 2010, with $225 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Regarding our conventional wholesale business, which by the way turned in another strong operational quarter, probably the most noteworthy event during the quarter has been the extensive commentary in the financial community questioning the medium- to long-term prospects for power plant fleets like ours. My reaction to this point, based on the many commodity price cycles I have live through in this industry, is that you can't ignore the underlying reliability value of locationally advantaged assets in competitive markets. Our 48,000 megawatt fleet has a key competitive advantage in each of our three regional markets. First, in Texas, our generation portfolio's footprint closely matches and complements our thriving Texas retail business. Second, in the East, our portfolio has been shaped to focus on providing and being compensated for reliable capacity, as demonstrated by the enhanced value in earnings to NRG as a result of the recent capacity performance auction, and the importance of which has been underlined by the recent announcement of Entergy with respect to the closure of the FitzPatrick plant. And third in the West, our portfolio features a heavily contracted Fast-Start gas capability tailored to a market moving towards 50% renewables. In all three of our regional markets, the steady and stable operations of our generation remains critical, not only to the enterprise, but to the grid in general. Moving on to other signs of successful execution of our business plan, I'm pleased to announce today that just yesterday, we closed our most recent drop-downed NRG yield, which delivered $210 million in cash back to NRG, which as you know we will be utilizing as part of our efforts to strengthen the balance sheet as we discussed on our last call. I'm also pleased to report that, as we announced on September 22, we successfully executed on the $251 million share repurchase program, which in combination with all shares repurchased year-to-date brings the total shares acquired this year to 7% of our outstanding shares. And as we will discuss in more detail in a bit, we are now shifting our immediate capital allocation focus to debt reduction, as we indicated would be the case on our NRG Reset call, as a way not only to further strengthen our balance sheet but also to unlock shareholder value. Lastly, our Home Solar business remains well on track, as we outlined six weeks ago, driven by tremendous top line growth with over 6,300 net bookings in the quarter, and we believe one of the highest, if not the highest growth rate of the major players in the sector. This volume places us in a fight for third with Sunrun and not that far off from Vivint in the number two position. With respect to our installations for the quarter, which numbered 1,900, or now a total of approximately 80 megawatts, we are making progress in our concerted effort to reduce the backlog going into and through the early months of 2016. For those tracking Home Solar's negative EBITDA contribution projected for full-year 2015 continues to track within the negative $175 million disclosed on the second quarter call. So, let's move on to discuss progress on the NRG Reset and drivers behind our 2016 financial guidance, turning to slide 4. Let me start with components of the Reset which are fully within our control. We are well into the implementation phase of our companywide cost reduction program of $150 million across G&A, marketing and development expense. In addition, and Mauricio will provide more details on this, I'm also pleased to announce today that we have identified and are implementing an additional $100 million in O&M spending reductions across all of our businesses, all of which can be done in a manner that does not sacrifice the reliability of our portfolio. So when combined with the initial NRG Reset cost reduction plan, our cost reduction efforts now bring, on an annual basis, a total cost savings target of $250 million to be achieved in 2016 and recurring thereafter. On the asset rebalancing component of the program, we remain focused on and highly confident in our ability to unlock, in combination with the cost reduction program, over $1 billion in capital for allocation to reduce the balance sheet. The modifications of our plans at Portland and Avon Lake Unit 9 are complete, reducing or eliminating additional capital spend at those plants, and we are actively marketing select assets for disposition. Given the high level of interest in these assets expressed during our preliminary marketing phase over the past few weeks, we are moving forward at a pace and in a manner that we believe will lead to an optimization of value for NRG shareholders. You should expect in all likelihood a series of such transaction announcements over the weeks and months to come. Regarding the GreenCo business, the $125 million GreenCo runway around NRG Home Solar, the C&I business at NRG Renew, and eVgo is established, and ready to commence on January 1, 2016. As it relates to the process around the securing of a strategic or financial partner in GreenCo, through the initial phase of our efforts we are quite pleased with the interest we are seeing. We continue to be in the market discovery process and remain focused on selling a majority interest in GreenCo with the goal of financial deconsolidation and simplification at the parent company level. However, and not unlike our approach to asset dispositions on the conventional side, our approach with respect to GreenCo is value first and speed of execution second. The choice of partner in at GreenCo is an important one and we are focused on both optimizing current value and positioning the business, which NRG will continue to own a significant stake in for future success. We will provide you with more material updates as the process allows. So as we look at all the actions we are taking, and importantly marry this with the ongoing benefit of our integrated platform, we are introducing 2016 financial guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth on a consolidated basis. As an additional item and something Kirk will provide more detail around, in response to many of the questions we are receiving from investors pertaining to the complexity of our capital structure, for the first time we are now providing our expectation for free cash flow before growth at the NRG level. What this represents is the free cash flow generation excluding non-recourse subsidiaries such as GenOn, NRG Yield, and the primary NRG ROFO assets. Our hope is that providing this to you, we will eliminate at least part of the concern about the geography of our cash flows. Now turning to slide five, I would like to touch upon capital allocation. We have repeatedly stated over the past few months that our focus over the coming year is on shrinking the balance sheet, so for the avoidance of doubt, let me put our thinking in this regard into some historical context. For many years now, indeed for almost my entire time as CEO of NRG, our focus has been to establish a diversified business platform that reduces our company's exposure to near-term fluctuations in natural gas and power prices, amongst other potentially concentrated risks. Specifically, our goal always has been to minimize commodity price impact on free cash flow, while maintaining the upside that occurs when the commodity markets move in a positive direction. Our key tool in this regard, in addition to hedging, has been asset and business diversification. Our diversification commenced in earnest when we entered the retail business six years ago through the acquisition of Reliant, followed with our strong move into contracted generation targeted around renewables, our redevelopment efforts that are locationally advantaged Brownfield sites, and most recently our asset management program aimed at maximizing our economic advantage in capacity markets like PJM. This quarter's performance, especially with our outstanding retail performance, and next year's guidance, coming as they do at a time of historically low natural gas prices, speaks to the effectiveness of our business diversification as a financial buffer. But of course, this diversification becomes a moot point if market concerns around the balance sheet persist. It is our strongly held belief that NRG's equity investors will benefit from an absolute reduction in our debt, most notably at the NRG level, but also across our entire capital structure. As Kirk will outline, that is the focus of our capital allocation program now. At this slide five describes, as a result of our recent efforts, we aim to free up roughly $1.6 billion in total over the next 14 months to apply to balance sheet shrinking, and particularly to debt reduction. Further, as we look out beyond the next 14 months, our efforts around reducing maintenance CapEx and the material completion of our capital expenditure program will provide further capital allocation flexibility. Our overriding goal that animates this entire effort is to put to rest the question of whether NRG is carrying an excessive level of debt, so that all of us can be on the same plane where we can focus on the cash generative power of the NRG businesses and how that cash can be put to its best use for the benefits of NRG shareholders. And with that, I will turn it over to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Our integrated platform continued to perform extremely well during the third quarter. Our wholesale business mitigated the impact of lower power prices through active hedging and good commercial execution, while our retail business benefited from lower supply costs, highlighting once again the strength of our wholesale-retail platform. During the quarter, we continued to take steps on repositioning our portfolio to optimize and improve economics and returns. First, our asset optimization effort in the Northeast, which focuses on capacity revenues, was validated by the recent PJM capacity performance auction resource (15:07). Second, we continue to reduce spend across the fleet, which I will discuss in more detail in a later slide. And finally, we have taken the necessary steps to hedge our portfolio in the short term to protect from further downside. All of these efforts are in addition to the business diversification strategy that David already mentioned in his remarks. So let's start with a review of our operational performance on slide seven. We have another quarter of top-quartile safety performance, with 147 out of 168 facilities that finished the quarter without a single recordable injury. We're mindful that our portfolio is going through some changes and we need to stay vigilant and redouble our efforts to ensure that safety is and remains always first. Our total generation was up 5% for the quarter, driven primarily by higher generation in the Gulf and the West. The East was relatively unchanged, with slightly lower coal generation offset by higher gas runs. Our coal and nuclear plants improved their availability and reliability metrics. I want to congratulate STP, Parish, and Dunkirk for almost perfect runs this summer. Our gas units continue to be called on more frequently in the market, as you can see in the bottom right chart. We continue to maintain a remarkable 99% starting reliability on our gas (16:27). Turning to slide eight, our retail business continued its trend of exceptional performance, delivering $225 million of adjusted EBITDA, the highest third quarter since 2010 and $58 million more than last year. During the quarter, we captured value from lower cost to serve, effective margin management, and expansion of our product offering. We have also sustained our strong momentum in customer acquisition and retention that led to 5,000 customer account growth, despite the continued expiration of acquired Dominion customers' contracts in the East, where we continued to see better than expected retention levels. Excluding the Dominion acquisition, our customer growth was 26,000. As we have stated in the past six years, the ongoing success of our retail business continues to demonstrate the value of our integrated wholesale-retail platform, and most importantly provides NRG diversification in earnings through all phases of the commodity cycle. Turning to slide nine. Let me share a few comments on the gas market. We have experienced pretty mild weather this past year, a warm winter followed by a mild summer. This weather combination most likely will lead to a new record storage number in the coming weeks, at or near 4 TcF. Combined with the expectation of an El Ni\u00f1o weather forecast, and you've got a market with only bearish news and falling prices. It's worth noting that El Ni\u00f1o is typically associated with a warmer upper Midwest winter and a colder Gulf Coast one. As a diversified energy company with assets in both areas, we could do well in such a scenario. I want to remind everyone that we're very well hedged through 2016 and about 50% in 2017, giving us some nice runway to what we see as a more bullish future. Make no mistake, where we see plenty of upside if gas prices were to rise, but have protected significantly the downside through hedging and business diversification. Regardless of current sentiment, in our view, long term natural gas price fundamentals look strong. The first half of this decade was dominated by supply growth outstripping demand. We expect the second half to reverse that trend with demand growth outstripping supply. Natural gas production has been stagnant since late last year, in part because of lower rig counts and low prices. In the meantime we see growing LNG exports, increasing exports to Mexico, higher industrial production, and greater demand from the power sector. As an example, our fuel conversions of new gas flow from Joliet and Shawville alone will increase our summer peak day gas consumption by 0.5 BCF/day. The gas demand from new builds and conversions is real and is coming. Simply put, we are well positioned to weather the short-term low prices and remain open to benefit from bullish long-term fundamentals. Turning to slide 10, on our power market update, and starting with ERCOT. As we have discussed for several years now, market changes are needed to better reflect scarcity conditions like the ones we experienced this summer. During August, we saw our first real test of the operating reserve demand curve mechanism, and sadly, we watched it fail. Scarcity conditions were right for a few days, during which a new record peak was set. But aside from one $350 day head clear (19:56), the week was mostly disappointing. A combination of scarcity conditions and low prices caught both market participants' and the PUCT's attention. ORDC is expected to be a major topic of conversation at the open meeting tomorrow. Discussions are now underway to examine potential changes that can be made to the ORDC parameters to make it more effective in reflecting true scarcity on the system. We're supportive of that effort and will actively participate in the discussion. Otherwise fundamentals remain strong, with load growing by 2.7% on a weather-normalized basis so far this year, despite low oil prices. Combined with the risk of additional retirements, current forward prices look too low and present an upside to our low-cost and environmentally controlled coal portfolio. As for the Northeast, we have been repositioning our portfolio from providing base-load energy to providing reliability as a capacity resource. The recent results in PJM and New England, which we just covered in our recent call, validate our commercial strategy. In the past couple of weeks, we've heard news of additional nuclear retirements. It would seem that smaller nuclear plants are struggling to cover cost and may lead the way to further tightening in the market. Turning to our hedging disclosure on a slide 11, and as I mentioned earlier today, we're pretty well hedged for the next two years. As the chart in the upper left of the slide shows, we're very well hedged against our expected production for 2016 and almost 50% hedged for 2017. We are evaluating further entry points to increase our coal hedges, and are comfortable with current inventory levels as we head into the winter months. We like the remaining open position for the back half of 2017 and beyond, given our more constructive view of gas and power. Finally, on slide 12 I want to provide more details on our expanded cost reduction program across the company, and more specifically the $100 million reduction in O&M savings that David mentioned. As you likely have assumed, most of these will be executed on the wholesale business, where we continue our work on evaluating and prioritizing every actionable spend decision on an asset-by-asset basis. Key drivers of the overall reduction relate to the asset optimization efforts that we announced around Portland and Huntley respectively, changes in the way we're managing operational risks and further cost reductions on units that have lower capacity factors. Of course, we will not make any O&M reductions that jeopardize the safe and efficient operations of our fleet. In addition to the $100 million reduction just announced, we're introducing the fourth iteration of NRG's continuous business improvement program, called FORNRG. This program is driven by employee ideas and innovation to enhance each department's bottom line. The FOR stands for focus on return, and is rooted in ensuring all employees are empowered to find better, more cost-effective ways on doing our jobs. Our goal is to achieve $150 million of cumulative EBITDA over the next three years. Just as we have done in the past, we remain committed to our continuous improvement program that has yielded so many benefits for NRG and its shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Kirk. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Thank you, Mauricio. And beginning with the financial summary on slide 14, NRG delivered a total of $1.145 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter, and over $2.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30. Our third quarter results were highlighted by $225 million in adjusted EBITDA from Home Retail, a 35% year-over-year increase, again highlighting the success of NRG's integrated business model as results improved largely due to favorable supply cost. Business and Renew combined for $722 million in EBITDA for the quarter, while NRG Yield contributed $198 million. Despite the subdued summer power prices, our strong Home Retail performance combined with effective wholesale hedging allows us to narrow our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, still in line with the midpoint of our original 2015 guidance. Looking to the business segment components of adjusted EBITDA guidance, the increase in guidance for NRG Yield reflects the full-year impact of the closing of the wind portfolio drop down as required under GAAP, with an equal reduction in Business and Renew guidance, which previously included the EBITDA associated with the equity stake now held by Yield. Based on the strong retail performance for the quarter, we are also increasing the retail component of 2015 EBITDA guidance, which offsets the modest reduction in expected 2015 wholesale results. Finally, we're also narrowing guidance for 2015 free cash flow to $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion. Turning to other highlights, and focusing first on our progress on NRG Yield drop downs, we're pleased to announce we've now closed the previously announced sale of a 75% interest in a portfolio of 12 wind projects to NRG Yield for $210 million in cash. The remaining 25% interest continues to be part of the drop down pipeline remaining under the expanded right of first offer agreement. NRG intends to complete the balance of the $100 million in commercial distributed solar projects and $150 million in residential solar leases under our existing partnerships with NRG Yield over the balance of 2015 and into early 2016. As we've indicated in previous quarters, NRG also intends to offer its remaining stake in CBSR to NRG Yield in late 2015, which makes up the balance of the $600 million in expected drop down offers to Yield during 2015, as originally announced on our first quarter earnings call. Turning to share repurchases, NRG completed the purchase of $251 million of its common stock during September and October of 2015, which when combined with our previously completed share repurchases and annualized dividend leads to a total of approximately $630 million in capital returned to NRG common stockholders in 2015, and a 7% reduction in common shares outstanding. Turning to 2016 guidance on slide 15, we're initiating 2016 guidance ranges with adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion and $3.2 billion, consisting of business and utility-scale renewable adjusted EBITDA of $1.545 billion to $1.67 billion, retail adjusted EBITDA of $650 million to $725 million, which is a $50 million increase over our initial 2015 retail guidance. And finally, NRG Yield adjusted EBITDA of $805 million, which includes the recently closed wind drop downs. Our free cash flow before growth guidance, which is net of maintenance and environmental capital, is expected to be a robust $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Our 2016 guidance excludes the impact of the GreenCo businesses as identified during our Reset call on September 18, for which NRG's total cash committed is limited to $125 million, which will be managed through an intercompany revolving credit facility as part of NRG 2016 capital allocation, which I will review in greater detail shortly. As David mentioned earlier, to further clarify the cash flow and capital available at the NRG level, we are also initiating guidance for the portion of our total free cash flow before growth guidance, which is available at the NRG level, which for 2016 we expect to be $750 million to $950 million. This range is based on deducting the portion of our total free cash flow guidance expected to be generated at NRG's non-guarantor subsidiaries, which consist primarily of GenOn, NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO assets. And then finally, adding back the expected cash distributions and dividends from these subsidiaries makes up the adjustment to arrive at NRG level free cash flow before growth. Turning to slide 16, and continuing the theme of clarifying and enhancing our disclosures, in light of increasing questions and focus from our investors on leverage levels at NRG, I have provided here a deconstructed view of the consolidated balance sheet, as well as the derivation of the NRG corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio, which is the cornerstone of our targeted prudent balance sheet metrics. As you recall, we target this ratio at 4.25 times, which is consistent with our targeted BB credit metrics, recently reaffirmed by S&P. Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance and previously committed debt reduction from 2015, we are in line with that target. As shown on the left of the slide, although NRG's consolidated debt balance as of the quarter end is approximately $20 billion, over $11 billion of that debt resides at our excluded project subsidiaries, which consist primarily of NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO assets, most of the debt at which is fully amortized and consistent with the contract durations, with the remaining non-recourse debt residing at GenOn. This debt is non-recourse to NRG and is not counted in our corporate credit metrics, including the debt-to-EBITDA ratio prescribed by our credit facilities, which contain thresholds governing our ability to purchase shares and pay dividends. Only the remaining $8.8 billion of debt consisting of our senior unsecured notes and term loan facility is recourse to NRG and counts toward this ratio. On the right of the slide, after adjusting for the $500 million in 2015 capital already allocated to NRG-level debt reduction, which we expect to augment using 2016 capital, we anticipate corporate debt, or the numerator of the ratio, to be less than $8.3 billion in 2016. Turning to corporate EBITDA, or the denominator of the targeted ratio, we began with the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance. As only cash distributions from our excluded project subsidiaries count as EBITDA for ratio purposes, we next deduct the midpoint 2016 EBITDA from these subsidiaries, and then add back these cash distributions, which include our share of dividends from NRG Yield and distributions and payments from the remaining nonrecourse subsidiaries, primarily the remaining ROFO assets. The final adjustment is an add-back of non-cash components of corporate level expenses, which we're deducting in arriving at our EBITDA guidance. What results is $1.95 billion of corporate-level EBITDA, which basically represents EBITDA from assets and businesses from our recourse subsidiaries, plus the cash distributions and payments from nonrecourse subs. Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, our expected corporate debt-to-EBITDA is no greater than 4.26 times, in line with our long-term target for this ratio and significantly below both our restricted payment and default ratios. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to augment our 2015 allocation of capital to debt reduction, with additional debt reduction using 2016 capital driving this ratio even lower and providing additional balance sheet strengthening as we move into 2017. We remain committed to shrinking the NRG balance sheet as part of the NRG Reset, and leaving no doubt as to the strength and integrity of NRG credit ratios as we move into 2016 and beyond. Turning to slide 17, having initiated 2016 guidance, I'd like to next review NRG-level capital available for allocation for 2016. We are focused here on capital allocation at the NRG level, which excludes NRG Yield excess cash as well as GenOn excess cash reserve for liquidity and the completion of our asset optimization project at GenOn. Moving from left to right, we have now allocated all remaining 2015 capital towards debt reduction, which we expect to execute over the balance of 2015 into 2016, totaling $500 million in discretionary debt reduction at NRG. This balance consists of $200 million, which is one-third of the targeted 2015 NRG Yield drop down proceeds, plus $300 million of remaining capital also announced as part of the NRG Reset in September, which we are now committing to debt reduction as well. Turning to 2016, incremental NRG level capital for allocation begins with the midpoint of our NRG-level free cash flow guidance of $850 million. Total 2016 committed capital at NRG is approximately $600 million, as shown in the red bar, and is comprised of the $125 million GreenCo runway revolver; growth investments of $250 million, primarily our PH Robinson peaker project, Carbon 360, and the eVgo California settlement; with the balance allocated to NRG-level corporate debt amortization and our common stock dividend. The remaining free cash flow balance of $250 million, combined with $500 million of 2015 capital remaining to be deployed towards debt reduction, leads to $750 million in capital available at the NRG level through 2016, which we expect to further supplement through the execution of the remainder of the NRG Reset initiatives. These initiatives include non-recourse project financing, through which we expect to fund approximately $250 million of environmental CapEx at Midwest generation, thereby increasing capital available to NRG. Having now completed the rating process and documentation for this financing, we are prepared to launch when market conditions are more favorable. Targeted asset sale proceeds from the NRG Reset totaling at least $500 million are expected to further augment excess capital for consolidated balance sheet reduction. Finally, and potentially supplemental to the $1.1 billion in Reset capital, any proceeds from the GreenCo sell down and future NRG yield drop downs, located currently by equity market recovery, which serve to further expand NRG level capital for allocation. By way of reference, in the upper right corner of the page I have provided a walk, beginning with the remaining 2016 excess NRG-level free cash flow through the other components of the NRG Reset, which combined now total $1.1 billion in consolidated 2016 capital to be deployed toward shrinking the balance sheet. Finally, turning to slide to 18, I'd like to briefly review and update our expectations for significant reductions in maintenance, environmental, and growth capital from 2016 to 2017. Our revised 2016 capital expenditures reflect reductions in growth CapEx, stemming primarily from the $100 million in reduced spend on fuel conversions at GenOn as well as GreenCo-related growth CapEx, which is now capped at $125 million based on the runway amount. Turning to 2017, due to incremental reductions in expected 2017 growth capital expenditures, including the elimination of distributed-generation solar and residential solar, we now expect a year-over-year reduction of over $550 million in consolidated CapEx in 2017 versus 2016, with approximately $350 million of this reduction occurring at the NRG level. These substantial year-over-year reductions in expected capital expenditures provide a significant cushion against continued softness in commodity prices and a potential uplift in available capital in 2017, which may be allocated to further balance sheet reductions, including debt reduction and return of shareholder capital. With that, I'll turn it back to David. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Kirk. And if we turn to our closing slide, which is slide 20, we end by quantifying a point previously made, which is that NRG's financial results in 2016 are not nearly as exposed to fluctuating gas prices as the market seems to be suggesting. We have successfully mitigated the downward exposure of falling natural gas prices through our hedging program and through our asset diversification. In the ultra-low commodity price environment that currently grips our market, this strategy is what has enabled us today to guide to a healthy adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow level for 2016, and which, together with the substantially increased capital flexibility arising out of the steps listed on the right side of this page, should enable us to implement a substantial capital allocation program over the months ahead. Our goal in all this is to make NRG a simpler, less leveraged company over the duration of the Reset program. NRG is not just an IPP. As we have demonstrated on this call, NRG's unique advantage is that our balanced wholesale-retail business mitigates the financial impact of low energy commodity prices, which enables us to profitably serve our retail customers with a growing mix of products and services. This is essential during the current low commodity price cycle, when the value pendulum in the sector clearly has swung to serving the end-use energy customer. As I said, this wholesale-retail balance is NRG's unique advantage, and all of us at NRG are excited about the opportunities we have in front of us to maximize the value of this advantage for the benefit of NRG shareholders. And with that, Liz, we are happy to take people's questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for the enhanced disclosure, it's extremely helpful, very well done. Just on, hit on the couple topics on, first on just coal supply, Just given the very low commodity environment we're in, very low gas and power prices, could you talk a little bit further to just what you're seeing in terms of potential ability, whether it'd be on transport or the commodity itself \u2013 what are the dynamics, in terms of being able to continue to improve your position in terms of your coal costs? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Stephen, you want to tell us the two questions, so \u2013 and then we'll answer them. So we're tipped off and we can prepare an answer to the second? Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure thing. My other question is just on competitive dynamics in retail. And I was curious whether you're seeing overall any competitive dynamic changes in that business, and then more specifically whether you see a potential for some of your retail competitors to try to get into solar, as you've been doing? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Into solar, not into -- not IPPs getting into retail, but you're interested in ... Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: In retailer to solar. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's right. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, let me start by answering the last part of that question, and then Chris Moser's going to answer your coal question, and Elizabeth, as soon as Chris finishes, you answer the question about competitive dynamics in retail. But I would say, Stephen, given the market's reception to us getting into distributor \u2013 so I don't think that's going to encourage other IPPs to get into that area. But, so \u2013 but in terms of the other IPPs getting into retail, which is something that I've sort of been expecting for a long time, maybe Elizabeth can talk about that in terms of the context of competitive dynamics. But \u2013 but Chris, why don't you start with talking about the coal dynamics, and Elizabeth, you take over from Chris. Christopher S. Moser - Senior Vice President- Commercial Operations : Sure. I would characterize it like this, Stephen. I think we're working with our whole coal supply chain and the partners in it to make sure we've got reliable and competitively priced fuel. There's really two pieces to that. There's the rail piece and then the commodity piece. I mean on the commodity side, if you've been watching over the past couple of weeks, we've seen a pretty decent jog down in the prices, specifically PRB, but NAZ (40:36) as well, and so that will obviously help us next year. And then on the transportation side, without getting into too much specifics, I would say that our transportation partners have been good partners with us and want to make sure that the coal continues to flow. So, I think that's how I would answer that. Elizabeth Killinger - SVP & President, NRG Retail, NRG Energy, Inc.: And Stephen, regarding the competitive dynamics in the retail business, I think we continue to see intense competitive markets with \u2013 we're 50 players in Texas, and it varies by market in the East, but anywhere from kind of 15 to 30-something competitors. So, lots of competitive activity. We are seeing competitors extend their product offerings to include more products than simply retail electricity, and that takes the form of energy management solutions, natural gas, some home-control type features; as you noticed, home solar, and otherwise. So, we expect that to continue, which is why we continue to lead the market in evaluating what consumers want, and making sure we're delivering the best of it to them. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much \u2013 sorry, David. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Steve, I just, I guess my reaction on your people going into solar, response a little flippant about IPPs; what I think \u2013 and look, no one can predict the future, but I think the period ahead in home solar is going to be focused on consolidation around what I think is going to emerge as the four main players, the Solar Cities, the Vivints, the Sunruns, and ourselves. I don't expect another IPP to come into that space anytime soon, but I would actually be surprised, since \u2013 and, I'm \u2013 I subscribe to the view that home solar is a mortal threat to the utility business model. I would be surprised if, within the next 18 to 24 months, some big utility doesn't try and buy their way into this space, but that's just my speculation. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, good morning, guys. Just on that update to the balance sheet, what target metrics do you guys want to get to at the corporate NRG balance sheet perspective, and of the $1.6 billion that you are expecting between now and the end of the next year for debt reduction? Is that all NRG-specific debt, or is that going to include some GenOn and some other pieces in that number? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Sure, Dan. It's Kirk. I'll take that in reverse order. The $1.6 billion is really a consolidated look at uplift in capital for allocation. As you know, in particular, $500 million of that is what is part of the NRG Reset in asset sales, and depending on the mix of those asset sales \u2013 some of which we expect to be at the GenOn level, because we're focused on the Northeast \u2013 that, more than anything else, would govern the proportion of the allocation of capital toward debt reduction at GenOn versus NRG. As to the targeted metric, we continue to target, as I'd said, 4.25 times corporate debt to corporate EBITDA. We also focused on FFO to debt, keeping that number below the \u2013 at or below the high-teens level. And I'd say that the tertiary component of that is, we look to stay around 50% debt-to-capital, though that is a book ratio. Certainly something that we focused on, the rating agencies focused on, but I think it's probably certainly tertiary to those first two. And so \u2013 and part of the reason why we focused on that 4.25 is, as I said, it comports with what, based on our ongoing conversations with the rating agencies, support those BB credit metrics. It also gives us a significant cushion against the thresholds in our credit facility, above which we're no longer permitted to pay dividends or buy back stock. So we've got a significant cushion there, and obviously even further cushioned below the default ratio. So those are the reasons that go into those target metrics. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess just on capital allocation, can you remind us, with all the resets, what growth CapEx commitments you guys have beyond 2015? And then maybe along those capital allocation lines, how you think about, is there going to be room for buy-backs next year, or is this all going to be debt related? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Well, to answer the first part of that question, in terms of committed growth capital, as I think we've laid out, as we move into 2016, what we're seeing in terms of the growth capital on a consolidated basis is primarily the completion of the GenOn repowerings, as well as the \u2013 and beyond 2017, the beginning of the capital allocated to our Carlsbad and Mandalay projects, and the balance of that capital in 2016 and a little bit further into 2017 is just, A, the remainder of the Carbon 360 project, which has about $150 million of capital left to go in about equal parts between 2016 and 2017, and the eVgo California settlement, which in both 2016 and 2017 is at or about $20 million in each year. That is really the bulk; that is all of the remaining growth capital that we have or expect to allocate at this point. As to the allocation of capital toward the balance sheet and your comment about share repurchases, what I would say is, as I'd mentioned, we're continuing to focus on finding opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Certainly our dividend is something we're committed to, and certainly we look to supplement that with share repurchases, but at the present time we are going to focus in swinging the pendulum towards the debt side of the balance sheet. In particular to leave no doubt, and to ensure not only that ratio is improved in 2016, but we are confident in our ability to maintain that ratio through 2017. I think that more than anything else will determine our focus in the near term on debt reduction, and ultimately arriving at that ratio through that debt reduction will govern the proportion of our capital allocation which would later go to share repurchases. Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Yeah. So if I'm looking at slide 17, just to be clear, thinking about the capital allocation beyond the $500 million, since the CapEx savings is coming at GenOn and a portion of the asset sales will probably be at GenOn, we should think about sort of $250 million, maybe plus or minus \u2013 plus whatever portion of the asset sales are non-GenOn, as being pointed at debt reduction at the parent, incremental to the $500 million in 2016, is that correct? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : I think the way you've categorized that, Greg, is right, although certainly we \u2013 as I've said, we're focused near-term in allocating that capital towards debt reduction. So I'd be hesitant to say prescriptively all of it, but for right now that's certainly where we are definitely focused. And the way you describe that in terms of the geography, yes, $100 million of that CapEx savings all resides at GenOn. The $250 million in the non-recourse financing we expect to be at the NRG level, offsetting what would otherwise be NRG capital allocation or CapEx towards the completion of that environmental spend at Midwest Gen. And then the asset sales, depending on the outcome, will be a blend in terms of proceeds between NRG and GenOn. So the way you summarized that is accurate, yes. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Right. And then the first \u2013 your primary focus is debt reduction. And when we get into 2017, you're looking at, presumably, if we could keep the EBITDA from bleeding too much, an incremental $350 million improvement in cash available for capital allocation at the parent? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Yes. That's correct. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Which is \u2013 and as I said, that does not include, at least in that calculation, any anticipated proceeds from the GreenCo process or further NRG Yield drop downs, which would obviously supplement that $350 million. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Got you. And then my follow-up question, when I look at the buildup on page 16, the GenOn EBITDA of $335 million, that's net of the shared services payments. So if I was looking at a simple EBITDA just on asset performance, you're projecting it to be about $530 million in 2016? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : That's right. You'd add back that roughly $200 million to get to that sort of asset-level performance as you said, correct. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks guys. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys, good morning. First quick easy question for you. I wanted to focus on the $100 million cost savings, just what that comprises of, and also more importantly, I see a FORNRG statement here of a cumulative 180. Just wanted to understand \u2013 or 150 through 2018. Can you comment how the two jive? What should we expect in 2017 and 2018 in terms of run-rate increments? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mauricio? Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP : Hey, good morning, Julien. So, I mean, the first one is the operating expenses. And I would \u2013 I mean, I listed some of the main drivers of that, but I will say the first gives you the impact of the decisions, the asset optimization decisions that we made at Portland, the suspension of Portland and the retirement of Huntley. The second one is, we've gone through a line-by-line review of every single asset, particularly those that are in more challenging market conditions, and we have right-sized the cost structure to comport with those market dynamics. And then the third one is, as we have a portfolio of close to 50,000 megawatts, allow us to optimize the management of forced outage risk, and what I call the contingency money that we know we're going to have to spend, we just don't know where. So if you have a single asset you have to budget for the forced outage, the probability of forced outage. But when you have 50,000 megawatts, then you can optimize across the entire portfolio. So that is the step one. Step two is the FORNRG portfolio, and this is a target. You're familiar with the FORNRG, because we show the fourth iteration of this. We are looking at, company-wide, how can we do the things are we're doing today, better in a more cost effective way. So think of this as contract renegotiations, rail renegotiations, property tax renegotiations. So, I mean it is the host of things that we can do, that is very difficult to pinpoint today, but we've been very effective and we've been very successful in achieving, in the past, these cost savings, which they will flow directly to the bottom line. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And that's all, in every part of the company. Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP : That is, everywhere in the company, including retail, just across the company. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. So perhaps just a quick follow up there. Some of your assets seem to generate negative cash flow in Texas. I'd be curious how that might fit into that puzzle? And then perhaps to boot with that, a more strategic question, coming back to perhaps the, what you alluded to earlier Dave, about yourselves being in those top four residential players, how is the strategic review proceeding? And perhaps, if you can answer one question, what is it that you need to \"fix\" your retail solar \u2013 your solar efforts more broadly? Is it an installation platform, or what are you kind of ending up in the strategic process thus far? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Do I... Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP : I mean, I'll \u2013 Julien, I'll go first about your... David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll probably go on the second part of the question. I forgot what the first was. Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP : I will take the first one, David. So, I think you are alluding to \u2013 I don't know what particular asset you are saying, but what I can tell you, Julien is I think we've demonstrated financial discipline when we have an asset that, number one, is in negative free cash flow; number two, the prospects of a recovery in that market are such that we cannot justify the continuing operation of that plant; and then number three, which I think is significantly important in Texas, is the prospect in terms of additional environmental CapEx to comply with upcoming rules. We will evaluate, and if needed retire, just like we did in Huntley. What I can tell you is that we're not in such conditions right now in Texas. I have said in the past that our coal portfolio is a low cost, environmentally controlled portfolio, and I would expect that coal plants that actually have a much dire forecast in terms of environmental CapEx, we'll have to make that decision before \u2013 so I'll just leave it at that, but make no mistake, I mean, we will continue with the financial discipline that we have shown over the years. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Good. And Julien, I shall break your part of the question that I'm going to answer into, itself into two parts. So it was, sort of how is the strategic process going with GreenCo, I think particularly as it applies with a focus on Home Solar. And then you say, what you need to do to fix the sort of issues within Home Solar? So \u2013 and Kelsey is on the phone, and Kelsey if you have anything to add after I finish, go ahead, particularly obviously on the second part of that question. So, on the strategic process, what I would tell you, Julien, is we've been through the sort of preliminary discussion stage, out there talking to multiple people who are interested, and I think specifically road-testing the idea that what we're looking to do is sell a majority stake to someone who is sort of strategically aligned with our thinking about the prospects for the business, but maintaining a substantial minority stake so that we can maintain the business connection with the rest of the company, and also have a second bite at the apple in terms of value realization. And it's early days yet, what I would tell you, I mean it's relatively easy for people to express interest before they have to write down a number on a piece of paper, but I would say in the early going, there is quite a lot of interest in it, and no problems with the structure we're proposing. So that's what I would tell you about where we are now on the strategic process. With respect to the issues in the Home Solar, what I would tell you is there are operational issues, basic blocking and tackling, that sort of come with running a business that has complex logistics and is growing at an annualized triple-digit rate. And so you get the sales engine revved up and then the installation and the deployment have to follow, and getting that exact balance right, as I think other players in the industry have demonstrated, is a constant work in progress. But I would say there's an enormous amount of attention on it, particularly the productivity of our installation crews right now I think is double what it was just a couple of months ago. And then there's the paper work from going from installation to deployment, which is \u2013 which is obviously, in terms of getting the right software and just making the process much more efficient. Kelcy, is there anything that you would want to add to that? Kelcy Pegler - President-NRG Home Solar : No, I think that's pretty good, David. I would just say we're working on the cohesiveness. We're satisfied with both our sales and installation increase in Q3. Most notably what was important to us was we were able to sell and install more systems without adding significant head count. In fact, we ended Q3, almost exactly flat from a head count perspective. So without adding cost. And Julien, I think what we've done is, we've really focused and we're determined to achieve that 90 day from signature to energization of the solar system. And we've identified with this theme of an excess backlog, which is any job that exceeds that 90-day timeline. And then the optimal backlog, which is all the jobs being executed within that timeline, and we believe we're poised to be executing all of our backlog and all of our bookings to energization in the first half of 2016 within 90 days. And so that's what I would tell you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Julien. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Good morning. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just picking up on the question about the GreenCo process. I was curious, David, you made the statement in your prepared remarks \u2013 I think it was the prepared remarks \u2013 that you wouldn't be surprised to see utilities wanting to buy into this business. Are you suggesting that among the parties you're talking to, there may be some utilities? Can you just give us any color, or is that sort of more further out in time? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, no \u2013 well, I didn't say it in my prepared remarks, just for accuracy's sake. I would not say that that's the main body of \u2013 I mean, if you \u2013 I guess Jonathan, what I would say in simpler terms, if you divided the people that are interested \u2013 or if you categorized the people interested in GreenCo into financial partners and strategic partners, there are significantly more financial partners than there are potential strategic partners. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I mean, that's helpful. And then I guess, I mean like, when you announced the Reset, you were talking much more broadly about potential structures, majority, minority, and the like, and it now seems to be \u2013 you have enough visibility that you are pretty confident that you can do a majority deal. Is that what we should take away from the shift in the language? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think what you should take away is that, through the preliminary phase, we got a significant amount of encouragement on that, but I think what you should really take away is the point that was made in the prepared remarks, that first and foremost it's value that we're looking for so. So, again, it's \u2013 I'm just commenting, I mean, people have not put numbers down on a piece of paper. So there's a significant amount of flexibility that remains around the GreenCo process, and we won't \u2013 I don't want to give any sort of final answer until we see numbers on paper, and then we might modify accordingly, but definitely in the non-quantified stage, there is a lot of encouragement around that structure. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And you, can you just give us any sense of when, what do you think the likely timing for this to play out? I heard you say you prioritized value over speed. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, I don't remember if we said it in our prepared remarks on September 17, but I think we did, which was that, we thought the whole process would be concluded within six months to nine months, and I continue to be highly confident in that timeframe. I mean, I know that some questions have happened, would be able to give people sort of more of an update by the end of the year. And I just can't make a call on that, because usually right when you're in the middle \u2013 I mean, we will clearly know more by the end of the year, but whether we share with you \u2013 usually you don't talk about things when you're in the middle of an active discussion. So I can't really help you, other than say, Jonathan, we're confident that it'll all be done within the original six month to nine month timeframe. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much, David. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Liz, I'm sorry, and I'm sorry for the people who want to continue to get in the queue, but we \u2013 since we have an NRG Yield call in a relatively few minutes, we're going to take one more question, and then for the others in the queue, again, I'm sorry, and please call in and we'll answer any questions that you have. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Tudor Pickering. Your line is now open. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Could you just kind of give us the timeframe for the cost cuts? So it's the $100 million, is that for the full 2016 or is it a partial year? And then the remaining $150 million, when does is that fully kick in? David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Neel, it's a good question. I'm glad you asked it, because I mean, I would say within the prioritization of time, within the, all the various initiatives that make up the Reset, our immediate focus, and something that's taken an enormous amount of time of management team and across the organization, has been cost-cutting. And that's precisely so that we could give you the answer I'm about to give you, which is we're \u2013 we're working so hard so quickly, because we want full year 2016 effect, both with respect to the G&A cost program, which internally goes under the name DOP, for doing our part, and then on the O&M cost saving portion. And Mauricio, do you have anything to add to that or... Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP : No. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think so. Yes. Anyway, Neel, did you have any follow-up question, and then we'll call it a day, Liz. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yeah, just had one quick question. So, with gas prices where they are, how are Parish and Limestone in Texas running now? Are you seeing some displacement from gas assets, or what do those capacity factors look like? Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP : Yeah, Neel. So, I mean I think the statistics that we're providing on the third quarter were pretty representative of the \u2013 how competitive those two assets are. I mean, we increased our generation in Texas for our baseload fleet, that includes nuclear and coal. As we go into the shorter months, we always see a reduction in capacity factors, but that's just normal seasonality. I can't tell you that we're seeing an increasing coal to gas switching that we haven't seen in previous months, so. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Neel, thank you for the question. David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I just want to thank everyone for participating, and we'll keep you updated in the weeks and months to come. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you many now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Welcome to the NRG Energy Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Cole, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Kevin Cole : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s full year and fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call is being broadcast live over the phone and via the webcast, which can be located on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. As this is a call for NRG Energy, any statements made in this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG perspective. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s press release and presentation. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today and covering the financial part of the presentation is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Commercial Operations are available for questions. Let me also formally welcome Kevin Cole, as our new Head of Investor Relations. He is well-known by many of you, having spent a number of years in the energy sector on both the buy and sell side. I also want to thank Chad Plotkin for providing transitional support over the past few months and wish him well, as he moves on to take other responsibilities within the Company. Before we begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank David Crane for his years of service at NRG. We are grateful for his many contributions to the Company for over a decade. And I want to wish him well in his next endeavors. Today is my first time, addressing you as CEO of NRG. So, I\u2019m going to deviate slightly from our normal earnings agenda because I want to use this time to not only report on the results of our business, which were exceptional, but also to give you my perspective on the strategic direction of the Company and our immediate priorities. So, let\u2019s begin on slide four, where I have outlined the key messages you should take away from today\u2019s call. First, as our financial performance has shown time and time again, we have the right portfolio and the right platform to succeed in this environment. Our business delivers strong results, during periods of low prices and importantly, our generation fleet remains significantly levered till market recovers. Second, in this environment, we will benefit from having a stronger balance sheet. We have initiated a comprehensive plan to reduce debt, streamline costs, and replenish capital. We are proactively doing this to take advantage of market opportunities in the short-term, so we can benefit from a market recovery in the medium to long run. Third, in order to afford ourselves maximum flexibility on our capital allocation decisions, we are recalibrating our dividend to be consistent with the capital intensive and cyclical nature of our industry. Finally, we are focused on bringing the GreenCo process to a closure that maximizes value for our shareholders. We are reintegrating business renewables back into the NRG platform with no change to our financial guidance and reinforcing our strategic relationship with NRG Yield. We are continuing to sell process of EVgo and NRG Home Solar. All of these actions support our objective to continue building and operating the best integrated competitive power company. Now, let me elaborate in more detail. Starting on slide six with the financial performance of our business, I am very pleased to report that we achieved the upper range of our adjusted EBITDA guidance in 2015, despite the challenging power markets, a company-wide restructuring, and changes in management. We remained focused on our business and delivered top quartile safety business with our retail business having a record year, demonstrating the consistency and value of our integrated platform. So, to every one of my colleagues, job well done. There are a few points that I want to highlight. We are reaffirming 2016 financial guidance, which now includes our business renewables. Our commercial team continues to execute superbly and have mitigated the impact of lower prices for the year. We are off to a good start on our plan to strengthen the balance sheet. Since November, we have retired close to $700 million in high-yield debt at a significant discount bar. We are expanding this by an additional $925 million of debt reductions, which Kirk will cover in more detail. We remain focused in replenishing capital with $500 million in targeted asset sales in 2016 and we are accelerating our cost savings timeline. And as I mentioned before and something I will discuss in more detail in a few slides, we are reducing the annual dividend to $0.12 per share from $0.15 per share, which afford us maximum flexibility in our capital allocation program, during this market period. Let me now move to the strategic part of the presentation and provide you my perspective on where NRG\u2019s today and what I believe separate us from others in our industry. Stakeholders repeatedly tell me that NRG story and capital structure is too complicated about the company\u2019s spending too much money on businesses that are outside of its core competencies. I have taken this seriously and I am here today telling you that simplification of our business is an imperative, both for external perception and internal focus. Efforts are already under way to address this concern. Everything from the way NRG\u2019s preceding the market to the way we disclose information, to the way we run our platform will be greatly simplified over the next several quarters. Simplification starts with the way that we think about the business. The graphic on the left side of slide seven represents our thinking. NRG has and continues to be comprised of two main businesses, generation, inclusive all renewable; and retail. That is our focus and there should be no mistake about that. But, it is not only these two businesses independently that create a most value for NRG, it is the interaction between the two through our scalable operating platform. This is truly a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The plus points between our generation and retail businesses underpin the NRG value for position. A generational fleet that is well diversified in terms of location, merit-order and fuel price minimizing exposure to downturns in any one market, but flexible enough to benefit from specific areas like we saw during the polar vortex, a complementary business model that helps insulate revenues from commodity risks. Today, two-thirds of our economic gross margin comes from sources that are counter or non-correlated to gas, like retail; capacity revenues or long-term contracts. A cash flow machine, even in what has become a very difficult commodity cycle that is enhanced by our ability to replenish capital through NRG Yield. While I believe it\u2019s not fully appreciated, much to our own doing is the shared and scalable platform that we have built. Our ability to leverage our common platform to grow our business and realize cost synergy in the processes absolutely unique in this industry. And not only is it unique but later in the presentation, I\u2019ll explain why I think it is necessary to succeed. In summary, my view of the business is that it\u2019s simple, focused and differentiated within the competitive power space. Turning now to slide eight, I want to take a step back and give you my perspective on the competitive power industry and what I believe it takes to be successful. This industry\u2019s currently undergoing a paradigm shift. We are in periods of sustained low natural gas prices, load growth that has slowed in most markets except Texas and the Gulf Coast, [indiscernible] technologies are coming on to the grid, changing traditional dispatch, market growths are focused on reliability, particularly in the face of retirement, renewables continue to enter the market as regulation focuses on limiting emissions from conventional power. Being a pure IPP player is no longer enough to succeed in the market today and defiantly not tomorrow. The company that can successfully navigate all the risks and changes in the competitive power industry is one that is diversified, not only in terms of its generation portfolio, but also in terms of its business line. It is too easy for any one fuel type or any one business line to experience turmoil or disruption in the current shifting market. As I mentioned before, the operational platform has become a value differentiator and to a great extent, a source of incremental revenue. Operational excellence is always non-negotiable, regardless of the industry. But in ours, building an operational platform that enables economies of scale is even more fundamental. For NRG, this operational platform has become a differentiated means of margin enhancement, as complementary businesses intersect and create opportunities for companies to startle different markets. But this is just the foundation. In the competitive power industry, companies need to remain leveraged to the upside by constantly assessing the markets and the economic viability of opportunities to grow the businesses in a disciplined manner, as markets evolve. For me, this means investing in areas where you can have a competitive advantage. It does not mean trying to be everything to everyone. Last, I believe financial discipline needs to be a top priority for companies in our sector. It is not prudent to take a myopic approach to managing the balance sheet and capital allocation. These decisions must be made on a portfolio level, looking at all parts of the business and align decision making with current market opportunities. So, how do we start up against these principles? I have already stressed how pleased I am with the operational execution across the business within NRG. We have made great strides in diversifying our business and revenues to protect us from low natural gas and power prices. At the same time, we remain well-positioned for growth, looking for low cost development opportunities and to monetize assets through our static relationship within NRG Yield. These unique attributes, position NRG for sustained success in the industry. As you saw in the earlier slides, we have identified cost control and financial discipline, as one of our key opportunities for improvement. While we have already begun a period of cost savings, I still believe we can do more. And I am actively working with the teams to uncover new opportunities. Our other area of focus will be in how we approach capital allocation and how we manage our capital structure. I want to make sure that our capital decisions meet with the current and near term market cycles. We plan to be transparent in our capital allocation. And there should be no head scratching when it comes to how we deploy capital. And on that note, our focus right now needs to be on deleveraging the business to ensure we stay ahead of this market cycle, so we can take the advantage of the opportunities that will result from it. We have already made significant progress and we will continue to do so until we see market conditions change. As we just discussed, NRG operates a large and well-diversified integrated portfolio with assets that are environmentally well-controlled. While it is important to have a good foundation, there is no one size fits all approach when it comes to regional dynamics. On the slide nine, we outlined what I refer to as our go-to-market strategy that reflects each of our regions, specific trends and market dynamics. In the East region, it\u2019s all about reliability or capacity revenues. We have seen system-operators support for capacity products that reward reliability and performance, particularly in the face of retirements and weather events such as the polar vortex. For example, in the first capacity performance auction in PJM, we cleared close to 90% of our fleet and increased capacity revenues by 80% over the next three years. We are about to finish the repositioning of our portfolio to shift our margin mix from energy to capacity, via fuel conversations, which reduces operating costs significantly and environmental retrofits to maintain a cheap option on key assets to capitalize on higher power prices. In the Gulf, we continued to benefit from our integrated platform in this lower price environment where our retail operation continues to over perform. Let me just say that our retail business in Texas is virtually impossible to replicate due to its scale and linkage with generation. We have demonstrated the value of our retail franchise for the past seven years with 2015 being our best year yet. This is a key differentiator of ours and one that we will continue to focus on, and grow. Our generation fleet has the scale and environmental controls needed to sustain this weak price environment, where we should see further supply rationalization. At the same time, there is still the potential for the market to self-correct and be enhanced by improvements in market structure and feed pricing. The West region is a story of renewables and distributor resources, and maintaining a capacity fleet that supports the grid, given the intermittent nature of these resources. There is a need for quick start, well-located assets. And that is exactly what NRG has been successful in that market. Securing contracted assets and developing sites in favorable locations that can then be monetized through NRG Yield, providing us a long-term dividend payment. So far, we have developed over 1,800 megawatts of quick start generation and won nearly 800 megawatts of repowering at our Carlsbad and Puente sites. We have been successful in growing our renewable and distributor portfolio and with the reintegration of the renewables group into NRG, this will continue to be a growth area. Now, turning to slide 10, we remain focused on streamlining the organization. I am pleased with our efforts in taking close to $350 million in costs out of the system, but I am not satisfied and we continue to look for more. So today, I am announcing an accelerated timeline for our target cost savings of $150 million under our core NRG continuous improvement process, which has yielded so many benefits across the organization over the years. We expect this EBITDA accretive cost savings to be realized through end of 2017. Additionally, we continue to prune our portfolio to bring incremental capital back into the Company. We have executed on $138 million in asset sales thus far and are on track with our $500 million target. Last, we are nearing the completion of our current generation fleet modernization program, which reduces our CapEx commitment by nearly $650 million in 2017, providing us additional flexibility on capital allocation in the next five years. Moving on to slide 11, I know there has been a lot of questions about my perspective on renewables and how this relates to the GreenCo process that we announced late last year. Let me be clear. As the CEO of not only the largest competitive generation owner in the country, but also one of the largest renewable companies, I recognize that this market represents a significant development opportunity, given said renewable targets, customer needs, our competencies and financial incentives, and it is one in which we must participate. However, I am committed to ensuring that our efforts in this area match our skills and capabilities and are executed in a way that is value-creating for shareholders. I am mindful of what has and continues to be a very deliberate process around GreenCo to determine the best way to create value in these business areas. So, let me summarize where we are now. First, from here on out, we will no longer refer to GreenCo, as described in our September update call. As we think about the individual business strategies moving forward, it no longer makes sense to group them under one headline. Not all renewable businesses are viewed the same in terms of fit and value for NRG. Today, I am announcing the reintegration of our traditional NRG business. Everything but the utility scale, since that was never part of the GreenCo process, back into the Company to ensure we\u2019ll maintain our advantage position and skills to participate in the changing landscape of the power industry. It is important to recognize that many of our C&I customers expect us to be able to integrate renewables on and offsite. Said another way, our efforts in renewables will mirror the strength of our integrated platform. And when augmented by our partnership with NRG Yield, our renewables business, which is net cash positive on a full year basis, does not require permanent capital from NRG. In addition, the reintegration of NRG Renew will not cause any change to our financial guidance. I am also pleased to announce that NRG and NRG Yield have reallocated $50 million in previously committed cash equity from the residential solar partnership to the business renewable partnership. This change reinforces our alignment with NRG Yield with mutual focus in renewable energy development. Finally, as you will know from the slide, we are in active negotiations around strategic transactions Home Solar and EVgo, so my comments will be limited. I do expect to complete this process in the second quarter. Turning on to slide 12, I want to walk you through our revised approach to NRG dividend. The dividend was launched in 2012 for several reasons, to better highlight the value of our contracted assets; to enable ownership by dividend restricted income funds; and to add yield support. Today, our world looks much different than it in 2012. We now have a deliberate dividend paying vehicle in NRG Yield to highlight the value of contracted generation and the assumed volatility in the IPP sector has mitigated our ability to realize yield support. And so, we meet our fundamental view that a static dividend approach is not an appropriate use of capital, given the deep cyclical nature of our sector. With that, we are reducing the dividend to $0.12 per share from $0.58 per share or to about 1% yield. I want to be crystal clear that this reduction is not due to balance sheet constrains. It is simply aligning our dividend approach with our broader focus on adaptability, while at the same time, maintaining a differentiated platform that appeals to a broad range of investors and creating shareholder value through all commodity, credit and development cycles. Moving to slide 13, this is one of the most important topics of today\u2019s call. My core fundamental view on capital allocation is to stay focus on what we want to become. However, given the deep cyclical nature of the sector, we must first ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital. We are proactively taking the necessary steps to not only there\u2019s no doubt about our strength during this cycle but also to take advantage of opportunities that arise during market dislocations. Kirk will discuss in more detail the specifics, but I want to offer three takeaways. One, the nearing conclusion of our large capital reinvestment program provides us the latitude to effectively harvest strong free cash flows through our asset optimization program, as I believe we have a good line of sight on market prices and environmental requirements, at least through the end of the decade. Next, paying down debt is fundamental as it assures our equity holders that NRG has the flexibility to create strong returns for them when the market recovers, and it assures our customers a stronger counterparty. My goal is to create no doubt in the strength of our balance sheet. So, at this time, maintaining our current target ratio of four and a quarter corporate debt to corporate EBITDA gives us ample headroom to our bound covenants and it is consistent with our credit ratings. Last, I remain committed to returning cash to shareholders when we feel that our capital structure is strong enough to allow for flexibility in the event of our prolonged commodity and capital market downturn. I ask that you don\u2019t take our focus on the deleveraging in 2016 as an indication that NRG has turned away from returning capital to shareholders. Rather, I think of it as assuring that our shareholders can have confidence that NRG will be in a strong position to benefit from opportunities and better market conditions. I will now turn it over to Kirk for the financial review. Kirk Andrews : Thank you, Mauricio and good morning everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on slide 15, NRG delivered a total of $3.34 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.127 billion in free cash flow before growth in 2015. Our 2015 results highlight the benefits and resilience of our integrated platform as the low commodity price environment helped Home Retail deliver $739 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding our original 2015 guidance of that segment by more than 20%. Business and Renew achieved $1.881 billion in EBITDA for the year, while NRG Yield which was aided by robust wind conditions in California late in the fourth quarter, contributed $720 million. NRG completed $786 million in dropdowns to NRG Yield in 2015, helping expand capital available for allocation and allowing us to return over $1.3 billion to stakeholders. $628 million of this capital was returned to shareholders including the repurchase of approximately 7% shares outstanding. Having shifted our capital allocation focus late in 2015, since November and through this past month, NRG has retired approximately $700 million in unsecured debt, including over $400 million at the NRG level and $274 million at GenOn. Our reduced unsecured debt allowances will also help increase recurring cash flow with over $50 million in annualized interest savings realized so far, as a result of these efforts. I\u2019d also like to briefly address one element of our 2015 results outside of EBITDA and free cash flow that is the non-cash impairment charges we took in the fourth quarter. On an annual basis, we test our long lived assets and goodwill for potential impairment. Given the prolonged low commodity price outlook, we adjusted our long-term view of power prices, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $5.1 billion, consisting of a write-down of certain fixed assets as well as goodwill. Due to the lack of robust forward prices in ERCOT, this change -- charge rather, is primarily related to impairments of our two coal plants in that market as well as goodwill related to the 2006 acquisition of Texas Genco, of which these two coal plants were a part. Based on the robust commodity price outlook at the time of the acquisition, we allocated the substantial portion of the Texas Genco purchase price to the coal plants with minimal value allocated to the gas plants. And although since that time the Texas Genco portfolio has delivered over $8.5 billion of unlevered free cash flow and provided the platform for our expansion into retail with the acquisition of Reliant in 2009, the outlook in the ERCOT market is nonetheless shifted substantially, currently favoring gas over coal. The impairment of our two ERCOT coal plants aligns the book value of these assets with their forward cash flow profile, as implied by the current market environment. And while the shift in market dynamics also implies the value of our gas portfolio in Texas now substantially exceeds its book value, as many of you are aware accounting rules permit only the write-down of asset book values and do not permit a write-up. These impairment charges also resulted in cumulative net income for the prior three-year period falling below the threshold prescribed for evaluation allowance against our net deferred tax asset balance, largely associated with NRG\u2019s tax NOLs. As a result, our one-time fourth quarter charges also include a $3 billion non-cash charge to tax expense, resulting from a contra asset entry on NRG\u2019s balance sheet, as required under GAAP as a valuation allowance offsetting our net deferred tax asset balance. That said, this accounting charge has no bearing on our ability to utilize our NOLs against future taxable income, and we continue to fully expect to do so. Finally, turning to our 2016 guidance, we are reaffirming the previously announced guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth, which as Mauricio indicated earlier, reflect our expectations for consolidated 2016 results including business renewables, which was previously part of GreenCo. A point of clarification, business renewables NRG\u2019s commercial and industrial distributed solar business, our utility scale renewable assets were not part of the GreenCo business previously excluded from our guidance. Turning to slide 16, I\u2019d like to briefly summarize our capital allocation progress in 2015, focusing on the NRG level, which excludes cash and capital projects at various excluded subsidiaries, primarily GenOn and NRG Yield. Total NRG level capital available through 2015 was $1.7 billion that is shown on the left of the slide. Capital available to NRG includes three components : First NRG level excess cash at the end of 2014, which is basically cash and cash equivalents, less our $700 million minimum cash liquidity reserve, net of any cash collateral posted as of the year-end; second, the portion of our consolidated free cash flow before growth at the NRG level, which is in 2015 was just over $800 million; and finally, during 2015, as I mentioned earlier, NRG receives $786 million proceeds from NRG Yield, which comprises the third component of capital available. During 2015, NRG level capital allocated totaled approximately $1.2 billion with more than half of that amount returned to our shareholders. Having shifted our focus late in the year toward debt reduction, we ended 2015 by retiring $246 million of principal across various maturities of NRG\u2019s unsecured notes, which significantly expanded the reduction of corporate debt beyond the amortization of our term loan facility. And as I mentioned earlier, we continued that deleveraging process through the first two months of the year, which I\u2019ll address more comprehensively when we turn to 2016 capital allocation in a moment. The remaining $312 million was allocated toward growth investments. Importantly, this amount represents a reduction of over $450 million versus our original growth investments forecast provided on our first quarter 2015 earnings call. At that point, we projected approximately $960 million in consolidated growth investments with nearly $800 million of that amount expected at the NRG level. This reduction in NRG level spend was the result of both the slower pace of Home Solar as well as the elimination of other growth investments. Turning to our 2016 NRG level capital allocation plans on slide 17 and building on the delevering process -- progress, rather, we\u2019ve made since November 2015. I will see -- 2016 will see a more significant shift towards further debt reduction, leaving no doubt that our balance sheet strength and credit ratios will remain resilient even if the current low commodity prices continue beyond the current year. We expect approximately $1.5 billion of capital available for allocation at the NRG level in 2016, which again represents excess capital beyond our minimum cash balance reserve for liquidity, which is further supplemented by our $2.5 billion credit facility. 2016 capital available for allocation consists of the excess cash balance at the NRG level at year-end 2015 plus the mid-point of our NRG level free cash flow before gross guidance and expected proceeds from dropdown to NRG Yield of approximately $125 million in 2016. These expected dropdown proceeds consistent of the substantial portion of what remains under our residential solar and business renewable or DG partnerships at NRG Yield, and represents the return of the portion of our 2016 growth investments toward these two businesses. This month, in order to align the size of these two partnerships with NRG\u2019s strategic priorities, we have reached an agreement with NRG Yield to shift the amount of capital between Home Solar and the business renewables partnership. As a result, the Home Solar partnership was reduced by $50 million to $100 million with a corresponding $50 million increase to the business renewables partnership, reflecting the more robust and reliable pipeline of business renewables which has now been reintegrated within NRG. We expect to allocate approximately 75% of our 2016 NRG level capital or over $1 billion towards further debt reduction in 2016. This consists of ongoing term loan amortization as well as over $150 million in NRG corporate debt already retired, year-to-date. We plan to supplement this deleveraging in two ways. First, we will allocate $600 million of capital towards NRG debt retirement through open market purchases or tenders. And second, being mindful of our next NRG bond maturity in 2018, which is now approximately $1 billion in principal outstanding and the backdrop of the current dislocation in high yield market, we will reserve an additional $325 million toward the retirement of our 2018 notes in connection with the coincident refinancing of the balance when market conditions are more favorable. While our current priority is to ensure an efficient retirement and refinancing of our 2018 notes, as conditions evolve, we will continue to evaluate the best use of this debt reduction capital and may choose to allocate it toward different maturities, should this alternative prove more favorable. In any event, we expect this capital to ultimately be allocated toward corporate debt reduction, in order to meaningfully advance our efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet and ensure adherence to our target balance sheet metrics, even through an extended low cycle and commodity prices. As Mauricio indicated earlier, we have now adjusted our dividend rate to a level consistent with both our capital allocation priorities and a cyclical and capital intensive nature of our business. And while the current depressed level of our share price undoubtedly represents the compelling return opportunity, we believe it is prudent to continue our progress in right-sizing corporate debt and strengthening ratios, which will enable us the flexibility to capitalize on value enhancing opportunities for shareholders. Such opportunities are only made truly compelling by first ensuring the strength of the balance sheet, which supports this. For 2016, we expect just over $300 million of growth investments, consisting primarily of our P.H. Robinson peaker project, Carbon 360 and our commitment pursuant to the California EVgo settlement. During 2016, we are also focused on executing on opportunities to further expand capital available for allocation, including $250 million of non-recourse financing included as part of our reset announcement last year. As I indicated on our third quarter call, we are now fully prepared to launch this financing when market conditions are more favorable. In addition, we continue to expect the next utility-scale dropdown offer to NRG Yield to be our remaining stake in CVSR and plan to offer this yield in 2016. We are currently exploring this yield the best mean to efficiently finance this dropdown towards this yield and prudently managing its liquidity while continuing to replenish capital to NRG. I expect we\u2019ll have more to share with you on the timing and the payment structure later this year. And finally, tuning to slide 18, in light of our significantly deleveraging progress and having provided an extended look at our 2016 capital allocation plan, I would like to update the information we provided last quarter regarding NRG capital structure and 2016 corporate credit metrics. Focusing on recourse debt at the NRG level, which prior to deleveraging, we had expected to be approximately $8.8 billion as of year-end 2016, on our third quarter call, we indicated our intention to reduce that debt by at least $500 million. Having completed half of this objective during the fourth quarter alone, we ended 2015 with just over $8.5 billion in recourse debt. Since then and through February, we completed an additional $171 million in debt reduction, as shown on the far right column of the slide. And as a result, based on the midpoint of our guidance and our implied 2016 corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio is already nearly in line with our four and a quarter target. However, our goal is to maintain adherence to that target in 2017 and beyond, taking into account the possibility of sustained low commodity prices. This objective drives our continued focus on further debt reduction over the course of 2016. As I indicated previously in reviewing 2016 capital allocation, we expect to further reduce corporate debt by at least another $600 million this year. Taking that additional deleveraging into account, we are on track to drive corporate debt below $8 billion by the end of the year, which would place our corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio at approximately four times. And finally, factoring on and the effective releasing the $325 million of additional capital, we have currently reserved for further reducing our 2018 maturity. That 2016 ratio would be reduced to 3.8 times. One way to consider that number is that it allows us to maintain adherence to our four and a quarter target ratio, even if corporate EBITDA were to be reduced by approximately $200 million, as a result of sustained low commodity prices. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kirk. And we have taken a lot of time this morning. So, let me just end with our priorities for 2016 on slide 20. We have the right portfolio and the right platform to succeed in this environment. And with the further strengthening of our balance sheet, we will be in a great position to seize opportunities during this challenging market and greatly benefit to when it turns around. I look forward to the next phase of NRG. Thank you. And operator, let\u2019s open the lines now for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. You may begin. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning, guys, a few questions. I\u2019ll start with the detailed one. So, I just want to be clear on page 10, when you talk about the $150 million of EBITDA by year-end \u201817. Should we assume that that\u2019s an aspiration to improve your run rate EBITDA by that amount? Mauricio Gutierrez : Correct. Greg Gordon : Or is that just accumulative impact on EBITDA of 150? Mauricio Gutierrez : No. Good morning, Greg. And no, the objective here is to make it a recurring $150 million cost reduction that will impact EBITDA directly. Greg Gordon : Great, thanks. And on page 17, when you talk about the CVSR and non-recourse fainting below the lines; if those are not included in your available capital, so should you be successful in achieving those that would be accretive? Kirk Andrews : That\u2019s correct. Those would be incremental to capital available for allocation, Greg. Greg Gordon : Okay. And that would be my big picture question, Mauricio. So sort of the first thing that happened after you took over the CEO role was we saw that in terms of a capital allocation decision as we saw that you cleared a new power plant in the New England auction, which was a little bit disconcerting to investors who are looking for a capital allocation program that was more focused on shrinking the balance sheet. Obviously that\u2019s the core message that you\u2019re giving us today. So, can you characterize, if you were to disbursement [ph] free up this incremental dropdown money on non-recourse financing, how do you think about each incremental dollar for capital allocation going forward and how do you characterize what you\u2019re doing in New England in the context of the message you are giving us today? Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Greg. And I understand that that was the first news. And the timing with the New England capacity auction is something that I don\u2019t control. Let me just start by providing you kind of the general -- my general take on capital allocation and then I\u2019ll go into the specifics of Canal. As you can see from all the actions that we\u2019re taking today, one of my key priorities, the first 90 days of being the CEO, was to focus on capital allocation, first being mindful and aware of the current commodity cycle that we are today and then second the dislocation that we have in our capital markets. It was important to me to afford us the maximum flexibility when deploying capital and to exert absolute financial discipline. I already talked about the actions that we\u2019re taking, one on deleveraging and strengthening our balance sheet, and ensuring that we go through this cycle with the strong position to capitalize on opportunities, but importantly that we\u2019re ready when the market turns around; two, the recalibration of the dividend; and then three, is the focus on cost savings and streamlining the cost structure on the organization. So, when I think about to Canal, it is not a capital allocation decision for 2016, it\u2019s a capital allocation decision that we will make in 2018 and at that point, we will evaluate the current environment. And on that perspective then, we\u2019ll make the determination what is the best use of our capital. But I want to make sure that we continue to generating low cost options at good returns, given the opportunity that we have to lock for seven years a very constructive capacity prices. And as I told you in the prepared remarks, in our focus in the Northeast and particularly in New England is focus on capacity revenues. And now is a dual fuel peaker that is needed in that market at good returns and it\u2019s a capital allocation decision that we will make not today, where we are focusing all our attention on strengthening the balance sheet but in two years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. You may begin. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning. Congratulations Mauricio and Kevin. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Julien. Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, perhaps first the follow-up on Greg\u2019s last question on capital allocation. Can you elaborate on your latest thinking on the wholesale portfolio itself? Obviously it\u2019s been under a good bit of strain, [ph] how do you think about reinvesting in your exiting asset portfolio and timing for rationalization, as you continue to see current -- before it manifest itself? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Julien. So first of all, I -- we are actually in the last year of what I consider a high water mark with respect to reinvesting in our portfolio. After acquiring GenOn and EME, we increased our portfolio significantly to close to 50,000 megawatts. We went through a process where we optimized that portfolio through fuel conversions and environmental retrofit. So, as you know, we have been executing that plan and this year is the last year of that. What I expect in the next couple of years is really to harvest on that investment. All the market dynamics that we were expecting when we made those investments are playing out, particularly around reliability and capacity for all three Northeast markets, whether it\u2019s PJM for capacity performance New England and New York. We are moving forward that; we saw that during the polar vortex, we acted upon. And it\u2019s playing out the way we thought it was going to play out. Now, with respect to other parts of the country, you know that I will expect absolute financial discipline when it comes to the profitability of our assets. If it\u2019s not economically viable, we will shut them down, just like we have done in the past and just like we are doing today, in New York. If the market conditions don\u2019t support our generation portfolio, we will take action on it. But we need to also take into consideration, not only the current state of the commodity cycle but also the prospective opportunities that we see. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then coming back to what you were just talking about, the expansion was done on the EME. How do you think auction that\u2019s on here? I mean, obviously it\u2019s a dynamic situation but you paid down some debt there and cash on hand. What you think about next step and the timing of that? Mauricio Gutierrez : Right. Look, I mean Julien, most of the -- bulk of the GenOn portfolios and PJM, we value significantly our strategic in the Northeast in particular in the PJM area. But what I\u2019ll tell you is in the spirit of streamlining our organization that applies to streamlining our capital structure, I would like to see that. But, we will only do it if it is add value and not having a negative impact on our credit profile. And that\u2019s the option that we are going to continue to maintain going forward. Kirk, do you have any additional comments? Kirk Andrews : Sure. I mean first of all, I agree with that obviously, we have taken an important step obviously towards deleveraging, as you acknowledged, Julien. But as I have indicated in my past remarks, at various conferences and one-on-ones, that order of magnitude is certainly helpful and necessary but sufficient in order to bring about rightsizing that balance sheet. I\u2019ll remind folks, certainly we have got some near-term maturity with GenOn, we are focused on that as part and parcel of why we went at the delevering that we did. And as you saw in GenOn -- in Mauricio\u2019s remarks, rather we have continuation of our asset sale program, which as we have indicated previously going back to the reset as focused on the Northeast. So, we\u2019d expect it\u2019s likely, more likely that that would probably come out of the GenOn complex which would enhance liquidity. But as the year progresses, certainly I would believe 2016 as the key inflection point, given those loan maturities. And we are mindful of the options obviously, continuing to delever through the open market purchase, as we have done before. We are recognizing -- we recognize that we have got some secured debt capacity there that provides us some alternative as well. So, what I would tell you is that as the year unfolds, I would expect you to hear more from us in terms of what we plan on executing there. And we are hopeful in terms of addressing and rightsizing the capital structure but -- and by reiterating what Mauricio said, we are only going to do that being mindful of preserving the integrity of the NRG balance sheet and the process. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Jonathan Arnold : One quick one, Mauricio, I think when you talked about the dividend, you talked about a static dividend being inappropriate in the context of the reduction. But, could you just clarify what we should be expecting going forward from this lower level, is it just to stay here as a token to allow yield investors to own the stock, or do you look to grow it modestly over time? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. No, Jonathan, I mean first of all, the actions that we are taking on the dividend are -- I guess there are two main reasons. One, I think this level is consistent with the nature of power industry, capital intensive and cyclical. But certainly, when I look at the current dividend that we have and the underlying premises or principles that we used to implement it in 2012, a lot of them are not valid anymore. If you recall, when we announced the dividend back then, it was to highlight the value of contracted assets. Since then, we created NRG Yield; we already talk about -- one of the objectives was the yield support. And in this current market environment and with the level of volatility that we\u2019re seeing in the stocks, it really doesn\u2019t accomplish that objective. So, when I put the two together, one the nature of our industry and two, some of the principles that we had when we initiated, it\u2019s just inconsistent. I think what you should expect is this number is the right number today and it afford us the maximum flexibility for capital deployment and capital allocation. And that is my assessment right now on the dividend. Jonathan Arnold : Okay, makes sense. And just another topic, you\u2019ve obviously been streamlining management structures out of the cost reductions et cetera. Can you just maybe give us a little more insight into what some of the key changes have been; where you are in that process; are they largely behind now, just some of the operational changes that may have gone on? Mauricio Gutierrez : Look, I mean, I think with respect to the streamlining the organization, we started the end of last year. We went through significant efforts to reduce the cost structure. And over the past three months, I have continued with that effort on rationalizing and focusing the organization into our core strengths and as I articulated already in my remarks, focusing on what I think is the core value of energy, which is putting together generation and retail and the plus points around it. So, I am very comfortable today with the management team that I have. This is an area that I am going to continue evaluating in the weeks to come. And I think you should expect from me additional announcements, as I go to even further in line of our businesses, particularly as we go through the outcome of the GreenCo process. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Two questions, one capital structure related. Just curious, you\u2019ve announced a lot of debt reduction at the NRG level for 2016. Curious what your thoughts are about the debt reduction targets at the GenOn level in 2016. The only reason I ask that is you highlight the NRG debt maturity coming in 2018, but obviously GenOn has some too, and that some of the growth for NRG, meaning the Canal expansion that just cleared or even the Mandalay repowering that has a contract, those are actually assets owned within the GenOn box. So just curious about kind of the balance between debt reduction at GenOn and some of those growth projects of assets that are at the GenOn box that are actually part of NRG, Inc.\u2019 growth trajectory? Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Michael. And let me just handle it to Kirk to answer the first part of the GenOn question, and I\u2019ll take the next. Kirk Andrews : Sure. Thanks Mauricio. Michael, first of all on the Cana, which as I said in addressing Julien\u2019s question, we\u2019ve obviously begun to make progress in terms of delevering that\u2019s been our confidence in doing that, we\u2019re mindful of balancing, maintaining adequate liquidity at GenOn with the need to obviously attack the capital structure at the same time, which is why the asset sale process obviously kick started that. We got a head start on it at the end of the year having announced a couple of asset sales and we\u2019re moving forward obviously to close the second of those two and continuing to focus on completing the remaining 500 or the remainder of the 500 that we announced on the reset, which as I indicated Julien, given the fact that we\u2019re very clear about the fact that we expect those still be in the Northeast, the expectation, the knock-on expectation certainly is that that would continue to be at the GenOn level. So, we use the proceeds of those asset sales to continue to deploy towards deleveraging. And as we move through year, we\u2019re mindful of that 2017 maturity, which is why supplemented by those asset sales, as I indicated also to Julien\u2019s question, we\u2019re focused on the best means apprehensively to use the options that are disposable, not only asset sales, but obviously we\u2019ve got some secured debt capacity there that we\u2019re remindful of. So, all I can tell you as we progress through the year, we\u2019re going to focus on those alternatives and the best means possible, as I said though, always being mindful of preserving the integrity of the balance sheet of NRG given the non-recourse nature of the GenOn subsidiary, which will continue to be the case. Michael Lapides : Got it. Mauricio Gutierrez : Michael, with respect to your second part of the question, what I will say is that we\u2019re going to continue developing options to grow the portfolio. When we have long-term contracts, we\u2019re going to do it in close partnership with NRG Yield to continue replenishing capital; when it doesn\u2019t have the profile to be able to be dropdown, that\u2019s not a capital decision -- capital allocation decision that we need to make today. And we\u2019re going to evaluate it when we have to actually deploy that capital. But I think it is important to continue to generate these projects in the context of growing our portfolio at good economics. Michael Lapides : Got it. And one follow on Texas related, just curious our view is that coal plants in Texas are struggling to have cash break even right now. And even more importantly nuclear plants are generating limited cash flow, maybe positive but limited. At what point do you start considering coal retirement at ERCOT? Mauricio Gutierrez : That\u2019s a great question, Michael. And so, let me give you my perspective on it. The current market in Taxes has been very disappointed, despite what I consider is still pretty strong fundamentals, strong demand and a pricing that doesn\u2019t incentivize new build economics, even though we have seen something, what I can say that out of not economical engine. When I look at our portfolio, particularly Parish and Limestone for and STP, they are very large in scale; they are environmentally controlled; and I would say that they are probably one of the most cost advantage based load plants or coal and nuclear plants in the state. We have identified what we believe is the least competitive assets in the supply stack when it comes to coal. And we believe that if the market continues to be at these levels, it will not be possible to sustain the operation of some of these assets. So that\u2019s why I think there is going to be a supply rationalization in the immediate term and we should see a recalibration of the market. I feel comfortable right now with the three of our base load plants. But I think we have a pretty good track record in terms of if and when these plants are not economic and the prospects of these plants are not positive, we will act upon. And we have done that in other regions and there is no reason why we\u2019d do it in Texas. But right now still not the time and I think the supply stack will react before we get to that point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may begin. Steve Fleishman : The $513 million of available capital at year-end that you are using in 2016, is that above kind of your normal cash levels? And if so, what cash do you have kind of available beyond that? Mauricio Gutierrez : It is -- Steve -- and I\u2019ll let Kirk give you specific details, but this is above the cash reserve that we have for both NRG and GenOn. Kirk Andrews : Sure. And this was -- good morning, Steve. This is one of the reasons why -- I think in a couple of points in my prepared remarks I made specific reference to contextualize capital available for allocation, which we consider to be a cash surplus versus cash on the balance sheet. And so, when we calculate that, we start with the minimum cash balance that we reserve at the NRG level. So, we set aside $700 million for liquidity. Now that -- part of that liquidity is what we need for cash collateral proceeds for example. So, as we post cash collateral, we consider that a utilization of the minimum cash reserve. So, whatever we deduct at any given time, think it about as $700 million in minimum cash minus the amount of cash collateral we posted. Comprehensively, and this is outside of capital available for allocation, we focus on liquidity separately. So, liquidity is that $700 million of minimum cash at the NRG level plus the $2.5 billion corporate credit facility. That\u2019s separate in a part from what we consider excess capital, which is with that $513 million that you refer to represents. Does that help? Steve Fleishman : Yes, I think so. One other question, just on NRG Yield. Mauricio, as you thought about NRG yield, what is your view of kind of a long term strategy around it? And if it stays at a relatively depressed stock price, what are your options? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Steve. Well, I mean I\u2019ll answer it from the NRG standpoint, and we are going to have the NRG Yield call in about 30 minutes. So, let me just say that the relationship between NRG and NRG Yield is there is a lot of synergies and it\u2019s a symbiotic relationship. It\u2019s of great importance for NRG. This is a way for us to access low cost of capital to replenish our capital, particularly on the development front in this type of commodity cycle. We need to have a good development platform for NRG Yield to have clear line of sight in terms of the growth and the potential dropdown that we have. That will benefit energy yield and a healthy NRG Yield is good for NRG in terms of our ability to stay competitive in developing new sites. So, that\u2019s kind of my take on it. And I want to be very careful that I give you the answer from kind of the NRG perspective. And we can go into more detail when we go through the NRG Yield call. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more caller. Our last question is from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering. You may begin. Neel Mitra : Hi, good morning. I just had a follow-up question on the ERCOT coal power plant. Are there any opportunities to renegotiate the transport agreements or lower your PRB coal costs, so that those plants are more cost advantage at this point? Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Neel. And I will discipline myself to pass the mic to Chris Moser, who is the Head of Commercial Operations. Although under my watch, COO, I renegotiated a number of rail contracts. They have been good partners in this downturn of -- this commodity cycle downturn. But Chris, what are your thoughts on that? Chris Moser : No, I think that\u2019s fair. I think we continue to work with our coal supply partners, both the mines -- the coal miners and the railroad company as well to make sure that we add to the plants competitiveness, to the extent that we can. They, as Mauricio just alluded to, have been good partners with us so far and we continue to look forward to working them with them in the future. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you. And I recognize that you may have a lot more questions. We will get to them, and Kevin and the IR team will be available for any follow-ups. But unfortunately, we have a hard stop; we have to get NRG Yield call ongoing. So, thank you. And I look forward to continue this conversation. Thank you, operator. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

And now with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you, everyone for joining our call today. Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. We're off to a really good start for the year. Our financial performance was strong for the first quarter allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. We're making significant progress in our priorities of reducing costs, replenishing capital, and deleveraging the business. And importantly, we're bringing certain people our platform with the conclusion of the GreenCo process. So let me start with our first quarter results. NRG delivered $812 million of adjusted EBITDA under very challenging marketing conditions. We remained focused on our day-to-day operations, achieving top quartile safety performance, good availability across our generation fleet, and stable results from our retail business. All of these, combined with our opportunity hedging program, mitigated the impact of the very weak wholesale prices that we experienced during the quarter. These results illustrate the strength of our platform and the unique value proposition that NRG offers. We are making good progress in our commitment to deleveraging the business. We retired $229 million of NRG debt or approximately 30% of our 2016 targets. Not only are we on track with our original plans, we have expanded the total capital available for deleveraging to $1.3 billion after adding $253 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization financing, which Kirk will provide additional details on during his remarks. Finally, this quarter, we're taking another important step forward in simplifying our business as we concluded, after much consideration, the GreenCo process. With the reintegration of business renewables last quarter and now the resolution for our Home Solar and EVgo businesses, which I will cover in more detail in a few slides, we have turned the page on this period of uncertainty and now are focused on executing our plan. On our last call I spent some time talking about the merits of diversification as a necessary condition to succeed in the future of the competitive power industry. Today I want to expand on the multiple levers that NRG has to deliver value to our shareholders. Now turning to slide 5, I have outlined the three key macro levers that describe the earnings potential of our business. Over the years we have successfully repositioned the company away from solely relying on energy margins to other more stable and predictable sources of revenue. So let me start with the first lever, which now represents two-thirds of our economic gross margin. This comes from parts of our business that are either not directly correlated to or that are countercyclical to the price of natural gas including our retail business, contracted generation and capacity payments. This lever of our business provides a stable base of predictable and visible earnings potential, a quality that differentiates us from many others in our industry, and we do it at significant scale across all three areas. Keep in mind this base is also growing given market trends in renewables and contracted generation where our relationship with NRG Yield will continue to be a competitive advantage in the future. Now let's talk about the second and third levers that comprise the other one-third of our economic gross margin which is directly tied to the price of gas and power. These portions' relative share has declined over the years given the prolonged weak commodity price environment. But we have deliberately maintained offset through fuel diversity, as I believe the current gas pricing environment is unsustainable in the medium to long run, and we want to be there with scale when the market recovers. The second lever is what I refer to as the fuel spread. This is the traditional way we have made money selling coal, oil and uranium at gas prices. It is effectively a synthetic long gas position. For those of you who invest in the E&P sector, we are long roughly about three Bcf a day of gas, so for every $0.50 move in gas prices, our portfolio has the potential to flex up by $500 million in additional gross margin. Let me be clear. We're not gas agnostic and don't want to be gas agnostic, as we believe current prices are not sustainable. The third lever is our power spread or heat rate exposure. As power markets tighten due to retirements or low growth, we maintain significant offset to increasing power prices, as we have the largest competitive power portfolio in the country with close to 50,000 megawatts of generation with both geographic and merit order diversification. So when people ask me why I'm convinced we have the right platform to be the leader in the competitive power space today and into the future, this is why. Success in this industry is all about diversification of the business and core operational excellence. Our platform is designed to deliver results even in a difficult market, and given how unpredictable the markets can be having stability in our core platform is critical. At the same time, our leverage to any market recovery should be embraced not ignored because it is quite substantial. And when you couple these dynamics with our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet and streamlining our costs, I have no doubt that NRG is built to thrive under a variety of market conditions. So moving onto the next slide I want to touch briefly on key developments across our markets. We are encouraged by recent actions from regulators in support of competitive markets. We are pleased that FERC has stepped in to effectively stop the out-of-market PPAs for AEP and FirstEnergy in Ohio. It is also encouraging that the U.S. Supreme Court decided to invalidate Maryland contract created for the sole purpose of suppressing capacity prices. In PJM, the transition to the capacity performance product has brought higher capacity payments in exchange for higher performance commitments as we have pivoted our suite accordingly. Our program of transforming coal plants to gas was undertaken with an eye towards becoming a provider of reliability. In Texas, we're optimistic in ERCOT as we see up to 9 gigawatts of coal generation at risk due to upcoming environmental regulations and continued strong growth. In addition, we expect market changes to ORDC with the purpose of increasing prices to better reflect scarcity conditions. And in the West, while the Aliso Canyon issue will present reliability challenges for the California ISO over the next year, we do not expect this issue to have significant impact to our generation portfolio since most of our revenue in California is supported by PPAs and RA contracts. Also our newest merchant plant, Sunrise, is supplied off the Kern River pipeline and thereof not impacted. We hope this becomes a catalyst to address gas power for the nation and fuel cost recovery issues that are much needed in California. Turning to slide 7, let me now discuss the details around the conclusion of the GreenCo process that we started in September of last year. Last quarter, I explained that there were three objectives we sought to accomplish in this process, maintain our capability to take advantage of renewable trends at appropriate investment returns, incorporate all of our businesses into our financial results, and to minimize the use of the $125 million revolver. Today I'm here to tell you we have met our objectives and have concluded the process. To do a quick recap, beginning last quarter we reintegrated business renewables, which allows us to maintain a strong position in the renewables market. This business is now fully integrated, and I will be updating you on its progress in the months to come. Moving to residential solar, we undertook a comprehensive strategic review process over the past six months to determine the best course of action to realize value, minimize capital needs and, like business renewables, ensure we do not lose the ability to meet renewable energy demands across all types of customers. While our original goal was to secure permanent capital and deconsolidate the enterprise, we were not able to move forward in this direction in a way that met all our objectives. Today we're announcing a change in our approach to residential solar that will allow us to meet them. First, we're both streamlining and simplifying the organization by significantly lowering the cost structure and focusing in markets where we have a competitive advantage. Residential solar will become a product in our retail offering, and we intend to fully integrate into our retail business by 2017. Second, we are changing our business model to focus on origination, installation, and direct third-party sales which will allow us to simplify financial reporting by providing immediate revenue recognition. I am pleased to announce new partnerships with both Sunrun and Spruce Financial which will allow us to execute on this plan. Our approach comes with significant changes in our overall organization, cost structure, and business model. This model allows us to maintain our 2016 financial guidance as we transition the business throughout the remainder of 2016 to be at least an EBITDA breakeven business by 2017. While this is not a business you can expect to hear about each quarter, our strategy for this business is important to our organization, allowing us to maintain a viable yet right-sized structure so that when the ERCOT market economics are viable we can offer residential solar to our existing 3 million customers. We have also concluded the strategic review process for our electric vehicle charging network or EVgo. I am announcing today the sale of a majority stake of this business to Vision Ridge Partners. NRG will receive total consideration of approximately $50 million with $19.5 million upfront available to NRG and $30 million remaining in the EVgo platform. In addition, NRG have some earn-out potential of up to $70 million through 2022. Under this structure NRG will have \u2013 will not have any ongoing capital commitments to EVgo other than its obligations under the California settlement. With the closing of this transaction, EVgo results will no longer be consolidated into NRG financial statements. With the conclusion of the GreenCo process, the $125 million revolver is no longer necessary and will be eliminated as we move forward and execute on our new plans. On slide 8 I want to provide you an update on the great progress we have made in streamlining our cost structure. We are on track to realize $250 million in recurring cost savings in overhead and O&M, and we have made significant progress in our new FORNRG program targets. This means that over the next two years we will have taken an impressive $400 million in total costs out of the system. Additionally, you will be able to track these costs in our disclosures to see our progress as we move through the subsequent quarters. While I am very pleased with our efforts to date, I expect that we will be able to find even more opportunities to reduce our cost structure as we continue with our remaining asset sales, the integration of the residential solar business, and our push to find even more opportunities to streamline the organization. So with that, I will turn it to Kirk for the financial review. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on slide 10, NRG delivered $812 million in adjusted EBITDA and $249 million in free cash flow before growth in the first quarter of 2016. Having now concluded the GreenCo process, our financial results in our guidance now include both EVgo and the newly restructured residential solar within our corporate segment, which is part of the generation and renewable subset of our consolidated guidance. With all businesses now included, we are reaffirming our 2016 full-year guidance for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. During the quarter, we continued our deleveraging program and have now retired a total of $229 million of NRG corporate debt year-to-date through May 4, leading to an additional annualized cash interest savings of $16 million. Finally, to update our progress in achieving our target of $1 billion in incremental consolidated available capital, which was announced on September 18th of last year, NRG has now completed a non-recourse monetization of future PJM capacity revenues from our Midwest Generation fleet for cash proceeds of $253 million. This transaction, which will be accounted for as a non-recourse debt financing with no impact on adjusted EBITDA, represents the final component of our plan to free up $1 billion of 2016 capital, leaving only the balance of our $500 million asset sale target. And we expect to complete this over the balance of this year. Turning to slide 11, the Midwest Gen non-recourse capacity monetization proceeds of $253 million, increases our 2016 capital available for allocation by $210 million versus our prior expectation, as we reviewed during our year-end earnings call. The remaining $43 million in financing proceeds represents the acceleration of capacity revenues within 2016, which were already included in the NRG level of free cash flow before growth guidance midpoint, which was part of the $1.488 billion in 2016 capital available as shown in our year-end earnings materials. Including the Midwest Gen proceeds, total 2016 capital available for allocation now stands at approximately $1.7 billion at the NRG level. We expect to allocate this incremental capital to further advance our deleveraging efforts or alternatively to repay our convertible preferred stock, which based on the conversion price relative to our current share price, presents a compelling potential opportunity. The dropdown of NRG's remaining stake in CVSR to NRG Yield continues to represent an additional opportunity to further supplement NRG level capital available, and we intend to offer this remaining stake to NRG Yield during the quarter. Finally, liquidity stands at $1.9 billion as of March 31, which includes $589 million of cash at the NRG level, which has since been supplemented with the proceeds from the Midwest Gen capacity monetization, which closed just following the quarter end. Finally, turning briefly to slide 12, our continued progress on deleveraging keeps us on track to bring our 2016 corporate debt-to-corporate EBITDA ratio below our target as we position NRG's balance sheet to maintain adherence to our 4.25 times target ratio even through a continued low commodity price cycle. And we will continue to update this analysis as our debt reduction program progresses. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Kirk. And in closing, I wanted to remind everyone of our priorities in slide 14. This is the scorecard that I will share with you throughout the rest of the year. As you can see we have made considerable progress in just the first few months of the year. Addressing the general debt is among one of our highest priorities given both the overall debt levels and maturities in 2017 and 2018. We're actively evaluating alternatives to optimize the capital structure with a focus on maximizing value for all stakeholders. With this objective in mind, we expect to be engaging in discussions with general creditors as a part of this process in the near term. As we evaluate alternatives, we remain committed to our prudent balance sheet management principles including maintaining our target corporate credit metrics. We remain focused on executing our current strategy. And with the reintegration of renewables, we're now in a position to reinvigorate the development pipeline and provide certainty to NRG Yield's growth potential. I believe we now have all the pieces to move forward and demonstrate the value of our integrated platform. So with that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, good morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to just delve into the relationship with Sunrun and Spruce that you mentioned. Could you just walk through the roles of NRG and then your two partners just so I can understand better the nature of that relationship, what each party brings to the table, and what this business looks like for you going forward? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure Steve. I mean, I think the best way to think about it is we're going to be focused in the area that we believe we have a competitive advantage. That is in selling the system and installing the system. Once we do that, we have an agreement with Spruce and Sunrun to monetize these systems, to monetize these leases into their platform. So I mean it is a different way of \u2013 the way we have done it in the past. If you recall, we were \u2013 before we would drop it into Yield, but we would be \u2013 it would be consolidated NRG as a whole. Now basically the entire lease goes to our partners. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. So the assets won't go to NYLD, but \u2013 and your partners will monetize it. So would you receive effectively an upfront fee for the value you're creating by acquiring a customer or would there be an ongoing cash flow to you? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Steve, it's Kirk. The way to think about this is the cost of the system, which is normally in the traditional construct you think about the CapEx necessary to put a given system in place. The way to think about that in this construct is that is basically cost of goods sold. And the revenue is the price that Sunrun and Spruce pay us for that particular system. So rather than you \u2013 than seeing proceeds come in in terms of a return of capital and CapEx go out in advance of that, that is now going to be revenue, which is what we will receive for lock, stock and barrel the entirety of system to Sunrun or Spruce. And then they'll also retain the ongoing obligation to manage and operate the system O&M and the like. And our \u2013 and what was formally our capital expenditures would be COGS. So think about it. We are migrating to a gross margin model rather than a gain on sale model, if you want to think about it that way. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Yeah. That's very clear. So Kirk, then every quarter as you get new customers and you sell those assets to Sunrun and Spruce and then that's revenue in terms of the proceeds you receive from them every quarter your operating costs, which used to be CapEx are truly COGS. That's clear. Okay. And then I just wanted to shift over to, Mauricio, what you had said on GenOn at the end. I know we don't know \u2013 we can't predict what the outcome will be of those discussions, but is it a clear priority that if there were to be an outcome that that outcome needs effectively to be consistent with your overall credit metrics of NRG as a whole? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely, Stephen, and I've said that before. And I want to make sure that I'm clear. I mean, we have to maintain the credit metric targets that we have at NRG in \u2013 and adhere to that principle in any of the options that we are going to be evaluating. As I said, I would like to simplify the message in the spirit of that. We need to look at simplifying also the capital structure. We need to address GenOn for that reason and because of the near term maturities that we have, but we have to adhere to those prudent balance sheet management principles that we have. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you very much. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Stephen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Can you guys hear me okay? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, just fine. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Greg Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. So just to beat a dead horse a little bit on the resolution of the process, it sounds like you've created a reasonable way of sort of keeping an option while stopping the losses. But there's probably a lot of investors who are hoping that there would be a clean break here. So can you just talk about the process and the market (25:31) crossover in those assets and why the option, which frankly I think sounds like a good option, is the best thing that you could come up with? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. Greg, I mean, we actually went through a process that took a significant amount of time. During this time I think everybody knows that we knew that the conditions both in the capital markets and then through the beginning of the year were pretty challenging for both the residential solar business as a whole but also on the capital markets. So this was not the best time to be in the market. We knew that. That's why we were looking at selling a majority stake, not all of it, because we wanted to maintain the optionality on the Texas market where we think we have a significant asset in our customers to be able to offer them residential solar. I think when you couple that with this change in the business model where it's effectively we sell, install and flip to a third party, and importantly, refocusing the business where we actually have been successful in the past and reducing significantly the cost structure. We felt that that combination was the best path for maximizing value for this business. And I think we'll provide that over the next 12 months. We expect that business to be at least breakeven in 2017. I've always looked at residential solar as another product in our retail offering. It makes a whole lot of sense if we already have that relationship with the residential customer and this is one of the products that they are asking for it that we provide it. And if we can provide it in a way that is cost effective and that we can create value, we should have it in our lineup of product offerings. So I think the rationale is there. I think the appetite from customers for rooftop solar is there. We just needed to make pretty significant changes in the way we can structure the business model to ensure that it was, quite candidly, a profitable one. And I think that those are the steps that we have taken. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So first of all, you're focusing on New Jersey, Massachusetts, New York. Those are states where you have a presence. So that means you're going to stop spending gobs of money on advertising and feet on the street to try to break into markets where you don't have a presence. Should I presume this also means that you're merging the business line into the core business and getting rid of duplicative overhead, marketing staff and other things like that and just making it sort of part of the product offering of the overall business as opposed to a separate freestanding business, and those are sort of the ways that you're reducing the cost profile? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Exactly. I mean not only we are reducing all the costs by not being in states or regions where we don't have a core advantage, but making it part now of our retail business or in the process of making it to our retail business, we will have significant synergies. Particularly in the marketing and selling, if we now have already a relationship with a customer that is buying system power, we will be using those same vehicles to offer now rooftop solar and potentially decrease the cost of selling that we had on a standalone basis. So I mean, I think this way we create not only a lot of synergies by including in our retail business, but we also are being very disciplined in terms of the size and the scope of this business as we transition through this period, and importantly, maintain the option to, if this becomes viable in Texas, we can offer this to our 3 million customers because that to me is the prize. I mean, that is the goal. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. One more question and then I'll go to the back of the queue as well. You made the decision to bring some cash flow forward by monetizing these capacity payments. I mean, theoretically cash in hand today is better than cash in hand a year or two from now, especially if you're in a position to aggressively de-lever the balance sheet. But Kirk, can you talk about what you're foregoing in the future to get that cash today? How much financing costs are you incurring? And do you see that as working given the market opportunities to retire debt? And where is your debt currently trading? Is it still at big discounts or has it accrued? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. I'll try to cover all that, but if I miss a piece of your multi-part question you can remind me. But as to the Midwest Gen financing, to answer your question, is it worth it? Yes. As I think as we disclosed in the press release, certainly in the Q, a cost of just under 4.5%, and that is basically the way to think about the cost of financing. The way that it works mechanically is you're basically monetizing today the discount and the implied cost from an interest rate standpoint is that kind of 4.5 type cost. Relative to the opportunities certainly that we have and even relative to what the path that we were on exploring previously, which is the term loan B market, we see that as at an attractive cost, as you well put it, to bring cash forward today to take advantage of opportunities and obviously get ahead in our deleveraging progress. I mean, certainly we are focused on doing that, but we are cognizant of the fact that right-sizing the balance sheet is important today so that we can preserve flexibility for the company tomorrow. And this $250 million, net $210 million as I mentioned for 2016, is an important step in that direction for us. As far as our overall debt is concerned, our long-term notes are still trading at a much smaller discount. They've accreted largely closer to par even on the long-dated maturities, which certainly from the standpoint of opportunistically purchasing debt at a discount makes it more expensive, but as you well know, we are a serial issuer or a serial roller of debt from a refinancing opportunity standpoint. So that certainly I feel a lot more comfortable with what that means. In terms of the barometer and the confidence that the high yield market has and the quality of our credit, I think underpinned by what we're on the path to doing in driving those ratios down, and also giving us greater flexibility on the refinancing front. So in the total package, I like where we are today. I mean, I think we've probably have seen 350 basis points of rally on the long side just since our last earnings call. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, guys. I'll go to the back if I have more. Kevin L. Cole - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Your line is open. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. I actually have a question about your sensitivity to gas and heat rates. I think we've all struggled with trying to gauge what is the correlation between the heat rates and gas especially in Texas? And also how linear is this correlation with gas is especially for the GenOn portfolio, right? You're showing a movement of $0.50 in gas, and I'm basically trying to understand how you are showing that sensitivity because a $0.50 move in gas presumably has little effect at all on GenOn's assets. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Angie, I'm assuming that you're talking about the slide 5 where I put the sensitivities... Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...for the entire portfolio? Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me just \u2013 I mean, this is the entire portfolio, not just coal and nuclear, which have been our traditional disclosures. But I guess in the spirit of providing more visibility and clarity to the sensitivity on commodities, I included the gas and oil portfolio as well in this sensitivity chart. So the way to think about my remarks of moving the value of the portfolio by $0.50, $0.5 billion is on an open basis. And this is based on economic generation that we can see today at current markets. So as you can appreciate that economic generation, as commodity prices move, that will increase and your sensitivity to the same $0.50 move will be greater. This sensitivity basically reflects the economic generation that is exposed at current market. So I don't know if that at least provides some clarity in terms of what this number is. Now, in terms of the GenOn, I would say that it's pretty sensitive to increases in natural gas. I'm not sure I... Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Well, I understand, but I'm just trying to say a $0.50 increase in natural gas for GenOn doesn't necessarily mean that a number of those plants are now becoming economic, right? And yet a $1 increase in gas would make a number of GenOn assets economic. So I'm basically trying to see how to capture that sensitivity, right, which is clearly accelerating as gas prices rise. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. No. That's fair. The only thing that I would say is, as you recall in particular on the GenOn complex, but this is in general to both portfolios for GenOn and EME, we already went through a pretty comprehensive asset optimization process where we converted some of these coal plants that were very sensitive to energy prices to natural gas, in effect pivoting the revenue driver from energy margins to capacity margins. So I would say that some of that is already captured in the GenOn complex. I don't know if that was part of your comment that, perhaps, the GenOn complex is not as sensitized to natural gas because of those fuel conversions, but $0.50 makes some difference. I mean, it is not \u2013 you will be, I guess, adding economic generation as prices increase. But from current levels where we are, clearly, it's not as significant as it would be in a different market scenario. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And how about now the link between gas prices and heat rates? I'm particularly struggling how to call it in Texas. So you're showing the movement in gas by $0.50 and one heat rate. Can you tell us what's the correlation between these two in Texas and PJM or across the portfolio? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, I mean, I think for simplicity we have provided this as a linear sensitivity. So $0.50 move on gas, half a heat rate move on power, I mean, clearly, when gas prices increase, heat rates tend to be compressed because you want to keep (37:20) content. And the reverse happens when gas prices decrease. We have not provided that comprehensive correlation just \u2013 I guess, just for simplicity. Not that we don't have it, because that's the way we actually model our portfolio when we account internally for different changes in commodity prices. But for these type of disclosures we are trying to make it linear and something simple that people can just have a rule of thumb. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi, good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Mauricio, a couple clarifications. On the EME money forwarding, are you going to have to put money back into Edison Mission, Midwest Gen in 2018, 2019? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I am sorry, Steve. Are you saying environment \u2013 some sort of environmental CapEx or asset optimization? What... Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : No. I'm sorry. The forwarding of the hedge value, the capacity value, excuse me. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Not necessarily putting money in, but as I said before, it is literally a shift forward. So one of the points I wanted to make clear is because of the accounting convention behind how this particular capacity monetization is treated, it is treated as a financing which is why the EBITDA or capacity revenue component of our revenue line is unchanged. But the overall cash flow effect is we're getting those proceeds today. We'll have the capacity revenues tomorrow, but we will have an offset or principal and interest payments that is associated with the payments, if you will, to be third party. But there isn't an injection of cash per se. It's just that the capacity revenues serve to pay the financing cost principal and interest, at least directionally, or the way that is going to play out in the financials as we go forward, if that makes sense. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. But just then from a cash flow standpoint in 2018, 2019 I assume you lose that cash at... Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : ...EME. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The direct answer is yes. You're pulling the cash forward today which means it won't be there tomorrow. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Okay. And then just on the thinking on GenOn, so the support payments which I think are part of your NRG EBITDA, in the event that we go to the scenario where you do have to kind it let it go, can you cut cost significantly to kind of offset the loss to that revenue? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, Steve. I mean, I think the rule of thumb is that it's about 50% of the cost that we... Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It is a significant portion of that number overall. I mean, as you recall, you go back and look at our overall corporate G&A before GenOn and after GenOn, the costs associated with managing that overall portfolio and providing those services is a significant portion of that shared services payment as we move forward. So there is an offsetting reduction in cost if you, just for academic purposes, imagine that shared service payment away. It isn't an absolute. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is open. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Praful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. So Mauricio, you made the point on natural gas prices and the fact that you're long natural gas, which makes sense. Just wanted to understand how you look at retail when you talk about it because you mentioned retailer is countercyclical, which we all understand it is. So when you look at EBITDA sensitivities to natural gas prices, how do you fit in retail and the sensitivity of retail being countercyclical to that EBITDA sensitivity? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. I mean, we have said in the past that in a rising natural gas price environment which theoretically will also increase in power prices, our retail business will contract in their margin. But that will be more than offset on the pickup that we will get on the generation side. So when we think about that integrated platform, we have actually smoothed some of the peaks and valleys by putting it together, particularly in Texas, which is important because of the market construct. The energy-only type of market construct that is the way I described it is feast or famine. I mean, it is almost a digital market. It is prices are very low or prices are very high. So we feel very comfortable with our value proposition. And we feel very comfortable that if gas prices rise the impact or the negative impact that has in retail is more than offset by a significant multiple on the generation side. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. That's simple. But any order of magnitude impact on the retail versus the wholesale? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think we \u2013 I mean, we've provided a band of our retail business in the past, but I don't believe we have provided a sensitivity to a percentage move in natural gas or power prices. But I mean that is something that we could potentially look at in the future. And I'm making a note of that. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. That would be very helpful. And just quickly, secondly, I was looking at your hedge disclosure on slide 24. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And the Texas and South Central seems to have a weighted average hedge price that looked to have dropped for 2017 by about $5 a megawatt hour, and just wanted to ensure I understand what's driving that? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Look, I mean, what we did is we layered in additional hedges for 2017. I mean, if you look at the hedge percentages from the last quarter to this quarter, I think we increased by I want to say 25% to 30% our total hedge price. And I think that is the effect of just increasing our percentage hedge at some lower prices which reflect current market. And I mean we did it in the back of the recent rally that we have seen in the natural gas market. As I have said, I continue to be bullish in 2017, but we need to be prudent in terms of our hedge profile for a potential extension of this trough in the commodity cycle. But as we have been in the past we're very opportunistic, and we felt that with this recent move it was a good time to layer in additional hedges. Now, I think that pertains only to our coal and nuclear fleet. It does not have our gas portfolio reflected in this. Chris, do you have any additional comments? Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations : No. I think that's true. I think that's a factor of some of the heat rate moves we've seen on the expansion and how you calculate gas sales when you translate them into heat rate. Sometimes you get a bit of a funny move like that. As you can see the average equivalent natural gas price is decent right there at $3.52, so I think it's an artifact of some moving around on the heat rate side. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. Thank you, guys. I will get back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys, two questions for you and congrats on a good start to the year. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just looking at some of the detail you provide on the Texas market in your market outlook, I'm kind of at slide 21 and beyond. Just curious, the units you view at risk, what do you think the catalyst is? What you think the timeframe is for when the owners of some of those units have to start making decisions about when to retire? Is there a forcing function or could this kind of drag out longer than people expect? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, I mean, I will give you two cents on it before I pass it on to Chris, but clearly the current commodity or power price environment is already a pretty good catalyst for starting that conversation. And we announced at the beginning of this year that we were going to \u2013 our intentions to retire one of our units because of the absolute lack of scarcity pricing and the failure of ORDC to provide the right price signal in what we consider the tightest market in the country. So I would say that you have different catalysts right now brewing. The first one is this very low power price environment in Texas. The second one is the regional case regulations and then the one-hour SO2 requirements. So when you put those three together, I think this is what we tried to show in this slide, which units are exposed to either one, two or all three. And I think that will inform the decision of asset owners in terms of the economic viability of their units. But Chris, I mean, do you have... Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations : Well, yeah. I don't know that I have a lot to add to that. I mean, I think as you're sitting there and you're thinking, God, I have to put new scrubbers on Big Brown and Monticello. And then, oh, we still haven't seen exactly what the damage is from those in terms of we haven't yet seen the final one-hour SO2 impact. I think that combination has got to be daunting. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: What's the timeline? When do plants have to comply with both those? Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations : Well, regional haze is going to be later 2019, 2020 and the one-hour SO2 I don't have a good answer for you on because I think it's still being baked. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And when you think about nuclear plants in Texas, I mean, we're seeing retirements of nuclear plants in some of the markets that have capacity payments. Can you talk about whether South Texas project is generating free cash flow and whether you think nuclear plants are facing some of the same challenges in Texas that we're seeing elsewhere in the country? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, Michael. I mean, I think all the traditional baseload generation is facing some challenges at $2 gas prices. I think from our perspective, and we don't provide specific information on a plant by plant basis, but what I will tell you is in Texas we actually have a higher threshold than if we were a standalone generator. And the reason why is of our integrated model. So we actually achieve significant amount of synergies and value by pointing generation to retail. We avoid collateral charges. We avoid friction costs. So we have this higher threshold when it comes to evaluating the economic viability of the plant. But again, I don't think we can make a decision of retiring a plant based on one month or three months of very low commodity prices which, to be fair, we have very effectively mitigated with our hedging philosophy and strategy. What we need to do is we need to look at it in the context of all the dynamics in that market. What are the prospects for each of those plants, and what exactly is what that plant provides to the system that eventually will be captured in the prices? So that's I guess where I see that. What I will tell you is that we have an absolute commitment to operate plants that are economic. We have, I think, a pretty good track record in terms of retiring plants where the system doesn't need them in the past, for over the last 10 years. And even since the beginning of this year we have retired close to a gigawatt of generation in western New York and Texas because the market just doesn't support it and because we felt that the economic prospects in those particular markets were not going to support it. But I think investors should rest assured that we will make the right economic decision. But we need to make sure that we go beyond the next month and we look at the prospects going forward. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, Mauricio, much appreciated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi. Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So a couple of little questions, little details here on the resi solar piece, just going back to that, how many megawatts do you expect you will be able to monetize annually as far as a run rate? And then secondly on the EVgo piece can you comment real quickly, what's the California payout still due? I imagined \u2013 I think it says you retain that piece? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Julien, it's Kirk. I'll answer the EVgo piece of that. We've probably got over the next four years about \u2013 the good rule of thumb on the California settlement, think about that order of magnitude about $20 million a year over the next four years. It bumps around, but that's sort of a good averaging. And then we'd be completed in terms of our obligations in California under that settlement. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Julien, I mean, I think what you should be looking at on the home solar business is we're actually looking at the last six months of operation. We don't have any grand aspirations in terms of the total sales and installations that we want to have for the year. We're calibrating that to the historical levels. I feel very strongly that our plan needed to be a plan that it was achievable. I'm not going to provide you specific numbers, but what I will tell you is that I feel very comfortable hitting those targets. And I think with the agreements that we have with our partners we're going to be able to effectively implement this new business model. So I think that's what I'm comfortable disclosing to you, Julien, today. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Well, wait, sorry. Just to be clear you're comfortable hitting which target? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. What I'm comfortable is on the financial numbers that I provided. I don't want to go into specific systems that we're going to be deploying. What I said is that this business is going to be at least break even by 2017, and that in 2016 the negative EBITDA that I have disclosed is mostly coming from this first six months of operation while we were running this business. I mean, going forward I think that turns into a breakeven value proposition. But I don't want to provide right now specifics in terms of megawatts deployed or systems installed. I feel that the financial disclosures that we're providing will be sufficient going forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And just turning to the PJM auction coming up here, I've just got to ask. You put it 140 to 160 as analyst expectations, but what are your expectations? And then specifically within that what are you thinking about demand response, the RICE regulations, and new supply entry? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Chris, any comments on the BRA? Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations : Yeah. I mean, back on page 22 we discussed it a little bit. I mean, we've seen some pretty decent numbers out of capacity markets in general across the board there at $7 NE Pool (54:43). We like \u2013 obviously the last BRA in the 200s for areas where we have a lot of generation were fantastic results. And then the New York May spot market has been \u2013 was a great trend there in the face of a lowered load forecast. We see a lower load forecast for the CP auction as well. So it's probably down year-on-year. So that's why we threw the analyst expectations on. I'm not going to throw a number, our own internal number out there, but look, I think it's reasonable to think it's going to be down some or moderate a little bit from the numbers we saw last time just because of the changes in load forecast. And then you're right to point out, I think there are some pretty big wildcards out there in terms of, hey, what does FirstEnergy do? What does AEP do? And what kind of impact is the RICE NESHAP going to have on those? And those are a bit of wildcards out there that could swing that one. Well, I think that those swing it directionally upwards compared to where it otherwise would be if you start pulling out some of the DR based on auto DR. And then also if you look at FirstEnergy and AEP decide they're going to retire those units and don't want capacity obligations because they're concerned about whether or not this end run, this most recent end run they're trying around FERC works or not. I think there that 6,000 megawatts of stuff that's up in the air, which arguably could have a bullish piece on it. Will that be enough to offset the load change that they've had in the load forecast? That remains to be seen. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : But I don't hear you emphasizing new supply or a big swing in demand response, right? Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations : Sorry, Julien, say it again? Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : I don't hear you emphasizing a big move in new supply or demand response participation. Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations : Well, I think on the demand response side this is kind of the last hurrah for a base \u2013 for the base capacity product. So we'll see what happens on that side, but I \u2013 yeah. I don't think there's big swings either way on those two points. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question. Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Mauricio, you mentioned at one point that you are going to start looking for incremental savings. And just when we benchmark your SG&A against some of your peers, obviously, you are a bigger company, but it does seem still to be a much more scaled number than maybe others have. Can you give us some insight into what you see as the factors there and what sort of areas you might be looking at as you try to drive further cost savings? Is it a presentational issue? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right, Jonathan. No. I mean, what I said in the past is that I think it's not a fair comparison to put us against some of our generator peers because they don't have the scale of our retail platform and our retail business. So I mean, I think on our generation platform, I will put it vis-\u00e0-vis anybody in our space, but you need to take into consideration that we have a retail platform that I don't believe anybody else on our sector has. What we have done today and what I tried to articulate today is really to give you a comprehensive look at the entire cost structure that we have, one that you can actually reconcile with our financials and that you can hold us accountable going forward. We have identified and either executed or are in execution close to $400 million of cost reductions that I feel we all feel very comfortable that are very achievable. And we're making significant progress. I think there are more opportunities as we integrate some of the businesses, specifically residential solar into the platform, but I expect that we will be looking at other areas. We now have a comprehensive continuous improvement program that over the years have been very effective under FORNRG umbrella, and we are extending that, expanding that to the entire organization. So we are reinvigorating that initiative. It is now company-wide, and I expect that we will come with additional savings under that framework going forward, and as we start identifying them I will provide that additional detail. But I'm just excited about where we are in terms of our cost reduction program. We have made significant progress and I think we run a very \u2013 we're going to be running a very efficient organization here. That is my goal, and again, I mean I think when it comes to comparisons you need to make sure that you compare apples to apples. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No. That is fair, but do you think that this sort of next round you're alluding to is something in 2016 or is that more longer term? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I think it would be in 2016. I mean, we are in the process right now. I mean, I announced today the reintegration of residential solar. We have identified, as I said, significant cost savings. I think as it fully integrates with retail I am sure that there will be more. And we're looking across other areas in the organization. So I mean this is an area of focus and to be candid, I mean, it is a reflection and it has to be an \u2013 it is an imperative in this commodity cycle. So we are looking across not just overhead but also operations, O&M, and that is an area of focus as we're seeing changes in dispatch profiles and changes in terms of how our units get compensated specifically moving from energy-driven margins to capacity-driven margins. So I mean, everything is on the table. And I think, as I said, I mean, it is an imperative in this current commodity market environment. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And maybe I'd just make one quick one on if you do move into Texas with the home solar business, is it agreed that that will be with the same partners under the same model or is that TBD? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that's a TBD. Right now the partners were focused in the three Northeast markets. And I can't comment right now in Texas, but I think it's a TBD. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So the deal you have with Sunrun and Spruce is specific to the three markets we've talked about today then? Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think what I will say is that's where we're focusing right now, and our partners will support us on those three markets. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. All right. Well, thank you guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Brian Chin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks and good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, good morning, Brian. Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So just going back to the Midwest Gen capacity, I get that you're just swapping out for a lower cost of capital, but what I'm wondering is that $253 million, does that cover the entirety of the Midwest Gen capacity? Is there an ability to upsize that to a larger number Why or why wouldn't you potentially upsize that lower cost of capital financing? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Brian, it's Kirk. What I would tell you is, no, it doesn't include all of it. The order of magnitude is a little less than half. There may be an incremental opportunity to do so, but that number provides us the amount of capital we thought was prudent right now given the opportunities we see on the deleveraging front. But again, so it's a little less than half of the total amount of capacity, so think about maybe 1,500 megawatts a year through the 2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019 timeframe. Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And then could you conceivably expand that for any of your assets in PJM East or potentially in California under resource adequacy constructs? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I can't really comment too much on California. I think that's a little bit more complex, but the answer on the PJM East front is yes. Added complexity there is \u2013 obviously, a lot of those assets are in the GenOn complex, but it's certainly not impossible where that's concerned. And then I think going back to Midwest Gen, certainly that's an opportunity that we'd revisit post the completion of the next round of auctions there in PJM. Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Appreciate it. Thanks for squeezing me in. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No problem, Brian. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Now, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer. Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $779 million, a 14% increase when compared to the same period last year, thanks to a solid performance from the Generation business and a record second quarter result for Retail, which continues to benefit from lower wholesale prices, a proven ability to attract and retain customers, and outstanding execution. These are excellent results particularly in light of the low commodity prices that we continue to experience in our core markets. And it once again validates our integrated model and diversified approach to competitive power markets. Given the back-to-back strong quarterly results and the hedge position we have in place for the remainder of the year, we're not only reaffirming guidance, but we're tracking towards the upper end of our range. Traditionally, this quarter is a quiet one, our shorter season, since demand for electricity and respective wholesale prices are the lowest for the year, but for us, it was rather busy. In addition to ensuring our fleet was ready for summer operations, we made significant progress in executing on our debt management plan. We have retired $337 million of corporate level debt year-to-date, reduced our 2018 to 2020 maturity debt obligation by $5.8 billion, and bought back $345 million of our convertible preferred stock. Kirk will go into more detail in a few slides, but I want to take a moment to recognize him and the entire finance and legal organizations for superb execution and timing. The progress made today is an important step to ensure that our leverage ratios remain on target through varying commodity cycles. In delivering on our commitment to enhance capital flexibility, we have entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to drop down our 51% interest in CVSR with $180 million in total cash consideration, including financing proceeds and an EBIT to EBITDA multiple of over 14 times. This transaction reinforces the value of our partnership, allowing us to replenish capital efficiently while further expanding yields portfolio and (04:04), which benefits our nearly 50% economic interest on them. Proceeds from this transaction will be allocated towards deleveraging, specifically to supplement the reserves set aside for our 2018 bonds, expanding our total deleveraging target from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. This quarter, we also finalized the sale of Rockford and the Aurora plants for $425 million, bringing total cash consideration from asset sales to $563 million, which surpasses our initial target of $500 million. We have remained relentless in our pursuit of streamlining the organization and finding additional cost savings. We are on track to achieve our fornrg cost reduction target of $400 million through 2017 and to reduce our CapEx program by $650 million for 2017. This CapEx reduction follows the successful completion of fuel conversions at New Castle and Joliet and environmental upgrades at Avon Lake, with all three plants back on line and better positioned to take advantage of opportunities in their respective markets. Now turning to slide 4. I want to highlight the strong performance of our integrated platform during the second quarter. Safety is always top of mind. And while we remain a top quartile performer year-to-date, we can do and have done better. We are focused on and committed to improving our safety record for the balance of the year. The mild weather continued from the winter months into the start of the summer with temperatures that were milder than last year. Needless to say, this kept commodity prices through the end of June lower than last year. But once again, our business delivered results that were even stronger than last year. You have heard me say this before, but this is exactly what differentiates NRG from other IPPs. We have an integrated platform that can provide stability and deliver strong results even during periods of low prices while maintaining significant upside. And we continue to demonstrate this quarter after quarter. Our Generation business performed well, with improvements in reliability, availability and operating cost while realizing higher capacity revenues. We successfully completed multiple CapEx projects, bringing several units back on line for the summer. In fact, during the first month of operations, our fuel conversions benefited from low gas prices in PJM and are performing even better than expected. Our fleet was also well-positioned to maximize value in the recent 19/20 PJM capacity auction. Results were disappointing, given the reduction in loads and increase in newbuilds, except in ComEd where prices remain strong benefiting our Midwest Gen portfolio. Overall, we cleared about 80% of all our megawatts in PJM for total revenues of over $0.5 billion. While these market conditions were not ideal for the generation of business, the low wholesale prices benefited our complimentary Retail business. Beyond favorable supply cost this quarter, our Retail business continued its push for cost efficiencies, customer retention and product expansion. This is a business that continues a trajectory of growth and has proven to be very stable. I want to commend Elizabeth and the Retail team for their achievement this quarter and for continued success in growing this business. But while the Retail business on our pivot towards becoming a capacity player, an important part of the story, the NRG value proposition is even more robust than that. Turning to slide 5. I want to put some of the recent market trends in context of NRG's multiple leverage for value creation as I outlined on our last call. The first lever is our stable but growing base of price of the most predictable parts of our portfolio. Retail, which continues to demonstrate the stability of its earnings, capacity revenues that provides visibility multiple years into the future, and contracted assets through NRG Yield. This first lever has proven solid over time, and there is good reason to believe that our base will only grow and strengthen given current market trends. We are encouraged by the support for constructive capacity markets and strict performance standards but we're even more encouraged by the increasing need for contracted renewable and quick-start gas plants that are required to meet higher renewable portfolio standards, and the sustainability targets of corporations across the country. We are ready to capitalize on this market opportunity, which is even further enhanced by our partnership with NRG Yield. Now, turning to the other two levers of our value proposition. Our leverage to natural gas and power. Both less predictable, but with significant upside potential given where we are in the commodity cycle. Let's start with our leverage to natural gas. We have deliberately maintained fuel diversity in our portfolio, and can therefore benefit from the price differential between coal and uranium to natural gas. Our long gas position is about 3.3 bcf a day. I am encouraged by the price, supply, and demand outlook. We have seen a significant increase in spot prices from the recent lows; production has been stagnant, reflecting an unsustainable low-price environment, and demand is picking up, particularly in the power sector. If the price of gas moves by $0.50, NRG would realize almost $0.5 billion in additional gross margin, 2/3 of which is realized at the NRG level, and with minimal impact on our Retail business since most of our fixed-price obligations are short-term and hedged. The last lever is our exposure to power prices for heat rates. Our upside is also significant as we have the largest and most diverse fleet in the country, with close to 43 gigawatts of merchant generation. While we're seeing the market tightening due to unit retirements, the outlook for power is more neutral, given the increased uncertainty from environmental regulations, and the recent actions to subsidize on economic generation by certain states. We will continue to work with our generators, regulators, and stakeholders to protect the integrity of competitive markets. As you can see, the outlook for the business overall is positive, and no other company offers investors a play in the industry in the same way that our business does. We're not one-dimensional when it comes to creating value, and we're able to handle downturns better than others. We do not bet on a single fuel or on a single technology. We have embraced vertical integration and diversification as a way to navigate through a sea of uncertainty in our industry. I have no doubt our business is best positioned for both nearer- and longer-term success in the industry. I want to take a few minutes to share some thoughts on two of our key markets, ERCOT and PJM. Let's first start with ERCOT on slide 6. We're seeing signs of market recovery as dark spreads have increased over 100% from their lows even outpacing the rebound in spark spreads by a healthy margin. As an owner of an environmentally controlled coal unit in the region, we certainly welcome this move. So far, this summer has been characterized by consistently warm weather, of higher than normal wind production in July, and a healthy grid have resulted in little to no scarcity pricing. While the forward markets have improved, we have been disappointed that the PUCT have not taken swifter action to correct the demand curve to provide better market signals. That said, we do expect positive revisions to the ORDC later this year to better reflect scarcity conditions in prices. Finally, there is still an overhang of uncertainty from several environmental regulations in Texas most notably, regional haze. This could delay the decision to retire uneconomic and uncontrolled assets for some time, but ultimately, the investment to comply will prove difficult for these type of units under current market conditions. We remain confident that our large environmentally-controlled and favorably-located assets are well-positioned to meet compliance thresholds with modest capital investments. PJM is somewhat a different story moving from a market with high energy and capacity prices that incentivizes new generation to one with energy margins under pressure. The massive turnover from coal and oil to natural gas is starting to impact spark spreads as more efficient combined cycles are coming online. In looking at both energy and capacity prices for the 2019-2020 period, we're now below the cost of new entry for a new CCGT. (13:40-13:52) We expect the next auction for 2020 to 2021 to be more constructive as we believe a move into 100% capacity performance requirement, a potential slowdown in newbuilds, and a more moderate load revision will support higher capacity prices. We are encouraged by the constructive nature of the capacity market and its efforts to better reward unit reliability. Our investments are consistent with these market dynamics, and rest assured that we will continue to oppose the use of state-based contracts and subsidies that undermines well-functioning competitive markets. During my first call as CEO back in February, I committed to simplifying our business. This meant not just simplifying how we communicate our value proposition to the market, but also the internal structure and interworking of the organization. In that spirit, it's not lost on me that we need to extend the simplification to our capital structure. So addressing GenOn has been one of my priorities for 2016. On slide 7, I wanted to shed some light on the situation as it currently stands. The GenOn portfolio has allowed us to fill a gap we had in PJM, a strategic market as we were building a diverse portfolio across all major competitive markets. This position was later complemented with the acquisition of an additional 4,000 megawatts from Edison Mission. Over the last few years, we have taken steps to capitalize on evolving market trends, particularly around changes in the capacity market. However, deteriorating market fundamentals are adversely impacting the GenOn portfolio. Abundant shale gas, more stringent environmental regulations, and an influx of new efficient gas plants which are causing significant pressure on energy and capacity prices in the region. This low commodity cycle is impacting the financial scale of the GenOn entity, as you can see in upper left-hand table. Currently, the leverage ratio for the consolidated GenOn entity is 7.7 times. This level of debt relative to EBITDA is successive, particularly as NRG seeks to maintain a long-term corporate level leverage ratio target of 4.25. GenOn has taken several important steps to address the challenges it faces. First, it has appointed two independent directors to the GenOn board. It is a key step in ensuring that the interest of all stakeholders in GenOn are considered. Second, it has retained restructuring advisors to help navigate the process efficiently and judiciously. Third, it has opportunistically solved several non-core assets over the past several quarters who helped provide additional financial flexibility within the general complex. I know that many of you have a lot of questions on GenOn, but I am sure you can appreciate this is a sensitive process, and as GenOn is engaged in ongoing conversations with its stakeholders, we are unable to elaborate on the specifics at this time. I expect to provide more information as this process moves forward. What I can leave with you today is the reminder that as this process progresses and options are evaluated, there are three key principles that we will adhere to : simplifying the organization; maximizing value; and from NRG's perspective, maintaining the strength of the NRG balance sheet and credit metrics. So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review. Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary on slide 9, NRG delivered $779 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by a strong performance by our Retail mass business, achieving a record EBITDA of $213 million. For the second quarter, Generation and Renewables combined for $326 million in adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield contributed $240 million. For the first half of the year, NRG generated almost $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $220 million of free cash flow before growth. Based on both performance year-to-date and our updated outlook for the balance of the year, which has us tracking to the upper end of our EBITDA range, we are reaffirming our 2016 guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth. We expect to update and narrow these ranges, following the completion of the summer season on our third quarter call in November and we'll also provide guidance for 2017 at that time. During the second quarter call and into July, NRG made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility, as we took advantage of favorable market conditions, by significantly extending corporate maturities while continuing our deleveraging efforts. Since we embarked on our current corporate debt reduction program in the fourth quarter of 2015, we have now retired a total of $642 million of NRG level debt. In addition, through two successful unsecured notes offerings totaling $2.25 billion, NRG significantly extended corporate maturities at lower rates, than the shorter dated maturities which were retired using the proceeds from these offerings. We also successfully extended both our corporate revolver from 2018 to 2021, and our secured term loan from 2018 to 2023. These transactions, when combined with the overall debt reduction achieved since late last year, result in approximately $50 million in annualized interest savings for NRG. Taking into account the $10 million in annualized dividend savings we captured in the second quarter through the redemption of our convertible preferred, interest and dividend savings combined drive incremental improvements in free cash flow before growth on an annual basis at the NRG level of approximately $60 million. Finally, NRG has just entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to sell our remaining 51% interest in CVSR, resulting in expected cash proceeds to NRG of approximately $180 million. These proceeds are derived from two sources. First, taking advantage of incremental secured debt capacity at CVSR. In July, we closed on $200 million in new non-recourse secured debt. NRG's share of the net cash proceeds of which is $101.5 million. Second, we agreed to sell our remaining 51% stake in CVSR to NRG Yield for $78.5 million in cash and expect that transaction to close this quarter. The total cash proceeds from these transactions further increase NRG level capital for allocation, which you'll find updated on slide 10. Turning to that slide, 10, the cash proceeds of $180 million from the CVSR transaction increased total 2016 NRG level capital available for allocation to just under $1.9 billion. The proceeds from CVSR also increased the portion of NRG level capital allocated to debt or convertible preferred reduction, which now stands at just under $1.5 billion for 2016. On our first quarter call, we had earmarked the net proceeds of $210 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization toward the potential redemption of our convertible preferred stock. Having now redeemed the convert for $226 million versus the $210 million reserve we'd established for that purpose, a portion of the CVSR proceeds helps make up the difference, or $16 million. $59 million of the CVSR proceeds was used to offset the financing fees incurred in connection with the maturity extensions, allowing us to maintain the total capital allocated toward absolute debt reduction. The balance of the CVSR proceeds or $105 million, will be used to increase the reserve established for the remainder of our 2018 notes, from $325 million to now, $430 million. Turning now to slide 11 for an update on the NRG level capital structure and leverage ratios. As a result of our significant progress in debt reduction and maturity extension, the remaining balance of our 2018 unsecured notes now stands at only $587 million and is our only remaining outstanding debt maturing prior to 2021. Looking to NRG's maturity profile in the upper left of that slide, including our corporate revolver as of the third quarter of last year, NRG had about $6.7 billion in total debt maturities through 2020. To put our progress toward strengthening our balance sheet into perspective, as a result of the continuing deleveraging and opportunistic refinancings, today, we have less than $900 million maturing through 2020. A reduction of approximately $5.8 billion in less than a year. While we'll continue to be opportunistic when market conditions are favorable, this increased flexibility allows us to be more selective, and less exposed to the type of short-term swings and volatility in the debt markets we saw earlier in 2016. The added benefit, as I mentioned earlier, is that in the process we've already achieved approximately $60 million in annual dividend and interest savings, which similar to the significant decrease in environmental CapEx which follows 2016, helps further improve our ability to translate EBITDA into free cash flow in 2017 and beyond. Finally, as you can see in the updated table in the upper right-hand of the slide, we remain on track to drive our corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio well below our long-term target of 4.25, allowing us to maintain adherence to the principles of prudent balance sheet management through the commodity cycle. We're very pleased with our progress on the balance sheet side and I want to recognize the folks in our finance, accounting, and legal departments in particular for their outstanding efforts this year in making these successes possible and moving NRG forward in achieving our balance sheet goals for 2016. With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Kirk. To close, I want to leave you with our scorecard on slide 13. We have made excellent progress on all our stated objectives from simplifying the company and streamlining costs to strengthening our balance sheet and creating financial flexibility to better manage this commodity cycle. Importantly, I want to note the significant progress we have made in continuing to strengthen the relationship with our strategic partner, NRG Yield. This partnership provides yet another significant point of differentiation between NRG and other IPPs, adding to our stable base of earnings and allowing us to replenish capital for assets we develop and drop down with strong returns. Last quarter, we focused on strengthening our yieldco by putting in place a dedicated CEO to focus solely on growing this business. This quarter, we enter into an agreement to drop down NRG's remaining stake in CVSR. Going forward, we remain committed to finding and developing projects that we complete in the dropdown pipeline. Throughout the organization, our performance and progress in meeting our objectives has been impressive and I look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the coming months. Andrea, we're now ready to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Good morning, gentlemen. Great quarter. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey. Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Can you just give us maybe a little bit more granular detail on the strength of the \u2013 in the Generation business in the quarter because it's at odds with the performance of some of your competitors? I'm wondering whether it has to do with outage timing or other nuances going on there. Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Look I mean I \u2013 as you could see on my prepared remarks, Greg, Generation business actually benefited from three main reasons. One was the hedge profile that we had and the opportunistic hedging that we've consistently done over the last couple of years. Two, we have actually focused on managing costs. We look at optimizing our maintenance CapEx, our outages and we're trying to be consistent with the way the portfolio is running today which is not the same way the portfolio ran before. So, we need to adjust our operating philosophy. And then last one, I think we also benefited from capacity revenues coming from our South Central region, where in the past, we've said that we were able to move some megawatts into the PJM capacity auction. And so those are the three big drivers on the Generation business, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Second question, on your slide 6, you show that the market conditions have improved demonstrably in ERCOT, and some investors are frustrated that despite the gas price move, we haven't seen a commensurate move up in power prices on PJM. I put that to sort of the way the dispatch curve looks and you're kind of in the deep part of the smile now where gas has to keep moving up for gas plants to move back ahead of coal, but there's also a theory that coal was burning out of dispatch and that's been putting pressure on power prices in that market. And that now that that's no longer happening, we might see better conditions. Can you comment on whether either or both of those are true? And if not, what's your outlook for PJM power prices? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, I mean, I've heard the frustration about moving gas prices up and power not following through. I think what I wanted to represent in this slide is that in Texas, it's actually \u2013 we have seen dark spreads move significantly both in terms of heat rate expansion and following natural gas. With respect to PJM, I think the story's slightly different. If you look at gas basis in PJM, have actually significantly decreased over the summer. And I think that is putting some pressure on the spark spreads. I am not of the theory that coal generators are running uneconomically in the region. I just think that you're seeing an influx of combined cycles, you're seeing pretty good gas prices or low gas prices compared to the forward markets a couple of months ago. And I think the combination of those two are just putting some pressure on the spark equivalent. On a long-term basis, as the market implemented capacity performance standards and we're seeing this massive turnover between coal and natural gas. We should expect more pressure on spark spreads. I mean the capacity performance market was designed to ensure that generators have more availability during scarcity conditions. So as we look past 2017, and towards the end of the decade, I expect to have more pressure on the spark spread in PJM and be more constructive on capacity prices. I mean that's why we shifted the strategy in the East, particular in PJM, towards becoming a capacity resource as opposed to providing energy. We still maintain that option on energy and it's a cheap option, but most of the investments that we have made are on the back of what we think is a more constructive part of the market which is the capacity one. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Two questions. One shorter term, one longer term. First of all, shorter term, you reported and congrats on this, what looks like to be a really healthy, really strong second quarter and yet, you left 2016 guidance intact rather than raised. Just curious, what are some of the headwinds you see for the second half of 2016 that make you keep guidance at the current level? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, good morning, Michael. Look, as I indicated, I think we're tracking towards the upper end of the guidance. I mean, it is the second quarter. We have a lot of the summer ahead of us and I think it's just prudent to keep our guidance the way we had it. We're very comfortable with the position that we have, we're very comfortable with the hedging that we have for balance of the year. But let's keep in mind that we still have August and September which can be really hot in Texas. And I think it was \u2013 it's just \u2013 from a prudency standpoint, we felt that it was the right thing to do to maintain our guidance. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. And thinking longer term, I mean if you just look at the company's portfolio, if there's a scenario where you're no longer the principal of \u2013 owner of GenOn, how does the board think about the market positioning of NRG \u2013 legacy NRG in terms of markets you have significant exposure to like ERCOT and then markets maybe in a next GenOn world like PJM where you'd have pretty limited exposure? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, Michael, we're venturing here in the realm of the possible and what I will tell you is that in PJM, we have actually two ways of participating in that market. Clearly through the GenOn entity but also our Midwest Generation portfolio that we acquired from Edison Mission and that's close to 4,000 megawatts. So it's not necessarily an inconsequential position. Actually in many places, you have the scale and the scope. So, when we think about the portfolio, even without in the possibility of not having the GenOn entity, we feel very comfortable with the geographic diversification that we have across \u2013 in all competitive markets, including PJM. And just keep in mind that in the latest auction, actually the ComEd area where our Midwest Gen portfolio sits was probably the one that was the most constructive in the capacity auction results. So, clearly, we will re-evaluate the makeup of our portfolio, but I think that doesn't necessarily changes the underlying value proposition of an integrated platform with diversity across fuel, merit order, and geographic location, and with a focus towards the more stable part of our business which is contracted assets through our renewable development portfolio and our partnership with Yield, our capacity focus, and our Retail business. So, I don't think it changes the value proposition for NRG or our strategy going forward. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Mauricio. I'll hop back in the queue. Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. How are you? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey. Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So, I wanted to ask a quick question real quickly around the Texas outlook. Obviously, things are evolving in that space and I wanted to get a sense real quickly as to what your thoughts are both as to retirements of not just coal assets but further steam assets and gas assets, more broadly, as well as the potential for any kind of settlement as it relates to the haze regulations with the EPA and how that might ultimately play out. Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Julien, I mean, I've said it before. I think the Texas market continues to be one of the most effective markets in the country, particularly from where we're starting. If you look at the spark spreads, if you look at power prices, they were completely oversold the last couple of months. And that basically shifted some of the bullishness that we have in that respective market. When you look at the fundamental there, even the first half of the year, we have very, very strong growth, and if I'm not mistaken, yesterday, we set a new all-time record in Texas. So, load growth continues; load growth is very robust. We like the market structure. We like the higher price cuts. I think there are improvements that need to happen, particularly on ORDC and to make sure that we have better price signals when we enter into scarcity conditions. And as you mentioned, I mean I think there is a risk for rationalization in supply, in retirements. My expectation is that, if we continue to see this current level of pricing, there are some old steam units and perhaps some environmentally uncontrolled coal plants, that will retire because they are not going to be able to make the math work when putting back in controls. Look, I mean I don't want to be myopic in terms of the regional haze and what will happen, and it stayed and we're going to go through the process. But behind the regional haze, you have the ELG. You have the 1-hour SO2. I mean you have a number of other environmental regulations. I think ultimately, smaller or medium sized coal units that are not controlled or well controlled, the outlook is just not going to look very promising. And perhaps it delays the retirement decision one or two years, but I think, ultimately, people will make the right economic decision. And the low gas price environment and the low spark spread environment accelerated some of that. I mean, we actually filed to mothball one of our old steamers. It was needed for reliability. Other generators have done the same. I think you're going to continue to see that in the coming years if something doesn't drastically change in the market. But we're starting to see some recovery, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : But just to be specific here, I mean, do you see a potential for a settlement with EPA, a universal \u2013 either with the haze or more broadly? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean, it's very difficult to speculate a settlement on haze with the EPA. I mean, as I said, I mean, I think there is a number of other environmental regulations that will be limiting. And even under the regional haze, you have other parts of that regulation that's still applicable in the region. So my view and my take is perhaps a little bit more generic that environmental regulations are going to be more stringent. And if you don't have good backend controls or you're in a good location or you're actually burning a lower sulfur coal, that \u2013 making the math work will be difficult. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got you. And then just a follow-up, in terms of GenOn, and I know this is kind of a little bit off the reservation, but in terms of just your ability to deal with any allocated costs, in the eventuality that something does happen there, how are you feeling about your ability to mitigate those costs? Now, I don't know if that's too far astray or not, but obviously last time you made a comment, how are you feeling about your efforts now to re-evaluate your cost structure and potentially mitigate the allocated costs, if it truly does come to it? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, Julien, I mean, I don't want to speculate on how we're going to be allocating cost and any potential outcomes. I mean, I think what I said about the GenOn situation is that, it's early. We are in active dialogue \u2013 or GenOn is in active dialogue with their creditors. I've laid out kind of the three principles that we're going to apply as we navigate through this process, simplifying the capital structure. And we are maximizing value and ensuring that we don't impact negatively the credit metrics of NRG. And as we go through this process, we're going to be using these three principles to make sure that we make the right economic decision. So, I mean, beyond that, Julien, it's really just \u2013 speculating is probably not the prudent thing to do as we go through this process right now. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you very much. Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Thank you, Julien. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Abe. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: On slide 13, most of these 2016 strategic priorities have been accomplished already. What are some of your strategic priorities for the second half beyond the GenOn restructuring, and do you have any further opportunities to pursue asset sales or dropdowns? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look. I mean, I'm very pleased with the progress that we have made on all the priorities, and that has afforded us the opportunity to be looking at some other strategic objectives clearly accelerating the GenOn discussion is one, but in a more general theme, I'm looking at \u2013 continue to perfect the integrated platform that we have. And that goes from the Generation portfolio to Renewables, to our Retail, whether it's residential or C&I. I am evaluating what parts of the value proposition that we have need to be strengthened and which opportunities are available in these four core businesses that we have. So, beyond just giving you more specifics, what I will tell you is that perhaps we're pivoting weaker towards looking at other strategic opportunities as we have made such a good progress on the deleveraging front. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And perhaps similarly with the reduction in debt you have in place for 2016 and the reserves for the 2018 maturities, will 2017 capital be more focused on shareholder return or growth capital or... Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think that's fair. When I think about capital allocation, I made the case that we needed to focus on deleveraging that was the right thing to do given where we were on the commodity cycle. As we are getting now significantly below our 4.25 target, we can start focusing on returning capital to shareholders or some other growth investments. So, as I said, it's been good progress and perhaps a little ahead of schedule that we can actually turn our attention into that. But for 2016, most of the capital is committed. For 2017, certainly we will evaluate the other two options that we have. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey. Good morning, Praful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. So first question was on GenOn, I just wanted to \u2013 and building on, I guess, a previous question. I just wanted to confirm and understand, how strong is the ring fence? As in, is there any risk that the GenOn credit or creditors have any claim at the NRG level or is the ring fence tight enough that those two boxes will be completely independent? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Look, I mean I feel very comfortable with the ring fence around GenOn. We have made the right operational decisions to position the portfolio to benefit from market trends at PJM. All the cash within the GenOn entity has remained in GenOn even inclusive of the asset sales which from my perspective were done very opportunistically, and at the right time, and at very good multiples. So from my perspective, the integrity of that entity is pretty strong. But, Kirk, do you have anything to add there? Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think you summarized it well. I mean, at the outset of the transaction when we closed it, we announced we restructured it for a myriad of reasons as an excluded project sub on a non-recourse basis. And from a governance, operational, and financial perspective, we have adhered to all principles around that. So that, I would just echo that contributes to our confidence that we've established what's necessary to ensure from a financial standpoint and from a non-recourse standpoint, it is consistent with the objectives that we set out and we operated it, both financially and operationally, in line with those principles. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. And secondly, in terms of the sensitivity to gas prices, just wanted to understand how Retail fits into the Generation side. And it's interesting, you clearly have Retail performing well and at low gas prices clearly it benefits. But then I wanted to understand, as gas prices go up, as you show in these sensitivities, what is the assumption around what happens to the Retail business, EBITDA and margins, under those situations? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, I mean when you think about the Retail book, just \u2013 our fixed price obligations on Retail don't extend beyond 6 to 12 months. And for the most part, they're hedged. They're hedged to expected lows, plus some variability around weather and different weather scenarios. We buy options to manage that variability. So if \u2013 in the short term, if gas prices increase, it doesn't necessarily impact our Retail business. I think in the long term, we have the opportunity to price low at the current market prices. So, it's further mitigated by that. I think where you'll see the difference is just in terms of the cycle around Retail in a low commodity priced environment where you have higher loads, then you can benefit from that because I guess on the margin on megawatt, you have expansion on margins. That situation doesn't necessarily happen in higher gas prices, particularly in the short term. Again, longer term, you always price at market, so you don't necessarily \u2013 our Retail business is not necessarily impacted by it. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey. Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Mauricio, given the fact that the next big or the next maturity at GenOn is in 2017, for those of us looking at it from the outside, is it fair to say that whatever resolution you like to achieve most likely happens next year as we get closer to maturity and minds are more fixated on getting something done or might something actually play out this year? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, I mean, it's hard to say. I mean, this requires a number of stakeholders in the process. Certainly, the next summer is the first maturity that we have, the 2017s. From my perspective, we're trying to have a comprehensive long-term solution for GenOn. And that just resonates with one of the principles that I outlined, which is simplifying the capital structure or simplifying the message and the organization at the NRG level. So I'm looking at finding a long-term comprehensive solution and not necessarily just dealing with one specific maturity or not. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then secondly, then just from again a big picture perspective, when you look at your new sort of cost profile given the actions you've taken, you've identified, and you couple that with your contract and capacity profile that you laid out for us, as well as the forward curves as they stand, are we still looking at a scenario directionally that implies downward pressure on 2017 EBITDA versus 2016 or can that be now mitigated with the cost actions you've taken? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look. I mean, I'm not going to venture into providing guidance for 2017 or any indication. I think what I can tell you is that our CapEx program gets reduced by $650 million. And starting in 2017, I said it before, we're going to harvest some of the investments that we have made over the past two to three years to reposition the portfolio. So I think that combined with, as you said, some of the cost actions that we have taken in terms of streamlining of the organization, reducing costs, resizing and recalibrating businesses that were underperforming, so I think the combination of that, plus the outlook that we've had on 2017, particularly around natural gas, which is starting to play out, I think when you combine that, it starts giving you at least some direction what some of the levers and the drivers are. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. And just one quick follow-up. The assets that you've sold, the $563 million in proceeds, can you just remind us the annual EBITDA that goes with those asset sales? Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I am not sure that we've disclosed that, but if we have, we'll follow up with you. What I will tell you is that all the asset sales that we did, one, were non-core assets; two, they were done at pretty strong multiples compared to the EBITDA, and I think, three, capitalized actually in some of the particular outcomes on the capacity auctions and energy market. So we were \u2013 I was very pleased with the execution. It exceeded our initial target. And I think for now, we're going to pause. I mean, I don't think there is any additional asset sales that we need to do but I don't believe we have disclosed that EBITDA number. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Thank you, Andrea. I think that's all. Thank you, everybody, for participating on our call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Esther. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's third quarter 2016 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcasted live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investor section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcasts. As this is an earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation, as well as risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release and presentation. Now, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG Energy's President and Chief Executive Officer. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business; and Craig Cornelius, Head of our Renewables business. I want to start by highlighting the key messages for today\u2019s call on slide 3; first, we are narrowing and increasing our 2016 EBITDA guidance by $200 million at the midpoint. Our exceptional performance by everyone in the company once again highlights the value of our integrated platform and its continued ability to perform under a variety of market conditions.  Second, after reintegrating the Renewables business in to NRG earlier this year, we\u2019re now fully leveraging our proven operational platform. As you will hear later in the presentation, we have a robust and growing Renewables business that not only enables us to acquire and operate assets in one of the fastest growing parts of the energy industry, but also helps us strengthen our partnership with NRG yield. This business is executing on market opportunities and with a SunEdison transaction is only getting stronger. Last, I am extremely pleased with our progress in strengthening the balance sheet. As of today, we have reduced our corporate debt obligation by $1 billion, bought back $345 million in convertible preferred shares and extended over 6 billion in near-term maturities well beyond 2020.  These are impressive numbers, given we started our efforts only one year ago, and this has been one of my primary objectives since becoming CEO. I wanted to thank everyone in the organization who worked hard to achieve our targets in such a short time frame. Now, moving on to the third quarter results on slide 4, today we are reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.173 billion, a testament to the continued operational and financial strength of our business. Once again, despite a sustained low commodity price environment, our platform delivered.  I want to highlight the outstanding results of our retail business for the quarter, which increased by 18% year-over-year, recording one of its strongest performances ever. Elizabeth and her team continues to operate a best-in-class retail business and together with our commercial team has proven extremely effective in supply and risk management and in strengthening customer relationships. Well done to the entire retail and commercial teams on your continued success. I also want to recognize everyone in the organization for improving our safety record over the quarter and returning us to a top docile performer.  Our generation\u2019s business performed well during some very challenging market conditions. Not only did we protect the value of our fleet during very low summer prices, but we also executed our asset optimization projects on time and on budget, including three coal to gas conversions this year.  We remain focus on strengthening our yield goal during the quarter by expanding the potential pipeline of projects. In addition to the SunEdison transaction, we also completed the drop down of CVSR and today we are announcing an agreement, and today we are announcing an agreement to deal 73 megawatt thermal equivalent of the University Of Pittsburgh Medical Center on behalf of NRE yield. Last, we have been making good progress in streamlining our cost structure and remain on track to achieve $400 million in savings by the end of 2017 on the [endeavor] for NRG program.  Underpinned by our hedge profile and integrated model, we are initiating 2017 financial guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Later in the presentation, Kirk will provide additional details. But for now I want to highlight our consolidated free cash flow range of $800 million to $1 billion.  As we done in the past, we manage our business forecast and this guidance speaks to the stability and strength of our free cash flow generating ability, which at current prices implies a 30% free cash flow yield. Let me turn now to our market on the slide 5. This summer proved to be a disappointing one from a pricing standpoint, particularly in the east where temperatures were almost 30% above the 10 years average, but prices were flat compared to the forward market. This was due to a lack of low growth and much lower gas basis.  In Texas, we experienced mild weather, but even under this conditions, ERCOT still managed to post a record peak load of 71 gigawatts, a roughly 2% increase from the previous peak one year ago.  We have consistently said that this is the only market where we are seeing low growth and this summer is evidence of that. Unfortunately, prices came in much lower than expected in large parts due to the over performance of wind which was about twice the expected production during peak hours, eliminating the potential for scarcity pricing.  As you can see on the right side of the slide, disappointing summer prices and the recent sell-out in gas have been putting some pressure on the forward market. Longer term and turning to slide 6, we remain bullish in our outlook for ERCOT, particularly at these price levels, where we see a clear opportunity for a market correction in the near future.  As I just noted, ERCOT is experiencing real demand growth about 1.4% year-to-date, which is the strongest in the country. But despite the new big low this summer, we did not see scarcity pricing. And we actually have not seen it for a number of years. I want to reiterate that the ORDC is now providing the right scarcity pricing [load] to existing or new generation. As an energy-only market, correct pricing load are imperative for its proper functioning. We are hopeful that with the resolution of EFH restructuring the PUCT will turn its attention to ORDC reform and we look forward to working with both the PUCT and ERCOT to improve the markets.  We\u2019re also starting to see units retire, given persistent low power prices. These retirements will only be extenuated by additional environmental compliance requirements. We believe there are at least 4 to 8 more gigawatts currently at risk, none of which are NRG units.  A combination of strong load growth, units at risk, higher environment costs, potential delays in new bills and market structural reforms drives our construction view in ERCOT.  Turning to the east, energy margins in PJM remain under pressure, given the new capacity performance requirements that in essence review the probability of scarcity pricing. These combined with no low growth and a significant amount of new gas deals coming online in the next few years, results in a less than favorable outlook for energy margins. Capacity on the other hand is a different story. The next PJM auction will be the first with a 100% capacity performance requirement. These CP-only market construct will impose significant risk on the 17 gigawatts of generation that clear as a base capacity in the last auction, as well as the 10 gigawatts of demand response and energy efficiency that also cleared as base capacity.  Let me be clear, that\u2019s 27 gigawatts of capacity that has a decision to make on how and what to bid in to the CP auction in May.  One last thought on the markets, now it is important to reiterate that we will take firm action against any out-of-market efforts that undermine the integrity of competitive markets, like the ones we have seen in New York, Ohio and Illinois. As proponents of competitive markets, you can expect us to be vocal advocates of our position.  Let me turn to our renewable business on slide 7. In the past, I have discussed with you the importance renewable generation in our future and the positive trends we see in that market. Higher renewable portfolio standards, increasing corporate sustainability targets and cost efficiencies are the basis for a sustained growth in renewables demand.  In my first call as CEO and consistent with the outlook, I announced the reintegration of our renewable business back in to NRG, recognizing the changing landscape of the power industry and the compelling growth opportunities for NRG. Our renewable business is unique, as it leverage NRG\u2019s existing operational platform and cost of our relationships from the traditional generation and retail businesses. We also have the ability to augment our renewables business by acquiring or developing renewable assets that can be dropped down to NRE yield. This puts NRE in an excellent competitive position to execute and play in this space in a meaningful way.  Today we operate over 4 gigawatts of wind and solar assets, making us one of the largest renewable generators in the country. We are focused on building up our pipeline and creating line of sight several years in to the future. We have been hard at work developing projects and currently, we have approximately 800 megawatts in near term and backlog assets and an additional 2.6 gigawatts of pipeline capacity.  Renewables provide not just an opportunity to execute on low cost growth, but also a way enhance our value proposition by contributing to our stable base of earnings and providing visibility in to future cash flows. This is an important business that is strong today and only getting stronger.  Turning now to our SunEdison asset transaction on slide 8; in September NRG was selected as the winning bidder for our 1.5 gigawatt portfolio of utilities -scale wind and solar assets at an initial purchase price of $129 million with $59 million in earn-out potential. In October, we completed the purchase of 29 megawatts of distributed generation of asset for $68 million. Our scale, diverse platform and partnership with NRG Yield, afforded us significant advantages during the bidding process. And these same characteristics will continue to be advantageous as a developer and operator of these assets in the future.  For the utility-scale transaction, we were able to mitigate risk and maximize reward by purchasing a portfolio of assets in which we could ascribe the majority of the transaction value on the operational assets, and maintain the pipeline as an option at a steep discount to market prices.  To be more specific, over 85% of the total purchase price is justified by the expected value of the operating assets in Utah. The balance will come from the development and optimization of the 1.2 gigawatt backlog and pipeline, representing a low cost option for growth. With other [future] assets NRG would expect to achieve strong returns as a result of placing these megawatts in to our DG partnerships with NRG Yield.  This transaction is a significant win for NRG, as we continue to build out our position as a leader in renewable generation. We executed on a unique opportunity to accelerate the growth of our renewables business while setting the foundation for a strengthened partnership with NRG yield. It is our expectation that these will be temporary use of capital that can be recovered in a short period of time.  Turning to slide 9, I\u2019d like to discuss our current thinking and capital allocation for 2017. Although details will come out on our next call, I\u2019d like to provide you with my current assessment of our options as I see them today, particularly on the 30% of the capital that is yet to be allocated.  I want to first remind you of our philosophy on capital allocation, maintaining the robustness of the balance sheet and making decisions that are cycle appropriate and what guides our approach to allocating capital. We\u2019re in a deeply cyclical sector, which means that we must plan ahead, anticipate markets and leave no doubt about our financial strength; particularly during down cycles such as the one we are current facing.  Last year, given the market outlook and to reduce our overall leverage, we initiated a $1.5 billion deleveraging program. Over the course of the past year, we have made significant progress toward this target, and as we are finishing these commitments, I want to ensure the market that cycle appropriate leverage and capital discipline will continue across the organization in to 2017. With respect to growth, given the low commodity price environment, we are focused on low cost options or areas of quick capital replenishment such as the SunEdison transaction.  Finally, we remain commitment to returning cash to shareholders when we feel our capital structure is strong enough to allow for flexibility. At the beginning of the year, we revised our dividend program to be consistent with the cyclical nature of our industry, and I remain comfortable with our dividend policy. We continue to evaluate the potential for share buybacks given our current share price and free cash flow yields.  And with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review. Kirkland Andrews : Thank you Mauricio and good morning everyone. Turning the financial summary on slide 11, NRG delivered 1.173 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter dated by strong performance by our Retail Mass business which contributed EBITDA of 266 million, Generation in renewables combined for 605 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, while NRG Yield contributed 246 million. As required by GAAP, following completion of the drop down of NRG\u2019s remaining interest in CVSR to NRG Yield; adjusted EBITDA at NRG Yield now reflects 100% of consolidated CVSR results with an equal reduction in generation and renewables results.  Through the first nine months of the year, NRG generated almost 2.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA and 1.1 billion of free cash flow before growth. Based on performance year-to-date and our updated outlook for the balance of the year, we\u2019re increasing and narrowing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance to 3.25 billion to 3.35 billion which I\u2019ll review in greater detail following. As of this week, we\u2019ve now completed over 1 billion in corporate debt reduction over the course of the last 12 months, with 777 million completed year-to-date and 246 million retired in the fourth quarter of 2015. This significant reduction in corporate debt helps to ensure we can maintain our balance sheet targets through the low commodity price cycle.  In addition, when combined with the retirement of our convertible preferred and the extension of corporate debt maturities at more favorable rates, our deleveraging efforts also help generate nearly 90 million in annual interest and dividend savings, improving NRG level free cash flow.  While the specifics of the capital allocation plan will be laid out in more detail on our year-end earnings call, we do intend to reduce corporate debt by an additional 400 million through the retirement of the remaining balance of our 2018 senior unsecured notes. This will further enhance balance sheet strength, reduce interest expense and extend our nearest unsecured maturity to 2021. The balance of which is now only 200 million. During the third quarter, NRG also completed the drop down of our remaining 51% interest in CVSR to NRG Yield, which when combined with the proceeds from the CVSR non-recourse debt financing generated total cash proceeds to NRG of approximately 180 million.  Turning to slide 12, I\u2019ll provide some greater detail on our revised 2016 guidance, as well as initiate guidance for 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we are narrowing and increasing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to 3.25 billion to 3.35 billion. As noted on the slide, this revised 2016 guidance range includes the impact of $120 million of adjusted EBITDA, resulting from the monetization of hedges at GenOn, which would have otherwise been realized in future years. The updated 2016 business and renewables range also reflects this increase from the GenOn hedge monetization, as well as the movement of CVSR EBITDA to the Yield segment following the drop down which closed this past quarter. Based on a strong retail mass performance to the first nine months of the year, we are also increasing this component of 2016 EBITDA guidance to 725 million to 775 million.  Finally, the increase in the NRG Yield component of guidance is primarily driven by the movement of CVSR adjusted EBITDA from generations yield following the drop down, as well as stronger than expected year-to-date performance across the wind portfolio.  We are narrowing the consolidated free cash flow before growth guidance range to 1.1 to 1.2 billion which reflects the impact of the 120 million in non-recurring debt extinguishment cost incurred in connection with our successful debt reduction and maturity extension efforts during the year. This reduction in expected NRG level free cash flow before growth is solely due to these one-time debt extinguishment costs. Moving to 2017, on the right side of the slide, we are initiating consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of 2.7 billion to 2.9 billion. 100 million of the GenOn hedge monetization EBITDA, which was realized in 2016, serve to reduce expected 2017 EBITDA and is reflected in both our generation and renewables and consolidate EBITDA guidance range for 2017.  Greater than 75% of the year-over-year drop in adjusted EBITDA in the generation and renewable segment is due to declines at the GenOn level, which includes the year-over-year impact of the hedge monetization. The remaining components of 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance consists of 700 million to 780 million at retail mass and 865 million at NRG Yield, where the year-over-year difference simply reflects the impact of outperformance in 2016 wind generation versus median wind production expectation embedded 2017 guidance.  Moving to free cash flow guidance, the drop in GenOn adjusted EBITDA is also reflected in the 2017 consolidated free cash flow before growth of 800 million to 1 billion, which includes approximately 300 million of negative free cash flow at GenOn. Finally to arrive at 2017 NRG level free cash flow before growth, we add back that negative free cash flow at the GenOn level and deduct free cash flow net of distributions from NRG Yield and other non-guarantors which leads to an expected range of 700 million to 900 million of NRG level free cash flow in 2017.  Importantly, expected NRG level free cash flow in 2017 is in line with 2016 net of those one-time debt extinguishment cost, primarily due to the significant year-over-year decline in NRG level capital expenditures, as well as the full year impact of interest savings from our corporate level debt reduction program.  Turning to slide 13, for an update on 2016 NRG level capital allocation, I\u2019ve highlighted in blue the changes since our prior quarter update, which includes the impact of the 120 million in debt extinguishment cost I mentioned previously, as well as the increase in growth investments of approximately 190 million, which reflects the SunEdison transaction. These two items serve to temporarily reduce the excess capital balance reserved for the 2018 NRG senior notes, which now stands at 120 million. The balance of our 2018 senior notes has been reduced by 200 million following the quarter end as we completed our 2016 debt reduction program and the remaining balance of these notes now stands at only 400 million. During 2017, we plan to replenish the 2018 debt reserve to 400 million to ultimately retire the remaining balance, using 2017 excess capital generated through NRG level free cash flow, and the continuing monetization of our NRG Yield eligible assets which now include the operating portion of the SunEd portfolio. When combined over 1 billion in debt reduction already achieved over the past year, this leads to over 1.4 billion in debt reduction through 2017.  Finally, slide 14 provides an update on expected corporate 2016 balance sheet metrics, as well as the first look at 2017. Starting with 2016 having repurchased a portion of our 2018 and 2021 notes following the third quarter end, we\u2019ve completed our 2016 de-leveraging objectives driving corporate debt to 7.8 billion, the exact target corporate debt balance first established as part of our 2016 capital allocation plan, which was announced during our February earnings presentation.  Based on midpoint 2016 guidance, this gives an implied corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio of just under four times. Turning to 2017 metrics on the far right of the slide, we intend to further reduce corporate level debt by an additional 400 million as I mentioned by retirement of the remaining balance of those 2018 senior notes, which brings corporate level debt to 7.4 billion, which when combined with the 2017 corporate EBITDA based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, places us just under our target ratio of 4.25, as we continue to ensure we achieve our balance sheet target through the low commodity price cycle.  With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Mauricio for closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you Kirk, and to close on slide 16, you have our 2016 score card. And we have made significant progress across all the goals that we set for the organization. We have delivered on our operation and financial objectives, we have significantly reduced our debt profile, we have taken steps to reinvigorate capital replenishment through our strategic partnership with NRG Yield, and we continue to look for ways to streamline our organization. As I look at this score card, I want to commend the entire team for their efforts in strengthening our business. On our next call, I will outline my 2017 objectives, but for now, I will like to quickly touch upon a very important priority, GenOn. Both NRG and GenOn continued to be focused on a comprehensive strategy that maximizes value for all stakeholders. As we are at the initial stages of evaluating available options, it\u2019s too early to provide any more specificity. But please know that we will update the market as appropriate. With that, operator, we\u2019re ready to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is now open. Greg Gordon : As you think about the capital allocation for 2017, you gave us the free cash flow before growth, then on slide 9 you sort of tell us preliminarily how you\u2019re thinking about it. But when you look at the 31% of that cash that\u2019s uncommitted and you talked about the idea of a share buyback. But are there other means of returning cash to shareholders that don\u2019t necessarily result in an increase in the fixed quarterly dividend like some sort of variable dividend payment or special dividend that are on the menu of potential options? Mauricio Gutierrez : As you mentioned, we\u2019re evaluating all options. I think what I will try to do in this call since our capital allocation plan will be provided to all of you in our next earnings call is our current thinking and we\u2019re evaluating all options, just like I did at the beginning of this year in terms of our priorities and how we see the market and the economics of our portfolio.  You know we\u2019re going to do the same, so we\u2019re evaluating not only share buybacks, the dividend policy and I think the special dividends, but at this point what I will tell you is, as I think about it, I am comfortable with the dividend policy that we are - where we are today in terms of the cyclicality nature of our industry. And when I look at the share buybacks and the free cash flow particularly at these current prices, I\u2019ll have to take that in to account.  So Greg in the next couple of months we\u2019re going continue accessing the market, we\u2019re going to see our current stock price, we\u2019re going to see our leverage ratios which as Kirk indicated is right on target with our guidance that we have provided and that we feel comfortable. And we\u2019ll finalize it in a couple of months. Greg Gordon : On a totally different subject you talked about the markets, we all saw what happened in Texas this summer, you articulated it very clearly. But you attributed a big part of the lack of scarcity pricing to the over production of wind. I guess I\u2019m wondering and other people are wondering whether its right to assume that that\u2019s over production, or if we\u2019re looking at a permanent dynamic in terms of the way that wind is going to change pricing or if you actually really believe that there were dynamics that caused that whether that over production is permanent or whether there were just weather conditions that caused that? Mauricio Gutierrez : Greg I\u2019ll let Chris give you more specifics, but as I look at the data particularly when you look at the seasonal study that Texas put out. The over performance was not small, it was almost double of what we were expecting. So, I would attribute that to climatic drivers. But Chris is there anything else that you can share? Chris Moser : Yeah, I think it\u2019s fair to say that and when we went back and looked, we\u2019re pretty confident that at least for this year it was a weather phenomenon and not a miscalculation. They\u2019ve been doing the same calculations for quite some time in ERCOT. And in this case it was happened to be windy when it was hot and that\u2019s not generally the case that we see down there. So we\u2019re attributing it mostly to the weather, but we\u2019ll keep an eye on it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Stephen Byrd : Wanted to follow-up on Greg\u2019s question on capital allocation; a portion of your cash flows are contracted, actually fairly significant amount of cash flows are contracted. And when you think about approaches to return of capital, in the past there\u2019s been the thought of that that is a more stable source of cash flow.  When you think about the dividend versus share buyback, how does that factor in to your thinking in terms of the fact that a part of you cash flows come from outright contracts, a good portion of cash flows also come from retail business that proving to be very resilient. How do you think about sort of the nature of that risk and whether or not that might factor in to your dividend thinking? Mauricio Gutierrez : i think that\u2019s a good observation, because as I have said in the past, we have been very successful in diversifying our business and the way I characterize it is, two-thirds of our gross margin comes from stable sources, whether that is contracted assets, retail or capacity payments or our interest in yield. Absolutely we factor that in in terms of our approach on returning capital to shareholders, whether it is a dividend or whether it is in the form of share buyback.  So, rest assured that that is not lost on me, and as we\u2019re thinking about the capital allocation plan for 2017, we take that in to account. But I also have to access as well the current state of our stock price and take that in to consideration as a barometer for all other investments that we have in the company. Stephen Byrd : And then I wanted to shift over to the SunEdison transaction and this is a fairly bright question, but we\u2019re starting to see more companies attempt to get in to the renewables business and I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re seeing in terms of degree of competition. I\u2019m thinking more about competition more for development rather than acquiring mature assets if you\u2019re seeing any trends out there in solar wind in terms of the degree of competition. Mauricio Gutierrez : We are seeing a higher degree of competition but I think that\u2019s a good thing. And since this is the first time that Craig has joined us in this call, I think that market and all of you would benefit from his comments and insights since he is living this on a day-to-day basis. But I will tell you is, I think that opens up additional opportunities for us in terms of tax equity, other type - but Craig is there an additional comment that you want to make? Craig Cornelius : Sure. While we do see new entrants to this space both in sources of permanent equity for assets as well as development, we think the current environment actually favors incumbent players with development and operational capabilities like our own, and with a significant access to both commercial and mass retail customers as well as utility customers that we service today. So when we look at the market complexion over the next three to four years, we believe in enterprise or like around that has significant access to customers, scale and stability over almost all renewable pure-play companies, access to a competitive cost of capital through yield, that\u2019s technology agnostic and can take full advantage of cost to clients that are being realized in wind and solar.  That\u2019s advantaged by a virtue of our ownership of assets and our operational capabilities and the development platform that can address the full spectrum distributed and utility scale opportunities, exhibits advantages that smaller scale pure-play developers don\u2019t have and can benefit from the trends of additional capital formation that\u2019s being observed in the industry. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steve Fleishman : So just a question on the corporate aspects of GenOn. So in the 2017 guidance, I assume, you still have the shared services payments in the guidance, so is that still about $200 million. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, that is correct. Kirkland Andrews : Just to clarify Steve, it\u2019s Kirk. That is correct but the only place that that would really manifest itself in guidance is within that NRG level free cash flow, because obviously that\u2019s eliminated in consolidation otherwise. Steve Fleishman : Right, and do you still believe that that\u2019s most if not all of that could be offset with cost reduction in the event that went away? Kirkland Andrews : We do. And certainly a substantial portion of it would be, yes. Mauricio Gutierrez : Steve we have said it in the past and it\u2019s our belief that that would be the case. So at this point I don\u2019t any reason to provide any other indication to all of you. Steve Fleishman : That\u2019s great. And then just secondly at a high level on retail we\u2019re hearing on all the conference calls and just watching developments. Everyone that\u2019s in the power business is a lot more interested in retail, obviously you guys have been extremely successful early mover. How worried if at all should we be about the competitive dynamic heating up for you from this? Are you kind of better protected because of the Texas footprint? Just high level thoughts on that issues? Mauricio Gutierrez : So let me give you may perspective and then I will have Elizabeth provide some additional comments. When you think about retail platform, number one, I would say that we have a leading platform in the best market for retail in the United States that is incredibly difficult to replicate, particularly on the residential side.  Most of the mode that we have seen from IPPs in to the retail space has been for C&I which is a very different value proposition and it\u2019s a different approach to that market. Having said that, I always welcome new entrants in the space, because it allows us and it allows the market to provide some benchmark in terms of best practices. And I think as you said it, we were the first mover, we have benefited significantly from it. I think the fact that other IPPs are following suite is a testament of the integrated platform that we have been able to put in place and the winning formula I guess to navigate through these incredibly transition that we are going through the energy markets. But Elizabeth, is there something else that you can provide in terms of a competitive landscape as you\u2019re seeing more IPPs going in to the retail business? Elizabeth Killinger : Sure, thanks for the question. I would say our retail has extraordinarily strong momentum that\u2019s really underpinned by our scalable platform and the strength that we have in supply and risk management. And we\u2019ve demonstrated year-over-year the ability to grow in both customer account and earnings. We are talking about 20,000 to 30,000 to over a 100,000 customers a year organically in addition to some of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done over the years.  We also have a distinct approach in the market. We have a more diversified business than many of the competitors. We have multiple, very strong brands that focus on a particular customer segment. We have a variety of products, so customers can buy more than one recurring product or service from us and we also have strength both in Texas and the east. So overall with that momentum and ability to focus on the customer, have strong renewals and strong acquisition performance, I feel like we\u2019re well positioned to compete in the market place as we have done so successfully for a number of years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: A little bit of a follow-up question on the last couple, perhaps trying to get a couple of concepts here. Can you talk about at least initially the capital allocation to the renewables business? I know you\u2019ve laid out some numbers on the slides here, but can you try to tie that back in to what that means not just for \u201917 but onwards. And also what is the return profile or [EVD] with that development multiple however you want to think about in terms of the projects that you\u2019re pursuing under this 1.2 gigawatt backlog. Mauricio Gutierrez : So Julien, let me just start with the returns that we\u2019re seeing, and I gave some indication on the slide. We\u2019re looking at current operational assets particularly the utility scale mid-teens kind of yield, that\u2019s what we\u2019re targeting. Clearly on the [DG] side, those reclaims are in a slightly higher yield spend nature of the markets.  With respect to the capital allocation, one thing that is important to recognize is that these capital allocation has a high velocity of replenishment. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important and so strategic the partnership and strengthening in our yield, because all these renewable assets that are on their long term contracts are yield eligible for drop downs, which allows us to replenish the capital very quickly and at the same time achieve very attractive returns.  Kirk, is there anymore specificity in terms 2017? I think Julien wanted to get - Julien if I am not mistaken, do you wanted to get even more specificity than that? Because I think it\u2019s important to - I mean the key characteristic here is a rapid replenishment of capital. Kirkland Andrews : Julien, this is Kirk. Couple of things to know about, obviously we\u2019ve layered in or added the capital allocated in 2016 relative to the SunEd acquisition that we announced. And this true of SunEd and not when you have SunEd, but a lot of the other projects that we look and evaluate all the time in the pipeline. Certainly the long term contracted nature of this project lends itself to significant levels of their capacity. In some cases the existing project level debt, like was the case in fact with CVSR which is what helped facilitate the capital return through sort of a two-pronged effect that was optimizing the leverage on the one hand and increasing that which gave proceeds back to NRG, and ultimately dropping that asset down the yield.  We\u2019re basically able to mirror that same approach by taking advantage of the significant debt capacity first which certainly reduces the amount of equity capital and that\u2019s really what we refer to when we talk about capital allocated to renewables.  As Mauricio says, because that\u2019s relatively low capital intensity given the high degree of leverage capacity, so fine with the fact that we\u2019re going to have line of sight of a healthy and robust [CASD] yield, it gives us good line of sight that we can continue our relationship with NRG yield, we compensated for taken up development and construction risk and still provide yield and opportunity for an acquisition, providing us that premium income to compensate us for the risk and still delivering accretion to yields. So that\u2019s really overall how we think about the ongoing model. Not only is it a high velocity return, it is relatively low capital intensity because NRG\u2019s capital allocated is simply to the equity side of that equation. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, but what\u2019s the total equity commitment for next year? And then just to go back to very quickly - we\u2019ll I\u2019ll leave it at that. And then a separate follow-up question would be, you\u2019ve also talked about retail and your \u201917 guidance shows a pretty healthy amount of continued retail. Obviously there have been some good tailwinds. Can you explain the dynamic about keeping this very high level of retail? Kirkland Andrews : I may offer a little of the opportunity to expand my response on retail. What I tell you with respect to 2017, and we\u2019ll roll this out certainly in greater details and Mauricio said, when we expand on our capital allocation plans. But the overall amount of capital there that\u2019s represented in that percentage on the slide relative to renewables is relatively small. And by that I mean probably 10% to 20% of that at most right now is renewable investment. The balance of that is majority of our ongoing efforts in particular, some of the repowerings for the conventional projects which are also yield eligible.  So the capital there is about 20% at most is currently the renewable committed capital within that. And again that\u2019s a by-product of what I talked about before. It lends itself to a high degree of leverage, which means that the capital required from NRG is relatively small on a per megawatt basis.  As far as retail is concerned, touching on some of the points that Elizabeth made a few minutes ago. Our diverse product backlog or offering I should say combined with the diversity of different channels through which we market give us a high degree of visibility and the resilience of that customer base, combined with the fact that obviously on the one side as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019re continuing to see us especially most acutely in 2017 in that low commodity price cycle that\u2019s obviously beneficial on the retail side of things as manifested this year and we certainly see that given the outlook for commodity prices going in to \u201917.  But Elizabeth anything you would add there? Elizabeth Killinger : Yeah, the only thing I would add is, we have continuous improvement mindset in retail as we do with all of our for NRG efforts across the company, and so some of the improvements that we experienced this year are in cost efficiencies and we definitely carry those forward. And so that combined with our expertise in managing margins and growing customer account any will best have confidence that will continue to be able to deliver at that high level of EBITDA and cash flow performance. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: It\u2019s principally margin not customer account? Elizabeth Killinger : No, it\u2019s both. I mean so far year-to-date we\u2019ve grown a net of 40,000 customers with over 70,000 of those being in Texas, and we are striving to always balance EBITDA and customer account. But when we see that kind of growth year-over-year that does contribute to our earnings as well. Mauricio Gutierrez : But Julien if I can just - because I get this question almost every year, the stability of retail margins. And I think this is the seventh year of ownership and we have delivered consistently. And not only delivered the retail margins but growing it. So I\u2019m hopeful that we have earned your trust that this is a stable business and that we have the formula to continue having these margins for the foreseeable future. Operator : Our next comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Angie Storozynski : I wanted to ask about this big drag from the working capital that\u2019s showing in your guidance of free cash flow in \u201917 at slide 43. Can you tell me a little bit more about that 240 million and also how much of it is a one-time issue and how much of it should I account for when I estimate your free cash flow going forward? Mauricio Gutierrez : Okay Kirk, why don\u2019t you take that one? Kirkland Andrews : Angie, we came in to - this as much a year-over-year impact if anything else. We came in to 2016 with a significant surplus of coal inventory. It gave us the opportunity to right-size that coal and as you know as we burn what was on that pile a little bit more disproportionately than in years past because of that high level of inventory. And as we move in to 2017 that\u2019s just a little bit of the natural rebuilding or recalibrating towards that. I would say that I can\u2019t give you the number off the top of my head, but I think that\u2019s probably a little bit of a high watermark. I wouldn\u2019t say we return to just double-digit usage of working capital, but certainly over 200 million is a little bit of a high watermark in terms of the outlook, right. We\u2019re recalibrating the inventories there and some of that coal burn it\u2019s a (inaudible). We had at least one plan or a couple plans in our portfolio where we were in the process of transitioning from coal to gas and burning through that. So a lot of that is why that is exacerbated in sort of the year-over-year change in working capital. Angie Storozynski : Okay, but you also mentioned some other issues right, the asset, the activation charge etcetera, etcetera at least those should be going away right? Kirkland Andrews : Yeah, but that\u2019s not as such the deactivation charge in the context of working capital. What I\u2019m saying is, in 2016 a lot of the positive benefits from working capital is just that we literally took the coal powers down at those plants we are converting to gas, basically down to zero during that period of time.  So that really speaks to the year-over-year variance, not specifically to the working capital we use that you see in 2017. That\u2019s the only distinction I was drawing there. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then I know you\u2019re not providing a long term guidance, but in the past you\u2019d said that 2017 would be the weak point of your earnings from an EBITDA perspective. Is this still true? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yeah, I think that\u2019s a fair representation Angie. If you look at just the commodity prices in 2017 and the dynamics in terms of capacity revenues and energy margins and where natural gas is today and the roll up of hedges, I believe 2017 to be the low point. Operator : And last question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Shahriar Pourreza : Can we just real quick on this SunEdison the 1.1 gigawatts, can you just talk about how much of that sort of has a PPA and whether any portion of that 1.1 needs to be built within a specific timeframe or the PPA expires. Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure, I\u2019ll let Craig take on that. Craig the pipeline the 1.2, just some general characterization of that. Craig Cornelius : Sure. And we\u2019ve provided more detail about the asset mix on page 30 of the appendix, and I\u2019ll speak from that as a prompt. One of the projects we expect to take in to construction over the course of the next 18 months is a project in Texas, on which we would expect to close later this month and then commence construction during the course of the next two quarters.  That project has completion date that would be targeted in the first half of 2018. The balance of the pipeline is to be contracted, 111 megawatts worth of that pipeline is largely construction ready and actually was previously contracted.  We\u2019re in discussions around the targeted timeline for that mix and the balance of the pipeline is at various stages of development, and based on its progress in terms of permitting and interconnection and power marketing opportunities and how that pipeline compares to other potential uses of development and equity capital, we would look to advance those projects, but it\u2019s reasonable to think of those projects as 2019 or 2020 type COD assets. Shahriar Pourreza : And then just on the [48] gigawatts in Texas. It\u2019s a good color but it\u2019s still a bit of a widespread, so what\u2019s driving that range? Is it sort of your assumptions around gas or is it a function of environmental policy, just may be a little bit of color what\u2019s driving the bottom and top end of the 4 to 8? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yeah, the 4 to 8 gigawatts that are at risk right now, I think most of them is on controlled units, on scrub units, but Chris do you have more specificity? Chris Moser : I think it\u2019s fair to say that its relatively cloudy, we\u2019re still waiting to see if TXU is going to do something. The environmental rigs are up in the air being fought out in the courts. And honestly I\u2019m not sure that we had Clear Lake as one of the ones that we thought was going to be shutting or if you would have backed up three or four quarters ago, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d have had Greens Bayou 5 on it either. So I think there\u2019s an abundance of caution when we throw a number out there. I think that\u2019s as much as anything. Operator : At this time, I\u2019m showing no further questions, I would like to turn the call back over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you. And appreciate very much your interest in NRG and with that we conclude the earnings call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s program. This concludes. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

Analysts: Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Antoine Aurimond - UBS Securities LLC Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NRG Energy, Inc. 4Q 2016 Earnings Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin. Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Vince. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's full year and fourth quarter 2016's earnings call.

Now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you, everyone, for your interest in NRG. Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. Before I turn to our presentation, I would like to acknowledge Howard Cosgrove and Ed Muller for their years of service as directors on the NRG board. I want to thank them for their dedication and wish them well in their next endeavors. Let me also congratulate our current Director, Larry Coben, on his appointment as Chairman of the Board. I'd also like to welcome our two new board members, John Wilder and Barry Smitherman. I look forward to working with both of them on all of the exciting opportunities ahead for NRG. 2016 was a pivotal year for our company. Just one year ago, I made a commitment to simplify our business, strengthen our platform and restore confidence in our direction and decision making. We have made significant progress on all fronts. Today, NRG is in a much better place to continue executing on our multiyear strategic plan to solidify our position as the premier integrated power company in the country. Let's move now to slide 3, where I'd like to summarize the key highlights from today's call. First, we delivered on our numbers. Our track record of strong results and execution continued in 2016. We had our second best safety performance year on record and our integrated platform delivered earnings that were even stronger than last year. We grew both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth despite the difficult commodity price environment that reduced our total generation by 14% from 2015. Our Retail business delivered its third consecutive year or EBITDA growth with a record adjusted EBITDA of just over $800 million. NRG's best-in-class platform has again demonstrated its ability to provide strong, stable results despite challenging market conditions. For these reasons, I'm also able to reaffirm our 2017 financial guidance. I want to thank all my colleagues for a job well done on a very successful year. Second, we executed on our priorities. Our focus over the past year in simplifying and streamlining our business resulted in over $0.5 billion in cost reductions. We made progress in repositioning our portfolio by selling assets at value, and executing several capital projects on time and on budget. We strengthened our balance sheet by reducing corporate debt by $1 billion and extending $6 billion of debt maturities well beyond 2020. Last, we reinvigorated our strategic partnership with NRG Yield by putting in place a dedicated management team and expanding our Renewables business and ROFO pipeline. Third, we're not done yet. As we closed out the first phase of deleveraging, cost cutting and business optimization efforts, we now turn to the next phase of our plan. We're in a much better position today to benefit from market opportunities than we were one year ago. But before discussing details of our 2016 results and 2017 plans, I want to remind you of what underpins our continued strong results and sets NRG apart from others in the industry on slide 4. NRG's differentiated business model is simple and focuses on our competitive advantage; the integration of Generation, which includes Renewables and Retail. This integrated platform and the touch points between these primary businesses allow us to capture operational and commercial synergies in a way that makes the whole of our business greater than the sum of its parts. NRG's unique value proposition centers on stability. Our diverse portfolio minimizes our exposure to market and fuel-specific downturns, while our diverse business lines create a stable base of free cash flows, particularly the natural hedge between Retail and Generation. In 2017, we're estimating the three-quarters of our gross margin will come from stable sources, such as retail, contracted assets, including NRG Yield, and capacity revenues. We have built a business that is not dependent on commodity prices to deliver strong results, but that remains well positioned to benefit from upside in a commodity market we cover. As we manage our business for stable, visible free cash flows, we maintain the ability to grow and quickly replenish capital. We achieved these through our strategic partnership with NRG Yield, which serves as another unique differentiator of our business and is an important driver of our ability to participate in the growing Renewable segment. Turning to slide 5, I want to reiterate my belief that the competitive power sector is in a period of unprecedented disruption. Changes in fuel mix, consumer preference, technological innovation and increased distributed generation have put pressure on the traditional IPP model, particularly as commodity markets continue to weaken. While sufficient at the outset of competitive markets, I believe the IPP model is now obsolete and unable to create value over the long term. On our fourth quarter call last year, I highlighted the six elements that I believe are now required to succeed in the competitive power sector. These, starting with excellence in operations and execution; diversification, both in terms of Generation portfolio and business lines; and a scalable platform for growth. NRG was already strong in these three areas and the results achieved throughout the past year further confirm this assessment. So, our focus turned to the remaining three attributes. First, we needed to ensure that we were operating a platform efficiently. This meant simplifying by focusing on our core Generation and Retail businesses and divesting from non-core and underperforming businesses. Furthermore, we focused on reducing costs, taking over $0.5 billion out of NRG's total cost structure. These combined efforts have greatly strengthened our business compared to where we were one year ago. The remaining attributes required implementing a more flexible, transparent approach to capital allocation and achieving a more resilient capital structure given the sustained low commodity price environment. As a result, we refocused a substantial amount of our capital to deleveraging in 2016, freeing up additional capital by adjusting our dividend policy. Importantly, we also changed the way we allocate capital for growth by refocusing on projects that offer high returns and quick paybacks. Going forward, you can expect the same discipline we brought in 2016 to be applied to the next phase of execution. And I will continue with my philosophy of no head scratchers when it comes to understanding how we allocate capital. And with a focus on the new Business Review Committee well aligned with our strategic priorities, we look forward to its role in our review process and the continued execution on the three priorities outlined here. Turning to slide 6, I'd like to provide you more detail around our cost reduction initiatives and the next phase of our plan as we move into 2017. I am very pleased to report that not only have we already achieved our $400 million total cost savings target, we have exceeded it, reducing our total cost by $539 million compared to our 2015 baseline. Reducing our cost was not just the focus of management, but a focus of all employees throughout our organization, and I am very pleased with the progress we have made to date. My promise to you was to not only hit our targeted cost savings, but to report our savings in a way that was more transparent and held us accountable. The left side of the page is a view of our total cost structure, sales and marketing, G&A, O&M and development. As you may recall, last year we combined all of our cost savings initiatives under one comprehensive program, but you can still track individual items in our 10-K disclosures. With our current target met and exceeded ahead of our initial timeframe, we continue on our focus on streamlining and optimizing our business. We are already working on our next round of forNRG cost-cutting initiatives. But given the scope of the Business Review Committee, it is appropriate to delay a public announcement of the new set of targets until later in the year. Now turning to slide 7, as I discussed earlier, the breadth and scale of our platform is a clear competitive advantage. But I also understand that it can complicate the ability to properly unpack our cost structure. The objective today is to help further simplify the investment proposition by enhancing the visibility into our cost structure. While I will discuss the highlights in the slide, the full detail behind these numbers can be found on the appendix of today's presentation and will map to our 2016 10-K disclosures. As I'm sure you're all aware, comparing costs from one company to the next can be challenging. So before I get into detail, let me put more context around this analysis. First, given the business and technology diversity that drives our integrated platform, benchmarking NRG's consolidated cost to those of a pure IPP is simply not correct. So, in our disclosure, we have isolated the cost structures within each of our reported businesses as a means to compare our cost to appropriate peer companies. Second, costs are somewhat fungible between different categories. And even within the small competitive power group, there are notable differences in cost categorization. To account for this difference, it is important to capture these combined costs, both expensed and capitalized, to fully appreciate a company's baseline cost structure. Now, going into the detail on each of our segments. In Generation, I want to remind you that our current Generation business is the result of consolidating four generation companies over the past five years, NRG, RRI, Edison Mission, and Mirant. And during this time, significant cost synergies were realized as part of the integration efforts. This discipline continues today, and on an adjusted basis, our Generation segment carries a total cost of almost $50 per kilowatt, a number that is slightly lower than that of our closest peers. For this business, we focus on $1 per kW metric given that a substantial portion of our fleet in the Northeast is reliability focused, capturing significant capacity and scarcity revenues, while generating a lower number of megawatt hours. In addition, to maintain comparability, we have backed out cost associated with our nuclear unit ownership that NRG is the only competitive power generator with this higher fixed cost, lower fuel cost technology. While our generation cost per kW are in line with our peers, we're continually focused on driving further cost savings by improving upon efficiencies in fleet operations and asset optimization efforts. Next on Retail, with nearly 3 million customers, most of whom are residential customers located in Texas, NRG operates the leading residential retail platform in the country, and the stable margins from Retail are an important driver of our free cash flow each quarter. Our Retail business maintains a relentless focus on meeting evolving customer needs and on continuous improvement, which have driven expansion of both our customer base and earnings. Benchmarking cost in Retail is difficult given the differences in customer, product and regional mix from one company to the next, and because other retailers provide little visibility into the breakdown of their cost structures. Finally, moving to Renewables, as I highlighted earlier, Renewables are a pillar of our growth and portfolio repositioning. Today, NRG, together with NRG Yield, has one of the largest renewable energy platforms in the country, and we're able to leverage our expertise within our other segments to continue to develop and operate this fleet. The operating cost as reported for NRG's Renewables segment is $91 per kW. But important to note, this includes assets such as the Ivanpah concentrated solar thermal facility, which has a higher cost structure given the emerging nature of this technology. The more appropriate metric is that of our combined Renewables segments in NRG and NRG Yield, which captures the full cost structure of our renewables operations across our entire fleet. This combined view cost of $67 per kW, as you can see, is in line with peers, and we continue to improve. Since we reintegrated our Renewables group last year, we have driven further improvement in this area through transitioning large portions of our fleet to sales performance of O&M. Additionally, we are focused on adding simpler mainstream technologies to our fleet with a core focus on utility-scale solar, which can be operated at $20 per kW and utility-scale wind at $50 per kW. As a result of these initiatives, you should expect our Renewable cost structure to step down over time. The goal of the disclosures is to provide you greater visibility into our overall cost structure and the metric that you can compare to peers. But what I want to make clear is that being in line with peers does not mean we're done looking for areas to improve. Assessing and reducing our costs is an ongoing process and we will always aim for increased position. Now, on slide 8, I'd like to provide a summary of the many ways in which we repositioned our portfolio during the past year. As part of our normal course of business, we put our entire portfolio through a rigorous review process. The result can lead to everything from fuel conversions to asset sales, to realigning our portfolio to the most compelling market opportunity. In 2016, we took significant steps to strengthen our generational fleet. We sold four assets at value for $550 million, exceeding our original target by 10%. We modernized our fleet and converted 2.2 gigawatts of coal plants to natural gas, benefiting from lower gas prices and capacity revenues. We brought online our first of a kind carbon capture facility, Petra Nova, on time and on budget. We pursued growth opportunities in both conventional and renewable plants, looking for areas of quick capital replenishment as highlighted by the 1.5 gigawatt renewable portfolio acquisition from SunEdison that we closed last year. For this transaction, we have already recovered 100% of our total utility-scale purchase price, with just the first 265 megawatt dropdown to NRG Yield. This means we have over 1 gigawatt of projects in this portfolio at effectively zero cost. Looking forward, we will continue our rigorous review process, assessing the current market and developing solutions that optimize our fleet and strengthen our platform. I would expect these to include further asset dispositions at value. Turning to slide 9, I want to provide an update on our Capital Allocation Plan. As I laid out on the fourth quarter call of last year, my primary objective for capital allocation was to ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital, and provide our shareholders with greater visibility into our capital allocation decision making. In an effort to begin to better align to the market cycle, the transition in capital allocation mix between 2015 to 2016 reflects the recognition that we needed to focus our efforts more on deleveraging, and leave no doubt on our ability to withstand a prolonged period of low commodity prices. For 2017, we will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and pay down debt, expanding our current program with an additional $200 million through the end of this year. Approximately 70% of every dollar we allocate will go toward this effort as we aim to maintain a cycle-appropriate level of leverage. This will ensure we have the financial flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities when the market recovers. We will also continue to pursue low-cost options for growth where we have an ability to generate the strong returns in a relatively short period of time, which can be viewed as temporal capital for NRG. So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk now for the financial review. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on slide 11, before I review the full-year results, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a change we've made to both our segment disclosure for 2016 and our guidance breakdown. We're now combining both Mass Retail and Business Solutions into a single Retail segment in order to bring all of our direct customer-facing businesses together as a single segment. Business Solutions, which consists of our C&I, demand response and other B2B initiatives, was previously part of the Generation segment. Our results for 2016 as well as our guidance for 2017 now reflect this change, which we believe will provide greater clarity of disclosure in helping our investors better understand the NRG value proposition. Turning to 2016 financial results, NRG delivered $3.257 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Our results highlight the benefits and resilience of our integrated platform as the low commodity price environment helped Retail deliver $800 million in adjusted EBITDA. Mass Retail contributed $755 million of this total, in line with the midpoint of our latest guidance for Mass Retail, which was announced on our third quarter call. Generation and Renewables achieved $1.547 billion in adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield, aided primarily by robust wind conditions through the year, contributed $899 million. We ended 2016 having completed $1 billion of our $1.4 billion corporate debt reduction program, the balance of which is part of our 2017 capital allocation to retire the remainder of our 2018 bond maturity. When combined with the retirement of our convertible preferred and the extension of corporate debt maturities at more favorable rates, including the recent refinancing of our term loan, which occurred in January, our deleveraging efforts have generated in total almost $100 million in annual interest and dividend savings, significantly improving NRG-level free cash flow. Earlier this month, NRG received $128 million in net proceeds from a new, non-recourse HoldCo debt financing at Agua Caliente. In addition, NRG and NRG Yield have now entered into an agreement to complete the dropdown of a 31% \u2013 of 31%, rather, of NRG stake in Agua Caliente as well as the Utah solar assets acquired late last year as a part of the SunEdison transaction for a total of $130 million. Having previously realized $48 million in financing proceeds from additional debt financing for the Utah solar assets late last year, these 2017 transactions, which I'll review in a greater detail shortly, are expected to result in additional cash proceeds to NRG of over $250 million, increasing 2017 capital available for allocation. Next, I'd like to briefly address an element of our 2016 results outside of EBITDA and free cash flow, the non-cash impairment charges of $1.2 billion incurred for the year. Over the course of 2016, we impaired a number of assets due to changes in the market affecting these specific projects for a total of approximately $300 million through the third quarter. And in addition, on an annual basis, we tested our long-lived assets and goodwill for potential impairments. Given a prolonged low commodity price outlook, we adjusted our long-term view of power prices, which resulted in additional non-cash impairment charge of approximately $900 million, consisting primarily of a write-down of certain fixed assets in California, Texas, Pennsylvania, as well as the remaining goodwill on the Texas assets. This non-cash impairment charge has no impact on EBITDA or free cash flow, and we are reconfirming our guidance for both 2017 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for growth. Turning to slide 12 to review our plans on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation, we expect approximately $1 billion of capital available for allocation at the NRG level in 2017, which represents excess capital beyond our minimum cash reserve for liquidity that supplements our corporate credit facility. 2017 capital available for allocation consists of the excess cash balance at the NRG level at the end of 2016, supplemented with the closing of the Agua Caliente financing in February, plus the midpoint of our 2017 NRG-level free cash flow before growth guidance as well as the proceeds from the dropdown of the Utah utility solar assets and the 16% interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield of approximately $130 million, and that is expected to close this quarter. We expect to allocate approximately 70% of NRG-level capital in 2017 towards further debt reduction. This consists of non-discretionary debt amortization of both the NRG term loan and the payments to the counterparty in connection with the Midwest Generation monetization transaction in 2016, which are treated as principal payments from an accounting perspective. The balance of capital toward debt reduction is discretionary and consists of $400 million toward the retirement of the remainder of our 2018 maturity, which was previously committed, plus an additional $200 million towards more corporate debt reduction, which we are announcing today. We will remain flexible as to the tenure of debt to which this additional $200 million is allocated. However, the most likely scenario is we will deploy this capital toward retiring the remaining balance of our 2021 senior notes. These notes are currently callable and the call price will step down again in May. Prior to this allocation, we're already on track to achieve our target debt ratio in 2017, which we continue to see as a trough year based on the forward curves. This additional debt reduction not only further strengthens our balance sheet and extends our nearest unsecured maturity to 2022, it also represents an attractive risk-adjusted return. We plan to hold our dividend at its current rate of $0.12 per share on annualized basis, representing about 4% of our capital for allocation. And finally, in 2017, we expect approximately $185 million of growth investments, primarily consisting of our investments at Bacliff, Puente, Carlsbad, and the remaining capital required for the Petra Nova project. Turning to slide 13, I'd like to provide some further details on the dropdown transactions and related financings, which highlight in particular the rapid return of capital achieved from the SunEdison transaction as Mauricio mentioned earlier. Looking at the left half of the slide, as I mentioned, we have already closed on additional project-level financings for both the Utah solar assets we acquired as a part of the SunEdison utility-scale transaction, as well as our 51% stake in Agua Caliente. When combined with the expected proceeds from the dropdown of our equity stake in Utah as well as a portion of our stake in Agua Caliente, which we expect to close in the current quarter, total proceeds from these transactions to NRG is approximately $300 million. In connection with the dropdown transaction, NRG and NRG Yield also agreed to expand the ROFO pipeline to include two additional assets from the SunEdison transaction, enhancing the growth pipeline for Yield and expanding potential capital replenishment for NRG. Looking at the right half of the slide, and importantly, less than six months after closing the SunEdison utility-scale transaction, NRG is on track to replenish more than 100% of the total purchase price, while retaining a zero-cost option on the balance of that portfolio, which includes both the late-stage pipeline, which is now part of the expanded NRG Yield ROFO, as well as more than 1 gigawatt of additional opportunity. As shown on the lower right of the slide, the proceeds from the Utah solar debt financing, which closed late last year, and the Utah solar portion of the NRG Yield dropdown, which will close shortly, total $129 million, exceeding the price paid for the entire SunEdison transaction by $5 million. And finally, slide 14 provides an update on corporate credit metrics. Starting with 2016, having repurchased a portion of our 2018 and 2021 notes during the fourth quarter, we've completed our 2016 delevering objectives driving corporate debt to $7.8 billion. Based on the midpoint 2016 guidance, this implies a corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio of just over 4 times. Turning to 2017 metrics, having now allocated that additional $200 million in corporate-level debt reduction, total corporate-level debt reduction in 2017 is just over $600 million, putting us on track to reduce corporate-level debt to $7.2 billion. When combined with 2017 corporate EBITDA based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, this now implies a 2017 debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.13 times. Importantly, while our target ratio is based on gross corporate debt to EBITDA, for comparative purposes, I've now added the implied net debt to EBITDA ratio at the bottom of this table, using actual corporate-level cash in 2016 and implied year-end 2017 cash by adding the current balance of unallocated 2017 capital with the year-end 2016 balance. These implied net debt ratios are approximately 3.75 times in each of 2016 and 2017. With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kirk. And to close on slide 16, I just like to summarize our main priorities as we move into 2017. You may notice similar themes to last year. This is because our focus on continuous improvement and our strategic objectives remain the same. We will continue to work towards perfecting our integrated platform, seizing market opportunities to grow, and demonstrating leadership in the competitive power sector. And we will enhance our business by remaining focused on operational excellence, reducing costs, strengthening the balance sheet, and repositioning our fleet. We continue with the process of seeking a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, where we are in active dialog with bondholders, and expect to provide more clarity next quarter. With a solid foundation put in place this year, we can continue on executing our strategy to drive greater shareholder value in the months and years to come. So with that, operator, we're ready to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our first question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for the additional disclosure on the cost structure, and congrats for exceeding your cost cutting targets. Just a few questions on your SG&A, for 2017, what is built into overall guidance in terms of your overall SG&A position? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Let me turn it to Kirk, specifically. But for 2017, on our guidance, we included the $400 million target that we had on our cost reduction initiatives. Is that what you wanted, Stephen, or what level of specificity you need? Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Well, I was thinking just in terms of the \u2013 just the aggregate SG&A amount for the entire company for 2017. How should we be thinking about that aggregate level in 2017? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, as we move into 2017, I think when you look at the additional disclosures that we have on the, I believe it was, slide 6, for 2016, you should expect that we're going to continue to focus on reducing our cost structure overall. And at the very least, when it comes to SG&A, not only we're going to hold the line, but as I mentioned on my prepared remarks, I think it's difficult given the initiative that we're going to go through in the Business Review Committee to put a specific target as we have done in the past. So, I hope that you all indulge us with holding on to, I guess, the direction that we have provided in terms of our new FORNRG program, our new cost initiatives. But there is a lot that we're going to go through in the next couple of months in revising our entire businesses around the company. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very much understood. Shifting gears over to something you mentioned in your remarks about asset dispositions. You mentioned that there's potential for additional asset dispositions. Without getting too specific, what types of assets should we be thinking about in terms of the most logical candidates for disposition? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: I mean, I think it's similar to what we did in 2016. I mean, we went through a very thorough review process on assets that were not necessarily core on specific regions, that were single assets that have been underperforming. But the most important thing to me is, if we can actually monetize assets at value. And that's what we're going to be focusing on, on the next steps of asset dispositions. As I've said in the past, we ended up with a portfolio of close to 50,000 megawatts of generation through a number of acquisitions, and it is the time now to be pruning around that portfolio and to recalibrate and resize that portfolio. But we will only do that if we can actually monetize assets at value, like we did last year where we set a target of $500 million and we came in a little over $550 million. So, I think that's how you should be thinking about the asset optimization efforts going into 2017. And of course, I mean, now that we have a new framework around the Business Review Committee, we will have a conversation about single assets. But every part of our business and \u2013 evaluate that and make a determination in the next couple of months, which I will be in a position to announce to you later in the year. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very good. I'll give time for others. Thank you very much. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Stephen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Your line is open. Antoine Aurimond - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys. This is Antoine actually covering for Julien. How are you? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good. Good morning. How are you? Antoine Aurimond - UBS Securities LLC : Good. First, can you expand a little bit on where the incremental $139 million savings were made, both in terms of O&M versus SG&A and also by business unit? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. So, the first thing I think it was important to \u2013 as we go in through this period of asset rebalancing and asset optimization, I feel it was important to provide you with the total cost reduction on the platform, and not only focusing on one specific category. So, what we attempted to do was provide you with the entire cost platform of the company. Some of the additional cost reductions happened around asset dispositions that we've made. And it is important, as we go in through this asset rebalancing, that we have the transparency to provide you the level that you need to be able to compare where we were before and where we are today. I will also say that a lot of the over-performance happened just across all the different categories; SG&A, O&M, selling and marketing. So, there is not just one area to pinpoint. But I think it was, as I mentioned, completely across the organization. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: And just to add on \u2013 it's Kirk. I mean I think this is part of one of the pages that Mauricio spoke to in the total cost comparison versus the baseline, on which those cost targets were set. This is what we achieved in 2016. And I think we had about $130 million in SG&A and marketing savings, about $300 million in O&M, and another $100 million of rounding in development. If you recall, I mean our original target of $150 million, as we said in the reset, which was a part of that $400 million, was to come from G&A, marketing and development. So pursuant to what I just described, the combination of those two elements in terms of savings between the baseline and 2016 is more like $230 million. So, that gives you a directional sense of at least where that component of the overage came from. Antoine Aurimond - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. And on the $400 million of excluded part of the Generation business, how much of that is non-recurring? And also, how do you think about your initiative of IPP going forward? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: In terms of non-recurring, and I believe you'll find a walk of that in the appendix. Always hate to refer to pages deep in the appendix, but I understand this is an important question. I think it's back on page 35 of the appendix. The only really non-recurring of that deduction is some non-cash gains or losses, and most of those are losses, related to just retirements or write-offs of small assets and inventory and the like. The bulk of that, excluding the component that we obviously left to the side that's associated with the cost of the South Texas Project, the nuclear asset, and we did that obviously for comparative purposes. We're the only IPP among the three that Mauricio had spoken to that has a nuclear asset. The remainder of that are \u2013 it's a list of different things. It's deactivation costs for deactivations that took place, obviously, those megawatts are not included; ARO or asset retirement obligation expense; the purchase accounting effect of lease accounting for some of our acquired assets that are under lease. And the remainder of that is, basically, just lease expense, which is really more of a financing charge that's largely associated with the GenOn and a subset of that is, obviously, the Midwest Gen asset. So, that's non-recurring and more just not what you think about as traditional O&M and SG&A, or maintenance CapEx. Antoine Aurimond - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Just wanted to be \u2013 sort of make sure I state the obvious and understand that the guidance you've given for EBITDA and free cash flow this year does not include anything that might result from the strategic review currently underway in terms of incremental cost reductions, asset sales, et cetera? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, Greg. Good morning and, yes, that is correct. I mean, the guidance does not include anything that will come from the review that we're going to undergo in the next couple of months. That is correct. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. So, it basically assumes the benefits you've achieved through cost cutting are sort of stable, but don't improve materially until you can give us a more detailed update on where you think you can go? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Great. And then I noticed a couple other small things on page 36, 37, 38 of the release that you both modestly reduced capital expenditures \u2013 you came in slightly below your \u2013 the last guidance on CapEx for fiscal year 2016 and also modestly reduced the CapEx budget for the next few years. And at the same time, it also looks like the fixed and contracted revenues have improved somewhat substantially, mostly out in 2020. Looks like a cumulative improvement of about $200 million. Am I observing that correctly? And I know these are not massive changes, but cumulatively, they're significant. Can you walk us through what's improved? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So, I mean, let me just start with the capacity, and part of the change is just the result that we had from the New England capacity auction. So, keep in mind that what we have here on page 36, it really reflects the latest data points that we have on capacity prices and available capacity that we sell under that. And with respect to the other small IE, we can follow up with you, because I think it sounds like you have some specific questions about CapEx and small changes. So, we can follow up with you, Greg, after the call. But if you have something specific, we can certainly address it now. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : No. That's fine. I can ask. I'll follow up later. I wanted to ask Chris a question about Texas, because you did spend some time on it in the presentation. We are expecting, obviously, a new peak in demand this summer. How much incremental supply though are we expecting to come on from incremental wind capacity this summer as well? And is this sort of still the view that under normal weather conditions that we should, would see, all things equal, a significant reduction in renewables contributing to peak demand? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: So, if I got the CDR right from December of 2016, there's about 18,000 megawatts or so that was on when they published that in the early part of December. By the time we get to the summer of 2017, they're looking at about 20,000 total, give or take. The split is 18,000-ish in the non-coastal and 2,000 and just a little bit over on the coastal side of things. Interestingly, that puts the non-coastal areas at very, very close to the CREZ limit of around 18,000. So that looks relatively full from our perspective. But yeah, I mean, we've got a chart in here. I don't remember what page it is. It's early in the section. What number is that one? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: 24. Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah, on page 24, where we've laid out some of the past peaks when we hit basically 71.1 last year. The forecast right now unadjusted is 72.9. And just to make it clear, what we could be staring at if August of 2011 comes back down around on the roulette wheel, we took the previous adder for high temperatures and tacked it on to their new one, you're pushing almost 76,000 megawatts, which would be an incredibly impressive kind of a number out there. Having said that, you've got Wolf Hollow and Colorado Bend coming on this year, two very efficient new CCGTs, which should keep things down a little bit. And then the question that you end up with, which was the $1 million question last year was, which was how much does the wind blow. The expectation that they built into the CDR is 14% and 58%, depending on whether you're talking about non-coastal or coastal. We obviously got more than that last year on the non-coastal piece, and that remains to be seen. I will say that, just one last thing, I will say that, I mean, we've seen them raise their load forecast by a couple thousand megawatts for the next couple years, which ate into the reserve margins, CDR over CDR kind of a thing, and that load growth is real. I mean that's part of the chart that we put there on page 24 as well. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. One final question, and this is a recent data point, so I don't know if you'll have an answer. But we've noticed that in the last week or two, that in some regions where you guys have power plants and some regions where you don't, that we're seeing a significant amount of coal-to-gas switching happening in real time with spot gas prices in the mid to high $2 range. And that's very different from the switching point we saw last time we were in a bear market for gas, when it was down in the low $2s. A, is that a correct observation? And B, is that just because Powder River Basin and rail costs are up or are there other factors? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: I mean, I don't think Powder River Basin coal has moved up all that much over the past time period. The last chart I saw, which was last week, had it ticking down ever so slightly. What I would say on that is you've got the Powder River Basin definitely down a little bit. But in terms of coal-to-gas switching, we haven't seen a huge change in those levels for us. What we have seen is cash gas awfully cheap, because it's going to be about 67 degrees here in Princeton today, and it's still at least by the calendar February. And so, cash gas is awfully cheap. So I think gas has come back on a little bit compared to what we saw in the earlier part of the winter where gas prices were much higher and coal was having stronger runs prior to this, call it, really mild weather. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : First, one clarification. The guidance for 2017, does that include the $400 million prior cost target or the $539 million updated number? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: It includes the full impact of the latter, the $539 million. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, the $539 million, like what, maybe just breaking, and you've kind of answered this and maybe I missed it, but on the slide, there's $71 million of plants that shut. How much is also related to the kind of like businesses that shut or exited and the like? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Beyond the savings associated with the divesture of plants, there's very little save a small amount of year-over-year change in terms of residential solar overhead. We streamlined that business and obviously changed the business model. But I'd say that number is less than $50 million in terms of overhead. The bulk of the difference, as you alluded to earlier, is just the changes associated with the plant sales, so Shelby, Seward, Rockford and Aurora. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, a question on just maybe a little clarification on the Business Review Committee, so I think per the agreement there, like an end date of August 15, is it fair to say you're targeting to complete that well before then? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, Steve, I think that's the goal. And over the next couple of weeks, we're going to meet as a Committee, start looking at every single one of our business with the benefit now of full information, including non-public information and the strategic plan that I laid out to the board last year. And I think that process, we're going to do it on an expedited basis. And one thing that it was important for me to highlight is, the areas where the Business Review Committee is going to focus is very well in line with the priorities that I laid out in 2016 and that we're continuing in 2017. So, now, we're going to have the benefit of working together with the same set of information, so we can make the best evaluation and make recommendations to the board and communicate that to investors later in the year. So, I think that an assumption that we're going to be communicating to the market before August is a fair assumption. Now, keep in mind that, I want to make sure that as we communicate the decisions to our shareholders and to our investors, we need to make sure that we don't jeopardize the execution of any of those decisions. So, I will make that determination in the next \u2013 in the coming weeks and months. But we are on a fast track to make a full evaluation of every single one of our businesses. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. Most of my questions were answered. But, Mauricio, let me ask, you guys have \u2013 and if your slide is correct on 7 \u2013 have a very competitive cost structure sort of to begin with, right. So, I'm kind of curious on what do activists seem like they're going to be able to extrapolate from this business? And maybe, is it more focused on asset sales and monetization versus further cost cut? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, two things. One, we understand that many of our investors were working with information from 2015 and partial information throughout the year. So, it is important that everybody recognizes the great efforts that we have gone through and the progress that we've made in terms of streamlining the organization and reducing costs. And this is the first step to improving our disclosures to all of you, so you can actually not only be able to benchmark us with our peers, but also hold us accountable on our efforts going forward. I mean, we may be competitive with other peers as we've put it in this additional disclosure. But certainly, that doesn't take us from our focus on continuing streamlining the organization. And irrespective of asset optimization or asset sales, this is part of who we are and this is part of the refocus of the company over the past 12 months. Now, as you can appreciate, and I think I have mentioned already that, as we go through this process, we're certainly changing and recalibrating the makeup of our portfolio, and repositioning in a way that becomes more \u2013 that is better prepared to take advantage of the market opportunities as they will present themselves. So, I think it's going to be combination of two things. One is continue streamlining the organization; and then two, repositioning the portfolio that will have an impact on our total cost structure. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. That's helpful. And then just real lastly is, you did highlight some of the stuff in your prepared remarks as far as items impacting deregulated power markets. But one of the things that appeared to be missing was sort of some of the state initiatives that are looking to maintain viability of these money-losing nuclear plants, like whether you're looking at Illinois, New York, potentially Connecticut, and obviously potential moves in Pennsylvania. So, I'd be kind of curious on getting your viewpoint there and sort of where you guys sort of fit as additional states may look to come out with their own form of initiatives. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: No, that's a great point, and I'm glad that they didn't \u2013 it didn't get unnoticed on my remarks. I will tell you that we're completely focused. We're going to be active and we're going to be vocal in defending the integrity of competitive markets. We have done that already in New York and Illinois. And wherever we see that out-of-market payments for uneconomic generation to really subsidize and slow down the most efficient mix of generation and technologies that consumers need and want, we will be there. And like I said, I mean, today New York, Illinois, and wherever that pops, we're going to be a very vocal and active proponent of competitive markets. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Terrific. Thanks, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There's no other questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Gutierrez for any closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, great. Thank you, and thank you for your interest in NRG and spending some time with us this morning, and look forward to talk to you in the next earnings call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Analysts: Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Operator : Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NRG Energy First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Liz. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's first quarter 2017 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. As this is an earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation and press release. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. Let's start today's call with our Q1 results on slide 3. Today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $412 million and reaffirming our full-year financial guidance for 2017 of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Our operational execution remained outstanding during the quarter. First and foremost, we achieved top decile safety performance, which is a testament to our ability to focus on our most critical objectives. We also maintained our focus on our key strategic priorities reducing cost, optimizing assets and balance sheet management. We announced the deactivation and mothball of 1,600 megawatts of generation, reinforcing our commitment to constantly optimize our portfolio given changing market conditions. We continue our prudent approach to growth and capital recycling with a dropdown of the Utah Solar and 31% of our interest in Agua Caliente assets for $130 million in total proceeds. And today, we are announcing the offer of our remaining 25% interest in a large portfolio of wind assets from the ROFO pipeline to NRG Yield. Finally, the Business Review Committee is well underway in its evaluation and is making good progress. All businesses are engaged and we're working diligently to provide an update to the market as soon as possible. Turning to the right side of the page, I want to take a moment to identify and explain the key drivers for the quarter and touch upon our path to full-year guidance. Kirk will provide additional details later in the presentation. Let me start with the first quarter results. As you can see on the chart, the decreasing adjusted EBITDA year-over-year was driven almost entirely by the Generation business. The roll-off of higher priced hedges that were executed after the polar vortex of 2014, lower capacity revenues in the East and a few known one-time items accounted for almost 75% of the total decrease. These items were included in our guidance as we had identified 2017 as a trough year and had guided to a lower full-year result compared to 2016. The other 25% was the result of mild weather with renewable resources and advisory fees. Taking this first quarter result and our current outlook for the year, we're now trending towards the lower half of our guidance range. We expect to update our guidance once we have more clarity on the BRC and GenOn processes. Now shifting focus to our operational metrics on slide 4, as you can see, the organization remained focused on our day-to-day operations despite ongoing internal initiatives and weak market conditions. I am particularly proud of our safety record, as we delivered another quarter of top decile performance. This is a testament to our strong safety culture and excellence in operations where 142 facilities out of 158 operated without a single reportable injury. Total generation was down 9% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by lower generation in our gas and oil units and the East coal plants. This was partially offset by increases in production from our coal units in the Gulf Coast due to higher wholesale prices. Our traditional availability metric, EAF, was up from last year following the completion of an intense two years of repowering and environmental compliance outages. Although EAF increased, it doesn't tell the full story of NRG's ability to capture value when economics justify. So we introduced our In the Money Availability metric last quarter. We believe this is an improved measure of our ability to manage and balance operational performance, margin at risk, and spend while in this low commodity price environment. Our results demonstrate our ability to have units available to capture value when it matters. In our Retail business, we continued our growth. Our sales were up in both our retail mass and C&I segments where we acquired an additional 14,000 retail mass customers over the quarter, bringing us up nearly 87,000 customers year-over-year. Although margins were down slightly due to mild weather and changing customer mix, our growth in customers and customer count helped us maintain volumes. We now turn our attention to the important summer months, and I remain confident in how we have positioned both our Generation and Retail businesses in each of their respective markets. Turning to slide 5, we outline the key trends on how we have positioned our portfolio in each of our core markets. As I've described in the past, we have come a long way in diversifying our earnings, both in terms of business lines and our portfolio composition. Today, almost three-quarters of our estimated 2017 gross margin comes from sources that are not directly correlated to the price of natural gas. This diversified base of earnings drives our platform and is enhanced by the regional strategies we take in each of our markets. So let me start with the Gulf Coast. We continue to see strong growth across the region and are encouraged by the fundamental dynamics, particularly in ERCOT. Given the energy-only market structure and integrated platform of Generation and Retail, it's necessary to mitigate price volatility and deliver sustained value. From a market perspective, given the persistent low commodity prices in ERCOT for almost five years, we do see a heightened risk of both new generation being delayed and accelerated retirements that could tighten the market sooner than expected. In the East, the market continues to be centered around capacity and providing reliability at the lowest cost. Over the years, we have pivoted our fleet to focus on reliability and benefit from capacity prices while maintaining a cheap option on energy. We continue to seek opportunities to balance our generation portfolio with more retail and enjoy the benefits of an integrated platform, but we will only do that at value while recognizing the limitations of the East retail markets today. We're also encouraged by the full implementation of the capacity performance construct in the upcoming PJM auction, which creates a natural market tightening through more stringent reliability requirements. But while we believe the market construct itself can be affected, we are concerned about the recent out-of-market payments that keep uneconomic generation from leaving the system. I will be speaking more on this in a few minutes. Finally, in California, regulatory policy continues to support the decarbonization of the state's economy with a focus on renewables, quick start gas, controllable demand and increasingly energy storage. In this market, our assets are well positioned inside load pockets and have benefited from repowering opportunities. In California, we have brought online or developed over 2 gigawatts of renewables and 2.5 gigawatts of quick start gas over the past five years. This past quarter, our Carlsbad project PPA became final and non-appealable, and construction started in February. Moving on to slide 6, the fundamentals of the ERCOT market remain strong. Load growth continues to outpace the rest of the country. On a weather-normalized basis, it has averaged over 2% over the past 12 months. And as you can see on the left hand chart, ERCOT has achieved higher peak loads with lower temperatures over the past few years. The new forecast by ERCOT for 2017 puts peak demand 2.5% higher than last year and a high demand case close to 8% that is 5,000 megawatts higher. At the same time, we've experienced energy prices for the past five years with little-to-no scarcity premium. This market dynamic is putting significant pressure on both new builds and retirements, as you can see on the right side of the page. There have been a number of delays or cancellation of projects, as developers fail to justify new investment at current prices. For example, the three thermal projects slated to come online for the summer of 2018 have not yet indicated that they have begun construction and are unlikely to achieve commercial operations prior to next summer. Now, turning to retirements, ERCOT has historically understated the actual number of megawatts leaving the system, as you can see, from the period between 2009 and 2016. Looking forward, we see the same anemic estimate for retirements in the reports, assuming only 840 megawatts between 2017 and 2022. In April, we announced that Greens Bayou 5 will go into mothball status, thus 371 megawatts alone leaving the market. And we believe that there are close to 5 to 6 gigawatts of already identified generation at risk today in the market. As we look at the future reserve margins in the high-teens, we cannot help, but think about the higher loads, less new builds and more retirements quickly tightening the market and creating scarcity conditions. In our view, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in terms of market fundamentals, but we need to see significantly better price signals before we can start deploying additional capital. Now turning to the East on slide 7, NRG margins remain challenged given low natural gas prices and new efficient generation, but we maintain our positive outlook on capacity markets, particularly in PJM, which implements the first 100% capacity performance auction later this month. In this construct, the higher reliability requirement will create challenges for the megawatts that cleared in previous auctions as base capacity, including less reliable generation and demand response. These resources will have to make a decision between taking themselves out of the market or pricing in a higher reliability premium. While we see positive changes like the capacity performance construct in PJM and other East markets, we are concerned about increasing activity by the states to undermine the integrity of competitive markets. Out-of-market subsidies and contracts distort pricing that was needed to attract new capital investment, but often raising prices for the end users. We and a number of other parties have filed legal challenges to the nuclear subsidies in both New York and Illinois because we believe they're not legal and because regulators should focus on crafting competitive solutions for public policy objectives. We are encouraged by the support from PJM, its market monitor, other generators and consumer groups. You can expect NRG to continue to be a leader in these efforts to protect the well functioning of competitive markets. So, with that, I will turn it to Kirk to talk about the financial results for the quarter. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to financial summary on slide 9, NRG delivered $412 million in adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter, Generation and Renewables delivered $95 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield contributed $133 million and $184 million. As Mauricio discussed earlier, our first quarter results relative to 2016 were impacted by a combination of expected changes as well as other unexpected variances. As shown in the chart in the bottom half of the page, approximately 75% of the quarter-over-quarter change in EBITDA was anticipated and occurred in our Generation segment. The majority of this anticipated variance was a result of the impact of lower realized energy margins including the roll-off of higher priced hedges in 2016 combined with the one-time impact with the sale of emissions credits. The remainder of this expected change in the Generation segment was due to a combination of lower year-over-year capacity prices as well as the shift of hedge revenues from 2017 to 2016 as a result of the early monetization of hedges at GenOn. The remaining quarter-over-quarter variance was primarily due to the impact of milder weather, which affected all four of our major segments during the quarter. Our Retail business was primarily impacted by lower margins resulted from a combination of milder weather and higher supply costs while both NRG Yield and Renewables saw below-normal solar insulation and wind speeds, primarily in California. The milder than the normal weather for the quarter also impacted the Generation segment, particularly in the East. And finally, we saw additional G&A expenses due to advisory fees largely associated with the newly formed Business Review Committee we established late in the quarter. Turning to the outlook for full year 2017, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for the year of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $800 million to $1 billion in free cash flow before growth. However, taking into account the first quarter results and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we are currently tracking toward the lower half of these ranges. Importantly, as Mauricio noted, this outlook does not yet reflect the impact of the BRC and GenOn processes. We anticipate having clarity on these processes and their resulting impact on guidance in the near term. Turning to slide 10 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation, having now closed on the dropdown of the Utah assets and the partial interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield during the quarter, our capital available for allocation stands at approximately $1 billion. And having now offered our remaining 25% stake in the TE Wind portfolio to NRG Yield, we are focused on completing this transaction later in the year to further augment available capital at the NRG level. Our planned capital allocation for the year also remains unchanged including approximately 70% allocated to debt reduction to further strengthen the balance sheet. We expect to execute on the bulk of this de-levering in late 2017, as we approach the maturity date of our 2018 notes as well as more attractive pricing on callable debt. With growth investments and shareholder dividends unchanged since our previous update, we continue to anticipate approximately $75 million of excess capital yet to be allocated and we'll address the expected use of this excess later in the year. Finally, slide 11 provides an update on 2017 corporate credit metrics. There are two changes to highlight since our last update. First, during the quarter, GenOn drew $125 million under the secured intercompany credit facility with NRG. NRG in turn funded this via a draw on our corporate credit facility in the same amount. The draw under the intercompany GenOn revolver was the result of a drawdown on the $125 million letter of credit posted by GenOn in support of GENMA. Although this drawdown was a result of a claim of default by the owner lessors, GENMA disagrees with the default claim and the associated drawdown on the letters of credit and is in the process of pursuing its rights and remedies. Although we view this drawdown on the NRG revolving credit facility as temporary, pending the resolution of this dispute, we have updated our corporate debt balance as well as the GenOn-level total debt to reflect the $125 million increase. As to the second change, turning to the right side of the slide, given the lower than expected first quarter results, primarily at the GENMA and REMA subsidiaries within GenOn as well as additional costs associated with the ongoing restructuring process, we are reducing the GenOn midpoint of the adjustments to our midpoint EBITDA guidance used to arrive at corporate-level EBITDA. The net impact of these changes on corporate credit ratios, however, is very minor, as our resulting 2017 gross corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio is now 4.17 times versus 4.13 times in our prior quarter update. As we began last quarter, we've also shown this ratio on a net debt to EBITDA basis, which remains under 4 times. With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kirk. And in closing, you can see on slide 13 that we have made good progress against our key priorities this quarter. With respect to GenOn, we continue to evaluate all options available in advance of the upcoming bond maturities on June 15 of this year with our primary goal of negotiating a comprehensive solution to satisfy our stated core principles. We, along with GenOn, remain in active dialog with GenOn's creditors while we continue to evaluate and pursue a broader range of possible outcomes. To that end, GenOn recently appointed a new dedicated CEO to assist in these ongoing efforts. I expect to update the market in the near term. As I look into the summer and beyond, I am confident in our ability to deliver strong results across our well diversified and integrated platform with a philosophy of continuous improvement. Thank you. And with that, operator, we're ready to open the lines for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So when I look at the slide 3 and also I look at page 9, although you haven't given specific \u2013 you haven't called out specific numbers, but it looks like weather and advisory fees could have been numbers approaching $75 million to $100 million of variance in the quarter, is that within the realm of reasonableness or not because if it is, it looks like, all things equal, you probably would have had a decent quarter, had you not had those things that were out of your control? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, Greg, it was actually around the $100 million. A quarter of that was advisory fees, and if you look at the two drivers of the remaining, it was a really the mild weather that affected Retail and Generation, and it was the lower wind speeds and solar insulation that impacted Yield and Renewables. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Right. And so on page 11, again just I think you were pretty clear, the low \u2013 slightly higher gross and net debt to EBITDA is purely a function of where the quarter came in and where you are on the guidance range. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Greg, it's Kirk. That's true with respect to the denominator because we basically adjusted out less with respect to GenOn. It's really the numerator component of that, as I indicated earlier, that we did increase the corporate debt just associated with that drawdown under the intercompany revolver, which NRG in turn funded by drawing its own revolver. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Sorry, I had to top off on the call for a second, so I missed that. What is the \u2013 can you give us \u2013 this is my last question \u2013 sort of a specific expectation for a timeline on when the business review will be complete? Should we expect that update to come in conjunction with the Q2 earnings call or if it comes to resolution prior to the earnings call with a significant enough margin of time, would you do a separate disclosure? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, Greg, I think we're making really good progress inside the BRC. As I mentioned, the entire companies are engaged, all the businesses are engaged. As you all know, we have a now (24:52) date of August 15, but we're working as diligent as we can to be able to communicate to the market as soon as possible. So if that merits \u2013 if we come to a conclusion and if that merits a standalone call before the earnings call, we will do that. My objective is to communicate that as soon as we have resolution and really not waiting for a quarterly earnings call. So if we have something to say, we're going to say it as soon as we can. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. I actually do have one more question, sorry, on Retail since you have your retail guru on the call with you. There's obviously been a significant move by your competitors to enhance their retail sales channel capabilities. We're also in an environment with very low volatility and very low pricing. Your customer count was up in the quarter, but your EBITDA results were lower. Are we starting to experience a significant amount of competition for certain types of customers and how should we \u2013 if that is a reason why (25:56) we factor that in? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Well, that's a good question, Greg. And before I pass it on to Elizabeth, just to make sure on the quarter, if you can see, we actually have milder weather and wholesale prices quarter-on-quarter were higher. So that really and naturally that compresses our gross margin, but in terms of the competitive landscape on Retail, Elizabeth, can you answer the question? Elizabeth Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.: Sure. Thank you. I appreciate the question. So I would say right now, we are not seeing any more competition than we have historically seen and NRG's retail engine is very strong. We have great momentum in both customer acquisition and retention, demonstrated really by our customer growth. Once again, we grew 14,000 customers in the quarter. Mauricio mentioned, last year in Texas alone, we grew by 87,000 customers. Every one of our competitors is looking at declines of some level and that customer growth actually mitigated the impact that we would have seen otherwise. On your question around margins, we do see some margin compression when we look at customer growth because if we decide to grow in a particular pocket, we will be willing to accept customers at lower margins if they deliver strong EBITDA, and because of our scalable platform, we're able to take on those customers and grow from there. So we do make trade-offs. I don't think that anything that's going on in the competitive dynamics is driving material compression in margin. And while we did see some compression largely associated with weather and a little bit associated with customer mix, we're still strong in our momentum at maintaining our margins and only when we take deliberate action will we see some compression, but it's going in eyes wide open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thank you very much. Elizabeth Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thanks for the question. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : (28:05) is ready now. Sorry. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Julien. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, so, quick question to the extent possible, can you give us a little bit more of a sense on how to think about the puts and takes in your 2017 EBITDA guidance as you reflect the GenOn and BRC updates? I suppose obviously being at the lower end, should we be thinking about GenOn as a net degradation and then the BRC to the extent to which that some of the cost-cutting initiatives can have an effect in the back half of the year that that could be an offset to GenOn and keep you at least at the low end, if not push you up? I'm just trying to get a sense of what the factors you would be updating here are as you think about it. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Well, I think you've mentioned the two big events that we have coming up, which is the BRC process and GenOn. GenOn clearly could have a significant shift in the composition of our portfolio. And the BRC, as we said before, their focus is \u2013 or our focus right now is on the cost initiatives, asset optimization and capital allocation, which is very consistent with how we approached our priorities last year in 2016. I think what you should expect is additional cost savings or cost reductions, just like we did in 2016 over $0.5 billion, most of it recurring. You should expect the continuation of that in 2017, but as I said before, I think we need to let the process work. I don't want to front-run it. We're all working very diligently and we're making really good progress, but I think the way you should think about it is additional cost initiatives and all the other decisions that we make will be towards creating shareholder value or maximizing shareholder value. Kirk, is there something else that you want to add? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: No, not a lot more to add, Julien. Obviously, GenOn is an outcome-dependent situation, but there are significant costs associated with the provision of shared services and inclusive of that change combined with any reasonable anticipation of any cost coming out of the BRC process, as you implied which I'd agree with, that would be certainly a net positive relative to the outlook because we haven't embedded any of that into our current outlook that underpins our guidance. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Said differently, the loss of dissynergies of the GenOn breakup, if that is indeed what ultimately happened, you have confidence that at the back half of the year, the BRC could offset that. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: I think that's fair. The combination of those two outcomes assuming any reasonable amount of cost cutting above and beyond GenOn should be a net positive vis-\u00e0-vis our outlook today. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. Second quick question, development related on the Renewables side. You added 1.3 gigs to utility scale and DG pipeline in the quarter, which seems pretty meaningful especially given some of the, I suppose, wider conversations around what you intend to do with your development renewable activities under the BRC. Can you comment what those additions were and then just talk about your commitment to the specific aspects of the business? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, the increase in the pipeline as I mentioned to you, after we integrated, post the GreenCo process, after we integrated our Renewables business and have stabilized that group, I think you can see the results here, not only with the acquisition of SunEdison, but really increasing our pipeline of projects. Keep in mind that these pipeline of projects are in various stages of development. I will say that most of them are really on an early stage development. And this is an important driver for Yield. We are a significant owner of Yield, and as we can provide more clarity on assets that we can drop down, it just enhances the value of Yield, which enhances the value of NRG. So I think that's the objective that we have and the mandate that I've given to the Renewables business. We need to continue growing that pipeline. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. It would seem as if you're talking about early stage projects and expanding capital deployment in the early stage, that would actually suggest furthering your efforts on this front as you just said, enhancing the pipeline? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: I think when you talk about capital deployment, keep in mind that most of the capital deployment around Renewables is transitory because we have said before \u2013 we have set it up as a quick capital replenishment, so redevelopment and then we very quickly turn it to Yield or sell it down to Yield to replenish capital and redeploy that at NRG. So, just keep that in mind, this is not permanent capital. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Absolutely understood. Thank you all very much. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Julien. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, hi. Good morning. Just a couple quick questions. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Mauricio. Any sense of the \u2013 how much the advisory fees are expected to be for the year, when you've kind of updated to lower half? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, as I mentioned, the first quarter was about $25 million. And what I will tell you is that it's hard to pinpoint right now the exact fees that we're going to have because it's going to depend on the outcome of both the BRC process and ultimately the path that we get to GenOn, but what we have embedded right now in our guidance is it's under $50 million. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And by itself, that pretty much gets you into the lower half per the numbers, I guess. Secondly, do you have \u2013 a lot of the hit that you were expecting this year occurred here in the Q1 even without the weather and the like. What kind of helps you \u2013 the hit later in the year is just a lot less than it was in Q1. Is that just that the hedge roll-off is not as dramatic, capacity payments get better, I guess, is there any other kind of key items that limit the hit later in the year again before BRC? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Keep in mind, as I said, the big driver here was the roll-off of high priced hedges that we actually put post the polar vortex of 2014. So if you remember, after the polar vortex, all the winter strips re-priced right after that, the 2016 and 2017 winter strip completely \u2013 or the 2015 and 2016 re-priced. And most of that \u2013 the uptick that we saw post polar vortex were exactly in the winter months. So, that's why the largest impact was in this quarter. I think as you progress in the year, that's going to subside. And the other thing that I will say is we've always identified 2017 as the trough year. So I think as you move in the outer years at current market prices, I think it's fair to assume that the outlook for commodity prices improve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : And that's without any BRC benefits and and the whole thing (35:50)? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: That is correct. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. So I wanted to \u2013 I know you are not giving us the specific date when you're going to announce the results of the pending review, but given that it looks like Texas is going to be particularly tight this year and maybe next, and you will be potentially making decisions regarding asset optimization in the markets, how do you think about it \u2013 that you would have to make those decisions before you see any type of summer-driven volatility in power prices in Texas? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I think, first of all, as I said, the BRC \u2013 well, good morning, Angie, first of all. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: And I think when you look at the focus of the BRC, one is cost initiatives. And given the low commodity price environment, I think it's fair to assume that we will continue our focus on reducing cost and that's somewhat independent of a particular season or particular summer. Of course, in every decision that we make including the evaluation of all our businesses inside the BRC, we're looking prospectively at the markets. We're looking at the current curve, we're looking at the sensitivity around it, and that's what is going to inform the decisions that we make at the BRC and ultimately the recommendations that we give to the board. So I don't think we are looking prospectively and I think that's the point that I want to make, Angie. This is not just a single point and marking a special decision against a curve. We are actually stressing different scenarios to understand the total composition of the portfolio and the sensitivity of the portfolio. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And then on the GenOn. So GenOn has the new CEO, was appointed before the upcoming PJM capacity auction. How should we think about it? Should we think that this appointment somehow changes GenOn's bidding strategies, how do you think about the way these assets should be bid into the auction given the fact that you might not operate them or own them still? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Well, Angie, I will say that the appointment of the new CEO, I think, in his responsibility is to review and be responsible for ultimately the bidding of these assets. Now we continue to provide shared services agreement including asset management, commercial \u2013 the wide range of shared services agreement that we give to GenOn, but as we have done in the past, we provide a recommendation and the commercial team gives them their perspective, but ultimately it's going to be the new CEO's responsibility to determine how that portfolio is going to be bidding to the market. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And my last question, I promise. The DOE study about the importance of base load assets, how does it play into your business review, if at all? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, I think everything is taken into consideration on the Business Review Committee. We have said in the past that one of the strengths of our portfolio is the diversity of our merit order, base load merit and peaking. So clearly, if there is something that focuses on recognizing the value of base load, then we welcome that, but I want to be crystal clear, it has to be in a way that doesn't jeopardize the integrity of competitive markets and we have to find ways to find the right competitive pricing to ensure the reliability of the system and that every single one of the resources is fairly compensated for the services that he provides to the group, and I think that has been our approach. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Angie. Operator : We have time for one last question. This question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just want to follow up on Angie's question on asset rationalization and just at a high level when you look at your fleet and you look at the market outlook today, is it your sense that there are opportunities to \u2013 or maybe not opportunities, but sort of if that it makes sense to think about some shutdowns of assets just given that they're not really economically viable or is this something we should be waiting for as part of the broader BRC update you'll provide later in the year? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, let me just start with our retirements because I've been very clear in the past. Our business is not to keep uneconomic generation running. We have retired a significant amount of generation that we felt was unprofitable and didn't have good prospects. Just last month, we retired Greens Bayou 5, 370 megawatts of capacity in Texas. And earlier in the year, we retired Pittsburgh in California. So I think the combination was close to 1,500 megawatts of generation. So when we have an uneconomic plant, we will move quickly and swiftly to take it out of the market. And of course, as part of the BRC, we're doing a holistic review of the portfolio. There are opportunities and I think we demonstrated that last year. We sold three plants. We monetized them over $0.5 billion of asset or sale proceeds. I think there is an opportunity where perhaps another counterparty has a different view on commodity markets or can create a \u2013 or looks at value differently than us and we will execute on that. But as I said, I think as part of the \u2013 with that respect, I don't want to front-run the BRC process. When it comes to asset divestitures, I think we need to let that play out. We are having good and very constructive conversations inside the BRC. And as I said before, we're moving as fast as we can because I am the first one who wants to communicate this to the market. So you have my commitment that as soon as we have something to communicate, we will tell you. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very much understood. That's all I had. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Steve. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: And thank you all for your interest at NRG. Thank you and good morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NRG Energy Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Takia. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's second quarter 2017 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes, and being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. As this is an earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation as well as risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law. In addition, we'll refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release and presentation. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. Just a few weeks ago, we announced our comprehensive and multi-dimensional transformation plan. Since then, we've had the opportunity to speak with many of you in great detail about our plan, which will better position us as the leader in the competitive power space. We are actively engaged on all fronts, and I look forward to updating you on our hard work and progress in the next quarter. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results. Also, you will know that all the financial and operational results discussed today do not include GenOn due to its bankruptcy filing. Starting on slide 4 with the summary and highlights for the quarter. Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $685 million, in line with our second quarter results from last year and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. We are also reaffirming our full-year financial guidance for 2017 for both EBITDA and free cash flow. Our integrated platform performed quite well during the quarter. Both Generation and Retail financial results were slightly lower given the mild weather experienced in the quarter and lower hedged prices. This was offset by strong results from Renewables, NRG Yield and the change in our Home Solar business model announced early in the year. We also remain focused on execution and made significant progress on our key priorities. First, we continue to execute on our capital recycling program with NRG Yield. We completed one dropdown and made two separate offers that will further strengthen that partnership. We believe these transactions highlight the renewable platform stability to enhance Yield's growth going forward, with opportunities both inside and outside of the current ROFO Agreement. Second, we announced our transformation plan, which laid out a much clear path of value for investors and will significantly strengthen and simplify our business, so that it will provide in many market cycles. And finally, we made substantial progress towards resolving GenOn. We continued to work diligently with GenOn and its stakeholders through the bankruptcy process and can report that GenOn currently remains on track to emerge from bankruptcy by the year-end. As you can see, it has been a busy several months, and I am extremely proud of all the hard work and focus that have gone into making this a strong quarter for our business. Turning to our key operational metrics on slide 5. I am very pleased with our safety performance for the quarter. We are just shy of top decile performance with 108 out of 129 facilities operating without a single recordable injury. We actually have fewer injuries year-over-year. And while these numbers are good, we will never be satisfied. The safety of our people is our number one priority, and we will continue to focus our resources on improving our safety record over the balance of the year and beyond. Performance was strong for our generation fleet. Total megawatts produced were 6% higher compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven largely by the return to service of our South Central Cottonwood combined-cycle plant following a significant flooding event in the first quarter of 2016, as well as higher coal generation. The availability of our generation fleet also increased during the quarter as we had fewer repowering and environmental compliance outages. More importantly, our fleet was available almost 94% of the time as you can see by our In the Money Availability metric. Our Retail business delivered a steady quarter driven by strong customer acquisition and retention, as well as reductions in operating costs. Both sales and customer account increased helping to offset milder than normal weather. Now moving to our key market on slide 6. Starting on the left side of the page with the ERCOT market. The fundamentals in this market are strong, and we continued to see trends that point to market tightening over the next several years. Weather-normalized demand growth in ERCOT has averaged 2.3% over the last 12 months, which is well above the flat to negative growth of every other competitive market in the country. This steady demand has been driven by strong increases in population and employment as well as new coastal demand from the industrial sector. On the supply side, we continue to see delays in new builds with actual megawatts brought online coming in well below expectations. Since the latest CDR report for May, we have seen 1-gigawatt of new generation being delayed from 2018 to later years and a new 700-megawatt combined-cycle removed from the CDR. At the same time, we're seeing continued pressure for retirements given the low prices experienced in Texas over the past several years. These market dynamics have become evident in the reserve margin calculation that indicates the tightness of market supply versus peak demand. As you can see in the chart, just in the last 18 months, reserve margins for 2018 went from the mid 20s to the high-teens. And it does not take too much in terms of additional retirements, load growth or delays to get to single-digit numbers. For these reasons, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in our opinion. However, there are changes that need to be made to strengthen the market, including marginal losses, improved locational scarcity pricing and enhanced performance of the ORDC. We will continue our work with ERCOT, the PUCT and other stakeholders to improve price formation and ensure the well functioning of ERCOT's energy-only market. Turning to the right side of our slide, I want to highlight the premium location of our generation fleet. In Texas, we have seen price separation between Houston and other areas. This is driven primarily by strong load growth in the area and transmission congestion. The Houston load pocket is where most of our generation is located, and given the drivers I mentioned, we would expect this premium to continue in the future. Turning to PJM. During the quarter, we had the 2021 BRA Capacity Auction, which was the first with 100% capacity performance requirement. As you can see on the chart, over 85% of our capacity in PJM clear in the ComEd premium zone at almost $190 per megawatt day. These are two clear examples of our plans having a competitive advantage, given their location near load pockets benefiting from premium prices. Before handing things over to Kirk on the topic of markets, I want to take a moment to reiterate NRG's strong support and advocacy of competitive markets for both retail and wholesale. We are disappointed with the rulings in New York and Illinois regarding subsidies for nuclear generation. However, there are strong grounds for appeal in these cases. We will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets and expect (09:50) both the courts and the new FERC commissioners to take a fresh look at this issue. We remain optimistic that these subsidies will be found to be damaging to both the market and to consumers as these cases progress to the core system. I will now turn to Kirk for our financial review. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on slide 8. For the second quarter, NRG delivered $685 million in adjusted EBITDA and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Total adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was relatively in line with the second quarter of 2016 and Generation and Renewables contributed $212 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield delivered $203 million and $270 million, respectively. As a reminder and as I reviewed during our transformation plan presentation a couple of weeks ago, our consolidated financial results as well as our guidance now reflect a deconsolidation of GenOn. Turning to guidance for 2017, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance ranges which are provided and updated as a part of our transformation plan rollout to reflect adjustments related to the deconsolidation of GenOn as well as the impact of $65 million in 2017 cost savings and $175 million in one-time working capital improvements from the plan. For your reference, I've included in the appendix the slide from our transformation plan presentation, which details these two adjustments to 2017 guidance. As a reminder, however, as I also indicated on the transformation plan call, our expectations for the balance of the year continue to place us at the lower end of the guidance range. On August 1, we closed the sale to NRG Yield of our remaining 25% interest in the TE Wind portfolio consisting of 12 wind projects for a total cash consideration of $41 million. In addition, we have now offered yield a 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility-scale solar assets, which are not part of the ROFO Agreement. And we have proposed the creation of the new $50 million distributed generation partnership. These potential dropdowns are subject to negotiation with and the approval by NRG Yield's independent directors. Finally, during the quarter, we successfully closed on a number of non-recourse project financings resulting in approximately $500 million in cash proceeds, including over $350 million of debt proceeds for the construction of our Carlsbad contract to cash plant in California. NRG has now repaid the $125 million outstanding balance under our corporate revolver leaving this facility now undrawn. As a reminder, we had made that draw earlier in the year to fund the corresponding drawdown by GenOn under the intercompany revolver. Although that intercompany balance remains outstanding, GenOn is required to repay the balance upon emergence from bankruptcy. And in anticipation of that event, we repaid the NRG revolver this past quarter using excess cash on hand, which we expect will be replenished upon GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy and the corresponding repayment of the intercompany revolver. Turning to slide 9 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. Our updated capital available for allocation now reflects the proceeds received from the closing of the TE Wind dropdown further increasing expected surplus capital at year-end to $170 million. As we reviewed with you on July 12, we expect to significantly build on this balance during the first half of 2018 using proceeds from asset sales which assuming a sale of 100% of NRG Yield and Renewables would help drive anticipated excess cash to just over $4 billion by the end of 2018. To complete the financial review, slide 10 provides an update on our corporate credit metrics. Having previously provided a pro forma view of these ratios based on the full impact of the transformation plan, this page focuses on our expected credit ratio for 2017 with the denominator of that ratio based on the midpoint of our guidance for the year. Our expected year-end gross debt balance of $7.2 billion continues to reflect the expected deployment of $600 million in 2017 capital previously allocated toward debt reduction, which we expect to execute later this year. Our corporate credit ratios are largely unchanged since our first quarter update and we continue to expect to achieve a net corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.7 times. As we reviewed as a part of the transformation plan, we expect to be able to achieve our target 3 times ratio by 2018 based on the EBITDA benefits of the cost savings and margin improvements. Additional deleveraging in 2018 will be necessary solely as a result of the reduction in EBITDA associated with assets targeted for sale. We intend to fund this additional debt reduction with the proceeds from asset sales, and based on a 100% sale of NRG Yield and Renewables, would expect incremental debt reduction to be approximately $650 million in order to maintain our target ratio. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kirk. And to close, I want to leave you with our priorities for the balance of the year on slide 13 (sic) [slide 12]. We have remained focused on delivering our operational and financial goals while continuing to strengthen and simplify our business. Our priorities to enhance margins and streamline costs optimize our portfolio and right-size our capital structure are now integrated into our transformation plan. And we will begin updating the market on our progress starting on our third quarter call. Also, we would expect to update the market with any material announcements regarding asset sales as they occur. As we work through these sales processes and improvements, we will also provide you a more definitive timeline for our Investor Day. I thank you for your time today and your interest in NRG. And with that, operator, we're now ready to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Hey. Good morning, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I mean, I think the quarter speaks for itself pretty good numbers. And, I guess, the only thing that's material that seems to have changed is the inclusion of the $41 million from the dropdown in the cash available for distribution. So, let me ask you a different question. I know that when you announced the transformation plan, you had indicated that some of the sales processes had already been sort of well underway while others like the process of looking for a strategic alternative for NRG Yield had been more nascent because it had only begun formally after the board approved the full transformation plan. So, can you just give us some sense of what you think the cadence of announcements will be on disposition of assets, and what we might expect to happen in the nearer term, and what we might need to sort of be cognizant of waiting for towards the end of the year? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Greg, so, as you already pointed it out, I mean, we begun some of these processes earlier in the year. They are in very advanced stages. We tried to staggered some of these sales initiatives to make sure that we access the market in an efficient way. My expectation is that the first announcements will come out in late third quarter, early fourth quarter. I don't think you should expect every single one of the announcements to be in the fourth quarter or late fourth quarter. As soon as we know, you will know. And I think that as early as the end of the third quarter, we will be in a position to update you in the processes that we started earlier in the year. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. And then on the third quarter call, we'll get a sense of how far along you are in the preliminary rounds of cost optimization as well. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Absolutely. I mean, as you know, we started the sales process earlier. So, I think we're going to begin doing that sometime in the end of the third quarter. But the cost savings and the working capital and everything else is really starting in earnest now. And I will be in a position to update you and the rest of the market in our third quarter call. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you, guys. Have a good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. You've given a ton of detail over the last month. Thank you for this, in terms of your long-term planning. And by the way, super helpful. Mauricio, you made some comments about the court cases in New York and Illinois regarding nuclear subsidies. Can you talk about two things? One, what gives you what seems like such confidence on the appellate process for those cases? And two, when you look at your own nuclear plant in Texas, how do you think about whether this is a plant that's profitable at all or not, and when that's creating cash flow versus maybe just creating earnings? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, Michael. So, obviously, we're disappointed with the rulings by the District Court both in Illinois and New York. I think that you should expect that we will appeal both to the Circuit Courts. I recognize that there are some improvements that we need to make to the market, both in terms of recognizing the attributes that each power plant brings to the system and to recognize also the impact of new technologies. But where we disagree is to have an out-of-market subsidy for one specific company in a technology that is now proven and mature that, in our view, at the expense of consumers and the integrity of competitive markets. I mean, that's really the concern. So, we think that we have a strong case and with new FERC commissioners coming in, I think there will be a fresh look, a fresh perspective on the validity of our case and the potential impact that these out-of-market subsidies can have in the competitive markets. And we feel confident that this will prevail. Obviously, I can't comment anymore because this is an ongoing legal proceeding. I mean, in terms of our nuclear plant South Texas Project in Texas, and that's true for any other plant in our Generation portfolio, we are constantly evaluating the financial health of our facilities, not only in the near-term, but in the long-term. What are the prospects, what is their profitability today and tomorrow? And I will tell you, because I think we have a pretty good track record for that. To the extent that facilities are non-operating, are not cash flow positive, we've taken steps to either improve their competitiveness or to retire them if we don't see any better prospects to that. So, I think we will, in the case of STP in particular, I mean this is something that we obviously work closely with our partners. This is not just an NRG decision only. We have other two partners and we are all focused in improving the competitiveness of our nuclear plant. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Abe Azar of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, and congratulations on a great quarter. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Abe. Good morning. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: How did you determine to remove 3-gigawatts from your 2018 reserve margin forecast for Texas? Any of these announced yet? Are you expecting these retirements before the summer or after the summer? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. This is Chris. As we're looking at it, I think one thing is very clear about the CDR and that's that it overstates the amount of new generation that's coming and understates the amount of retirements. Now, I know that Vistra has talked about Monticello and Big Brown and Martin's Lake is being challenged, and that's 5-gigs, 5.5-gigs or so. So, we haircutted that to only 3-gigs and threw it in there as an example of what we would expect to happen sometime soon. But during this summer, no. I think it's sometime post summer. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. And just to complement what Chris said, I mean, what we tried to put here was the 2018 reserve margin. So, obviously, it's post summer of 2017. So, this is a 2018 look. And we want to make sure that people understand the levers or the drivers of the reserve margin, which translate in more or less scarcity prices. So, this will give you an assessment in terms of what we're seeing in the market in terms of delays of new builds and potential retirements that can happen in the near to medium term. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Shifting gears, how much of the cost savings are expected at Retail? And can you provide examples of how you'll achieve these savings while simultaneously growing margins? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. So, when you talk about \u2013 for Retail, we have done two things. One, there is a component that is embedded in the cost savings, in the $590 million of cost savings. And then there is a second component in terms of margin enhancement of $215 million. So, I think, when you're looking at both, I think you should look at them separately, Abe. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey. My questions were actually answered. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey. Thank you, Shahriar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Mauricio, on the asset sales process, can we just clarify, are you sort of disciplining yourself to say, okay, we want deal to at least be announced in the fourth quarter by the end of this year, and if we can't get some assets across the finish line we're not going to sell them or could some of this move in to next year as well? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Ali, I mean, my expectation given where we are in the processes and the fact that we started earlier on some of them, in particular, in the conventional side my expectation is, it would have a clear line of sight by the end of the year. Obviously, we can't control the processes completely. It depends on our market response to it. But my expectation is that by the end of the year, we will have enough information to be able to provide you with our announcement on all the asset sales. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. But there's nothing to prevent \u2013 as you said, if some things are slipping into next year you're not going to stop that process. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: No. There is nothing to stop these processes. They are growing, they're growing very well. As I mentioned in the call a couple weeks ago, we've received very good response from the market so far. And I am encouraged by what I'm seeing. And I think that we'll be able to provide you something, as I mentioned earlier to Greg, as early as the third quarter call. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And on the conventional fuel side, the 6-gigawatts, are you seeing any influence from the fact that there seems to be significant amount of capacity whether it's portfolios or single assets on the market? It appears to be a buyer's market sitting from the outside. I don't know if you've seen that on the 6-gigawatt sale process. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: One thing that I think is important to recognize is that we characterize this 6-gigawatts, but these are not only assets but businesses. And these are profitable and good businesses, attractive businesses. So, they don't necessarily are competing with single asset sales completely. You should think about it as more of an integrated and comprehensive set of businesses and assets. We are seeing a lot of assets in the market, but I think what we have been able to put here is a type of asset or business that is differentiated from a single combined-cycle somewhere in the country. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Last question, Mauricio. Once the transformation is done, you're looking at an integrated platform with fossil fuel generation. Given your comments earlier, there seems to be a regulatory push towards subsidies of nuclear and renewables, ongoing subsidies of renewables. And apart from Texas, demand and load growth has been pretty flat to anemic. Does that concern you when you look at that portfolio with no renewables and this kind of market headwinds that you're going to be seeing once you're done with the transformation? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So, I think you need to look at it on a regional basis. So, in Texas, as you know, we have a very well balanced portfolio between Retail and Generation. I feel very comfortable with the amount of base load and peaking that we have to be able to manage our load obligations and our load business that we have in Texas. It continues to be a very attractive market, a very robust market as I mentioned on the call. We're not seeing any signs of a slowdown in terms of economic growth and load growth. So, I'm very comfortable in Texas. In the Northeast, given the resolution of GenOn and some of the conventional asset sales that we're going to have, post the transformation plan, we will have an opportunity to rebalance that portfolio. And while we're going to be a little longer at generation, keep in mind that that generation is within the load pocket of the Chicago area, New York City or Southwest Connecticut and that these assets benefit significantly from capacity prices that have been very robust and continue to be robust as far as 2020, 2021. So, we have a five-year runway where it gives me a lot of comfort in terms of the rebalancing of our portfolio. And, obviously, we evaluate the composition of our integrated platform every time and we see if the asset mix that we have is the right mix to manage our load. So, that's how I think about the post-transformation plan in terms of our portfolio positioning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Ali. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Neel. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: I had a question on the spread between ERCOT Houston and ERCOT North. I know it's been very healthy year-to-date, but how do you expect the Houston Import Project in 2018 to affect that spread going forward? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey, Neel. Chris here. I'll take that one. So, yeah. We've seen during work on the line some decent spreads in the real time in the day ahead especially the spring. Tapered off; now that we're in the summer, they've stopped working on it. Work will recommence here once we get into the fall. And then the question is, Houston Import Project obviously built to try and contain those spreads. Working against that might be some of these retirements in the north. Obviously, supreme load growth down in the Gulf Coast. I saw in, I think it was Megawatt Daily yesterday that Oncor reported 3.9% quarter-on-quarter growth, which is obviously \u2013 I mean, that's double what the weather norm overall Texas piece was, which I think was 2.3% for the rolling 12 months. So, I mean, look, the growth is happening. It's happening in the Gulf Coast and that's where we are. That would tend to help buoy the spreads there in spite of even Houston Import. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. And it seems like the Limestone coal plant sits right at the beginning of the Houston Import Project. So, from a nodal perspective, do you expect Limestone to trade at a premium to ERCOT North or do you expect it to kind of just stay within the zone price? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, probably a slight premium. I wouldn't say it's huge and I don't think it would look just like the Houston price, but I would say slight premium. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And the second question, Mauricio. Just thinking about the $250 million Retail margin enhancement, what base should we think of when we model the $250 million? Just from the perspective of we have retail results now, you guys are bullish to Texas generation going forward. So, if post the results, really start to materialize in Texas, then Retail should naturally come down, which isn't a bad thing. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, Neel. So, well, first of all, it's $215 million just to make sure that we're correct in terms of margin enhancement. And what I said before is, obviously, when we did the comprehensive review of our business, we not only looked at cost savings but we also look at our businesses. And particularly in Retail, we knew that there is a, in terms of the scale and scope of our retail operations, there are very few people that we can actually compare ourselves to. So, we went a little outside of the power space and we went to the retail space, in the entire retail space in other industries to see what are the best practices. And we identified two areas where we can actually improve our Retail business which we are very proud off, and I think everybody recognizes our leading position in this space. And that was building up our IT infrastructure and analytics. And I think everybody recognizes the amount of information that we have from our customers. And so, there is an opportunity here to really take our Retail business to the next level, adopting some of the best practices from other industries. I think the midpoint that you were talking about, how should we think about it. For 2017, our midpoint was around $750 million give or take. So, the way I characterize this effort is, in the last three years, we grew our business roughly by $200 million. What we're saying that is in the next three years, we are going to grow it by $200 million. This, I hope, gives all of you comfort that we have done this in the past and that's what we are targeting to do in the future. Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Neel. Operator : Thank you. And we are out of time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mauricio Gutierrez, CEO, for closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Takia. And I want to thank you all for your interest in NRG, for joining us in this call. And I look forward to talking to you in the coming weeks and months. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NRG Energy Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later , we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Takia. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's third quarter 2017 earnings call. This morning's call will be broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statement made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from the NRG perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation as well as risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation and press release. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. I'd like to start the call by highlighting the three key messages for today's presentation on slide 4. First, we are on track to deliver on the Transformation Plan objectives we laid out earlier this year. For cost savings, we're actually ahead of our 2017 target through the third quarter of this year. Second, today, we're initiating 2018 financial guidance, which I am pleased to confirm is in line with the targets provided in our Transformation Plan. Third, we are seeing a number of positive catalysts in our core markets from a recovery in ERCOT driven by asset retirements to multiple regulatory initiatives that highlight the urgency of reforming our power markets. This is certainly a time to be optimistic about competitive power. Now turning to our Transformation Plan update on slide 5, we are making good progress across all areas. We are reaffirming our full cost savings on margin enhancement targets with a run rate of $855 million in recurring free cash flow accretion by 2020. Through the end of the third quarter, we have already realized $92 million in cost savings, which means we have achieved 142% of our target for 2017. And as I told you previously, we were hard at work identifying cost savings starting early in the year. This focus on continuous improvement have led to a jump start on our plan and has enabled us to realize some of our anticipated 2018 cost savings in 2017. In addition, we're currently putting in place the foundation needed to realize margin improvements starting next year. This includes everything from finalizing strategies for expanding and enhancing offerings for customers, to streamlining transactions, to enhancing our IT systems for more sophisticated customer analytics. Our asset sales process remains on track. We are reaffirming our total proceeds target of up to $4 billion and we anticipate the vast majority of this process to be announced in 2017. With respect to our Renewables business and our interest in NRG Yield, while this is very much an ongoing process, what I can tell you is that we are currently anticipating a 100% sale of this platform. We are pleased with the level of interest that our high-quality, unique assets and businesses have created from prospective buyers. These have allowed us to move to advance stages in multiple processes and we maintain the expectation of announcing significant transactions by the end of the year. But to be clear, and consistent with our objective to maximize shareholder value, we will not compromise value for time with any of these transactions. On the capital allocation front, we remain focused on using excess cash to deleverage our business and position ourselves to take advantage of high-return opportunities in the future. Since our second quarter call, we have taken other $600 million of debt out of our capital structure, completing our 2017 capital allocation goal. Turning now to our third quarter results on slide 6, we achieved $806 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which reflects the impacts of sustained mild weather in our core markets as well as Hurricane Harvey. As we have been tracking to the low end of the guidance coming into the summer, this results had led us to narrow and lower our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. I do want to take a moment, however, to acknowledge the strong results and outlook for our Retail business, which continues improving its operating efficiencies, and customer acquisition and retention, offsetting some of the impacts of summer weather. Despite the disappointing quarter in terms of weather and wholesale pricing opportunities, we have still made significant progress on executing many key priorities. As we execute on our transformation, we have remained vigilant and focused on safety. For the quarter, we achieved a better than top decile safety performance with 118 out of 128 facilities operating without a single recordable injury. This result is a testament to the safety culture embraced by every one of my colleagues at NRG. We also continue to execute on opportunities to quickly recycle capital through our partnership with NRG Yield, closing on a 38-megawatt solar portfolio for $71 million in cash proceeds and forming a new $50 million solar partnership. In addition, we are announcing today the offer of our 154-megawatt Buckthorn Solar assets to NRG Yield. Looking ahead to 2018, we are initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Kirk will provide more details later in the presentation, but, importantly, for the retained businesses, this guidance is in line with the targets provided in our Transformation Plan announcement this summer. This is despite removing several plants that were originally included in our 2018 Transformation Plan projections and lower than expected production from the oil field associated with our Petra Nova. Now turning to slide 7 for a closer look at the key drivers this summer, we experienced very mild weather across the East and ERCOT, eliminating any opportunity for scarcity pricing. In Texas, we saw both a major hurricane and the coolest August since 2004 with cooling degree days 13% below normal. In the Northeast, cooling degree days were, on average, 8% below normal for July and August. This lack of weather resulted in very weak summer prices as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. In ERCOT, real-time on-peak prices settled 43% below pre-summer expectations. But despite the absence of extreme weather this summer, ERCOT fundamentals remained strong. ERCOT's 2017 peak load of 69.5 gigawatts was up nearly 2% over the five-year average and came in just shy of the 2016 peak. In terms of total consumption, we were flat to 2016 levels despite having the coolest August in 14 years plus a major hurricane. And while, for our business, we say summer 2017 weather was mild, for many living along the Gulf Coast, it was devastating. Hurricane Harvey was an unprecedented storm. It was the wettest storm to ever hit the Continental United States. In the face of this historic adversity, I could not be more proud of the way my colleagues responded. Turning to slide 8, I want to take a moment to recognize the men and women of NRG who kept the lights on, supported each other and provided assistance to both our customers and impacted communities during a time of need. First and foremost, safety is always the primary concern and I am pleased to report we have no safety incidents at our plants or in our corporate offices during the storm. But beyond safety, our employees showed great concern for their communities, engaging with first responders and community assistance programs to be on the ground, helping with services such as on-site emergency power supply. And Reliant, our flagship retail business in Texas, went above and beyond, demonstrating leadership by being the first retailer to offer customer relief programs. We were as prepared as we could be for Hurricane Harvey. Our baseload generation maintained 80% availability during the worst of the storm, a testament to the resiliency and reliability of our portfolio. Today, we're back to 95% availability across all of our Gulf generation. Currently, only two of our plants are offline, and we're actively assessing impacts and determining our return to service strategy. On the Retail side, at its peak, about 4% of our customers were without power and today, power has been restored to nearly all of our customers. Between our two businesses, we estimate the financial impacts of the storm and related weather to be about $40 million in 2017. As we continue to assess the situation, we will provide you with any necessary updates. Once again, I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone across the organization for their commitment to safety, their focus on building resilient operations, and their support for effective communities in the days and weeks following the storm. Looking forward, we have many reasons to be excited about the markets, as outlined on slide 9. In ERCOT, the recently announced retirement of over 4 gigawatts of generating capacity puts further pressure on a market with already steady, strong fundamentals. For summer of 2018, these known retirements and asset delays alone will put ERCOT at the lowest reserve margin on record, which is expected to be somewhere between 10% and 11%. Other changes such as delay in new builds and new industrial demand could lower this number even further. The tightening of the ERCOT market is something that we have been anticipating for quite some time. Just on our last earnings call, we were estimating reserve margins of close to 11%, which now has become a reality. We are encouraged to see that other generators in the market are being disciplined (13:39) uneconomic assets as we have done in the past. And while news of these retirements during the past several weeks has increased power prices, it is important to note that these prices are still below what is needed to justify new build economics. Now while these retirements are important in improving market health, ERCOT must do more to strengthen markets and should recognize the locational value of power plants. We have already provided a set of recommendations that would improve the pricing now for generators in locations where power is needed. Reliability and resiliency are important attributes to the grid and we will continue to work with ERCOT to ensure generators close to load centers are compensated for all the benefits they provide. Beyond these positive developments in the ERCOT market, we are seeing several other calls to action for market reform. As the power grid continues to undergo significant change, low gas prices, renewable penetration, and attempts for out-of-market subsidy for uneconomic generation, regulatory bodies and other stakeholders are taking note. This has led to several significant potential catalysts. From the DOE stat report on competitive markets and NOPR, to PJM's proposed market reforms, I cannot recall another time where there has been such urgency and reach across ISOs to improve competitive energy markets. We will continue our vocal advocacy against out-of-market subsidies for existing uneconomic generation and for market-based solutions that recognize all the services that generators provide : energy, capacity, reliability, and resiliency. And with that, I will turn things over to Kirk for a financial review. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on slide 11, for the third quarter, NRG delivered $806 million in adjusted EBITDA and $599 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Generation & Renewables contributed $265 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield delivered $276 million and $265 million respectively. Our results for the quarter reflect the impact of mild weather as well as Hurricane Harvey. In the latter case, the sustained heavy winds and lower temperatures led to below normal load for our Retail business. The resulting revenue impact, combined with losses experienced from unwinding hedges and depressed real-time prices, contributed to lower than expected retail results for the quarter. Although our Houston base load assets weathered the storm admirably, our wholesale business was also impacted by outages and associated loss margin, resulting from flooding across the region, including in particular our Cottonwood facility, which has since returned to service. Finally, our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing or BETM business, underperformed for the quarter, further contributing to results, which came in below expectations. Prior to the summer, although our Retail outlook had been trending above the range, our reduced expectations for wholesale more than offset this and, as I indicated in our second quarter call, our expectations for the balance of the year at that time placed us at the lower end of our consolidated guidance. Now, factoring in the impact of the third quarter events I just reviewed, our outlook for 2017 is now approximately $115 million below the low end of our previous EBITDA guidance range. As a result, we are now reducing and narrowing our 2017 guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Our revised consolidated free cash flow guidance range is now $1.175 billion to $1. 275 billion while revised NRG level free cash flow guidance is now $755 million to $855 million. We do not expect the contributing factors to our reduced guidance for 2017 to be recurring and they do not impact our outlook and guidance for 2018, which I'll review in a moment. Immediately following the quarter end, we redeem the remaining balances of our 2018 and 2021 unsecured notes, further reducing corporate debt, extending our nearest maturity to 2022, and capturing nearly $50 million in incremental annual cash interest savings. These redemptions also represent the completion of our 2017 capital allocation plan and place us on track to achieving our leverage ratio target announced as part of the Transformation Plan. Finally, on November 1, we closed on the sale to NRG Yield of a 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility scale solar assets which are not part of the ROFO agreement for $71 million, increasing 2017 capital available for allocation. Turning next to 2018 guidance on slide 12, although as Mauricio indicated, we remain on track to announce most of our targeted divestitures by year-end, we will continue to include those assets and businesses in our consolidated results and guidance until that process concludes. For 2018, we expect $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA with $950 million to $1.05 billion from Generation & Renewables, $900 million to $1 billion from Retail, which includes $30 million of margin improvements from the Transformation Plan, and $950 million from NRG Yield. Our 2018 consolidated free cash flow guidance is $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion, with $1.170 billion to $1.370 billion at the NRG level. In order to provide a pro forma view of 2018, based on midpoint guidance and moving from left to right in the table, we deduct the 2018 impact to consolidated guidance associated with divestitures which is comprised of approximately $1.4 billion in EBITDA, $670 million in consolidated free cash flow, and $290 million in NRG-level free cash flow. These 2018 divestiture impact numbers differ slightly from those used in the pro forma walk we provided as part of the Transformation Plan, which were then based on 2017 numbers. The final column provides an implied pro forma view of 2018 results based on midpoint guidance, and assuming asset sales including 100% of yield and renewables all take place as of January 1. On a pro forma basis, implied midpoint retained asset EBITDA is approximately $1.5 billion with nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. These numbers also reflect the impact of our 2017 transformation targets, including achieving $500 million of cost savings, $30 million of margin improvement, and $85 million of additional working capital efficiency. Importantly, pro forma cash balances are also, of course, further improved by up to $4 billion in expected asset sale proceeds. Beyond 2018, we expect nearly $300 million of additional upside from the full run rate of the Transformation Plan benefits as cost savings grow from $500 million in 2018 to the full $590 million by 2020 and margin improvements further expand from $30 million in 2018 to $215 million by 2020. Turning to slide 13 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation with changes since the prior quarter highlighted in blue, our updated 2017 capital available for allocation of $1.3 billion now reflects the proceeds received from the closing of the 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility solar assets to NRG Yield as well as the $165 million reduction in the midpoint 2017 NRG-level free cash flow before growth guidance. Turning to the GenOn settlement capital, as the GenOn noteholders on October 30 entered into and filed the consent agreement, extending the effective date milestones to as late as September 30, 2018, we now expect GenOn's to emerge from bankruptcy in 2018. However, we will continue to reserve for the GenOn settlement payment next year upon emergence. In parallel with the milestone extension, NRG and GenOn also reached agreement on a settlement term sheet in an effort to resolve certain open issues from the original RSA. With our corporate debt reduction now complete, with the redemption of the 2018 and 2021 notes, we've revised the debt reduction up slightly to reflect the principal balance of the 2021 notes actually repaid versus the $200 million delevering placeholder in our previous disclosure and we expect approximately $70 million of excess capital at year-end 2017. To complete the financial review, slide 14 provides an update on our corporate credit metrics for both 2017 and 2018. Based on our revised guidance for 2017, we expect a 2017 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 4.3 times. Turning to 2018, and taking into account our implied midpoint pro forma EBITDA post asset sales, which includes, again, the benefit of both cost savings and margin enhancements, and taking into account the $640 million of additional debt reduction due to divestitures, which was previously disclosed as part of the Transformation Plan, places us on track to achieve our net-debt-to-EBITDA target ratio of three times with significant surplus capital for allocation from asset sale proceeds. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kirk. Turning to slide 16, I want to provide a few closing thoughts on our 2017 priorities. We have made significant progress across all the goals we set for the organization. We remain focused on delivering results and executing on the Transformation Plan. We have exceeded our 2017 targeted cost savings and continued to reduce our debt profile in order to achieve our corporate credit metrics. As we continue to work diligently through the asset sales process, I look forward to providing you with further detail on sale announcements upon reaching agreement. We also continue to make good progress on GenOn. We have worked with GenOn to resolve open issues in the restructuring support agreement, which were detailed in the summary term sheet filed in our 8-K this week. This includes items such as the timing and nature of transition services, the treatment of NRG's Canal 3 project, and other post employment benefit obligations. We stake these terms will be finalizing the plan confirmation on November 13 and will set the path forward for GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy. On a final note, I promise all of you that we would provide a more robust plan and opportunity for strategic discussion through an Analyst Day. We are planning to hold our Analyst Day in March of 2018, where we will provide you with an update on our transformation plan progress, updated financials, as well as details around the strategic direction of our business. So with that, I want to thank you for your time today and your interest in NRG and with that, Takeisha, we are now open \u2013 we're now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So perhaps a quick first question, follows up a little bit on what you just alluded to in your closing remarks there, but can you elaborate a little bit? I suppose the last time you all spoke, you talked about potentially getting some data points on asset sales, potentially before this call. I wanted to perhaps delve into a little bit more in light of the hurricane, realizing that now you've disclosed that Cottonwood was actually out during the quarter. Was that part of the delay potentially here? I mean, obviously some of your peers may have seen delays in their own closing of sales processes as well. Can you comment on that as well as the timeline for bringing back Greens Bayuo and Gregory and how that might be complicating the process still? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Well, Julien. First of all, welcome back. It's good to talk to you again. And I mean, we only disclose on the asset sale process, the sale of our Renewables business. We didn't provide any additional details on the conventional assets. So with that in mind, what I can tell you is that some of the businesses that we have, which are very high-quality businesses are large and complex and that takes time in terms of due diligence. And as you alluded to, Hurricane Harvey impacted some of the activities and due diligence events that we were planning. So without providing you any more information, all I can tell you is that, yes, Hurricane Harvey impacted some of the processes, but I'm still confident that we will be able to announce something by the end of the year in the vast majority of our processes. With respect to the two plans that you alluded, I mean, right now, we are evaluating our return to service strategy and as you can tell, there has been significant changes in the ERCOT market due to the retirement. So I think that has \u2013 we're taking that into consideration as we look at the economics of our power plants, particularly those two power plants. Was there \u2013 I think that was it, right, Julien? I want to make sure that I got. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, no, absolutely. Thank you. And then maybe let me just ask you this real quickly as a quick follow-up here. Can you elaborate a little bit on your retail efforts? I mean, obviously, they're pretty meaningful improvement in margin that you've talked about at least the last time. Can you elaborate a little bit on where you stand against that, both in terms of the portion of new versus existing customers in that $215 million you initially articulated? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, and I think it's important for us to remind everybody that the margin enhancement target starts in earnest in 2018 so we don't have a specific goal in 2017. But having said that, we're getting ready. The team is not waiting for 2018. We're making really good progress in assessing and evaluating our platform from the IT infrastructure to data analytics. What I will tell you is that we're focusing on a couple of things specifically. One is looking at the effectiveness of our sales channels and increasing that effectiveness. We're advancing some of the secondary products that we have and getting ready to provide that to our customers. We have now initiated our digital transformation to provide additional and more seamless customer experience. We are further integrating our Generation and our Retail business and while I am very pleased with that integration, I think we're now going into the next phase of integration. All of these efforts, as you can appreciate, are interconnected. So we are strengthening the IT platform, the analytics platform to make sure that, while these efforts are going in parallel, the information now travels faster and better throughout the entire retail business. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And you can't say which portion is new versus existing though, right, within that? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, most of \u2013 a lot of these are new and/or improving what already exist. As I think as I said before, I am very proud of the Retail business that we have and the strong brand recognition that we enjoy particularly in Texas, but we did a very comprehensive review. We had an opportunity not only to look at the cost structure of Retail, but also the competitiveness of our Retail business even outside of power \u2013 retail power. And these are the best practices that now are making its way. So right now, we're in the process of evaluating, planning, assessing, getting ready for implementation, which as I said, will happen in earnest in 2018. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you all so much. Good luck. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Julien, good to have you back. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : So I think the \u2013 just talking about the quarter a little bit, I think we understood what the hurricane and weather impacts were going to be in the quarter, and are more or less in line with \u2013 had guesstimated that the impact would be around $50 million to $75 million, which you guys came in at $65 million on that front, but can you explain what happened with Boston Energy? And should we be concerned about that going forward or is that business not expected to be a contributor in your pro forma EBITDA guidance? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Kirk? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: In terms of \u2013 just to put it in perspective, so year-over-year, I think for the full year, at BETM, we had about $38 million in 2016. We're certainly below that in terms of 2017. Obviously, a trading business is impacted by movements in the market prices, (33:08) natural gas with power. And obviously, some of the movements that took place, in particular around some of the impacts of Hurricane Harvey, impacted the trading positions there or some of the positions that were taken. We do not expect significant contribution from BETM on an ongoing basis, moving forward. We're not significantly reliant on that in our 2018 guidance. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay, great. And then you have modified your language around the asset sales. I think Julien went over some of that, but you're now no longer assuming that a 50% sale of NRG Yield is in the realm of the possible. I apologize if you discussed this earlier, I was multitasking, but what's changed in the process to get you so confident that you'll now be exiting 100% of the business? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Greg, no, that's a good observation and as I said, I mean, it varies material developments in the sales process. My commitment to you was to communicate that and as we are advancing through the sales process of the Renewables business, in ASCOM, clear to us that the most likely outcome will be the 100% sale of our Renewables business. And that's why I think that's the modification that we want to, or the update that we wanted to give to the market. So when you think about now, the range that we provided, we are looking now at the up to $4 billion and 100% sale of our Renewables business, which I am very confident that will happen by the end of the year and we'll be able to announce something. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Great. And then in terms of the outlook, you're on credit watch for upgrade at Moody's and I know your bonds have responded extremely favorably to that. Are there now opportunities for potential accretive refinancings that weren't necessarily in the base case cash flow forecast that you laid out in the Transformation Plan? And also, should we assume that you're hopefully not building in any point of view on whether PJM price reform will happen or whether we'll have a return of volatility? In your outlook, you're just simply using the current curves? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Greg, that is correct. We don't assume any potential upside. The guidance that we provide to you is based on the forward markets. Now, with respect to be financings, Kirk, the refinancing opportunities. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Greg, I would say your observation and intuition are directionally correct. We are always mindful in monitoring the trading levels on bonds in the high-yield market. And clearly, we've seen a rally there where I think most of the yields on our bonds, A, they're trading at a premium, which means they're trading inside the nominal coupons, in almost every case. In fact, I think in every case, all the way out to the longest maturity inside six, which is really sort of an attractive long-term rate for unsecured financing at that credit level. So we will certainly continue to monitor that. We have some near-term callable debt. So I think our approach to the leverage side of the balance sheet is going to be a balance of obviously, first and foremost, maintaining that three times net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio, but in the process, I'm a big believer in, obviously, interest savings on accretive or NTV positive basis in addition to maturity extension. So I think you'd see us looking at that pretty closely. I think at or around the bond levels are trading right now, especially on the longest dated maturities, which is the best barometer or we can refinance on a long-term rate. We are at or even slightly ahead of what would be an implied accretive transaction. So I think that is certainly not beyond the realm of possibility and we'll continue to monitor that closely to sort of blend in that opportunistic refinancing and maturity extension, which is driving those balance sheet ratios to where we want them to be. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Fantastic. Thank you, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Abe. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: With your pro forma credit metrics on slide 18 showing close to one times net-debt-to-EBITDA, do you have any further thoughts on what you might do with excess balance sheet capacity? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, Abe. So I mean the first thing, as you can appreciate is executing on the Transformation Plan to provide the flexibility, the capital flexibility, the financial flexibility that we have and really to have enhanced excess capital. We have laid out our priorities. We're going to follow very disciplined our capital allocation priorities and to remind everybody, first and foremost, is to ensure the safe and reliable operations of our Generation and Retail business. Second is the credit metrics and, as Kirk pointed out, I mean we have a pretty good line of sight with asset sales in 2018 to achieve it. Then, you have the \u2013 any growth opportunities and we have laid out the financial guidelines to invest this 12% to 15% return and five-year payback. And then final is returning capital to shareholders and these two I see them interrelated. They have to be benchmarked in an absolute and on a relative basis. But what I will tell you is right now, I cannot think of any more compelling investment than our own stock, given the Transformation Plan that we have laid out. But, again, I think is \u2013 we need to go through our priorities first and foremost, is have the capital, then get to our credit metrics and then we can start talking about allocating capital. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And then with the way your PJM portfolio has transformed mostly into a capacity play, do you see material potential benefit if PJM changes the inflexible pricing rule? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Absolutely. I mean, we, particularly around the (39:25) area, we have a lot of base load generation, coal base load generation. If PJM moves forward to improve their price formation and acknowledge that, you have inflexible units that auto set their marginal price during off-peak hours. This will have a positive impact on prices, which will have a positive impact particularly on that part of our portfolio. Keep in mind that the rest is around low pockets, so the location of that is very important, around New York City, Southwest Connecticut. So I'm very comfortable with the portfolio that we have right now at PJM and the potential positive impact that these reforms can have on it. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. And then, is there any color you can provide on what the type of buyer for the NRG Yield and the Renewables stake could look like? Is the outlook in transaction yesterday, is that a model for what you guys could do on NRG Yield or is that too different? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, I hope that you appreciate that we're in very advance stages in many of our process including the Renewables. So I don't think it will be prudent at this late stage in the game to provide you any additional information that could potentially compromised the sales process. So I promise you that, as soon as we have more information to share with you, we will do it in a very promptly manner, but first and foremost is to make sure that these processes run its course as smooth and as good as we can possibly make it. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good luck. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolf research. Your line is now open. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Mauricio. So I just want to tie in some of the updated \u2013 the 2018 guidance to your kind of Transformation Plan announcements. So, if you look at the post asset sales of the $1.5 billion EBITDA you're giving, and then if you add in the full run rate to 2020 on the cost of the margin enhancement, I'm getting more like $1.770 billion or something, and I think you had said $1.845 billion. So I think, first, is that correct? And secondly, I think you mentioned Petra Nova maybe is a little lighter. So just is there a little bit of changes in some of the components there? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Steve, it's Kirk. The high level answer is no. We are still on track, as I said, to hit that target by the time we get out to 2020. And obviously, I think directionally, just focusing on the mid-point, you're correct, but a few things are true. One, in 2018, as Mauricio mentioned, there's a few assets still offline, remains to be seen what we do with those, and we mentioned in particular, Greens Bayou and Gregory. In addition, our Encina plant, which we don't have a contract for yet for capacity in 2018, so we basically have no contribution there, I think there is reason to be optimistic to see that come back online. But more importantly, as you move from 2018 and beyond, Petra Nova is still not a significant contributor in 2018, but as that ramps up, we still expect that to contribute to at least more meaningfully on a relative basis, albeit governed by what Mauricio indicated was lower volumes. More importantly, the Carlsbad Energy Center project, which still has actually a slight negative EBITDA contribution in 2018 as we complete that project, as we move into 2019 and beyond, you've got a pretty significant contribution there from that particular asset, in order of magnitude, to give you a sense, $80 million to $90 million of EBITDA run-rate basis points once you want to get beyond 2018. So that's the reason, sort of looking for that $1.845 billion as a target for full Transformation Plan and full achievement of some of those assets in Carlsbad still coming online. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. And then secondly, just maybe high level, Mauricio, assuming that ERCOT is going to be a much stronger market in 2018 than we thought, can you just give us your thought of the NRG Texas portfolio both Wholesale, Retail, and how much of that benefit do you capture given that you're both long and short? How should we think about that? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Well, first, let me address the Generation business and our portfolio is very close to low pockets around the Houston area. So either way they carry some inherent locational value that we have been very vocal toward that they need to recognize. As heat rates increase, we benefit both from our base load generation and our peaking generation. If you look at the hedges, the hedge disclosures that we have put in the appendix, we have now pivoted to where we're significantly open in 2019 and beyond and that has been on purpose. We were expecting a tightening in the market. We've been talking about asset retirements. We've been talking about the load growth that we have seen and the potential delays of new generation. So we actually have positioned the portfolio very favorably to benefit from these strong fundamentals that we're seeing. On the Retail side, while you are correct in the short term, in terms of some of our customers and the shore position, keep in mind that we don't necessarily manage a shore position in Retail. For any (45:39) that we have, we have Generation. We back to back it. It's about retail margins. We don't speculate the commodity market with our Retail business. As you move out when you have on price load but expected load, we have the opportunity to pass whatever is that cost and the prices to customers just like any other retailer do so we don't necessarily harm our competitiveness in the market. We just reflect the supply cost inherent in the market. Now obviously, there is a \u2013 we've always say that these two businesses move countercyclical that's why they're so complementary and you see commodity prices rise, we would expect some pressure on the Retail. But it is more than offset by the gains that you have on the Generation business. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Shah. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Most of my questions were answered at this point, but let me just on Texas and ERCOT. I mean, obviously, you've highlighted some big moves from some of the coal -retirements your peers had. So as you're sort of finalizing your asset sales by year-end, what are your thoughts on how you're thinking about selling parts of Texas especially given this call option you have on coal retirement and market tightening? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Well, right now, we're very comfortable with our Texas portfolio, and given the Retail business that we have and we're always looking at balancing our Generation and Retail. We're trying to move out now in the Northeast and the transformation plan has actually accelerated that rebalancing. But in Texas, we are very comfortable. You look at the peak load that we have on our Retail business, you look at our capacity and when you peel the onion a little bit, one layer more, we have base load generation at peak. And base load generation allows us to have a lot of the credit synergies that we look for when you put these two businesses together. Our peaking facility provides us the flexibility to manage peak loads. So far, the load following or the mid-merit, we've been able to buy that from the market at very attractive economics. Right now, we are very comfortable with acquisition. We have no \u2013 but if that changes, we will start looking at mid-merit. But what I can tell you is for now and the next couple of years, I am just very comfortable the way we have positioned our Retail and our Generation business in Texas, base load peaking and then going to market for mid-merit. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : That's helpful. And then just on your margin enhancement, it's good to see that it's underway. That's obviously one of the tougher drivers for investors to kind of model. I know it's early, but are you seeing any kind of opportunities in this stage to potentially accelerate ahead of some of your preliminary expectations similar to some of your cost cuts? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. So what we have done is really, we're trying to have it in a jump start on our margin enhancement and while the margin target's starting 2018, all the work that needs to be done behind the scenes is already happening in earnest in 2017. So getting ready, our platform, our IT platform, our high grading our analytics, evaluating the \u2013 and increasing the effectiveness of our sales channels, looking at secondary products like natural gas and security and investing in the digital transformation that it's going to make it much easier for customers to interact and engage with us. I mean, all of those things are happening right now, but these are the foundation to have a very successful effort in 2018, when we start capitalizing and monetizing in these investments. So I don't want to leave you with the impression that somehow we're waiting, the team is waiting for 2018 just because that's where we have the target. I mean, everybody's right now focused on building the platform so we hit 2018 running. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : That's helpful. Thanks again. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Shah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey guys. Couple of questions, one on Texas. Saw that you hedged a lot of 2018; also saw that you didn't really hedge that much more of 2019. Just curious, is that a market and fundamentals view, meaning that you still think there's dramatic upside left into 2019? Or is that a liquidity where you wanted to hedge it, but you couldn't actually get it done? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey, Michael, Chris here. That has more to do with making sure that our Retail side is flat against expected load and et cetera, so we make sure that they're covered up and since most of the expected retail load is kind of front-loaded, that's probably what you're seeing in the chart. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. The other question, just thinking about the conventional generation portfolio, if you had to look at the assets post the GenOn separation that you'll own in PJM New York, New England, which of those markets do you feel stronger about, meaning where you think you'll get good returns, good cash flow out? Which of those three markets are you more concerned about kind of the direction of the market to own conventional generation? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. So we have been very optimistic about PJM. The introduction of capacity and then the capacity performance, the attribute that highlights their reliability component of the grid, now the conversation around resiliency and just the market structure and the leadership in PJM to support competitive markets is \u2013 we're very optimistic about that. But as you think about our generation portfolio in the Northeast, now with position in PJM and particularly in comment, which has been a premium location, New York City and Southwest Connecticut. And with the objective of balancing our Generation and Retail business, I mean, we are trying to \u2013 we are focused on perfecting the integrated platform. A lot of the generation is going to be driven by our retail needs and how we grow retail and a lot of our retail is going to be driven by where we have generation. So we are right now, in the process of balancing the portfolio. As even without the GenOn assets and some of the conventional asset sales, we're still long generation in PJM. I mean, we have a ways to go before we have a balanced portfolio like we have in Texas so we have a lot of room to grow in Retail. But just in terms of market structure, I would put PJM number one, I think New England number two and New York number three, if I had to force rank them. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Last question, just coming back to Texas a little bit, with the big move in on-peak prices after recent coal plant retirement announcements, is that move enough to bring coal plants back into free cash flow breakeven? Or when you look at the market today with the big move in prices, are coal plants in the market still struggling to have cash flow breakeven? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, I think it's very plant-dependent. I don't think you can paint with a broad brush and just say coal plants generic, how is their economics? I mean, it has to do with where they are located in the grid, what type of coal they burn, what is their environmental profile? Do they have environmental controls already in place or not? What are the rules that are coming down the pipe? So I don't think you can make a blank statement like that. What I have said in the past is our coal generation in Texas, I feel very comfortable with it given the size, the coal that they burn, which is PRB and the location in the grid and the environmental controls that they have. I mean, we feel very comfortable where they are right now. Clearly, the expected retirements that we've been talking for a while were announced. That has an impact on prices. But as I said, an impact, but it's not enough to bring \u2013 to justify new build economics. So if ERCOT falls below the target reserve margins, I think more needs to be done in the market to incentivize new generation to come back, but that's how I think about our coal portfolio under these economics. I mean, somebody else is, I think, you can clearly see that these were uneconomic plans that were difficult to justify and we're just encouraged that they're behaving \u2013 they're taking uneconomic generation out of market and behaving rationally. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, Mauricio, much appreciated. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you, good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morming. Mauricio, a couple of questions on the 2018 guidance. First off, when I look at your retail guidance for 2018 and as you pointed out, there's a very small component of margin enhancement, I believe only $22 million or so. So if I exclude that, the underlying retail EBITDA for 2018 is probably the highest that I've ever seen, certainly in the last five years maybe longer. What's causing that number to be so high in 2018? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. So the 2018 numbers, remember, are impacted by our cost savings and that we have significant \u2013 the cost savings initiative on our Transformation Plan is really at ease. That's when you see the bulk of it. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So Retail is not just margin enhancement? A lot of the cost savings are flowing through the Retail segment as well? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Correct. I mean, you have the $30 million margin enhancement that Kirk already alluded to, and then you have the cost savings that had been laid out in the Transformation Plan and that we are well ahead of 2017, so that's the combination of the two. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see, and then \u2013 but on a full NRG level basis, when I look at the midpoint of your 2018 guidance, and I compare it to the midpoint of your revised 2017 guidance, if I exclude the cost saving pick up, the numbers are almost flat. Given the capacity margin, revenue increase, you're seeing 2018 over 2017, I'm just wondering why that would be the case? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah, Ali, it's Kirk. There's some puts and takes, I mean that was in \u2013 when I responded with Steve on the call earlier, with Gregory, which is certainly a part and brings value et cetera in 2017 that currently, we have zero EBITDA for those two plants, that are currently offline as well as the Encino plant not having any at least EBITDA baked into our guidance on the base that we don't currently have a capacity contract there. So there's a little bit of non-same-store on that basis between 2017 and 2018 where that's concerned. So some of that contributes to that. So basically, as we said all along, in 2017, even in the period of time when we were looking at our midpoint guidance, we talked about being sort of setting the baseline, if you will, which is why we anchored that and look forward. So we've never looked at the 2017 to 2018 numbers as a hockey stick, but there are some market recoveries. There's certainly the cost improvement that contribute to that, and then as I said before, there's a few elements namely around the plant side where we don't have the same contribution on an EBITDA basis. So it's a combination of those elements. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Last question. Big picture-wise, as you're looking at \u2013 as you said, fairly advanced sale processes across the board, the mix of buyers both strategic and financial, is it more financial? Just a sense of who is out there generally. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: No, Ali, I mean, I think on the outset, we provided some color on that. We wanted to put businesses that were very attractive, that were very high quality assets, that were unique and so attract the vast majority of the assets of the prospective buyers. So you know, given where we are on the processes, under late stage on many of the processes. I don't think it's prudent for me to even provide any color on the type of buyers that are in the process. What I will tell you is that they were a very wide array of \u2013 we really attracted a number, a very wide array of buyers in the process, but that's as much as I can disclose for you, Ali, at this point. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you. And thank you, all of you for your interest in NRG and I look forward to talking to you when we have more information about the asset sales process. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 NRG Energy Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Sonia. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast.

Now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business. I'd like to start the call by highlighting the three key messages for today's presentation on the slide 4. First, we delivered on our 2017 goals and we are reaffirming 2018 guidance. After a year of relentless focus on multiple transformative priorities, we have a much clearer path to value, and I am very optimistic about the potential for upside in our business, particularly given the strength we're seeing in our core markets. Second, we have made significant progress in executing on our Transformation Plan. Our sale announcements over the past few weeks have brought us to over 90% of our target asset sale proceeds. We have also significantly exceeded our 2017 cost savings target and remain on track to achieve our target credit metrics. And third, with the vast majority of our asset sales now announced, and as a reflection of our confidence in the outlook for our business, we are announcing a $1 billion share buyback authorization with the first $500 million program to begin immediately. Now, turning to our Transformation Plan update on slide 5, as you can see by our scorecard on the left-hand side of the page, we're making good progress. We have realized $150 million of recurring EBITDA accretive savings during 2017, which is over 200% of our original target of $65 million. The excellent work throughout the organization and the focus on our continuous improvement initiative led to a jumpstart of our cost program early last year. This meant that we were able to pull forward some of our 2018 initiatives and exceed our target for 2017. Looking forward, we remain on track to achieve our $590 million in total run rate cost savings by 2020. Our margin enhancement target is also on track, with details of this initiative to be covered at our Analyst Day. Now, moving to our portfolio optimization, today, we're announcing the sale of our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing business, or BETM, for $70 million in proceeds. This transaction is intended to further simplify, streamline and focus our business, and brings our total announced proceeds to over $3 billion. We remain on track to close all of our recently announced transactions by the end of the year and we will update you on our remaining asset sales as they progress. Last, we continue to strengthen our capital structure. We are on track to achieve our target net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3 times by the end of the year. With the recent asset sale announcement, we now have line of sight to significant capital that can be deployed to our other capital allocation priorities. I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time. I am pleased to announce that we have authorization for $1 billion share repurchase program, with a $500 million program to be launched immediately. And as we progress towards the closing of the asset sales and upon completion of our initial repurchase program, we will look to execute the remaining $500 million of our $1 billion program. Moving to slide 6 with our business and financial highlights, it was a busy year that challenged us to make our business stronger in order to position ourselves for long-term success. Despite of all of these moving pieces throughout the year as well as the devastation of Hurricane Harvey in our core Gulf region, we not only achieved top decile safety performance, but it was our second-best safety year in company history. This is a testament to the culture and focus of our employees. And I want to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues for their hard work and for keeping safety our top priority. Now, with respect to our financial results, we ended the year with just under $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA and almost $900 million of free cash flow at the NRG level. Our Generation business performed well in light of a mild summer and our Retail business delivered its fourth consecutive year of EBITDA growth with $825 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. Hats off to the Retail team, which continues to deliver outstanding results every year. Now, in addition to our Transformation Plan targets, during 2017, we also executed on our objective to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, resulting in a reorganization plan that was approved by the Bankruptcy Court in December of 2017. The plan is intended to transition GenOn to a standalone entity and provides NRG with certainty and visibility into the timing and services that need to be provided to GenOn in this transition period. On slide 7, I want to briefly describe the impact of our actions over the past two years on our portfolio. We will have an opportunity to discuss this impact in greater detail at our Analyst Day, but in the meantime, I'd like to highlight just a few of the ways we're simplifying and improving our vertically integrated power business. First, we are reducing our capacity by over one-half to roughly 20,000 megawatts and focusing our business on our core Texas and East markets to better match our Retail business. As we are scaling back our generation, our Retail business continues to be strong, with a steady stream increase in customer accounts and continued solid earnings. And as you can see on the third row of the slide, the EBITDA contribution from the Retail business is becoming increasingly important, going from 25% in 2016 to 60% in 2018 of our total earnings. These changes will increase the visibility and stability of our earnings profile, given the better balance between Generation and Retail. It also increases our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. NRG has always been a cash flow machine. And with these changes, we will make our conversion even more efficient. We will improve our free cash flow conversion from 21% in 2016 to over 60% in 2018, a ratio unmatched in our industry. And our business is changing. It is improving. We are rightsizing the portfolio and becoming leaner, stronger and better positioned to create shareholder value, both today and into the future. Now, the markets continued to show signs of steady improvement, as highlighted on slide 8. Over the past several years, we have highlighted to ERCOT regulators and stakeholders the extensive risk of retirements and the slowdowns in new-builds, given chronic low prices. Now, and as expected, these dynamics are causing significant market tightening and we're entering the summer of 2018 with the lowest reserve margin on record at 9.3%. This is well below the target reserve margin of 13.75%. And the power prices in the forward markets where ERCOT are responding to these tight market conditions and have more dramatically the past few months to over $130 per megawatt hour for the summer, as you can see on the left-hand chart. This is a stark comparison to the average summer price of the past six years of only $35 per megawatt hour. At NRG, we're all working to ensure our plants are ready to meet demand and provide customers solutions to proactively manage their energy bills. Now in competitive markets more broadly, there have been persistent calls to action for reform across states and across power markets. We continue to work with regulators and customers to make sure that competitive markets are not disrupted from a generation or retail perspective. We must get the pricing signals right in generation markets and improve the way that customers are able to access and consume power in the retail power markets. At the federal and state level, we see many indications of positive market momentum towards these objectives, and we will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets. Now, turning to slide 9, I want to provide a capital allocation update. During my first call as CEO two years ago, I told you that given the deep cyclical nature of our sector, we have to first ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital. We wanted to leave no doubt about our ability to deliver on the value that we knew existed in our portfolio during any market cycle. We therefore focus on strengthening our balance sheet and paying down debt. Since 2016, we have paid roughly $1.6 billion in debt and extended almost $7 billion of maturities, with most of them due well beyond 2022. Our identified asset sales will also help us to reduce close to $8 billion of debt. And with $640 million allocated towards deleveraging and another $1.2 billion of temporary cash reserve to achieve our credit metrics, we are well on our way to achieve our target net debt-to-EBITDA of 3 times by the end of the year. As we continue to meet our top capital allocation priorities, we are now pivoting to evaluate growth opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Our immediate $500 million share buyback is reflective of our commitment to seeking the value-maximizing outcome for our capital. And as we progress towards closing our asset sales, we expect to execute on our additional $500 million authorization. So, with that, I will now turn it over to Kirk for the financial review. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary on slide 11, in 2017, NRG generated $2.373 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $1.3 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth, with nearly $900 million of that cash flow available at the NRG level. For the year, Retail delivered a robust $825 million in adjusted EBITDA, including the impact of low commodity prices, execution on cost reduction and continued customer growth. Generation and Renewables delivered a combined $615 million in 2017 EBITDA, including a one-time impact of a non-cash expense of approximately $60 million due to excess oil inventory write-down and the write-off of obsolete spare parts inventory across the fleet. NRG Yield contributed $933 million in line with expectations. Including today's announced sale of our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing business, the total Transformation Plan asset sales announced or closed to-date totals $3 billion, or only $200 million away from our revised target, which we expect to reach by 2019 In the fourth quarter, we successfully refinanced our 2023 unsecured notes at a record low rate for NRG of 5.75%, reducing annual interest expense and extending the previous maturity by five years. In 2017, we also completed the reduction of just over $600 million in corporate debt through redemption of the remaining balances of our 2018 and 2021 notes. These redemptions eliminated our nearest corporate maturities and combined with interest savings on the 2023 notes refinancing led to annual cash interest savings of $55 million. I'd like to take a moment to address one element of our 2017 income statement, which is not included in our EBITDA results. That is a non-cash impairment charge on fixed assets and goodwill of $1.8 billion. This charge primarily consists of a $1.2 billion impairment loss on our interest in the South Texas Project, or STP, our nuclear facility south of Houston. A regular fourth quarter process of revising our forecast of power and fuel prices and the impact on plant cash flows resulted in the need to write-down certain fixed assets, including STP. The portion of the total write-down from goodwill impairment was approximately $100 million and was largely related to the announced sale of BETM. Turning to 2018 guidance, we are reaffirming our ranges for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. Our 2018 pro forma numbers, which are based on the midpoint of guidance and reflect the implied 2018 contribution from retained businesses and Transformation Plan cost savings and margin improvements, are also unchanged from our call last month. Importantly, as shown in the bottom row of the table, our pro forma financials also demonstrate the significant cash flow efficiency benefits from our retained businesses, as we convert over $0.60 of every $1 of EBITDA into free cash flow, a 66% improvement in cash flow efficiency versus 2017 results. Finally, as noted in the bottom right of the table, while our 2018 pro forma EBITDA includes a substantial portion of the cost savings and margin benefits of the plan, we expect an additional $275 million of incremental EBITDA beyond 2018 as we reach our run rate of recurring savings by 2020. Turning now to slide 12, we provided financial summary of our 2017 NRG level capital allocation, with changes since our third quarter update highlighted in blue. We finished the year with $440 million of excess capital remaining available for allocation, a $370 million increase versus our third quarter update. The substantial portion of the $370 million increase is largely due to an increase in total available capital and a decrease in allocations due to a shift in timing of expenditures and commitments from 2017 to 2018. First, total capital available prior to allocations increased by $193 million, as shown on the far left of the chart. $92 million of this increase reflects the difference between actual 2017 NRG level cash flow and the midpoint of guidance, which form the basis for our previous update. The remaining $101 million was a result of the sale of our Minnesota Wind portfolio to a third party as well as various distributed solar dropdowns to NRG Yield. On the uses side, actual capital allocated to the GenOn restructuring was lower due to the shift in expected emergence from 2017 to 2018 following the court approved plan in December. Actual 2017 capital allocated to GenOn consists of the $125 million draw by GenOn under the intercompany revolver in 2017, which will be repaid by GenOn upon emergence and NRG's pension contribution of $13 million. The balance of capital required for GenOn will be funded as a part of 2018 capital allocation, which I'll review shortly. Next, NRG's actual cost-to-achieve associated with the Transformation Plan were lower than original expectations, exclusively due to a delay in timing from 2017 to 2018. And finally, the remaining small changes in allocated capital reflect minor updates in actual costs related to the debt financing and the 2017 growth investments. The ending balance of $440 million in excess capital at year-end shown on the right-side of the slide forms the basis for our 2018 capital allocation, which I'll now review on slide 13. Our expected capital from existing sources on the left of the chart on page 13 includes the $440 million ending 2017 balance, plus the $1 billion of pro forma free cash flow from 2018. We expect this to be significantly augmented by the closing of our announced asset sales, which now include the sale of BETM. The total net proceeds of $2.792 billion reflect the aggregate proceeds of our 2018 announced asset sales net of transaction costs leading to total expected 2018 excess capital available of just over $4.2 billion. Turning to uses of capital, we have allocated just over $2 billion to the balance sheet. And this is comprised of approximately $760 million of permanent debt reduction and the balance of $1.2 billion expected to be a temporary reserve to ensure we achieve our target ratio of 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA. I'll review the basis for this $1.2 billion reserve in greater detail on the credit slide at the end of my section. But we expect this $760 million in 2018 permanent debt reduction to be necessary to achieve the 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 2018 and beyond. However, due in part to the fact that as I mentioned earlier, in 2018, we will not yet realize $275 million in recurring EBITDA from the full run rate of the transformation, our 2018 ratio does not yet reflect the full impact of the plan. As such, we are temporarily increasing our minimum cash balance in 2018 by $1.2 billion in order to achieve the target ratio. As our ratio improves over time, we would expect that this reserve would be released and available for future allocation. Next, as Mauricio mentioned earlier, we're allocating $1 billion of 2018 capital towards share repurchases, the first $500 million of which we expect to begin immediately. Dividends, which represent the balance of allocated return of capital to shareholder, are unchanged versus the 2017 rate. Turning to GenOn, we expect $178 million of capital towards the remaining commitments under the plan as GenOn expected to merge in 2018. This consists of the $261 million settlement amount and the 2018 pension contribution, partially offset by the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver. We expect $246 million in capital allocation toward the completion of our investment in cost-to-achieve under the Transformation Plan, including the amounts delayed from 2017 to 2018, I mentioned earlier. Finally, expected 2018 growth investments of $195 million consist primarily of the Carlsbad project, which is more than offset by the dropdown proceeds reflected in the asset sale bar to the left, and Canal 3, which remains under option for purchase by GenOn under the plan of reorganization. Based on this current allocation, this implies $613 million of excess capital remaining to be allocated in 2018. Please turn to slide 14, and I'll use this ending balance as a starting point to update the roll forward to pro forma 2020 excess capital we first provided last July as a part of the Transformation Plan announcement. Beginning on the left side of the chart on that slide, we start with the excess capital from 2018 of $613 million. I'll briefly walk from left to right to summarize the sources and uses in 2019 and 2020 to update or revise expected cumulative excess capital. First, using our pro forma 2018 free cash flow as a basis for 2019 and 2020, adds $2 billion of additional cash. Next, as shown in the table above the third green bar, we had $404 million of cumulative incremental cash flow from the Transformation Plan, which is not reflected in our 2018 pro forma free cash flow. This incremental cash flow is primarily due to the increase in margin enhancements toward the 2020 run rate of $215 million, $90 million in additional cost savings versus the 2018 rate, and the $20 million increase in run rate maintenance CapEx. Next, while our 2018 capital for allocation reflects the bulk of asset sales toward the target, we reflect the remaining balance of $205 million in additional proceeds expected by 2019. $90 million of additional cumulative cash flow reflects two years of cash interest savings on the $640 million of permanent corporate debt reduction we assume to take place at year end 2018. Turning to uses, $88 million of debt amortization reflects the final portion of the repayment of Midwest Gen capacity monetization shown as debt for accounting purposes as well as ongoing but relatively de minimis amortization on our term loan. $30 million represents two years of our ongoing commitment to fund GenOn pension contributions as part of the plan. And finally, $75 million to fund two years of annual dividend at the current rate, which, of course, will be slightly lower based on the share buyback. We add the release of $1.2 billion cash reserve, I spoke about earlier, to arrive an implied balance of just over $4.3 billion in excess capital through 2020, which for comparative purposes is $5.3 billion before taking into account the 2018 share buyback allocation, and represents in the aggregate over 60% of our current market capitalization. And finally, turning to a brief update on pro forma 2018 capital structure on slide 15. First, we've modified this slide on the left side to more clearly reflect our consolidated debt balance and pro forma debt balance in the context of targeted divestitures. Just over $8.1 billion of our ending consolidated debt balance will be eliminated upon the closure of the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables business as well as the associated dropdowns to NRG Yield. What remains is a pro forma consolidated debt balance of $8.5 billion, $1.3 billion of which is non-recourse debt. Approximately 90% of this remaining balance of non-recourse debt is the project debt balance at the Ivanpah project level which amortizes, funded by project level cash flows over the remaining life of the PPA. The balance of non-recourse debt at what remains of the Midwest Gen capacity monetization transaction, which is treated as debt for accounting purposes, and is fully repaid by 2019. Turning to the right side of the slide, our 2017 recourse debt balance of $7.186 billion will be further reduced in 2018 by the term loan amortization and the permanent corporate debt reduction as a part of the Transformation Plan and included in 2018 capital allocation. For presentation purposes, we've included only the $500 million minimum cash balance and the $1.2 billion cash reserve I spoke about earlier to derive implied net debt. We assume that $613 million in remaining excess capital in 2018, shown in the red box at the bottom of the slide, has been allocated to other opportunities. The denominator of ratio starts with our 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which does not yet reflect the full run rate impact of the Transformation Plan with $275 million of additional savings expected beyond this year. We deduct the EBITDA from non-recourse entities, Ivanpah and Midwest Gen, and add back the cash distributions from those subsidiaries, as well as, consistent with our previous slides on credit ratios, certain non-cash expenses included in EBITDA. Our net debt balance of $4.8 billion temporarily reduced by the $1.2 billion cash reserve reflects a ratio of 3 times our pro forma recourse EBITDA, in line with our revised target. With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kirk. Just a few final remarks on our priorities for the year on slide 17. And as always, our first priority is to deliver on our financial and operational goals. We're focused on executing our Transformation Plan objectives and bringing our announced asset sales to a timely close in the second half of the year. In 2017, it was a priority to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, and during the year, we were able to achieve this objective. Now, with a plan confirmation by the courts, we're focused on working with GenOn on transition services so that GenOn may be a standalone company by September of 2018. I want to acknowledge that 2017 was an important year for our company and we underwent a series of changes stemming from multiple strategic initiatives. I am very proud of our success in greatly simplifying our business and positioning ourselves to thrive under any market cycles. I look forward to continuing our conversation about the long-term strategy and prospects of the company at our Analyst Day on March 27. I want to thank you for your time today and your interest in NRG. And with that, Sonia, we are now ready to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Congratulations on continued progress on your Transformation Plan. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Wanted to first touch on Texas. We share your optimism about the tightening supply-demand balance. Can you speak to how you're likely to be positioned for the summer, just at a high level? I know it's challenging to tell us exact megawatts of open position, but to the extent that we do see relatively high summertime prices, how can we think about the strategy for remaining open and positioned to take advantage of such price moves? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Right. So, Stephen, let me answer the question with, I guess, two timeframes. The first is 2018, because we have seen a pretty significant increase in prices for this summer, and then perhaps longer-term, which is more of a structural change. So, for summer of 2018, our Generation business is very well positioned. We actually disclosed in the Appendix our hedge percentages now on a pro forma basis. And as you're going to see, we are about 30% open on our heat rate exposure. So, we are \u2013 from a Generation standpoint, we're well positioned to benefit from the market tightening \u2013 or the tightening conditions that exist in the market. Our Retail business is well positioned as well. As you recall, we back-to-back all our Retail, I guess, load and about half of our portfolio is fixed price. So you should expect that that half of the portfolio is completely locked in and the margins are locked in. The other half is in variable pricing. We take steps to manage that load and as the load progresses and it fixes their price, we can, what I describe is, detail or perfect the hedges that we have on that variable pricing load. Now, longer-term, 2019 and beyond, our Generation business is pretty open, as you can tell on the hedging disclosures that we have provided. So, we will benefit from any structural changes. And we believe that these repricing of the Texas market is going to continue at least for 2019 and perhaps 2020, since \u2013 which is not going to have a chance to have new-builds in the span of a year and a half or two years. Our Retail business, on the other hand, as you appreciate, if there is a structural change in the Texas market, all retailers will see this new level of pricing in the market. So, first of all, it doesn't put us in any disadvantage. Number two, having our Generation business, it offsets a little bit that margin compression that you should expect from \u2013 or that you could expect from higher prices in our Retail business, and more than offsets that. And then, the final thing that I will say is volatility creates opportunities and it creates opportunities for retail companies and generation companies that are well positioned. We saw it during the polar vortex and we actually are ready to capitalize on this opportunity as perhaps customers look \u2013 want to move to retail companies that are better capitalized, that has generation behind them and superior service that we provide. So, we see that also as an opportunity. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: No, that's very helpful. Shifting over to growth opportunities, obviously, you're generating a great deal of excess cash that could be deployed on organic growth opportunities. How do you think about the fields of opportunities? Is this a target-rich set of opportunities you're looking at? Or given where you stand today, is it relatively likely we should see fairly sizeable additional share repurchases just given the implied return in your own stock? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I mean, first is the latter part of your question, which is we're deploying $1 billion because we believe the returns on our stock are pretty attractive. And number two, we are always evaluating the market in terms of attractive opportunities. What I will say is just given where the market conditions are, those attractive opportunities are perhaps more likely in the Retail business than in the Generation business. And that's where we're going to be focusing. I mean, keep in mind that in the East, we're still long Generation. We need to continue growing our Retail business both organically. And perhaps, if there is an attractive opportunity in the retail sector, we will evaluate that. But without a doubt, right now, the most compelling return for our capital is our own stock and that's where we're focusing on. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Thank you very much. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Stephen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Antoine Aurimond - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Antoine for Julien, actually. How are you? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Antoine Aurimond - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi. To come back a little bit on the capital allocation beyond the $1 billion buyback, how would you guys think about a recurring dividend program in terms of payout and yield? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. I mean, it's one of the options that we have to returning capital to our shareholders. We laid out our priorities a couple of our earnings calls ago. And when I think of our capital deployment and capital allocation, it's just using those principles that we have already articulated to you. We need to make sure that our business is performing at the operating and financial level that we want. Now that we have line of sight after the asset sales on our credit metrics, then it gives us the opportunity to start thinking about growth or returning capital to shareholders. And in the returning capital to shareholders bucket, I mean, we have the share buybacks or a dividend. And right now, just given where the stock is, we have opted to execute on share repurchases, but dividends are a very viable way to returning capital to shareholders. We're going to continue evaluating that throughout the year. And once we finish with our initiatives and complete the repositioning of our portfolio, then we will have a robust conversation internally and with our board of directors to see what is the best way to return capital to shareholders. But, hopefully, the announcements that we're making today demonstrate and are clear examples of our commitment to be very disciplined when it comes to capital allocation Antoine Aurimond - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Got it. And then, can you give us a bit more detail on the $215 million Retail EBITDA enhancement in terms of how you plan to achieve that and whether the timing you laid out previously has changed at all? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So, you're talking about the margin enhancement for Retail, right? Antoine Aurimond - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Right. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. We provided some information about that when we announced the Transformation Plan and in subsequent calls. I would tell you that we're investing heavily in our Retail business both on our asset sale channels and our IT platform, and just the further integration of Generation and Retail, which helps us manage \u2013 or better manage and optimize our margins. In the Analyst Day, one of our objective is to provide you a lot more visibility and clarity in terms of how do we plan to achieve that $250 million. The only point that I also have made in the past is, if you look at what we have achieved the last three years, we actually grew our Retail business by $200 million. So, what we're saying is, in the next three years, we're going to grow it by another $200 million. We have done it before. It's achievable, but I am very mindful that we need to provide a lot more specificity about how we're going to do that. And I intend to do that with my colleagues, particularly Elizabeth and Rob, as responsibles of the Retail businesses, to provide more specificity about how we're going to do it. Antoine Aurimond - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Antoine. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Just a little bit of clean up on the Q4 and fiscal year results. The EBITDA came in a bit below the guidance range, but despite that the free cash flow was quite robust. Can I attribute that to that write-down that you guys called out in Q4 that was non-cash to $60 million as being sort of the key thing that took you down below the range? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Greg, it's Kirk. That's correct. I mean that's one of the reasons why I highlighted that non-cash, obviously, non-recurring impairment charge, which \u2013 the larger impairments on the fixed assets, that's just the acceleration of depreciation, which isn't part of EBITDA. But because that's inventory which would normally go through COGS, we chose to leave that obviously as part of our deduct to get to EBITDA, but obviously highlighting the fact that that's one-time and non-cash. A couple of other elements as we roll through the statement of other (40:08) which are non-cash, we made an accrual for potential liquidated damages due to the delay of the Carlsbad project. I think that was like ZIP Code of $20 million of accrual towards the year end. And the remainder of sort of the unexpected variances, if you want to call it that for lack of a better term, we had is largely related to really the Renewables side, which is really still consolidated. We had some delays in projects reaching COD, which obviously delays their contribution of EBITDA. But overall, the main one to highlight is the $60 million you started with. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Right. Two more questions. On the $600-and-change million, that's currently unallocated. I presume you're going to give us some more guidance on how you're going to allocate that capital at the Analyst Day. And so it's sort of been held back and so you can give us a sense of how you're focusing the business strategy and therefore where you're going to allocate those dollars? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, Greg. I mean, we'll provide you some more clarity during the Analyst Day, but what I can tell you today is we're going to be applying the same capital allocation principle that we have applied to date. So, while we will do that on the Analyst Day, I don't think you should expect any big surprises in terms of the disciplined approach that we're taking on capital allocation. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. And my last question, I think Stephen Byrd alluded to this earlier, just to be a little bit more direct. It's always been in hindsight over the years, a mistake to get too excited too early in the year in terms of guidance ranges and changing them. But forward curves and power market dynamics have improved quite significantly since you gave the guidance range. So, can you give us any sense of, given how you've hedged the portfolio, whether forward curves were to hold up at these levels for the remainder of the year? Where would you sort of be within the guidance range or is it just too early in the year and you don't want to get too excited about it? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, first of all, we're very comfortable with the guidance that we have provided today. That's why we're reaffirming it. Number two, we're not going to tell you specifically how we are positioning ourselves for the summer. I mean, we provided you the cash disclosures on the appendix. And as you can tell, we are roughly about 30% open on our total portfolio for heat rate exposure. So, the commercial team, and Chris Moser is managing very closely the position in the summer. Now, with the further integrations that we have between Generation and Retail, we have a pretty good line of sight in terms of the needs that our Retail business needs \u2013 has to mitigate any potential impact on it. But where I stand today, I just feel very, very comfortable with the position of our business and the guidance that we have provided to you. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you, guys. Have a great morning. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thanks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Mauricio. So the \u2013 just, I know I've asked this in the past, but just you do give the continued benefits of the cost cutting and the margin enhancement out to 2020. Just the base business, excluding that, and I know there's a lot of moving parts, but is it fair \u2013 in the past, we've talked about it being kind of assume flattish off of the base in 2017, 2018. Is that still kind of a fair thing to do, or any guidance there on other drivers? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah, Steve. It's Kirk. I mean, obviously, you already referenced sort of the on-to-come aspect of the Transformation Plan, that $275 million. But setting the Transformation Plan trajectory to the side, yes, we feel comfortable with the underpinnings of the base business, which is what informed our confidence to sort of reaffirm using that as an anchor in that roll-forward walk that I provided for you. Our outlook is consistent with that perspective over the long-term beyond 2018, yes. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. And then one more question on ERCOT and specific really to the summer peak. Could you talk about your generation-to-load match at summer peak days, periods, et cetera, in terms of protecting in the event there is high-volume spiky pricing? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey, Steve. Chris Moser here. I would think of it this way. With the integrated portfolio, the final position in any given hour is going to depend on where the Retail actuals come in and how the units perform in that given random hour out of the 700 on-peak hours we're going to see. If it's a high-load, high-price situation, we're set up to be \u2013 we're just fine in that situation. If it is extreme load and extreme price, that's going to limit the upside as the unit's length ends up covering and protecting Retail margin, so. But in an extreme load, extreme price situation in 2018, that should have some carry-forward and bleed through into 2019 and beyond, which should give us some pretty good hedging opportunities in the forwards. And keep in mind, that's an area where Retail retains a lot of pricing flexibility, given that they haven't sold everything out up there yet. So, I feel like we're in a pretty good shape right now. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. One last question, and you may want to leave this to the Analyst Day, but just your main peer company talked a little bit about, thinking about whether they might want to look to investment-grade credit metrics or rating in the future. Is that a priority for you at all, or is that really not something that you're focused on? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Steve, it's Kirk. Not primarily focused on it. I mean, certainly, improvements in credit ratings are something we certainly do aspire to from a cost of capital and reliability of access in the market as you sort of leg up the scale, if you will. But I think we feel comfortable with sort of the ZIP code of that BB ratio, striking the right balance between delivering the right equity return to our shareholders on the one hand and managing the risk of the balance sheet on the other, and most importantly, maintaining our confidence in the access to reasonably priced capital even through the cycle. That's not to say we continue to look towards that. I mean, as I think I maybe even said in a prior call, maybe the last call we had, we don't look at our credit ratio objectives as a set it and forget it. We continue to review those in the context of what we see, including, but not limited to, the fact that obviously the tax shield is not quite as robust today as it was a few months ago by virtue of the Tax Reform Act. So that's in constant review, but I think suffice to say, that's not a primary focus. We're comfortable with our BB target. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: And, Steve, let me just add that we have been very clear about our priorities. We have communicated that to all of you. Those priorities are right now on execution. That's our focus right now is to execute on those priorities. And as Kirk mentioned, I mean, once we have demonstrated that we've delivered on those commitments that we've made, then we will reevaluate. But for now, our priorities are very clear and we're executing towards them. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Hey, guys. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : So most of my questions were answered, but just on sort of the dividend and just a quick follow-up. Is there longevity in the token dividend? So like as you sort of think about returning capital and assuming you decide it's more economic to buy back shares, why sort of retain this token dividend? Should we sort of think about it as either you potentially looking to enact a higher payout ratio and maybe growing that dividend, given what your cash flow profile is, or removing the policy altogether? So why keep this dividend if you're going to maintain it at such a low level? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: No, that is a good observation, Shar. And we actually have been having conversations internally about that. And as you can appreciate, we're going to have \u2013 we're going to be talking to you in a more comprehensive basis around our capital allocation program, but importantly, in the context of our long-term strategy and long-term prospects that the company has. So, this is something that we're going to be getting into more detail at the Analyst Day. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Kirk, let me just follow-up real quick on sort of your leverage targets, like \u2013 and outside of ratings, you do have a peer that's noticeably shooting below that. You've got the integrated utility GenCos that are certainly leaner. You have other cyclical industries that have tighter metrics. Is 3 turns really optimal outside of ratings, especially given that you're kind of left without an industry, a sector, and eventually, going to have to benchmark yourself with other cyclical industries as you project sort of this message to investors? So, what is optimal? Is 3 turns still optimal, or is your thought process should it evolve? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, to avoid repeating some of the things I said in response to Steve's question, we are comfortable and reaffirming that 3 times target. And what informs our thinking beyond what I've talked about in the past about striking the right balance and everything else is cash flow context matters to us at the end of the day. And both Mauricio and I again reiterated how pleased we are with what the knock-on effect of what we're doing in the Transformation Plan means in our ability to more efficiently translate EBITDA to free cash flow. And legging towards two-thirds or $0.67 of every $1 translating, that makes a big difference. So, if I'm comparing apples-to-apples to somebody else's at a 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, but they're converting $0.35 on every $1 where I'm converting $0.70, that calibration factor on cash flow, I think, is important not to ignore because it certainly informs our thinking. And while EBITDA is a nice statistic, cash rules the day in terms of financial flexibility. And that I think is a distinction that's worth repeating. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Okay. That's helpful. Congrats, guys, on executing on the plan so far. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Shar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Your line is now open. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to go back to the sensitivity of earnings to changes in heat rates. So, when I look at slide 24, where you show the sensitivity of your margins, especially for the Texas business, it seems largely unchanged versus what you showed us, I think, during the financial update \u2013 actually, during the third quarter earnings call. And you had a pretty meaningful move in heat rates in Texas. So, the sensitivity versus the levels at the end of the year, is this versus the current guidance? What is the basis for that sensitivity? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: This is Chris, Angie. I believe that that is as of this week \u2013 are you looking at the heat rate sensitivity, $54 million Texas 2018? Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes. Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: That's what you're looking at? Yeah, think of it as $54 million from what is arguably a higher spot. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: And, Angie, let me just \u2013 because you were talking about comparing against previous disclosures, so I think it's important to mention that in this new hedge disclosure, I think we pulled out some of the portfolios or assets that we're selling, particularly the LaGen business. So, I just want to make sure that the team is working with you, too, as you're looking at previous disclosures with new disclosures that you're comparing apples-to-apples. And this new hedge disclosure I believe does not include the businesses that are held for sale now. But that's an important \u2013 I guess that's an important piece of information, Angie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. But there's nothing being sold in Texas, right? I mean, Texas Generation assets are intact. So you're saying that the... Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Angie, we can... Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: We can \u2013 let me just make sure \u2013 I am looking at the third quarter 2017 earnings presentation where the heat rate sensitivity for Texas and South Central is $62 million and the one that you have in front of you with the $54 million is Texas only. But we can run this down off the call, if you like. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Okay. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Angie. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Congratulations. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Abe. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just following up on your hedge profile, you remain more open for next year than I remember you being in recent years. Is this a reflection of your view that there's potentially more improvement in the forward curves or is this liquidity or something else? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: No. It's two things and it goes to a little bit of what I was just talking to Angie about the \u2013 if you're looking at the previous quarters, they would have had South Central included in that. And given that South Central has a pretty big short position in it against the co-op contracts, when you pull that out and you're just looking at Texas by itself or Texas and the rest of the pro forma situation, it'll look slightly less hedged. But given that South Central is, give or take, a 20% kind of a number, if you look back at 4Q 2016 for 2018, we were about 44% hedged gas. And if now we're at 4Q 2017, looking at 2019, it's kind of 26%. So, that give or take, rough and tough, looks pretty similar to where we were on an apples-to-apples basis. Unfortunately, Q4 2017, Q4 2016 aren't apples-to-apples because of the South Central being pulled out of the numbers on the 2017 number. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. But I think it's fair to say that we were expecting a market tightening in Texas. We knew that the chronic prices that we experienced over six years were going to accelerate retirements or slow down new-builds. We positioned ourselves correctly. I think we will see the benefits in our portfolio. And we will execute on our strategy \u2013 on our hedging strategy just the way we have executed in the past. We're opportunistic based on our commodity price yield. We manage our credit ratios and our balance sheet. And now, we also have to be mindful that the synergies that exist between matching Generation and Retail. So, these are the three legs of our strategic hedging program. We are not deviating from that. And I think you should expect as the year progresses and the market reprices itself or re-rates itself that we will execute accordingly. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And that's all. I will see you at the end of the month. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you, Abe. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Sonia, and thank you again for your interest in NRG. We're very excited about the changes that we have made in our portfolio and our business. And I look forward to talking to all of you at the end of the month. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NRG Energy, Inc. First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Ayesha. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's first quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statement made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspectives. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation as well as the Risk Factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. Before we begin today, I want to take a moment to thank those who participated in our Analyst Day just about a month ago. It was a pleasure to share our story and value proposition with so many of you. It is an exciting time for our company, and I am confident that our path forward will create value for all of our stakeholders. So now turning to slide 3, I'd like to start by highlighting the three key messages for today's presentation. First, we are reporting strong financial results for the first quarter, up 43% from last year, while continuing to make good progress on our Transformation Plan objectives. Second, our integrated platform is well positioned for upside in our markets today and well into the future. This includes our position going into the summer in ERCOT. And, third, as we committed to you, we held an Analyst Day in March where we outlined our long-term strategic vision and plan and the significant excess cash we will be able to generate in the coming years. Moving to slide 4, let me review the financial and operational results for the quarter. We have again achieved top decile safety performance. I want to thank my colleagues for keeping safety a top priority, particularly as we continue to execute on asset sales and cost savings. We are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $549 million and maintaining our full-year guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Our first quarter result is 43% higher than it was last year, primarily driven by cost savings and higher prices due to cold weather in Texas and the Northeast. Also during the quarter, we continued to execute on all parts of our Transformation Plan. We remain on track to achieve our EBITDA-accretive targets of $590 million in cost savings and $215 million in margin enhancements. Regulatory approvals for our announced asset sales are progressing well, and we expect to close these transactions in the second half of 2018. Additionally, our XOOM Energy acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of this year. Our share buyback program is also underway. Through the end of the first quarter, we executed $93 million of share repurchases towards our $1 billion program. On the next two slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Analyst Day, starting with the steps we're taking to strengthen our business on slide 5. Our focus is on building a business that can create value today and into the future. We achieve this by being well-positioned in attractive markets and by providing stable and predictable earnings. Given market trends, the winning platform is increasingly customer driven. This is not just an attractive but an actionable opportunity for NRG. Our core competencies have always been generating electricity and selling it to retail customers. We have unique advantages in this space and can leverage our existing strength to redefine our business and focus on meeting customer demands. Our evolution has led us to right-size our generation fleet, as shown on the left side of the slide. We are now much better balanced between expected economic generation and retail load. But importantly, we maintain additional capacity, and while today it is not economic at current prices, it can serve as a backstop to our retail business during periods of high prices. Now by becoming better balanced, we increased the predictability of our earnings, while still maintaining attractive market opportunities. We have a scalable retail business with stable margins that will now represent about 60% of our EBITDA and a generation business that is well positioned for a market recovery. Moreover, the low capital intensity of our retail business combined with efficiencies in maintenance CapEx across the fleet enables us to convert almost $0.70 of every dollar of EBITDA to cash flow. The right side of the page is an illustration of our platform, stability and off-site. As you can see, our retail earnings are fairly stable whether prices go up or down, especially when you're out. Our generation business is more directly correlated to power prices and margins increase with rising power prices and decrease with falling prices. But they don't go all the way to zero because our generation is needed today. We will be compensated either through market prices or reliability payments. So when you combine these two businesses you get the pink line on the chart, an integrated platform with little margin downside and asymmetric upside. And this profile only improves as the portfolio becomes better balanced. Now turning to slide 6 with an overview of the financial priorities discussed at our Analyst Day. Starting on the left side with the details of our $215 million margin enhancement program; we remain on track to achieve our target and 2018 is critical in setting the foundation to achieve more significant increases in 2019 and 2020. The lion's share of our targets comes from our retail mass business through two types of initiatives, value expansion and customer growth. Value expansion includes things like improving our platform, increasing retention and adding products to our current offering. Customer growth focuses on our sales channels and the digital experience. Now to support these and all of our margin enhancement efforts, we're investing $75 million of cost to achieve in our business. On the right, we highlight our capital plan, which, first and foremost, supports running our business at the highest level of safety and operational performance. After these, we are focused on executing our plan to create $8 billion of excess cash by 2022, the result of our predictable earnings, Transformation Plan impacts, and some modest growth in our retail business. As we look to allocate this cash, our decision making will follow our stated capital allocation principles. Because we are on track to achieve 3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of this year, we have started to turn our attention to reinvesting in the business at/or above our target hurdle rate and returning capital to our shareholders. These efforts have already started with the acquisition of XOOM and the announcement of our $1 billion share buyback. So, before I leave our Analyst Day discussion, I want to summarize this conversation by putting in perspective just how much cash our strengthened platform can generate. For purely illustrative purposes, if we were to put our excess cash through 2022 into reinvestment at our target hurdle rate, it would more than double our free cash flow before growth from $1 billion today to $2.6 billion in 2022. Now, if we were to put our $8 billion of excess cash into share buybacks, we would be buying back 80% of our market cap today. I don't believe there are many businesses with this sort of financial flexibility, and we are fully committed to being excellent stewards of your capital as we continue to evolve and execute our plan. Now, moving to our markets, I'm starting with ERCOT on slide 7. Over the past few years, we highlighted the significant risk of retirements and the slowdown in new build, given persistent low power prices. Last year, we finally saw the retirement of about 4,200 megawatts of uneconomic coal generation, which tightened reserve margins. As a result, we are entering this summer with the lowest reserve margin on record at around 10%. Prices have responded accordingly with summer on-peak prices currently trading at about $150 per megawatt hour. Moving to the right side of the slide, our generation portfolio in ERCOT is well-positioned and leaning long for the balance of 2018, with only 74% of expected generation hedged. On the retail side, we are a little over 100% hedged against our contracted or priced-load for the balance of 2018. For this summer specifically, I feel very good about our position and the steps that we have taken to ensure our business is well-positioned for high prices. So, first, let's talk about our generation fleet. We are leaning long going into the summer. We have worked hard this spring outage season to ensure our units can withstand increased run times, given the expectation of high prices. And we have purchased outage insurance to mitigate the impact of unplanned outages. Second, our retail business, and as a matter of policy, is fully hedged against our priced-retail load. This is made up of not only internal hedges where we cross generation and retail, but also by market purchases. And as we have done in the past, we have purchased out of the money options to manage against high loads and high price conditions. Finally, we are working proactively to educate our customers and provide them with options and tools to manage their energy bills. I am very comfortable with the steps we have taken to strengthen and position our integrated business to benefit from upside this summer should prices materialize. So now turning to the east on slide 8; the PJM capacity auction for planning year 2021-2022 will be held later this month, and I wanted to briefly provide a few observations. Last auction saw a slowdown in new bills and over 7 gigawatts of announced retirements added to the PJM deactivation list this year. But there is still uncertainty on how these will play out in terms of market tightening. As you are aware, some generators are seeking compensation for plants that are not needed for reliability and not economically viable. While some entities are grasping a bailout in the short run, we see capacity rationalization as a necessary first step towards a healthy market. And we are confident that there will be continued support for the competitive market value proposition. Beyond PJM, our risk portfolio is well positioned given our fuel diversity and location near low pockets. We remain optimistic about the continued calls to action for pricing reform across markets, and we will continue our work with regulators and stakeholders to maintain the integrity and well-functioning of competitive markets. With that I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary you'll find on slide 10, first quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, which is a $164 million improvement over the first quarter of last year. Generation renewables delivered $172 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. Our retail and yield contributed $188 million and $189 million respectively. Our strong first quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices and retail load in Texas. Those results were further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization, as we continue our progress on the Transformation Plan. Although first quarter results were strong and summer prices in ERCOT remain robust, given we're still only a few months into 2018 with the summer still ahead of us, we're maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow. During the first quarter, NRG successfully re-priced our $1.9 billion term loan, reducing the LIBOR spread by 50 basis points to $175 million over, which will generate annual cash savings of approximately $9 million. Additionally, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, we've also entered into an agreement with a third party to sell our Canal 3 project, a transaction which will enhance 2018 capital available for allocation by approximately $130 million. And shortly after Analyst Day, we also completed the sale of Buckthorn Solar to NRG Yield, closing the first of several Transformation Plan asset sales we had announced in early February. And finally, we made good progress in the quarter on our share repurchase program, which was launched in early March following our earnings call and the subsequent announcement of changes to our board of directors. Through the first quarter, we exsiccated approximately $93 million of the $500 million share repurchase program at an average price of $29.75. We continue to actively repurchase shares in the market, and we'll provide an update on our progress on our second quarter call. We will also update intended timing for the second $500 million installment of share repurchases once we have closed a more substantial portion of the asset sales we had announced last February. Turning to slide 11, our expected 2018 NRG-level capital allocation is unchanged from the update we provided at Analyst Day. As a brief reminder, our 2018 remaining capital available taking into account both midpoint free cash flow and asset sale proceeds to net of previously-announced commitments including share repurchases, that remaining balance still stands at $668 million. And as I highlighted at Analyst Day, this amount is $55 million higher than our fourth quarter update as the pending sale of Canal 3 as well as the reduction in our cash reserve to ensure we hit our credit ratio target more than offset the $210 million we allocated towards the purchase of XOOM. Finally, on slide 12, taking into account the pro forma EBITDA impact of the XOOM acquisition and including both our minimum cash of $500 million as well as the revised 2018 debt reserve of $1.065 billion, we remain on track to achieve our target 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of 2018. Turning to a pro forma 2020 view of our ratios based on midpoint 2018 guidance and including the incremental contribution of $275 million in EBITDA from Transformation Plan savings and margin enhancements beyond 2018, we are also on track to maintain that target ratio through 2020. The combination of both the $275 million in additional Transformation Plan EBITDA and the elimination of adjustments for Midwest Generation, which are associated currently with the capacity monetization transaction, allows us to maintain that target ratio in 2020 without the need for additional cash reserve to do so. Beyond 2018, we expect that $1.065 billion in temporary cash reserve to be completely released. With that cash in turn being available for reinvestment or additional capital return to our shareholders. In the lower right of the slide, our pro forma 2020 excess cash including that release of the reserve and the ongoing robust free cash flow is over $4.3 billion. With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kirk. Now, turning to slide 14, I want to provide you with a few closing thoughts on our 2018 priorities and expectations. We remain focused on delivering on our Transformation Plan objectives. We are making good progress on completing our announced asset sales, and I look forward to providing you with updates relating to these transactions as we move into the second half of the year. We also continue to move closer to the final resolution of GenOn, which is expected to emerge from bankruptcy in 2018. And finally, our Analyst Day provided a longer-term strategic discussion of our business. Our path forward will generate significant excess cash by leveraging our strengths, capitalizing on market trends and making execution of our Transformation Plan our number one priority. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Ayesha, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, congratulations. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Julien. Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. So, perhaps just to kick it off, let's focus on ERCOT, seeing that where on the press this is summer here. Can you give us a little bit more commentary on how you think about your sensitivity? I know you released some kind of generic ones in the appendix here, but can you talk a little bit more about how you think about the potential upside in the 2018? You haven't updated that for a little bit here. You also cautioned that you're purchasing insurance and other things. I mean, should we think about the sensitivities here for 2018 as being fairly linear or is there sort of a capping out with collars and things like that? And then maybe a second question, at the same time, I'll throw it to you is, can you talk about the backwardation in the curve in 2019 and 2020 and just what you're seeing out there in terms of trends of new supply? Clearly, in recent weeks, we've seen some unmothballing of assets and things like that, so to be curious for an update. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Sure. Well, let me tackle the first one and then I'll turn it over to Chris. So, there's a few things that we did this time around on the earnings slides. The first is we provided you a position report specifically for Texas, which in the past we haven't done and we wanted to do that. So, people would at least have a view in terms of for balance of the year how we're positioned. Obviously, for competitive reasons, we cannot provide a breakdown month-by-month. Now, what we \u2013 like I said in the call, I mean, I feel very comfortable because we're actually going into the summer long. I'm not going to tell you how much, but we are. And we have complemented that with other things like additional insurance for any operational risk that we have. As a matter of fact, we have done that before. It has worked out very well for us and we just continue to do that going forward. The second thing is we provided also the sensitivities on the appendix and a change in terms of prices from where we set the guidance and where the market is today. I think if you use the sensitivities and our open position, you will get very close to where we actually at least expected prices will be paid. Obviously, we have to see how the summer plays out. Hopefully, with these two additional elements, you can at least have an idea of where, I would say, on a mark-to-market we would look like. But obviously, we have to wait for how things develop in Texas. Now, to your second question about the backwardation on the curve, Chris? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. It's obviously backwardated with $150 for this summer and then a $125-ish for 2019. Quite frankly, I still think 2019 has room to come up and we're pretty well set up for that with plenty of open space out in 2019 still. When the final CERA came out a couple of days ago, it did show things were 500 megawatts better than we thought, to your point mostly because of a couple of units that came back, Barney Davis was one. That was around 300 megawatts. Gibbons Creek I think was always in the numbers or at least was no surprise to the market that one was expected to come back. So, there was a little bit of move there for this summer. Interestingly though, if you go look at 2019, the reserve margin actually went down some. It was 11.7% I think in the last CERA and this CDR came out at about 11%. What they did there was they actually reduced load by 500 megawatts, and then actually reduced generation by 1,000 megawatts. So it's kind of going the wrong direction for them in 2019 with some of these assets (25:51), for instance, actually pushing back three years from 2019 to 2022, I think, was the was the most recent number there. So, we have to see how that works. I mean, obviously, part of the issue with the backwardation is going to impact that new build situation. I mean, we don't think at this point that it's high enough or long enough to incent new build, and we're hoping that the irrational new build is a thing of the past. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. And I think just if you look at our position for 2019 and 2020, we're pretty open. Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Very open. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: And we expect that backwardation will correct itself. Obviously, everybody is waiting to see how this summer plays out. But fundamentally, we believe 2019 and 2020 to have a lot more room, and we're well positioned for that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. And then just a quick little detail here on the structure of the buyback program. Just curious, the amount purchased of late just versus the target, you're still firmly committed to executing against the full number by the end of the year? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, Julien. I mean, my expectation is that we will be executing the $1 billion by end of 2018. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Congratulations on a good quarter. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Abe. Good morning. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Shifting to the cost cuts, is the $80 million that you did in Q1, is that all recurring? So will that just translate to $320 million by the end of the year? And then just a follow-up to that is where do you expect the balance of the cost cuts to come from? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So, the first \u2013 yeah, the $80 million is recurring. I think you were extrapolating that and multiplying by four. I think that's incorrect. I mean, we're going to see a ramp-up on cost savings as we go into the second and third quarter particularly, as you know, we have more clarity and visibility on the asset sales processes, and we continue to streamline the organization. So, I think what you should expect is a ramp-up as we go into Q2, Q3 and the end of the year, I mean. So, that's what I would caution you not to extrapolate the $80 million as you did. And then what was your last question? Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That was the \u2013 you answered both of them with that. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Okay, great. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. If your phone is on mute, please unmute it. Our next question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is now open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : A couple of my key questions were answered. The first one is \u2013 that hasn't been answered is looking at the performance of the retail segment in the quarter. It looks like you guys did phenomenally well in terms of not just EBITDA, but in terms of adding customer counts, but you're not necessarily counting that towards your sort of margin enhancement initiatives, right? That's coming from just underlying organic tailwinds. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. So, let me start and then I'll turn it over to Elizabeth. I mean, first, I think the result of Q1 is it was driven by the cost savings. I mean, you're starting to see the benefit of our cost savings initiative. Number two, if you'll remember, we had a very cold January, loads were pretty healthy in Texas and the Northeast. And so that basically drove two things; higher usage and in combination with cost savings, we were able to put these numbers for retail. Now, Elizabeth, I don't know if you have any additional comments or color in terms of the customer. Elizabeth R. Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Thank you, Mauricio, and thank you for the question. What I would say is the results for the first quarter versus first quarter last year, Mauricio touched on, they're split pretty evenly between lower operating cost, increased margin, and weather. And if you look at that and you think about, well, why is that not showing up in the margin enhancement for the program, it's because those numbers are net of operating expenses. So, we're making those investments. We are seeing increases in gross margin from some of the activities, but we're counting Transformation results on a net basis, not a gross basis. So, you'll continue to see that. And you're right on it being a large portion of the underlying engine that's creating that. And year-over-year, we have just over 45,000 customer count increase versus first quarter last year and also a couple of thousand in customer count growth just between year-end and now. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Kirk, any chance you can give us an insight into how many shares you've repurchased since the books closed on the quarter? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Greg, all I will tell you is that we're continuing to execute on buyback since the quarter end, and we're pleased with the progress, moving along nicely. That's all the level of detail that I'm going to share at this stage, but we'll certainly update when we get to the second quarter call. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Last question, you indicated in the release that part of the first quarter revenue result in the generation business was sale of NOx credits. Can you just tell us how much that was and whether we should consider that sort of a one-off or whether that's something that could be more built into a periodic ability to make ongoing sales? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Sure. Directionally, what I'd tell you is I think you probably find this in the details in our press release around the Gulf Coast region. I think we had a $57 million quarter-over-quarter increase and I'd think about that as being roughly 60%/40% NOx credits versus prices. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah, we had... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Sorry. Go ahead. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: No. I was just going to say that we've got a decent bank of those and while we don't have a staged programmatic program to roll those out. When we when we see good numbers, we may move some from here and there. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mauricio, a question on Texas, there's the old adage that the best cure for high prices are high prices. Just curious what your level of concern is regarding the price moves incentivizing new forms of generation and that doesn't necessarily have to be peaking or combined cycle gas. It could be significantly more than expected amounts of utility scale solar end of the market. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Okay. So, Michael, I mean, your question is the, what kind of pricing we need to see to incentivize new capital going into the market. I'm just trying to understand what... Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. I'm trying to get your view on whether you see an increase or a ramp in activity related to either new gas-fired generation coming back into Texas or significantly more amounts of utility scale solar coming to supply that high peak price? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Okay, got it. Well, I mean, the first thing is we need to see not only high prices to incentivize new capital going into the market but also, not only high prices but long enough so people feel comfortable making 20 year, 25 year investment decisions. So far, what we have seen is only the expectation on one summer of high prices and we just talked about the backwardation that exists in the curve in 2019. So what we need to see in an energy-only market, price is everything. It provides the right signal and incentive for developers and companies to start putting capital to work in that market. So, you need to see two things, you need to see them high enough and you need to see them long enough to attract this capital investment. Now, we are not seeing actually the contrary and we've been talking about it, the slowdown on new generation is very real and you can still see it in the latest CDR or CERA report that Texas put out. And I think Chris already mentioned some of these units are being pushed out one or two years. With respect to other technologies, I don't see that really taking off only with one year of high prices. I mean, they basically follow the same behavior as any combined cycle. I don't see Texas putting a program of out-of-market payments to see whether it's battery storage or other technologies like that. I mean, Texas has been very clear and ERCOT has been very clear in competitive market signals in energy-only market. And we just need to make sure that we just let it work. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. One quick follow-up. Does your analytical team believe outside of the retirements in PJM that have been announced already? There is another significant wave of retirements coming assuming no incremental subsidies versus what's already been announced. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Chris? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey, Michael. This is Chris. If I remember right, I think that the amount of unclear generation in the last auction boarded on 18,000. So, I think just doing the quick math I think that leans you towards, yeah, you probably got some other units out there that are teetering on the brink. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. Operator : Our next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Mauricio, in your comments, you had talked about the various puts and takes, pluses and minuses for the upcoming PJM capacity auction, ComEd and EMAAC specifically. At least when you put it all together, and I know bidding behavior obviously is impossible to map out from the outside, but generally speaking, your expectation because of the retirements that we should see some better pricing perhaps this year versus what we saw last year? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, I'm not going to speculate specifically on the pricing on the next capacity auction versus the 2021. What I will tell you and I think what we tried to put here are some of the big market drivers. Obviously, the retirements and the additional \u2013 I think we said a little over 7 gigawatts, close to 7.5 gigawatts have been added to the deactivation list. But obviously, that is uncertain because of all these out-of-market conversations that are happening today. Now, I am encouraged by seeing FERC and the different ISOs to take a very specific stance in terms of the protection of competitive markets and making sure that they don't negatively impact those markets. Now, I don't know what's going to happen in the next auction in terms of the slowdown in new builds. All we're saying is that in the last auction, we saw almost half of the new builds that we have seen in the last three years. And if that continues well, you can see that as a perhaps as a positive catalyst along with the retirements if they happen. On the other hand, you see obviously we just talked about state subsidies, zonal transfer and the stagnant load. So, I think you have pluses and minuses, it's very difficult, and I think at this point quite uncertain to determine the direction of where this can go. It's going to depend on the outcome of some of these out-of-market, I guess, out-of-market discussions that are happening now. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. Second question, and as you laid out right now on the buyback front excluding the first $500 million. And if I heard you right, the second $500 million gets firmed up once the asset sale process starts to close as well. But in the first $500 million, just curious, is that driven the liquidity as you're seeing it? Is it driven by the way you see the price which you think is being undervalued? Just curious how the thought process is in this current buyback program. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. This is Kirk. I mean obviously on the second part of that question, certainly it's driven by what we see as an attractive price in the market. But certainly, the other half of that, your instinct is correct. We want to strike a good balance between taking advantage of that attractive price and also managing our existing liquidity, which is certainly significantly enhanced as we move forward to making good on closing those asset sales. But as you know in following the company, the early part of the year, that is our more acute liquidity need. So, this allows us to strike that balance and still have good robust access to the market to take advantage of that stock price. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And last question. As you ramp up the margin enhancement program on the retail side, is there any concern that as part of that? I mean, the stickiness of customers and your competitors obviously watching your moves, is there any concern about customer churn as this program starts to get more active going forward? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Well, I mean, I think the margin enhancement, as I've said, this is not about just increasing prices. I mean, we went through a very detailed conversation during Analyst Day on how we're enhancing our platform both in terms of sales channels, products, and digital experience, and the technology platform that we have. So, I think what you need to think about the margin enhancement is not increasing prices. I mean, it is a lot more, and it's investing significant capital on it. I mean, we are devoting close to $75 million in supporting that margin enhancement. So, I don't expect \u2013 I don't think you should \u2013 our concern is not about increasing churn. And with respect to our competitors watching closely, we said, I mean, we're going to provide you a general view in terms of where we are going to make these investments and where we're getting the margin enhancement. But we're not going to provide what we think is competitively sensitive information or, as I said on the Analyst Day, the secret sauce of how we're going to get it. But, Elizabeth, is there anything else that you want to add on it? Elizabeth R. Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.: The only thing I would add is our strategy is to balance EBITDA and customer count. It's not to just maximize margins, as Mauricio said, and so one of the initiatives within our program is actually to improve retention performance and ensure that customers are accepting the offers that we give them. So, there is quite a bit of work going on, and we feel like our position with competitors actually through the margin enhancement program will get even stronger than it is now. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Can you hear me? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, Steve. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Now, we finally can hear you. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. All right. That was actually I just want to test that my phone is working. All set. Thank you. No. Okay. So, just on the \u2013 could you maybe just give a comment on how the asset sale program is progressing in terms of approvals and just have any issues come up? And I know you had a lot of leg work to do, particularly on the consents and such for NRG Yield. So just is your conviction higher today than where it was then when you announced that you'll get this done? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah, no. So, Steve, the approval process or processes are going very well. We're making a good progress. We have actually received now HSR approval for yield, renewables and ligand (43:22). And I mean in terms of yield, we have now received the majority consent on all of our contracts. So, we're making really good progress. I mean, if things continue like they are, my expectation is that we could potentially close on yield and renewables by September, early October. So, I know that we've been saying second half of the year, but I think if the progress that we're making today continues, I think there is an expectation that by September, October, we can we can close these transactions. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Well, with that, I want to thank you all for your interest in NRG and I look forward to continue our conversations in the weeks and months to come. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations, please go ahead. Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.: Great. Thank you, James. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's second quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcasts. As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statement made on this call, that may pertain to NRG Yield, will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation, as well as risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligations to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. And also, on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. I'd like to start with the key messages for the second quarter on slide 3. Our business performed exceptionally well during the quarter with earnings up 23% from the same period last year. We are making excellent progress on our Transformation Plan initiatives and we are on track to hit all targets. Finally, our portfolio is demonstrating once again the value of integration between retail and generation during the volatile summer months, particularly in Texas. I am very pleased with our results so far, and I am confident we are well positioned for the rest of the summer and beyond. So, now moving on to the highlights of the quarter on slide 4. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, we delivered $843 million of EBITDA during the second quarter, driven primarily by higher realized prices in Texas, higher retail loads, and the impact of accretive cost-savings. Kirk will provide additional color on our results and the impact on our credit metrics. For the first half of the year, our business has performed exceptionally well, but with the warmest and historically most volatile months still ahead of us, we are maintaining our 2018 EBITDA guidance range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. And as has been our practice, we will update our 2018 guidance and initiate 2019 guidance on the third quarter call. During the quarter, we also completed our first $500 million share buyback in which we repurchased almost 16 million shares at an average price of $31.80 per share. Our commitment to returning shareholder capital continues, and we are on track to execute on our second $500 million share buyback following the close of either NRG Yield and Renewables or our South Central portfolio. I also want to highlight the progress we have made on GenOn, which continues to move forward towards final resolution. In July, we executed a settlement in which we received associated releases from GenOn. And on August 15, we will terminate shared services. GenOn is planning to exit bankruptcy on October 1 of this year. We are also making significant progress on our Transformation Plan, which you can see by our scorecard on slide 5. During the quarter, we removed an additional $145 million of costs, bringing our savings through the end of June to $225 million and placing us well on the path to achieving our 2018 target. We also continue to make progress on our margin enhancement program. You will begin to see the results of this program on our scorecard during the second half of 2018 with the results really ramping up in 2019 and 2020. Both of our cost savings and our margin enhancement efforts remain on track for their current year and full plan targets. As you know, asset sales remain a key focus for the organization. We closed on the sale of Boston Energy Trading and Marketing or BETM and our Spanish Town asset, while reaching an agreement to sell our interest in two additional assets, Keystone and Conemaugh. We actually had anticipated selling these assets in 2019 but we were able to accelerate this timeline and execute on the opportunity to monetize these assets ahead of schedule. Our NRG Yield sales process is moving along very well. We have received all necessary regulatory approvals and are finalizing the consents. We are making every attempt to bring this to conclusion as swiftly as possible and are working hard to make this a third-quarter close. The sale of our South Central portfolio is also making good progress, and we continue to expect that this transaction will close in the second half of this year. Although we are in the middle of the summer in Texas, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the positioning of our integrated model on slide 6. And as you all know, ERCOT supply/demand balance is the tightest it has been in many, many years. Following the retirement of nearly 5 gigawatts in the past 12 months and steady load growth. This market tightening led to an increased probability of scarcity conditions this summer, which was reflected in higher forward prices. So far, demand has not disappointed, setting a new record peak of over 73 gigawatts in July. However, this record load was met with equally impressive reliability across the grid, which temper real-time pricing as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. In other words, it took nearly perfect system-wide reliability to meet the summer peak demand. Now, our generation fleet perform exceedingly well during this period, driven by the extensive planning and preparation we put going into the summer. I would like to commend our operational teams for achieving excellent results and having no recordable injuries during this recent heat wave. We also took measures to ensure the stability of our retail business. This included leveraging our integrated approach with generation to help manage supply cost and proactively helping our customers manage their bills. These tight market conditions in Texas also created longer term opportunities to ensure (00:08:26) the predictability of our earnings. We took advantage of higher prices and executed power hedges at attractive levels for the summers of 2019 and 2020. This is exactly the period that saw the majority of price increases. We also took the opportunity to hedge our shoulder months and off-peak periods with natural gas as a proxy for power in those same years. I mean, this summer so far has showcased the strength of our integrated model with complementary businesses that increase the predictability of our earnings. As I said before, we're only halfway through the summer and historically, the more volatile months are still ahead of us. So, we all at NRG remain focused across the organization on ensuring a successful summer. Now, moving to our market outlook and starting with ERCOT on slide 7. Much like this summer, the longer term outlook for ERCOT fundamentals remain very strong. As you can see on the left-hand chart, on a weather-normalized basis, total loads remain very robust and growing and continues to grow at 2% per year. This is a dynamic we don't expect to change anytime soon. We also continue to see project delays of new generation anywhere between three to five years. And given that forward prices remain below new build economics, we also don't anticipate this dynamic to change in the near term. So, bottom line, and for the foreseeable future, we expect tight reserve margins in ERCOT with higher probability of scarcity pricing and greater volatility as the system works to stay in balance. These conditions create an opportunity for both sides of our business and highlight the longer-term value of our integrated approach, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide. Our retail business is in a stronger position relative to other players in the market due to the integration with generation and a scalable customer acquisition and retention engine. Increasing loads means an increased opportunity for new customers while potential volatility creates opportunities to take market share from other competitors. And our generation business benefits from higher prices with greater opportunities to hedge the portfolio at attractive levels. Also, higher hedged prices allows us to invest in our fleet to achieve higher reliability, increase the predictability of our earnings, and mitigate the impact of volatility on our retail business. Now, onto the East on slide 8. PJM held its capacity auction for the planning year 2021-2022 this past May. The results reflected less new builds and significant amounts of unclear capacity, signaling more disciplined development and bidding behavior. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, on a same-store basis, NRG cleared more megawatts at higher prices than the previous auction. As we continue to optimize the fleet, we will focus on maintaining our assets in premium locations. We now have 85% of our PJM fleet in the premium ComEd zone, which, once again, separated to clear at a price of $196 per megawatt day. Throughout the East, we are encouraged by the multiple regulatory avenues for market reform that could benefit both our generation and retail businesses. For example, FERC recently committed to protecting PJM's capacity market against the impact of state-driven subsidized generation. It's clear to us that FERC wants to see the true cost of all resources reflected into the market by putting a price floor on subsidized generation. This is a strong and clear pro-competitive position coming out of FERC. As part of this process, FERC also requested additional comments on the possibility of carving out low and subsidized generation from the market. This is referred to as the Fixed Resource Requirement or FRR. We believe these requests for comments and the idea of taking single units out of the market is counter to the spirit of FERC's ruling. We remain confident that FERC will act consistent with the pro-market principles communicated in its recent orders and either fix the FRR, to ensure that it does not negatively impact price formation, or perhaps rejected in its entirety. That said, details matter and we're looking forward to actively engaging on this issue both with PJM and FERC. So, with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Mauricio. Turning first to the financial summary you'll find on slide 10. For the second quarter, NRG delivered $843 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is a 23% increase over the prior year. Our strong second quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices and retail load in Texas and further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization as we continue our progress on the Transformation Plan. And for the first half of the year, NRG has delivered nearly $1.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and our cost improvement program is only now beginning to hit its stride. Although we're very pleased with these year-to-date results and the summer prices in ERCOT continued to show strength, we are nonetheless maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow. I will note however that our first half results, combined with our outlook for the balance of the year, currently plays to our expectations for 2018, well above the midpoint of our guidance range. And we will update and narrow these ranges on our third quarter call. At that time, we'll also provide guidance for 2019, which will include the impact of more robust targets for cost savings and margin enhancements, with nearly $200 million in additional EBITDA expected from these initiatives in 2019 versus our 2018 targets. As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we've also completed phase one of our $1 billion share buyback program with 15.7 million shares repurchased at a price \u2013 average price of $31.80. We remain highly focused on closing our two large asset sale transactions, and we'll launch in the second half of that $1 billion share repurchase program following the first of these two transactions to close, which is likely to be the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables later this quarter. During the second quarter, we also completed the issuance of $575 million in new convertible notes with a coupon of 2.75%. By repurchasing an equivalent amount of NRG senior unsecured notes, NRG's aggregate debt balance will be unchanged, and we expect approximately $20 million in annual interest savings, further augmenting free cash flow as we retire shorter-dated and higher-coupon maturities. To this end, we've already repurchased $89 million of senior unsecured notes of varying maturities to-date and have recently provided notice to repurchase $486 million of the 2022 notes, our nearest maturities, which will mark the completion of the senior note refinancing associated with the convertible issuance. As a reminder, we've also targeted $640 million of debt reduction, which we expect to complete later this year in order to achieve our 3 times net-debt-to-EBITDA target ratio. And finally, this quarter, we successfully closed on the settlement with GenOn, which accelerated a significant portion of the items set forth in the original Restructuring Support Agreement, including the $261 million settlement payment by NRG and the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver, which were previously expected to take place at emergence. With the financial commitments associated with the GenOn bankruptcy now largely behind us and GenOn well advanced in its (00:17:40) efforts, GenOn is targeting an emergence from bankruptcy early in the fourth quarter. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to update our pro forma financial summary, which you'll find on slide 11. As a reminder, this summary is based on the midpoint of our consolidated 2018 guidance and provides a view of 2018 EBITDA and free cash flow from retained businesses, net of any contribution for businesses and assets we are selling as a part of the Transformation Plan. On the left side of the slide under the heading, prior pro forma, we start with the pro forma 2018 summary we provided on our last earnings call. Next, two second-quarter events gave rise to the need to adjust our pro forma view. First, the restructuring of the Ivanpah non-recourse project debt; and the amendment of some of the project's governing documents during the second quarter resulted in a change in the accounting treatment for Ivanpah. As a result, as of the second quarter, Ivanpah is no longer consolidated in NRG's financial statements but will appear as an equity investment. On a fully consolidated basis, Ivanpah's contribution to the midpoint of our EBITDA range was approximately $100 million. The impact of deconsolidation is the elimination of our partner's 45% share of Ivanpah EBITDA, leaving approximately $55 million of EBITDA from Ivanpah, reflecting only NRG's 55% stake in our revised pro forma. Importantly, aside from the impact of the income statement and adjusted EBITDA, Ivanpah's total non-recourse debt of approximately $1.1 billion will no longer appear on NRG's consolidated balance sheet. Turning to the second adjustment to our pro forma view, with the closing of the XOOM acquisition, we are adding the annualized expected EBITDA of $45 million from XOOM to the retail portion of our pro forma EBITDA. Of note, this is an annualized number for XOOM on a pro forma basis while the actual contribution for XOOM to our 2018 results will be a partial year, reflecting EBITDA only for the second half of the year. The EBITDA adjustment for deconsolidation of Ivanpah is offset by the addition of the annualized EBITDA for XOOM and, as a result, our total pro forma adjusted EBITDA remains $1.6 billion. The impact of Ivanpah's deconsolidation is limited to EBITDA and, as a result, the $45 million increase from EBITDA from XOOM is reflected in our revised pro forma consolidated free cash flow before growth, which is now approximately $1.05 billion. And finally, as I've noted previously, our pro forma EBITDA and free cash flow are based on the midpoint of 2018 guidance, which includes the impact of the 2018 Transformation Plan targets. Beyond 2018, we expect an additional $275 million of annual adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow by 2020 as the Transformation Plan reaches its final targets. Turning to slide 12 for a very brief update on 2018 capital allocation. Our 2018 capital available as well as our committed capital items are largely unchanged from the previous update. The only exception on the allocation front is having now settled most of the financial aspects of the GenOn bankruptcy, our capital outlay for GenOn has been reduced by $18 million to $160 million. As shown in the dotted box below the chart, the only capital allocation item associated with the GenOn settlement, which remains to be paid, is our annual pension contribution of approximately $14 million, which will take place in the second half of this year. As a result of both the reduction in committed capital towards GenOn, as well as the receipt of $12 million in proceeds from smaller asset sales previously not expected to occur until 2019, our remaining 2018 unallocated capital, shown on the far right, has increased by approximately $30 million, resulting in approximately $700 million in 2018 capital remaining to be allocated. Finally, on slide13, we've again provided the 2018 pro forma net debt to EBITDA calculation as well as the walk to our 2020 ratio, all based on our 2018 pro forma EBITDA. This calculation is based on revised pro forma EBITDA, which I reviewed earlier, and is largely unchanged from our previous disclosure. The adjustment for Ivanpah is now smaller due to the impact of deconsolidation. As a reminder, in 2018, we are temporarily reserving just over $1 billion in cash in order to achieve our 3 times net debt to EBITDA, and we expect this cash will be made available for capital allocation beyond 2018 as the additional EBITDA from the Transformation Plan initiatives, again beyond 2018, allows us to free up this cash by 2020 while still maintaining that important 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Having previously focused exclusively on 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio established with the Transformation Plan in these updates, this quarter, we're also providing two additional key credit metrics : adjusted cash from operations to net debt, as well as the cash interest coverage ratio to provide you a more complete picture of the strength of our balance sheet and credit profile. Although we remain a BB-rated company, this rating does not fully reflect the strength of these credit metrics. With consistent execution continuing to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our integrated platform, supported by our improved and simplified balance sheet, I believe we have the opportunity to earn and improve credit rating. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kirk. Turning to slide 16, I want to provide you with a few closing thoughts on our 2018 priorities and expectations. We continue to deliver solid financial and operational results while remaining on track with all of our cost and margin targets under our Transformation Plan. Our integrated platform is working as designed through the volatile summer months and remains well-positioned for tight market conditions in the future. As I said, winning the summer and closing on our announced asset sales is our most immediate focus. I look forward to updating you on our progress and providing you more clarity on our capital location as we move into the second half of the year. So, with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. James, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Yes, sir. Our first question will come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning. How are you? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good. Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. So, I wanted to follow up here on the asset sale progress. Just wanted to get a little bit of clarity. First, with respect to the next round of buybacks and capital allocation, would you expect to potentially provide that prior to the next third quarter call, seeing a timeline potentially on an expedited basis to close some of these larger transactions? And then, separately, with respect to the asset sales, how do you think about the execution of the balance, the smaller set that have yet to be announced? Obviously, you announced the Keystone/Conemaugh stuff today. But what's the commitment level? Have you kind of reviewed the balance of the portfolio? And are you opting to hold on to some of the smaller stuff? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, Julien. So let me start with the first one. I mean, we're going to launch the next round of \u2013 the next $500 million of share buyback once we close on either Yield, Renewables or our South Central portfolio. So, if that happens before our third quarter call, you will know and all the investors will know. With respect to your second question about the balance of the remaining asset sales, we're going to be providing you another update as we go through this evaluation towards the end of the year. But just keep in mind, I mean, right now, our focus is to close on these two transactions. And as we move into the year, the team is now shifting gears and evaluating the other asset that will be done for closing. Now, as you can tell, if we see an opportunity like we did with some of the asset sales that we accelerated from 2019 to 2018, we're going to do it. But I just want to make sure, I mean, all the resources that we have right now are completely focused in closing Yield and Renewables and South Central. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Understood. And then secondly, on retail, can you talk a little bit more about what you did in the quarter? You obviously alluded to it in the prepared remarks, but where does attrition stand today through kind of this period in August, and how do you think about the resiliency kind of going forward? Are you actually adding customers at this point? I mean, I'm just sort of curious. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So, let me start by saying that retail had a phenomenal quarter in the second quarter. We had warmer-than-normal temperatures. That basically pushed our loads and load usage. Keep in mind that we also added XOOM for one month. And Business Solutions also performed well. So, it was a good quarter all around for retail. But Elizabeth, I mean, with respect to some of the attrition questions. Elizabeth R. Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, Julien. We actually saw, as you can tell by our results, customer counts up over 10%, largely driven by XOOM. We have what I would call pretty steady attrition and retention performance. There's a little bit of pressure but nothing that, I would say, is out of the ordinary or unexpected. We're really pleased with the performance of both the acquisition and the retention engine through second quarter and are looking forward to a strong third and fourth quarter as well. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Bottom line, on track with the targets that you delineated previously on the retail side. Elizabeth R. Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, sir. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. Thank you, all. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Julien. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is now open. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations on a good quarter. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Greg. Thank you. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So, there's a bit of a debate in the market, Mauricio, that I'd like to hear your perspective on. On the one hand, the lack of really, really high levels of volatility this summer despite the strong load has been disconcerting to some investors who thought that those high levels of volatility would validate the thesis on the Texas market and your long-term view on power market there. But on the other hand, the lack of massive volatility has allowed you to continue to print stable profit margins and, actually, do some really solid hedging that may or may not have been actually maybe upside relative to what you promulgated in your outlook. So, from a business perspective, what would you rather see, the conditions you have now or massive levels of volatility that put more stress on the business and potentially bring a faster new entry cycle? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Well, first is the \u2013 I think you need to look at the fundamentals in Texas. And what I was very pleased to see this summer is that demand is real. I mean, setting a new record peak of 73.3 gigawatts in July, which is not normally even the month that you'll see the most extreme weather, was very encouraging. So, when you think about the fundamental picture of ERCOT, the supply/demand and the timings (00:29:57) that exist, it hasn't changed. And actually, this summer has validated that it's here for the foreseeable future. I think what you saw this summer is just a combination of a few things. One was a very strong demand, but that strong demand was met with, like I said, perfect performance by a degree. I mean, when I say perfect performance, you have to just look at the forced outages that we had in that peak there (00:30:22), and I mean, they were quite remarkable. And also wind performed, as expected, very close to normal. So, obviously, when you have this type of a situation, yeah, I mean, real-time prices were below what people were expecting. They are not necessarily low, but they were below what people were expecting. And from my perspective, we want a market that has very strong fundamentals and that has a really good market structure on both generation and retail like the one we have in Texas, so that is the perfect combination. We don't want to see a market that is clearing too low that necessarily doesn't reflect the fundamentals of the market and that's why we have been so, I guess, frustrated over the past couple of years in ERCOT. But also, we don't want to see a situation where you have a scarcity pricing that leads to perhaps shading low, and none of those two extremes are good for our franchise. Our integrated franchise of generation and retail is somewhere in the middle. So, the most important thing is that prices reflect the fundamentals of the market. And from where I see it, the fundamentals in Texas are incredibly strong. And they're going to be very strong for the foreseeable future. I mean, even if you look at the forward prices, I mean, they've been rising, but they are not at the point that are incentivized new-build economics. So, supply continues to be delay on new generation. Demand, we just saw that it was very strong. So, I mean, I want to see a market that is well-functioning, not that is bouncing on either side of the extremes. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you. And are you in a position now to tell us where inside the guidance range you're trending year-to-date? Or is the rest of the summer just too much of a wild card, and you rather wait till Q3 to tighten the outlook? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Greg, it's Kirk. I actually gave you a little bit of that in my remarks. I anticipated that question. And what I'd said, just to repeat, is the performance year-to-date, combined with our current outlook for the balance of the year places us well above the midpoint of our current guidance range. So, (00:32:44). Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Sorry if I missed that. Apologies. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: That's okay. It's okay. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : And then, I also saw there were a couple small retail transactions in the quarter that I just \u2013 can you give us some more details on customer counts or multiples to EBITDA on those, or were they just too small to call out? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, Greg. I mean, this is just the normal course of business. We actually buy books. I mean, we have an engine in Elizabeth and she's very effective in terms of identifying these opportunities. So, I wouldn't even think that they are representative of a transaction like XOOM. This is just a normal course of business. We're always looking for books that we can add to our retail business, and that's what they were. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you, guys. Take care. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Greg. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning and congratulations on solid progress across the board. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Abe. Good morning. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Based on the forward curves and your hedging today, could there be more cash available, I mean, over the next couple years above the $4.3 billion? And then, have your thoughts on capital allocation changed at all, and do you remain confident that share buybacks are the best way to get the stock high or closer to fair value? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Well, let me just start by saying that we're not going to front-run (00:34:20) our third quarter earnings call, which we're going to be providing guidance for 2019. My thoughts on share buybacks continue to be the same. And for that matter, all capital deployment, we're going to adhere strictly to our capital allocation principles. And as I see today, given where the price of our stock is, I don't think that there is any other more compelling and attractive investment than our own stock. So, until that changes, I think it's fair to assume that that's where we're going to be focusing on. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And then, shifting gears a little bit to Texas, can you discuss how you balance your hedging strategy with your fundamental view of the reserve margin and prices, particularly in 2020? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Sure. Chris Moser? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, Abe. This is Chris. Yeah. So, as we're looking at 2019 and 2020, obviously, we've got a view on where things should be compared to the clears that we're seeing. But make no mistake, as we did in 2019 and 2020 when prices get to be a good level and a good level above where it was 6, 8, 12 months ago, there's a certain amount of sense that comes from kind of sweeping some of that profit off the table and that's kind of the balance and the approach that we take. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. And just to make sure, I mean, most of the hedging happen in the summer of 2019 and the summer of 2020, right, Chris? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. The hedges that were put on in Q2, the power hedges were mainly summer on peak hedges. True. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. Got it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Good morning. So, on the on the N Yield (sic) [NRG Yield] (00:36:13) sale, you mentioned you're just finishing up getting consents. Could you be a little more specific on what consents you still need? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, Steve. Yes, I mean in the Yield and Renewables, like I said, I mean all regulatory approvals are done, consents, we're well on our way to have all of them. At this point, we're not providing any specific details in which ones are remaining but what I can tell you is that I have confidence that we're going to be in a position to close on the third quarter. That's what I will share on that, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: But we're making just great progress on the consents. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : That's great. And then just \u2013 this is just, to make it clear, the market. So, should we expect that this buyback will be announced \u2013 assuming that closes in Q3 and that's the first one, the buyback $500 million will be announced at that time? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah, not only will be announced, will be launched as soon as we close on that transaction. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Okay. And then, just in terms of the additional hedges how meaningful were they to your kind of 2019-2020 portfolio? How much more hedged are you? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah, Steve. If you look back in the Appendix, I don't \u2013 what is the page \u2013 page 21, you'll see the move there. We layered on a big chunk of natural gas equivalent hedges. Think of that as covering kind of the shoulder months and off-peak timeframe and the assets up in Chicago. And then you'll see that we did power hedging of 10% or 11% on an annual basis. But the hedge we're putting on were really more focused specifically in this summer. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. So, Steve, I mean, from a percentage standpoint, while it appears on that disclosure on an annualized basis, think of it as they were all put in the summer. So, the summer percentage was much higher than what is showing in the... Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean it was the mini part of the curve, right? It was the thick part of the curve that we were trying to sell and use the liquidity that was out there. I'm very happy with the hedge we put on for 2019 and 2020. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And just in that light, I mean, your three-year guidance goes all the way back to last fall. Obviously, Texas prices are meaningfully higher since then; natural might be a little lower. In the totality, though, are these hedges being put on at premiums to what your plan has been? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, Steve, just to be perfectly clear, I mean, what we provided was a pro forma based on \u2013 back then, 2017, with the impact of the Transformation Plan. And yes, I mean, if you look at the curve, all else equal, I mean, it's been a positive move. Kirk? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Steve, it's Kirk. First, overall the answer is yes. And the reason I say that is you can look no further to the fact that when we first established guidance for 2018, for example, that would be in the third quarter of the previous year, third quarter of 2017, generally speaking, our guidance is centered around the midpoint of our expectations, and those expectations are informed by what the summer prices are, in this case, in 2018 at that time. And, I think, since our pro forma view is all anchored on that 2018, the degree to which 2019 and 2020 summer prices today, for example, are higher than where 2018 summer was at the time we established our guidance, and I can tell you the answer to that question is yes and you can quantify it by looking back, that would give rise to the fact that all things being equal, that would give rise to an increase in that pro forma view since 2018 would be higher than it would 've been expected at that time. And as I said \u2013 I confirm that our expectations are well above the midpoint of our range currently for 2018. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : That's great. And one last, just quick thing on the Texas market, you mentioned a very strong plant performance and also, wind, I think being decent. Just how about demand response and how much is that impacting this in your thinking? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Sure. Chris? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. When I go back and if we look on the slide that Mauricio was talking about, I mean, load was about 500 megawatts \u2013 or just talking about the peak hour on the 19th there, load was around 500 megawatts higher or worse compared to the CERA expectation. You had generation around 1,000 megawatts better, which was just really flawless execution across the grid. And I'm happy to say we've put in some extra spring outages to be ready and that really paid off for us. We had fantastic performance from the operations group. So, anyway, so those two net out to be, give or take, 500 megawatts better than the CERA. And the CERA had around 1,000 megawatts of space in it. So, we really didn't get into the position where we needed a ton of other things to come to bear to save the market. I will say that the market \u2013 it was an interesting setup because Thursday wasn't supposed to be the high day. So, this is the 19th. It was supposed to be that following Monday, the 23rd, which was actually forecast at over 76,000 megawatts for the better part of that week. And so, I think a lot of the DR and whatnot was being prepared to be brought to bear on that Monday, and they may have missed the party a little bit because it turned out to be that Thursday was the high day. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Praful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. So, Kirk, just to clarify, on the EBITDA guidance well above the midpoint, is that for the retained assets or is there a split between what is retained and what is being sold in terms of what's kind of driving that uptick? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, I'm not going to get specific about breaking beyond what our official guidance is, which is consolidated guidance. But if you take a step back, the big portion of the adjustment, if you will, to get to a pro forma view is a portfolio that consists of two things primarily. One being LaGen, which is kind of an integrated type of business, not to say it doesn't have upside and downside. And the bulk of what remains is Yield, which is largely contracted, relatively low volatility, right? And you can look at it because Yield provides point estimates on their own guidance, which is largely unchanged. So, I think you can infer from that, to a large degree, that outlook is anchored off of our expectations for the balance of the portfolio. But I wouldn't go so far as to give you specifics other than I think it's reasonable to infer on the basis of what I just described. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. And that's super helpful color. All right. And secondly just following up on the ERCOT and PJM question. So, firstly on ERCOT, Mauricio, do you vary that if there is no spike in ERCOT and dry signal (00:43:31) in 2018 that you reach that point whereby 2019 or 2020, you have these unsustainable reserve margins which are so low that it's actually not suitable for your business? Is there a concern of that and how do you think that gets mitigated? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes, I mean, my concern is always that the prices do not reflect the fundamental view of the market. I mean, that to me is what keeps me up at night because if the prices don't reflect that, then developers, generators, we can't \u2013 perhaps we're making decisions with not the best information. Now, obviously real-time prices are just one aspect of it. I mean, you have to look at the day ahead. You have to look at the forwards, and most of the decisions are made on forward pricing. The day-ahead market is also an indication on how people get set up. And then real-time prices is what happens. I mean, so far we have been talking about real-time prices which basically was the result of perfect performance of the grid and a very strong demand. But as I think about 2019 and 2020, obviously I want to make sure that the prices are reflecting the fundamental situation in Texas. And to the extent that that lost, rational developments, rational market participants are going to react in the right way. So, that to me is the most important thing, strong fundamentals and a very strong market structure. That's what we're striving to do. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thank you. And then, finally, on PJM, as you said, I think it's clear that FERC wants to do the right thing here and create the competitive market or the right competitive marketing signals. But there's a pretty big gap between that and what the proposals are right now. Do you think there is enough time between now and January to get this done or do you think this gets pushed out to next year maybe? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: I mean, it's really hard to handicap the timing when it comes to FERC and when they're going to act. And so, I'm not going to venture into that. What I will tell you is just we have been very encouraged now for now a couple of orders on the position that FERC has taken in terms of protecting the integrity of competitive markets. If you go back to Mystic, the PJM and (00:46:10) capacity, I mean there has been a lot of consistency coming out of FERC. So, that's the data point that we have. Everything else we don't have the details, then it's a speculation. So, I don't think we will be venturing into something that we don't have enough information to even quantify. So, that's what I will say. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Really appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. So, okay, I'm going to go back to the share buybacks question. So, Kirk, you're saying that now you expect excess cash of almost $700 million. It seems like you do have a line of sight for the NRG Yield transaction closing and yet you are not launching the next batch of buybacks. What am I missing here? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, everything you just described is correct. The one thing to keep in mind is outside of the asset sale proceeds, which we've given some indication about timing, our organic free cash flow generation is relatively backend loaded, right? We need to get through the summer in order to start to build that cash. So, as we come into the fall, our cash balances begin to appreciate. In the interim during the summer months, while still waiting on that cash, that also tends to be the more significant draw in liquidity, which we have ample supply of, but we have to be prepared that if we do see scarcity pricing events or the anticipation thereof in the forward market, that then entails a need for posting additional collateral. So, we have to balance the liquidity, the reality that the organic cash flow is backend-loaded, supplemented by the receipt of the asset sale proceeds which is obviously determined on closing. So, all of those factor into that timing in terms of the expectation in terms of launching Phase 2. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. But just one more follow-up here, I mean you seem to be indicating that you will be waiting for the transaction to actually close, NRG Yield I'm talking. I thought in the past we were just talking about a line of sight of that transaction and I know that it might be probably just a small difference as far as time is concerned, but I mean are you basically depending on that cash really entering your bank accounts so desperately before the buyback can kick off? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Angie, this is Mauricio. I mean, well, first, we launched the first 500 megawatts because we felt comfortable that the transactions had been announced and we were making good progress. And I was very pleased with how we performed on this first 500 megawatts. The second 500 megawatts is going to be launched when we \u2013 at close. We feel comfortable with that. And, as Kirk is saying, I mean, we have to balance when those (00:49:23) are coming in and the back-end loaded of our cash flows come in in Q3 and Q4. Particularly with the type of volatility that we're seeing in the market, it is important that we take extra precaution. And then once we do that, then on the third quarter call, what I said is any remaining capital that is available for allocation, we'll be providing that clarity. So, I think that's the sequence that you should be expecting, Angie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And my last quick question. So, you showed us the performance on your retail and generation portfolio in the second quarter. Can you say what happened in July in Texas, if that strength, especially in retail earnings, continued? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, what I will tell you is that we actually, with the benefit of the pricing that we receive in the forward markets, we got ready, both on our generation and our retail business, to perform the way we have described we performed in July. I mean, aside from that information, I don't want to front run the earnings, the third quarter earnings where we're going to be talking specifically about the summer months. But I felt it was important that many of you are investors and wanted to know just what happened in this first month. And I think what I can tell you is that we're very pleased with the performance of the fleet. I'm very pleased with how our integrated platform performed as a whole, generation and retail in the first summer months. And that's \u2013 I mean, I think that's what I'm comfortable right now sharing with. I mean, like I said, we're just in the middle of the summer. I mean, the most volatile months are still ahead of us. Historically, August and September, that's where you see a lot of high \u2013 consecutive high temperature day. So, I want to make sure that the entire organization remains focused, and there's still a lot that can happen in the next two months. And I will be providing you an update on the third quarter call on what happened this summer. But so far, I feel very good. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Angie. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey guys, congrats on a good quarter and good first half of the year. I want to come back to the hedging slide a little bit, slide 22, but I'm just kind of comparing it to the same slide in the prior-quarter deck. And I'm just looking at the total forward hedged revenue number, and I'm only looking at 2019 and 2020. So, 2019, it's $1.2 billion and 2020, it's $828 million. If I look at that same slide for the first quarter, cumulatively, if I just take the differences between what you had hedged then and what you have hedged now, it's $1 billion, $600 million in one year, $400 million in 2020. Does that all just drop to the bottom line meaning that $600 million \u2013 I mean, that's $1 billion of incremental cash flow that will likely flow into NRG relative to what you may have thought or had hedged or had locked in three or four months ago. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Well, Michael, thank you and \u2013 I mean, keep in mind that this is just the top line. This is revenue. This is not gross margin. So, you have \u2013 first, you have another leg. I mean, you have to take into consideration what happened on the fuel side, right? I mean \u2013 and we haven't provided that here. And then secondly, I mean, I think as we have said, I mean, this reflects the hedging that we did, the incremental hedging that we did on both natural gas equivalents and power. So, I don't think you should have \u2013 this is an indication, this is a direction, but it's not a one-to-one drops to the bottom line. I mean, there are other things that are not captured completely in that line. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Right. But if I just think about the fuel side, I mean, we haven't seen PRB coal move a lot or lignite move a lot and I think you had probably already procured your uranium. So, it's really just \u2013 and gas prices haven't exactly spiked a ton in the last couple of months. So, unless it's just something dealing with the retail offset and maybe having retail contracts that don't just pass through the fuel clause, I would assume that at least a large portion of this incremental billion dollars would flow to you, if not all of it. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I mean, with respect to retail, keep in mind that in 2019 and 2020, I mean, any price changes affect every single retailer. So, I think the dynamic that we have seen when prices increase and benefits wholesale generation and perhaps it put some pressure on retail, that doesn't happen in 2019 and 2020 because all retailers are exposed to the same price of electricity. So, I think that addresses your concern around retail. And then with respect to \u2013 that's why we provide the sensitivities. I mean, I think the sensitivities give you a sense on how our portfolio behaves depending on the different market conditions. And I would actually \u2013 I think that's perhaps a more comprehensive way to look at the \u2013 how our portfolio will or how the changes in the prices will impact our portfolio. So, I would direct you more to the sensitivities as opposed to this one line that is very specific on revenue. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Much appreciated, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. With that, I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Gutierrez for closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, thank you. It was great talking to you and I look forward to continue our conversation in the third quarter call. Thank you, all. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NRG Energy Incorporated Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Joelle. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's third quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com, under Presentations and Webcasts. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And now with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer and also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. I'd like to start the call by highlighting the three key messages for today's presentation on slide 4. First, we continue to demonstrate the earnings predictability of our integrated platform. We are narrowing our 2018 earnings guidance to the upper half of the range and initiating 2019 financial guidance above our transformation plan pro forma. Second, we achieved a significant milestone in our efforts to right-size our business by closing on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. With the transformational plan, asset sales and cost savings nearly behind us, we're now pivoting to margin enhancement in 2019. Finally, we are announcing an incremental $500 million share repurchase in addition to the $1 billion announced earlier in the year. This brings our total share repurchase program to $1.5 billion and completes our 2018 capital allocation plan. Moving to our third quarter business update on slide 5, as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the third quarter, we delivered $677 million of adjusted EBITDA or 23% higher than last year. This was primarily driven by higher realized power prices and continued execution on accretive cost savings initiatives while achieving top quartile safety results. I am very pleased with the operational and financial performance of our integrated platform during a period of extreme price volatility. As we have discussed with you in the past, during periods of high prices, our Generation business benefits while our Retail business experiences some margin compression. It is exactly in this price environment that our platform demonstrates the benefits of the integrated model. Our year-to-date result now stand at $1.58 billion, a 34% increase from last year, allowing us to narrow our 2018 guidance range to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion which is at the upper half of our previous range when adjusted for asset sales. This is also the first quarter that our financial statements start reflecting our new simplified business model. Our total corporate debt is now at $6.5 billion or almost 60% lower than the previous quarter. This number includes $640 million of deleveraging completed in the last two months. During the third quarter we also launched the second $500 million share repurchase, following the close of NRG Yield and Renewables transactions, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the fundamental value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time. Looking ahead into 2019, we're initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion. This range reflects the strong fundamentals in our core markets and the confidence we have in achieving our transformation goals. This is yet another example of the stability and strength of our integrated platform, which will provide close to $2.6 billion of excess cash to be allocated in 2019. Later in the call, Kirk will provide additional details on both guidance ranges. Turning to slide 6 with our transformation plan update; we continue to execute on the plan initiatives during the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full-year 2018 targets. Through September 30, we have realized $375 million in cost savings, $24 million in maintenance CapEx reductions and $6 million in margin enhancement. Over the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on executing our cost savings and maintenance CapEx programs, while ramping up our margin enhancement initiatives. We continue to put in place the foundation for realizing margin improvement through multiple avenues, including expanding sales channels and products, streamlining transactions and enhancing IT systems for more sophisticated customer analytics. With respect to asset sales, during the quarter, we closed on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. We expect to close South Central by year-end as it is moving through the approval process with the LPSC and FERC, and Carlsbad will reach COD in the fourth quarter and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. We are also narrowing our asset sale proceeds from up to $3.2 billion to $3.1 billion. This is the result of having only Agua Caliente as the remaining assets with clear line of sight to close by year-end 2019. All other assets will remain in the portfolio at this time, given the improving market conditions. Finally, we are well on our way to achieve our leverage target of 3 times net debt to EBITDA by the end of 2018, after having executed our deleveraging objectives. Now, turning to slide 7 for a closer look at this summer; as you can see on the slide, weather was warmer than normal across our core markets, which led to higher demand, particularly in Texas, where we set a new record peak load of 73,000 megawatts. While loads were robust, actual prices were mixed across markets compared to expectations. In ERCOT, real-time prices came in significantly lower, as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. A combination of near perfect performance by generators during the July heat wave and milder temperatures in August resulted in prices 77% lower than it was expected at the beginning of the summer. In the west, California was a different story with prices settling well above expectations. This was mainly due to restricted gas deliverability. Looking ahead, we observe that the combination of once-through cooling unit retirements and the emergence of community-choice aggregators have resulted in recent increases to Western capacity prices. In the east, energy prices were pretty much in line with expectations and the focus is really on market reforms of both capacity and energy. Now looking forward on slide 8 and starting with our market outlook for ERCOT; as we have seen over the past year, reserve margins continue to tighten, driven by load growth, asset retirements, and additional delays or cancellations or new builds as developers are unable to justify long-term investments. On the top left-hand chart, you can see that reserve margins continue to be significantly below ERCOT's target for several years, highlighting the need for additional generation. Currently, the PUCT is considering positive changes to the ORDC scarcity pricing mechanism, to ensure the right price signals are sent to market participants. These potential regulatory changes, combined with low future reserve margins have pushed forward prices higher, particularly in 2019 and 2020. This move has been almost entirely driven by increases in the summer prices, where the market is now implying between 8 to 9 hours of prices at the cap. We have actually taken this as an opportunity to increase our hedge levels in 2019 and 2020, providing us with even more predictability on our earnings going forward. One area worth noting is that most of the current reserve margin is made up of capacity that comes from renewable generation. As you know, this is non-dispatchable capacity and therefore could potentially lead to fluctuations in the actual amount of generation available to serve load. Now moving to the East, the focus is on regulatory changes for both capacity and energy markets. As you know, FERC has stated that the existing capacity market in PJM is unjust and unreasonable, due to the negative impact of subsidized units. Let me reiterate that we believe a strong MOPR is the simplest and most effective way to reduce the harmful impact of subsidies on the capacity market. PJM and New England are also focusing on fuel security, which should lead to additional revenues for generators that have on-site fuel capabilities. This is very much at play, but all these regulatory changes are designed to improve the current status quo and are positive for our portfolio. Next month, it will be three years since I became CEO of the company and while this is not the quarter where we provide our capital allocation plan, I wanted to spend a minute talking about our capital allocation philosophy and track record, particularly in light of the financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves in the past few years. Turning to slide 9, you can see our capital allocation for the past three years. As you may recall, we initially focus on stabilizing our business by selling or closing underperforming assets, focusing on our core integrated business and strengthening our balance sheet. This resulted in most of our excess cash to be allocated to debt reduction in 2016 and 2017. With the announcement of our transformation plan and the rightsizing of our business, we created significant excess capital that we returned to our shareholders in 2018 through share repurchases given the undervaluation of our own stock. As we move into 2019 and given the excess cash potential of our business, which will be close to $2.6 billion even after the incremental $500 million share repurchase announced today, I want to reiterate to you that we will be absolutely disciplined in following our capital allocation principles that we have articulated to you and that you can see on this slide. I look forward to providing you with our 2019 capital allocation plan on the fourth quarter earnings call as we have done in the past. With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Mauricio. Turning first to the financial summary on slide 11, for the third quarter, NRG delivered $677 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 23% increase over last year. Having successfully closed the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables in August, our quarterly and year-to-date results now no longer include the contribution from these businesses, which are now treated as discontinued operations as a result of the sale. Through the first nine months of 2018, NRG has delivered nearly $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA with approximately $375 million of cost savings realized, which places us on track to achieving our 2018 cost savings target of $500 million. With these solid results and the important summer months now behind us, we're also narrowing and revising our 2018 guidance toward the upper half of our previous range, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly. With the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables transaction, combined with $640 million in discretionary debt redemptions which I'm pleased to announce, are now completed, we have now removed approximately $10 billion of debt from NRG's balance sheet in 2018. This not only significantly simplifies NRG's balance sheet for our investors but makes the achievement of our 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA target in 2018 all the more transparent. As you'll recall, part of our plan to achieve our target balance sheet ratio in 2018 included $640 million in debt repayment, which we achieved following the third quarter in two parts. First, in October, we redeemed the remaining $485 million balance of our 2022 senior notes, eliminating our nearest maturity in the process. Second, we repaid $155 million of our term loan facility. We are required under the terms of this facility to offer a portion of the proceeds from certain assets sales to the lenders at par. In keeping with this requirement, we have made this offer, and through an arrangement with a financial institution, effectively capped the amount of redemptions for which NRG is responsible at $155 million, which represents the balance required to achieve our debt reduction target for 2018. As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we have now fully funded the second phase of our $1 billion share buyback program. Following the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables, we put in place a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program or ASR with a financial institution. NRG initially received a base number of shares which will be supplemented with additional shares based on the average price of our stock over the program. The financial institution is continuing to execute share repurchases under the ASR which will be completed by the end of 2018. In addition, we now have a new authorization for an additional $500 million in share purchases which will be executed between now and into 2019. This brings the total amount of 2018 excess capital allocated to share buybacks to $1.5 billion or nearly 40% of our 2018 excess capital. Turning next to an update on our 2018 guidance which you'll find on slide 12, given the significant impact of deconsolidation, resulting from asset sales and our reported results in 2018, I'd like to first take a moment to provide you some context of our revised 2018 guidance. Looking at the table at the top of the slide and moving from left to right, we start with our previous guidance for 2018 which has remained unchanged since we first provided it about a year ago. That consulted guidance, included the expected full-year contribution from all of our businesses, including those which have now been sold. As you may recall from previous quarters, we have disclosed to you the full-year impact to the midpoint of our guidance from these 2018 asset sales which included everything we've closed on to-date such as NRG Yield, Renewables and our Boston Trading business or BETM, as well as our South Central business. Following the closing of South Central, which we continue to expect toward the end of 2018, the results of this business will also be treated as discontinued operations and will not appear in our results for the year. That second column reflects the midpoint EBITDA and free cash flow from these businesses based on our prior guidance or $1.2 billion and $590 million in EBITDA and free cash flow respectively. Deducting these amounts from our prior guidance allows you to see the contribution to that prior guidance range from businesses retained in 2018, which is reflected in the third column entitled, previous guidance adjusted for asset sales. This should provide you some context and reference for comparison for our revised 2018 guidance shown in the last column on the right. Based on the performance of our remaining businesses and our expectations for the balance of the year, our updated and narrowed guidance for 2018 is $1.7 billion to 1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion of free cash flow. Importantly, this revised guidance reflects the upper half of our previous guidance range adjusted for asset sales. Finally, at the bottom of the slide, there are a couple of items to note with respect to our 2018 revised guidance, which should also provide you some context when I review our 2019 financial guidance in a few moments. First, our revised guidance for 2018 still reflects the contribution from Agua Caliente, which we expect to sell to NRG Yield or Clearway in early 2019, as well as the partial year contribution from BETM, which was sold during 2018. In total, these two items represent approximately $120 million in adjusted EBITDA included within both the Generation segment, as well as our consolidated revised guidance. As BETM has now been sold and we expect Agua Caliente to be sold early in 2019, neither of these two items will contribute to our results going forward, and are thus not included in our 2019 financial guidance. Second, as you recall, we closed on XOOM Energy in mid-2018, which we expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our 2018 results. However, as we indicated when we announced the XOOM transaction during Analyst Day, we expect the full-year impact of XOOM to be approximately $45 million and our 2019 guidance reflects that. So, with that as a backdrop, I'd like to turn to 2019 guidance which you'll find on slide 13. 2019 will be the first year since we announced the transformation plan that our financial results will reflect our retained businesses and are simplified and further strengthen the balance sheet. Our guidance for 2019 is $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with $850 million to $950 million from Generation, and $1 billion to $1.1 billion from Retail. In the upper right of this slide, we provided a walk to help you understand our 2019 EBITDA guidance compared to our previous 2018 pro forma that was based on our original 2018 guidance. Our previous 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which was most recently found in our second quarter presentation, was $1.6 billion. To bridge to the $1.95 billion midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add two items. First, our 2019 guidance reflects the incremental impact of transformation plan initiatives versus 2018, which totaled $195 million. As you may recall, this consists of $500 million in 2018 cost savings, increasing to the $590 million run rate in 2019, and $30 million in 2018 margin enhancement which increases to $135 million in 2019. Second, to arrive at the midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add $150 million, which reflects the combined impact of increased power prices in 2019. Specifically, these increased prices benefit Generation EBITDA, just partially offset by higher supply costs that they represent for Retail. While we expect these higher supply costs to modestly impact 2019 Retail guidance, we expect them to be recoverable beyond 2019. Next on slide 14, I'd like to provide a brief update on 2018 capital allocation. As usual, you'll find all the changes to this update versus the update we previously provided in the second quarter, highlighted in blue. As you can see, primarily driven by a $500 million increase in capital allocated to share repurchases, which reflects a reserve for our new buyback authorization. We have now fully allocated our 2018 excess capital with approximately $80 million of total capital allocated toward our deleveraging targets and returning capital to shareholders, primarily through share buybacks. The remaining changes since our last update are summarized in the upper right of the slide, and primarily consists of the following : First, as shown in Item A, based on discussions with NRG Yield or Clearway and the expected COD for Carlsbad later this year, we now expect to close on the sale of that asset in the first quarter, which shifts about $365 million in capital from 2018 to early 2019. Next, based on the increase in 2018 EBITDA, which positively impacts our leverage ratio, we are able to reduce the temporary cash reserve needed to achieve this ratio in 2018 by approximately $150 million. This is partially offset by about $45 million of debt premiums and fees associated with both the $640 million in debt redemptions I've mentioned earlier as well as other liability management activities year-to-date. Finally, we have reduced the expected allocation to transformation plan cost to achieve by $60 million, which we now expect to incur as a part of 2019 cap allocation, which I'll review next on slide 15. Turning to 2019 excess capital on slide 15, we begin with capital available of $1.4 billion, which is comprised of the midpoint of our 2019 free cash flow guidance plus about $70 million of unallocated 2018 capital from the previous slide. Next, we add $485 million in 2019 asset sale proceeds, which consists of approximately $365 million for Carlsbad and $120 million for Agua Caliente. Both of which are expected to close in the first quarter. Next is the full release of the remaining $915 million in 2018 cash temporarily reserved to ensure our 3 times ratio. Our higher midpoint EBITDA for 2019 allows us to fully release this remaining balance next year for capital allocation, as we will not require any excess cash in 2019 beyond simply our $500 million minimum cash balance to achieve our 3 times net debt to EBITDA ratio. I'll review all of this in further detail on the next slide, however it's important to note that as you may recall, our previous expectation, which was based on our pro forma cash walk was with \u2013 that we would still need to reserve about $450 million in capital or cash in 2019 for credit ratio purposes, making this capital previously unavailable until 2020. Our more robust EBITDA reflected in that 2019 guidance allows us to release this capital for allocation effectively one year earlier than previously expected, and is the reason why although we've now allocated an additional $500 million toward share repurchases, our cumulative excess capital through 2019 remains unchanged from our previous walk at $2.6 billion. Finally, turning to an update on our corporate credit metrics on slide 16. In column one, we've updated our 2018 ratio calculation, to reflect our increased revised pro forma EBITDA, which again allows us to reduce our 2018 cash reserve while maintaining three times net debt-to-EBITDA. Our pro forma 2018 debt reflects the third quarter balance reduced by $640 million in debt redemptions now completed, leading to $6.5 billion in total corporate debt at year-end 2018, which, after deducting our minimum cash of $500 million and $950 million of additional cash temporarily reserved in 2018 leads to $5.1 billion in 2018 net debt. For debt ratio purposes, we have adjusted our midpoint of our revised 2018 guidance range to reflect the removal of EBITDA from asset sales which still remains in our 2018 guidance, specifically Agua Caliente and BETM. And we've also added $20 million to adjust for the full year effect of XOOM. In total, this net adjustment of $100 million leads to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for ratio purposes of $1.65 billion for 2018. As we've done in prior quarters, we continue to adjust the EBITDA for ratio purposes, to reflect the impact of Midwest Gen capacity modernization which will only be necessary through 2019 as that is the final year of capacity sold forward, after which, we will count 100% of Midwest Gen EBITDA towards this ratio. Turning to 2019, as I mentioned earlier that $300 million increase in adjusted EBITDA based on the midpoint of 2019 guidance allows us to fully release that remaining $915 million of cash reserve, or basically three times the increased EBITDA, making this cash available for further allocation in 2019, while permitting us to maintain that important three times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Finally, as a reminder, in 2020 we still expect an additional $80 million in EBITDA for margin enhancement programs which increases to $215 million in 2020 versus $135 million in 2019. This additional upside, combined with the strength and resiliency of our integrated Retail and Generation platform, helps ensure that we can maintain and improve on our credit metrics without the need for additional capital in 2020. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Kirk. A few closing thoughts on our 2018 scorecard on slide 18. As you can tell, it has been quite a busy year so far and we have made excellent progress across the board on our 2018 priorities. I am very pleased with what our team have been able to accomplish. As I look forward to 2019, we're focusing our efforts into three key areas, redefining our business by further perfecting our integrated model; shifting the focus of our transformation plan to margin enhancement and completing the announced asset sales; and finally, disciplined allocation of the significant excess capital that we will have available. I am very excited about the future of our company. I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. So, with that, Joelle, we're ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, team. How are you? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, excellent. Hey, wanted to follow up a little bit on just the hedges here. I wanted to understand a little bit what's going on in Texas on 2020? There's been a little bit of a change in the weighted average hedge price there on a per-megawatt-hour basis. It seems as if you've largely kept the hedge percentage intact, but if you could elaborate a little bit here? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Sure. Well, as we were discussing \u2013 I mean, we're seeing power prices increase in 2019 and 2020. We actually have taken this opportunity to increase our hedges, and you know, most of the move has been around the summer. So, you can expect that the hedges that we have put in place have been really around the June through September strip. But, Chris, I mean, are there any \u2013 anything else, more details around our hedge strategy and then some of the dynamics you're seeing particularly in 2020? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I think when we're looking at hedging, we're looking at trying to lock in good numbers against the expected generation with the idea that we'll still leave some \u2013 you know, to cover up operational risk and load variability, obviously in combination with buying options, and weather options, and outage insurance, and the rest of that. What you probably \u2013 and we can dig into this later, Julien, but what you're probably looking at is, is as we try and take off the summers, especially in 2019, we were also doing longer dated pieces, not just summer. Those are done at a lower level. Obviously I'm selling April off-peak or around-the-clock, that's going to move the number down a little bit. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. So, that explains the move from $42 to $36? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : The bulk of it. Okay. Excellent. And then just secondly here, Mauricio, I mean, I think folks are taking note this morning of some of the changes on the board, but I also take note of your commentary earlier with respect to continued execution of the transformation plan. You've announced for the first time here, your 2019 full-year EBITDA, how do you think about continuing some of the cost savings that we've seen in 2018 into 2019? How do you think about what's reflected and ultimately, is there anything to be read from the changes on board here \u2013 I mean, on the board composition this morning too. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well, I don't think there is anything to read on the board composition. The entire board supported the transformation plan, including myself. Management is committed to executing our transformation plan and I think we have done excellent progress, with the \u2013 John decided to step down from the board and what I can tell you is that he's been a good and insightful board member and I look forward to continue having him as a long-term shareholder. So, I think we have the support from our shareholders in terms of our transformation plan, the direction that we are \u2013 that we're going. Did that answer all your question, Julien? I know that it was \u2013 I think a two or three-part question. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Well, I \u2013 yeah. Well, I mean, maybe the \u2013 to be a little bit more direct about this, how are your transformation plans shaping up for further cost savings into 2019? Obviously you're holding on to a few more assets than you originally anticipated; does that provide for incremental cost savings and are you continuing to evaluate that at a board or even within the company from a cost savings perspective? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. So, with respect to the cost savings or on the transformation plan, we have line of sight on the $590 million. We're executing to that and that's going to start doing in \u2013 we're going to do that in 2019. Obviously, our cost savings, this is something that is a continuous improvement process. It doesn't end with a transformation plan. We're always looking at doing things more efficiently. So, we're going to continue doing that. And if there is an opportunity to reduce the cost on some of the assets that we're retaining, believe me, I mean, we are already looking at that and then evaluating that. So, I am very confident that we're going to achieve our numbers by \u2013 in 2019 and I am very confident also of the culture that we have on continuous improvement that I believe, you know, before transformation plan was for NRG and this is something that we all feel very strongly. So, I don't think you should expect that, you know, after the transformation plan this is basically done and over. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you all. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Julien. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning, guys. It's actually Phil here for Greg. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC : Phil. But... Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Phil, I'm sorry. Phil. We're getting a little echo here on our end. Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Let me try to adjust my headset. Anyway, congrats on the quarter. I just want to clarify a couple of items you discussed. So, to be clear, the incremental $500 million announced today, that's not allocated, it's not eating into the $2.6 billion CAFA that you're allocating for 2019. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: That is correct. Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC : So, theoretically, if you were to use all that for buybacks, you can allocate north of $3 billion from here. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. I mean, the $500 million plus $2.6 billion, yes, that's correct. Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC : Got you. In the 2019 guidance you laid out, is that marked to end of the quarter curves? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. So is it fair to say that where we sit from here today that curves look still a little bit better on a fresher mark-to-market or how are you \u2013 what are you seeing... Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. I mean, I would say that they are just a tad better, but keep in mind, when you're looking at the 2019 guidance, you have to take up a few things into consideration. Number one is power curves; number two, the level of hedges that we have. So, I mean it's not just one, and obviously supply cost for our Retail business. So, I mean, there's multiple things that you need to take into consideration, so it's not just one-dimensional. Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. And I guess to that point, I mean, yeah, Kirk, your commentary on Retail essentially with the higher wholesale prices going into 2019, you won't be able to capture that 1 :1 on the Retail side next year, but as you move through time, you can start to work that into future rates. So it's kind of a margin lag. Am I thinking about that correctly? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. That's correct and I mean, let me just \u2013 I mean as we have seen different prices is going to change a little bit the distribution between Generation and Retail in our earnings, but keep in mind, I mean from my perspective, what we are focused on is having an earnings profile that is stable and predictable for the integrated platform. So, if power prices are increasing, it benefits power generation business perhaps more than any part of Retail business and truly it's the other way. So \u2013 but at the end of the day, what we are focused on is the total earnings line of the integrated platform, and this is what we want to demonstrate, you know, the stability and predictability of our platform, which I think, we have done in 2018 and with the guidance we're providing today, it's a reaffirmation of that. Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC : Sure. And you've done a good job of that so far for sure. Last question, and then I'll cede the floor. Can you just provide any color or commentary around the 2020 trajectory from here, relative to 2019? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: I mean, what I will tell you, since we're only introducing 2019 guidance today, is, some of the drivers that you should be looking at for 2020 obviously is power prices, the hedges and something that Kirk was mentioning, which is, you know, some of the compression that we get by higher power prices in our Retail business. But aside from that, I will not \u2013 obviously, if the assumptions are the same in 2020 than in 2019, then you can make an inference of that. Obviously, you also have the incremental transformation plan targets that we have going in 2020, but I'm not going to \u2013 I'm not going to \u2013 and I'm not going to be providing 2020 guidance in the call. Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. Thanks, guys. Congrats. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Congratulations. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Abe. Good morning. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. With the backwardation in the Texas prices, at least the ones that are quoted right now, can you remind us what Retail's positive sensitivity is for lower prices, you know, absent the margin enhancement program? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we haven't provided the specific sensitivity on our Retail business because \u2013 I mean, there is a number of things that come into play; it's not just the cost of our sales, but also you have to look at where your margins are, your attrition rates, your bad debts. So, it's not \u2013 I wouldn't say that it's as direct or as directly correlated as CDC in the Generation business. I mean, there is a lot more variable that needs to be taken into consideration. So, I think what I will tell you is, the benefits that we see on the Generation business tends to be one-to-one when power prices increase, and we have ability to pass some of that to our Retail customers, so, it's not one-to-one. That's why we say our Generation business tends to benefit more than it impacts our Retail business, but that's \u2013 I think that's the dynamic that \u2013 and the complementary nature of our business. And that's the level of detail that we're comfortable providing. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then on 2018, the implied Q4 guidance is a lot lower than Retail and Generation have done in the prior years; is there something unique about this year in Q4? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: No. Nothing unique at all. It's kind of difficult to extrapolate from there, because remember \u2013 and again I'm not sure if you're referencing, when you talk about Retail and Generation, those two being the significant component parts of our overall performance in our guidance. In the past, Retail is basically same store from that perspective, but as a reminder, Generation, which we used to call Generation & Renewables for an obvious reason, included everything. So, I'm not sure whether you're accounting for the fact that we've significantly streamlined and changed the overall makeup of the portfolio, but in the context of the assets that remain, which is a phrase or a term that I used in my remarks, fourth quarter is in line with what we would normally expect. Just a lot of noise with things moving in and out this quarter. Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. So, two questions. So, one is, in the past you've mentioned that you were planning to acquire some retail businesses in the Northeast. Well, you haven't announced anything yet and just wondering if we're waiting for cash to come in from the Louisiana assets or if there's any other limiting factor here. And also, if you could put it in the context, so you have $2.6 billion in cash to be allocated. I understand that there are only really two ways to allocate it; one is that retail acquisition and the other one is buybacks, and is it safe to say that given the size of retail books that are available, only about maybe $700 million of that could be spent on Retail? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, Angie. So, let me tackle your \u2013 the first part of your question. Just to be completely clear, what I have said in the past is that we're going to be looking at perfecting our integrated model. In the East, we have more Generation than Retail, so we can actually achieve that rebalancing in two ways. We can either grow our Retail business or we can reduce our Generation business. Both are available to us, and we know that the retail space has been very active, but \u2013 and if we see something that is consistent with our portfolio and meets our capital allocation and hurdle rates, then we're going to evaluate. But there are different ways that we can perfect our model, and we're not locked in or \u2013 to one specific one. To your second question around what we can do with our excess cash in 2019, I would say that there are three different ways that we can allocate it. One, we can always find opportunities to grow our portfolio, our business, if they are compelling. Two, we can return capital to shareholders both ways, share buybacks, given the undervaluation of our stock, it is today and as a preferred one, but we also have another avenue, and we are open to it if it's dividends. And then finally, we also have to evaluate, you know, continue paying down debt, and while we are completely comfortable with 3 times today, that doesn't mean that, in the future, it's something that we just set it and forget it. So, that's what I would characterize our capital allocation for 2019 or at least the philosophy. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And on an unrelated note, Midwest Gen, so, PJM will be reforming its MOPAR rule. It does sound like Illinois might be leaning towards stripping out all of their nuclear plants from the PJM auction, keeping the Illinois customers basically neutral as far as their capacity payments, which I understand, that the capacity payments would be coming then from coal plants like the ones that Midwest Gen owns. So, in that context, how do you see the earnings power of this portfolio going forward? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Okay. Chris, do you want to take that? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Angie, for that to happen, you need to believe two different things. You need to believe that Illinois is willing to quintuple the number of nuclear subsidies that they're already providing from 2,000 to give or take 10,000, which is hopefully a stretch. And then, you also have to believe that FERC will allow a state to subsidize one particular set of generation and crush wholesale prices, which is in direct opposition to what they've written in the past \u2013 previous three orders. So, I mean I think that's very theoretical, and I think there's a lot of wood to chop to get from here to there. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Angie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Praful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. So, I mainly wanted to get to the hedging a little bit, and link that with the drop we saw in the 2020 hedge prices. I guess you talked about, and we all know about the tight reserve margins in ERCOT; given that tight reserve margin, I would guess that your preference would be to keep it more open to benefit from tightening prices in the curves in 2020, and clearly the curve is right now are backwardated. So, I guess, just wanted to understand more broadly the hedging policy views, and then secondly, a little bit more clarity of the almost $6 drop in 2020, kind of what prompted that hedging if you're kind of seeing this more broader tightening in ERCOT? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Okay. Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: Praful, Chris again. So if you're looking at back on page 24 and you look at total Generation portfolio, when you look at the open heat rate, you'll see that 2020 went from pretty darn low to 27%, and nuclear went from relatively low to 36%. So what you have is two different moving pieces here. What you've got is a big hunk of hedges that went in, that were arguably not just summer, but they were full year, on-peak around the clock kind of numbers. And you also have the lot of small numbers which is, if you have a small number that was only summer, and then you mix that with a full year piece, which was, you know, and that second quantum was bigger than the first quantum, you're going to get a move there. Trust me, when we're selling 2020, the summers are included. So we're locking in \u2013 we're locking in big chunks of value. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's helpful. And so more broadly, just understanding the 2020 and just the hedging policy in general, is there a view that ERCOT is going to tighten further and that curves don't reflect that today and you want to keep more open or do you feel that the curves are relatively opportunistic or wherever there is an opportunity, you would go in and lock in further hedges? Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.: No, fair question. I mean, I think if you look at the position where we're sitting, 30% \u2013 basically 27% to 36% hedged depending on which chunk of the portfolio, coal and nuke or total, you know, I think that we're saying that this thing has some room to run, so we're only 27% hedged. Now, I will say that we've seen a nice price rally since the summer and there's plenty of expectation that the PUCT, later today, may make some changes to the ORDC pricing mechanics and we're hopeful that they do because newbuilds are either being pushed off or cancelled. So, something needs to happen and we \u2013 I encourage the PUCT to take action. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Praful, and let me just add; in 2020 we are 70% open. I think that should give you an indication, our view in the Texas market. We continue to see that is very constructive, but we want to be prudent. We saw a pretty significant increase in 2020 on prices. We reacted to it, we were opportunistic, we laid out some hedges, but keep in mind, we're still 70% open. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's helpful. And then just on capital allocation more broadly, clearly there is both a growth opportunity and a potential to buy back shares. From a growth perspective, is Retail the only direction you see or are there other avenues of growth that we should be thinking about, that will hit your return thresholds that you could also kind of look at? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: I mean there is \u2013 we see multiple avenues. I mean, clearly the one that has been getting more headlines is Retail, just because of the value proposition where Retail is today, the implied valuations that we have, and the fact that we can actually put it in our Retail business that is scalable. So, we can achieve significant cost synergies. But we see opportunities in other areas, we're evaluating them particularly on the business \u2013 business solutions side, working with our customers, and the one thing that I will say is Generation perhaps is limited, given the very long-term nature of the investments and the fact that we have \u2013 we're adhering to our capital allocation principles. So, I would characterize it that way and that informs more or less where we start we're looking at \u2013 where we are looking at possible opportunities. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Super helpful. Thank you, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. First up, Kirk, I guess just wanted to clarify the slide 12 numbers you gave us, as you walked from the pro forma to the actual guidance for 2018. So, if I read that right, there's about $145 million of EBITDA that you're adding back in for the BETM and so on and so forth, but the midpoint of the two adjusted guidances only went up by $55 million. So, what am I missing there in that math? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: I think the way that you've summarized that is effectively correct, right? Nominally speaking, you have a significant \u2013 a more significant increase, but thinking about it \u2013 and perhaps this is where you're going \u2013 thinking about \u2013 ignoring the nonrecurring elements, right? When I talk about nonrecurring elements, I'm talking about Agua Caliente, I'm talking about the BETM, the Boston Energy Trading business, which still is reflected in our numbers even though it was sold intra-year. Yeah, you've got about $50 million of sort of same-store outperformance, which is why I characterize it as towards the upper half of our previous range on an apples-to-apples basis, right? That was part of the reason why I unpacked that because, nominally speaking, relative to the $1.6 billion pro forma, it looks like $150 million higher, but when you adjust that for the asset sales, your number is probably the right way to think about that on a same-store basis \u2013 if that makes sense, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. But then, Kirk, if you take it to your next column, the updated and narrowed guidance column, you know, that number \u2013 shouldn't that \u2013 if you took the column before that, this previous guidance adjustment column, and moved right, shouldn't that have gone up by that $140 million that you're adding in there? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: No, it's the opposite. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. I'll come back to you guys on that. Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I know we'd get a follow-up call, but I'm happy to try to make that clearer. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. A separate question; I know that, obviously, you guys are not giving 2020 guidance here, but just in the context of your net debt EBITDA targets, certainly on the 2019 numbers, you're hitting those targets as the way you've laid out to us, but if this backwardation in the forward curve continues even with the margin enhancement improvement, I mean the sense is directionally 2020 EBITDA is slightly lower than 2019. So, does that figure into your calculations thinking about net debt to EBITDA if you were to use a 2020 denominator versus 2019, and how you might think about capital allocation in 2019 and maybe lay down more debt than you're currently showing us? Is that a fair way to think about this dynamic? Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.: I know the direction you're coming from. A couple of things of note, right. As I mentioned, you got $80 million of margin enhancement from 2019 to 2020. That's $135 million of margin enhancements in the 2019 number, going to $215 million in 2020, right? That's $240 million of debt capacity right there and I think we'll sort of take that as it comes going forward, but certainly, that provides a pretty significant cushion having achieved that in 2019 to get to that 3 times net debt to EBITDA ratio. But I don't feel at all that we're going to need to allocate additional capital to maintain the 3 times. As Mauricio said, we will always continue to reevaluate the three as we move forward. So, my bias would believe \u2013 would be if there is any additional delevering, it would be by our choice as opposed to, for a lack of a better phrase, by necessity in terms of just maintaining the three times, if that makes sense. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: That makes sense. Yes. Last question, Mauricio, as you look at all this excess capital that you are accumulating and as you said, the growth opportunities are fairly limited, Retail right now makes sense, but there isn't that much Retail; if we keep going down this road, and I'm not just talking 2019, but longer-term, is there a scenario where you just buy out and you know, just take the company private? I mean if you keep buying back stock with excess capital, where do we end then? Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Well \u2013 I mean I think our focus right now, like I said in the past, is to execute on our transformation plan and then as we laid out the long-term strategy of the company, it's very compelling. This is where we believe we can create maximum shareholder value. I will tell you, as you just mentioned, the excess capital that we have, and it's a \u2013 it's going to be \u2013 it's a priority for the board and for us, how to allocate this capital. I've said it on the call and I will reiterate that again, from where our stock is valued today, it does not reflect the fundamental value and buying back our stock is still the most compelling opportunity. So, this is where we're focused and as we progress in 2019, if we see opportunities, if we see other alternatives, we always have to look at them through the prism and through the barometer of the implied returns that we have in our own stock. So, we believe that we're on the right track, we have the right priorities, we're executing well, we have the right team and I'm just very pleased where the company is going. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Joelle. Well, I want to thank you all for your interest in NRG. Look forward to talking to you in the future. Thank you and have a great weekend. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded. And now I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Mr. Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today\u2019s presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I am joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. I\u2019d like to start the call by highlighting the three key messages for today\u2019s presentation on Slide 3. First, we continue to demonstrate the value of integration between retail and generation by delivering strong results in 2018 and reaffirming our 2019 guidance. Second, our coal market in Texas remains the most attractive in the country. Our balance and well hedge platform along with enhanced summer readiness programs, positions us to deliver more predictable results. And third, we continue to demonstrate our discipline on capital allocation by adhering to our stated principles and our commitment to being excellent stewards of your capital. Today we\u2019re announcing a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which will bring our total share repurchases in 2018 and 2019 to $2.5 billion. Moving to Slide 4 with the business and financial highlights. On the left hand side of this slide, you can see our 2018 scorecard. We laid out a very ambitious plan for the year and I am pleased to report that not only did we achieve our goals, but in many cases, we exceeded them. I want to recognize and commend the entire NRG team for their persistence, focus and great execution throughout the year. We achieved our best safety performance ever, our best environmental performance, deliver financial results in the upper half of our guidance and we completed $1.5 billion of share repurchases. With respect to our transformation plan, we delivered on all our goals. We exceeded our cost savings target, bringing our total savings to over 90% of our objective. We achieved our credit ratio target of 3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and we started to see the impact of our margin enhancement program, which will be a focus in 2019. Also earlier this month, we closed on the sale of South Central and Carlsbad. We did transactions, we have now successfully completed all identify assets sales, bringing total proceeds to $3 billion under the transformation plan. Outside of these plan, we also closed on the acquisition of XOOM Energy in the second quarter and GenOn fully emerged from bankruptcy in the fourth quarter. Finally, we hosted our Analyst Day last March, which many of you attended. We outline our long-term strategy to create significant shareholder value through perfecting our customer driven integrated power company, built on a portfolio of leading retail brands and diverse generation assets. On the right hand side of the slide, I want to provide you with a brief financial update for 2019. First, as a reflection of our confidence in the outlook for our business, we are reaffirming 2019 financial guidance and announcing the new $1 billion share repurchase program. Next, we are announcing up to $600 million, reserved for additional deleveraging to achieve investment grade metrics for our sector. Kirk, will discuss these further in his section. Turning to Slide 5. I want to give you an update on our key markets starting with ERCOT. As you all know, ERCOT\u2019s supply/demand balance is the tightest it has been in many years. The chart on the left shows the reserve margin by year and highlights how much of that reserve is composed of existing generation and how much of it is from new generation. As you can see, it because more dependent over time on new builds, particularly on wind and solar. For example, in 2020, ERCOT projects a 10% reserve margin, 3.5% coming from existing resources and the rest coming from new wind and solar. Just to be clear, this is equivalent to nearly 14 gigawatts of new renewable capacity that needs to come online in the next 16 months. Any deviation from that will take us back to single digit reserve margins. These dynamics has led us to much higher wholesale prices in the near-term, but in the medium to long-term prices are still lagging and remain below new build economics. Making it difficult for developers to justify 20 or 30 year investments. Both the PUCT and ERCOT are aware of the situation and have taken steps to improve the energy only market to better reflect scarcity conditions in the system. We believe these changes will have an impact on forward prices, helping justify long-term investments necessary to increase the reliability of the system in the long run. Now moving to the right side of the slide. For this summer, we have further enhanced our readiness programs. I feel good about our position and the steps that we have taken to ensure our business is well-positioned for current market conditions. First, let me talk about retail. Our practice is to have a fully cash position against our price retail load. This is made up of not only internal hedges where we cross generation and retail, but also through market purchases. We\u2019re also working proactively to educate our residential and business customers by providing them options and tools to manage higher energy bills. Specifically, we have been successful in expanding our demand response capabilities to help and manage load during peak conditions. For generation, we\u2019re working hard during the spring outage season to ensure our units can withstand increased run times, given the expectation of high prices. We also purchased outage insurance and plan to maintain generational length to further protect the platform from real-time price volatility, unplanned outages and higher retail loads. Last, while our platform today is best position to provide more predictable results relative to pure retailers or wholesale generators. We continue to take prudence and measurable steps to further enhance our platform. For example, with the expectation of higher volatility in the market, it creates an opportunity to acquire customers at-value. And given our scalable customer acquisition engine and our track record of integrating new businesses, we will be in the lookout for these opportunities in order to grow our business and increase market share. And as our retail business grows, our generation or supply business must grow with it. We have an opportunity to compliment our physical assets, which short to medium-term contracts or PPAs that better align with our load obligations. This strategy allows us to better serve our customers, improves our position management and it is capital-light. Lastly, we continue to take opportunities to hedge the portfolio at attractive levels beyond 2019. Higher hedge prices allow us to invest in our fleet to achieve increased reliability and increase the predictability of our earnings. Now, let\u2019s move to the East on Slide 6. Our focus remains on regulatory changes for both capacity and energy markets. In PJM, we remain confident that FERC will protect the integrity of competitive markets, while accommodating state clean energy initiatives. Although, our timeline for FERC action remains uncertain. We continue to believe a strong MOPR is the simplest and most effective way to reduce the harmful impact of nuclear subsidies on the capacity market. In New England, we are monitoring fuel security efforts. Although we maintain limited exposure to that ISO. We believe these regulatory changes are designed to improve the current status score and are positive for fuel security reforms overall. On the right side of the slide, the chart shows capacity revenues across the northeast markets. It is important to point out that we have a diversified portfolio in the northeast resulting in fairly steady revenues as you can see on the chart. As we enter 2019 with a renewed sense of purpose to bring the power of energy to people and organizations, it just seems appropriate to provide you a snapshot on our progress and just how far we\u2019ve come along this past three years in strengthening our business, which has resulted in the remarkable financial flexibility we\u2019re enjoying today. As you can see on Slide 7, the three areas of focus for the company to be successful in the long run were simplify and streamline our business, have an appropriate capital structure for our sector and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. First, we refocus our business on our core strengths of integrating retail and generation. We sold non-core assets or underperforming assets and we right size our generation portfolio to better match our retail business. Our business today, provides more predictable earnings as we integrate to cyclical but offsetting businesses. Second, we simplify our capital structure with the sale of NRG yield and the separation of GenOn. We also strengthen our balance sheet by deleveraging and targeting appropriate credit metrics for our sector. For 2019, our total debt will be 69% lower than it was three years ago. Finally, we have also significantly increased our financial flexibility by improving the amount of EBITDA that we convert to free cash flow. Today, close to $0.70 of every $1 are converted to free cash flow compared to only $0.25 three years ago. We are allocating these capital using a set of clear and transparent principles. As I have said in the past, there will be no surprises when it comes to capital allocation. So the bottom line is this. Our company today is a stronger than it has ever been and what gets me excited is that the best is still yet to come. We\u2019re now a streamline cash flow machine that for the first time have the financial flexibility to create significant and sustainable shareholder value. Now let\u2019s talk about capital allocation on Slide 8. Continuing with the then and now theme, you can see that our capital location is directly in line with our roadmap to value creation of stabilize, right size and now redefine our business. As you can see on the bar chart, in 2016 and 2017 we stabilized our business through significant deleveraging. If you recall, my first commitment to you three years ago was to leave no doubt in our balance sheet strength and that\u2019s where we focus our excess cash. Then in 2018, we achieved our revised credit metrics of three times net debt-to-EBITDA, leaving significant excess capital available to either grow our business or return capital to our shareholders. We executed the accretive XOOM retail transaction and return just over $1.25 billion of capital to shareholders, reducing our share count by roughly 15%. Turning to 2019, I want to highlight the steps we\u2019re taking to reposition and redefined the company for long term success. First, we\u2019re allocating up to $600 million of the leveraging. While three times satisfies our leaving out our balance sheet objective, we believe targeting investment grade metrics have some benefits. It will lower our cost of capital, achieving through savings and further improve our equity evaluation. Again, Kirk, we\u2019ll talk more about these in his section. But to be clear, we say up to $600 million of deleveraging, given that it can be achieve in two ways, growing EBITDA or reducing debt. Next, we are announcing a new $1 billion share repurchase program. I believe a predictable cash flow company like ours should regularly return capital to shareholders. I saw today share buybacks are the most efficient and compelling way to return capital to our shareholders, while also maintaining our current $0.12 per share dividend. Last and with about a third of our capital on committed, we will remain absolutely discipline in deploying the excess capital, adhering to our capital allocation principles as you can see them on the right side of the page. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kirk for the financial review. Kirk Andrews : Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 10, NRG finished 2018 with $1.777 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $1.1 billion in free cash flow before growth. In both cases, a 28% increase over 2017. Retail delivered a robust $952 million in adjusted EBITDA, $127 million improvement over last year, driven by margin enhancement, cost reduction initiatives, higher usage, the XOOM acquisition and higher demand response for megawatt sold. Generation EBITDA for 2018 was $825 million, a $261 million increase over 2017, primarily result of increased power prices in Texas and higher capacity prices in PJM. These 2018 results reflect the financial contribution from our ongoing businesses and exclude the impact of the sales of the South Central assets which closed in early February for $1 billion in gross proceeds. Under GAAP accounting, South Central is treated as discontinued operations and is therefore not part of our reported adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. The closing the South Central transaction when combined with today\u2019s announced closing of Carlsbad for $387 million brings our total asset sale gross proceeds received under the transformation plan to approximately $3 billion. Turning to the balance sheet. Having met our 2018 debt reduction goals and achieved our target credit metrics originally announced as part of the transformation plan. We are announcing today a revision to our target balance sheet metrics for 2019 and beyond. Our new target balance sheet ranges which I\u2019ll review in greater detail later are based on credit metrics consistent with investment grade ratings. We believe achieving these metrics will not only provide benefits to our balance sheet, but also further reinforced the stability of equity cash flows to help drive a more robust valuation metric for our stock. To ensure, we align our 2019 balance sheet metrics with these new ranges, we\u2019re reserving up to $600 million of 2019 capital for potential debt reduction. In addition, having completed our $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which was in an average price of $36.24 a share, we\u2019re now allocating $1 billion in 2019 capital towards our newly authorized share buyback program, which Mauricio mentioned earlier. Turning to our final report on 2018 capital allocation on Slide 11. Changes versus our last update, which are highlighted in blue, result primarily from the slight shift in timing of the receipt of these South Central proceeds into early 2019. And the release of the 2018 cash reserve which was used for credit ratio purposes. During 2018, we completed $1.25 billion of our $1.5 billion share repurchase program, while the balance of $250 million in repurchases under that program was completed in early 2019. We also received $58 million in net cash from insurance associated with the GenOn settlement, which helped offset a portion of our previously allocated settlement payments. With approximately $0.75 cents of every dollar of capital allocated in 2018 towards the return of shareholder capital or debt reduction, we ended 2018 with approximately $350 million in excess unallocated capital, which will form the basis of 2019 capital allocation. I\u2019ll review 2019 capital allocation in greater detail in a few moments, but I\u2019d like to turn to an update on our credit metrics including our new targets, which you\u2019ll find on Slide 12. Looking first at 2018, you\u2019ll see that our financial results, which reflected deconsolidation of South Central combined with our net debt balance, inclusive of the South Central proceeds, place us within our transformation plan target credit ratio of three times net debt-to-EBITDA. Turning to 2019 as indicated earlier, we are revising our target credit metrics to focus on ranges we believe are consistent with investment grade metrics. Highlighted at the bottom of the 2019 column all these revised target ranges which are 2.5 to 2.75 net debt-to-EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations to net debt of 27.5% to 32.5% and interest coverage of between 5.5 and 6.5 times. Although, we are not targeting a specific credit rating at this time, based on our current Standard & Poor\u2019s business risk rating affair, our revised targets replaces in line with investment grade metrics. The chart at the far right of the slide helps illustrate this. As many of you know, credit rating is a function of two key variables, credit metrics, which is shown on the horizontal axis and business risk on the vertical axis. The shaded grey area represents the approximate inflection point between high yield and investment grade, based on the relationship between these two variables, our objectives here are two-fold. First, moving our balance sheet ratios from our previous target to our revised targets, placing these metrics into investment grade territory based on that business risk rating. Second, we will continue to execute in order to demonstrate the cash flow resiliency and reduced risk inherent in our integrated platform, which will position us over time to earn an improved business rating. The combination of these two should place us on a strong footing to actually move our rating solidly to investment grade in the future. In other words, should we target a rating in the future that means solid BBB. In the near term, these new metrics provide other tangible benefits. By reducing debt, we reduced cash interest, which is accretive to free cash flow dollar for dollar due to our abundant NOL balance. This, of course, also improves our conversion factor of EBITDA into free cash flow as well. In addition, by further shrinking our balance sheet, we also strengthen and further reinforced the stability of our equity cash flows, which we believe merits a more robust valuation metric or a lower free cash flow yield. Finally, we also improve our credit worthiness, which may be further enhanced by future ratings increases, making us a stronger counterparty with reduced need for credit support or collateral, as we execute on our asset-light strategy via PPAs in lieu of physical generation. As shown in the 2019 guidance column, reducing debt by an additional $600 million and the associated reduction in interest expense would place our 2019 ratios near the midpoint of these target ranges. We have reserved up to $600 million in 2019 capital to ensure we will achieve these new targets in 2019. However, as increasing EBITDA and operating cash flow is an alternative means to achieve these targets as well, the actual amount of debt reduction required maybe less than the $600 million, we have currently reserved. By way of example and hypothetical, in the event, we find a strategically consistent superior return acquisition opportunity later in the year, the 2.5 turns or so of the EBITDA multiple, we pay in such an investment would represent \u2013 that would represent what we paid in that investment rather that would not require additional capital for that first 2.5 turns of the EBITDA, but merely serve to reduce the $600 million we\u2019ve currently reserved for debt reduction dollar for dollar. Turning to Slide 13 for an update on 2019 capital allocation having ended 2018 with $350 million in unallocated capital, we\u2019ve since supplemented that through the receipt of approximately $1.3 billion in net cash proceeds from the closing of the South Central and Carlsbad transactions. When combined with the midpoint of our 2019 free cash flow guidance, we expect approximately $3 billion in capital available for allocation in 2019. Our capital allocation announcements today combined with previously committed allocations represent approximately $2.1 billion of 2019 capital allocated or committed. This consists primarily of $665 million in capital toward debt reduction, including up to $600 million in deleveraging to achieve our new target credit metrics and $1.25 billion in share repurchases. 2019 share repurchase capital includes both a $1 billion program we announced today, plus $250 million of repurchases already completed in 2019, which represents the remaining balance of our $1.5 billion program we announced during 2018. As shown on the far right side of the slide, we have $872 million of excess 2019 capital to be allocated, which we expect to become available over the balance of the year, particularly during the summer months, which contribute the bulk of our 2019 free cash flow. Finally, this quarter please note, we\u2019ve included in the appendix a few revised slides for your reference, including wholesale open and effective gross margin for 2019 and 2020, as well as some new slides in the presentation summarizing regional capacity revenue. We hope these new disclosures will further enhance our understanding of the drivers of our future financial outlook. Back to you, Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kirk. I have a few final remarks on our priorities for the year on Slide 15. As always, our top priority is to deliver on our financial and operational objectives. We remain focused on executing on our transformation plan initiatives, as we direct our attention to margin enhancement in 2019. Like I said earlier, our company today is stronger than it has ever been. We are now a streamlined cash flow machine that for the first time have the financial flexibility to continue perfecting our platform to make it more balance and predictable, continue strengthening our balance sheet and consistently returning capital to shareholders. With these priorities, we believe we have an opportunity to create significant shareholder value in the long term. I am very proud of our progress, and I look forward to the next phase in our journey. Thank you. And with that Jonathan, we\u2019re ready to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your question, please. Greg Gordon : Hey, good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : So obviously, the results were great and the outlook for the year is still consistent with your prior expectations. I think the overall cash available for allocation is actually higher on the margin than what most people had expected, which is also good. But can you just talk a little bit more about the decision to allocate more capital to debt reduction less, therefore, being available for further buybacks? And how you come to the conclusion that, that over time is more value accretive because I think I understand the answer, but I\u2019d like to hear it from you guys? A - Mauricio Gutierrez Yes. So well, Greg, I mean, I\u2019ll give you a general perspective and then I\u2019ll let Kirk get into the specifics of why we think this is the area that represents investment grade type of metrics. And as we have done in the past, we are providing you not just our net debt-to-EBITDA, but also some of the cash flow credit metrics because, as you all know, we run this business for cash. In terms of \u2013 we outlined the benefit that we see in terms of moving towards a more robust credit metric level, I guess. One, it allows us to have access to lower cost of capital. It also reduce our interest expense. Importantly, as we move into an asset-light strategy or capital-light strategy to complement our physical assets, it makes us \u2013 it reduces the collateral that we need to post if we enter into these long-term PPAs. And I think it, ultimately, impacts the valuation of our equity. So we took all of these things into consideration to move us from where we \u2013 like I said, leaving out that level of three times that we feel very comfortable. It was appropriate with the risk profile of our business. As we have continued to evolve our business, and we can demonstrate the predictability and stability of it, then we have an opportunity to have a, I guess, a more direct impact on the valuation of our stock, when you look at all these three things in combination. It\u2019s not just our balance sheet, but it\u2019s also the opportunity to continue perfecting our platform and returning capital to shareholders in a consistent basis. But Kirk, in terms of specifically these ranges? Kirk Andrews : Sure, Greg. What I would start with is really the central focus that we always have, which is, we\u2019re focused on driving shareholder value. And you could probably list five or six, but I\u2019m going to use three ways to drive that value. I mean, the first one is disciplined capital allocation. That\u2019s obviously, what we\u2019ve been focusing on. That\u2019s how you build and maintain credibility with our owners at the end of the day. And we, obviously, plan to continue demonstrating that in 2019 and beyond. But more tangibly to state the bloody obvious, certainly, you can increase value by increasing earnings, growing the earnings, growing accretively, growing inorganically. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing. But we\u2019re also mindful of the fact that if you can drive the basis on which the stock is valued at the same time, you\u2019re driving value in two ways, right? And that helps kind of supercharge the value opportunity you have. Part of the reason, why we\u2019re buying back stock today is, we see it as a compelling investment. It\u2019s a compelling investment just based on traditional valuation metrics in the sector. We believe, we\u2019ve driven the risk profile of this business down, which should command a sea change in how that reduced business profile is reflected in a more robust valuation metric, as I said before. One of the ways, I think that it is a probable to do that is to derisk further the financial side of the balance sheet and that\u2019s obviously reducing the debt. We\u2019ve taken a look at different free cash flow yields in correlations with different levels of leverage and credit ratings, and there is some pretty compelling evidence across various sectors that basically indicated a strong correlation between those two. And so if we can be successful in driving those metrics down and ultimately, driving that rating up, we believe that\u2019s likely to drive more non-traditional investors in the stock, who are more used to investing in companies with more robust balance sheet. And when we combine that with the continued demonstration, as I said the resilience of our free cash flow, that\u2019s the best means to get that second punch, if you will to drive the stock up. First part is growing the EBITDA, the second driving the metric at which is valued. And that results \u2013 a strange way to answer a balance sheet question with the equity side of the equation, we\u2019re talking about deleveraging, I\u2019m happy to talk a little bit more about ratings or interest savings or things like that, but I think that\u2019s probably the leading basis on which we\u2019re looking at this change in our value \u2013 rather in our credit metrics. Greg Gordon : Yes. That makes sense to me. I mean, you\u2019re trading in an equity free cash flow yield approaching 14% and an unlevered free cash flow yield to the EV that\u2019s still close to 12%. And so just getting a couple of 100 basis points improvement in your free cash flow yield is like another $10 to $15 upside in the share price. So I \u2013 that resonates with me. Thank you. I\u2019ll Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Greg. You got it, Greg. You got it. Greg Gordon : There is lot of questions probably beyond that. So I\u2019ll jump off and go to the back at the queue. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Your question, please. Angie Storozynski : Good morning, guys. So I have a question about your retail growth, both the margin expansion on the organic basis and M&A. So give us a sense, where you are tracking versus those margin expansion targets that you gave us at the Analyst Day? And also, given that your peer has just announced a major acquisition or big acquisition, how \u2013 and if I understand it correctly, you\u2019re suggesting that you could actually have an M&A in the Retail business as well. How should we think about the whole retail component of your EBITDA going forward? Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Good morning, Angie. I think you laid out the question well. The way we think about our growth in retail is twofold. One, organic. And we\u2019ve had a lot of success, particularly in the East, but also in Texas of growing our business organically. We\u2019re targeting anywhere between 2% and 4% annual growth on our business. And then the second one is through M&A. And in the past, we\u2019ve said that when you look at our business, although we have made significant strides on rebalancing and rightsizing our portfolio. In the East, our generation business is bigger than our retail. So we\u2019ve been focusing, in trying to grow our retail business in the East. We believe that perhaps the most actionable opportunity today is on the retail side. We\u2019ve been very, very disciplined in terms of our capital allocation. We have established platform. So for the most part, we\u2019re looking at acquisitions that or opportunities that complement that existing platform. When we think that we can expand the platform like we did in \u2013 with XOOM last year that allows us to enter into the multi-level marketing, we will do that. But our focus is going to be a very disciplined approach on two things, one is, the \u2013 meeting the thresholds, the investment thresholds that we have and that we\u2019ve laid out to all of you. And second one is a very realistic view on the earnings potential of these businesses. I think we have an excellent track record in terms of being disciplined in deploying capital. And two, on delivering what we expect this business will deliver or that we have in our valuations. Now, in terms of our margin enhancement, I mean, the bulk of the margin enhancement is really around our residential and retail business, although generation and business solutions transform, and we have made good progress. What I can tell you is that we have spent the last 18 months working on these. First, identifying our initiatives then investing. And just in 2018, we\u2019re starting to see the fruits of this. We met our $30 million margin enhancement target. The bulk of it is going to come in, in 2019. That\u2019s where we expect the majority of the impact. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Elizabeth just to give you a quick update on where we are on our mass retail margin enhancement efforts. Elizabeth? Elizabeth Killinger : Sure. Thank you, Mauricio. Hey Angie, I would summarize a couple of thoughts for you. First on earnings growth between 2017 and 2018, our retail business grew by about 15% in earnings only 3% of that was from XOOM. And on the customer growth side, we grew about 15%, 445,000 customers, most of that was from our M&A activity, but we still have 30,000 customers that we grew organically in the business. So we have a really strong engine. So far, I\u2019m really pleased with the progress on our margin enhancement plans. You may remember from our Analyst Day, our efforts in the mass side of the business had two primary approaches, one was value expansion and that\u2019s from both retaining more customers. So we\u2019ve implemented predictive analytics tools and enhanced ones that we already had and had been using. We\u2019ve improved our customer experience at multiple tough points from billing to customer care to introducing apps that connect customers to more capabilities. And our value efforts give us better insight to match customers and products and maximize both acquisition and existing customer efforts during a pretty high pressure season for us both with competition and higher supply costs. And then on the customer growth efforts, that is really exciting. We\u2019ve expanded our channels and our footprint of our face-to-face reach, so that we can meet customers, where they are with compelling products and services in the East. That looks like both in electricity and natural gas portfolio, and we\u2019ve been able to grow that. And we\u2019ve seen double-digit improvements in our key sales metrics, as a result of our growth efforts. So we\u2019re really excited about the progress we\u2019ve made, and we\u2019re looking forward to continuing to deliver in 2019. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. I was just wondering how the growth targets that you laid out on the Analyst Day compared now to your outlook given that there\u2019s been probably some increase in the cost-to-serve load as we saw in 2018, probably even more so going forward, you do seem to be a bit short power in Texas. So I mean, again, is this embedded in your projections? Or should I think that that\u2019s actually driving your retail margins going forward? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean, if you think about our margin enhancement, that is independent to commodity price increases. I think the best way that I can characterize our margin enhancement is, it just makes our platform better, so regardless of the \u2013 where we are in the cycle now. The reality is when you combine margin enhancement with the dynamics that we\u2019re seeing in the commodity prices, I mean, yes, perhaps you can potentially mass the impact of margin enhancement. But the way we think about margin enhancement is completely independent from the underlying commodity price. And we are on track \u2013 yes, we\u2019re on track for 2019. Angie Storozynski : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Abe Azar from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Abe Azar : Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations on achieving your multiple goals for 2018. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Abe. Abe Azar : No problem. Looking forward, what do you mean by perfected customer-focus business model in your 2019 scorecard? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So we have gone through great changes inside our portfolio. We rightsize \u2013 first, we simplify the business by taking some non-core assets or underperforming financial assets. We focus on our generation retail integrated business. Then we rightsize it. So our generation portfolio is much better balanced than our retail. But we feel transform regional imbalances for lack of a better word. In the East, our generation portfolio is bigger than our retail. And in Texas, our retail business is slightly bigger than our generation fleet. So I think, there is an opportunity one to better balance those two, that\u2019s what I mean by perfecting it. And then number two, while our physical assets right now are the right ones to help us manage load, there\u2019s always an opportunity. Keep in mind that the customers are going to be determining what is the right mix of the generation assets that we need. When I say, customer-driven integrated platform, I mean it. I mean, the customers are going to determine what kind of supply they want to have. Is there going to be 50% renewables, 75% renewables, 100% grid power. So that\u2019s going to inform how we set off our generation portfolio, and there\u2019s an opportunity to perfect that. So that\u2019s what I mean by perfecting it. Now, what it means is from a practical standpoint, as I said, there is an opportunity right now to continue growing our retail business both organically and through M&A. But today, I don\u2019t see any opportunity that meets our investment thresholds on the generation side. And that\u2019s why we have initiated this capital-light, asset-light strategy, where we can actually contract short-term or medium-term contracts, PPAs to better manage and perhaps it even better aligns the load obligations that we have. We don\u2019t have. It\u2019s capital-light because we use developers that have perhaps low in terms of capital than we do and have a different risk profile when it comes to the residual value of these assets. And so we think it\u2019s a better match to help us complement our physical asset position. That\u2019s what I mean by perfecting the business. Abe Azar : Thank you. That makes a lot of sense. That\u2019s all I have today. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Abe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your question, please. Steve Fleishman : Yes. Hi, good morning. Just a quick question on the credit metrics and investment grade. Do you have any sense on if you execute on the metrics in 2019, as you stated just how long it might take the rating agencies to actually make you investment grade, like\u2026 Mauricio Gutierrez : Kirk? Kirk Andrews : Sure, Steve. I think that\u2019s probably going to be beyond \u2013 certainly beyond 2019 probably based on the dialog we\u2019ve had. Certainly, we\u2019ve enjoyed a lot of success with the rating agencies in the recent past to get them to upgrade us in the last year. So as you know, and understandably, they tend to be a little bit more lagging, they like to do their homework, come around to the new \u2013 both the new business risk profile, as well as the new financial profile. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s going to take a little time. I think that\u2019s fine. It probably will take at least 12 months to 18 months before we can get there. And part of that, as I said before, is the reason why we\u2019re targeting investment grade metrics is that\u2019s the first step in establishing the platform to get there. I think realistically speaking, and I alluded this in my remarks, we need to continue to demonstrate to the agencies as well as our equity investors that strength and resiliency of the platform because that\u2019s going to be a necessary catalyst over time to get them confident to reduce that business risk. And that\u2019s the reason, why I\u2019m giving it a little longer timeline, which is completely fine because it\u2019s really going to be the combination of, obviously, execute on the delevering, delivering the metrics and then walking that business risk up. You think both of those are really necessary conditions so that we\u2019re going to get to a here\u2019s the investment grade rating. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware, sitting in another region at the BBB minus level is not the right place to be. So if we\u2019re going to take that step and actually target a rating, as I said, we want to be solidly in that range and that\u2019s another reason, why that will take a little bit of time. But I think this puts us on the right path. But it\u2019s important to get at it soon so that we continue to back run to demonstrate that resiliency. And also at the same time on the equity side, trying to drive that valuation metric tighter on that free cash flow yield. So it \u2013 I would say, 12 months to 18 months at a minimum to get through that process. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And just one other question just on the kind of M&A opportunities, which it sounds like would be mainly focused in retail. Just \u2013 obviously, there is one transaction that\u2019s out there that there\u2019s supposedly a competitor process. Is this a \u2013 is there a broad set of opportunities? Or is it more limited to one or two that are out there? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Steve, I think, there\u2019s just a limited number of opportunities. I mean, limited in the sense of very large retail book. So I think there is going to be a lot of them in terms of small books. But we think of them as the day-to-day, we\u2019re going to be evaluating these, just like we have done in the past, and we\u2019re going to acquire these small books, as a normal course of business. But on the \u2013 let\u2019s say, on the slightly bigger because these are not necessarily large transactions, Steve. There\u2019s a limit in the number of opportunities. And like I said, we are \u2013 we know that we want to participate on this. We have an option to either grow organically or grow through M&A. And just, I mean, we\u2019re just going to be very disciplined. Very disciplined on two fronts, on the way we look at these businesses and the earnings power of these businesses; and secondly, on the value that we pay for these businesses and the combination of those two are going to \u2013 they have to meet our internal threshold. So I mean, those are the two things that I guess everybody should be thinking about. What do you expect from this business, and what you are willing to pay for this business. And I think we have a pretty good track record in terms of being disciplined on the value side and we\u2019ve been very realistic on delivering the earnings potential of these businesses or the earnings that we tell you, they\u2019re going to deliver. Steve Fleishman : Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me? Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. So quick follow-up on the credit side. I just wanted to clarify this, the reduction in debt that you\u2019re talking about the $600 million. Just what point in time do you decide to move forward with the \u2013 given the use of your terms that you reserved it in your capital allocation? And then secondly, let me just get this out of the way now two completely separately, but looking at the new hedge disclosures, can you give us a little bit more of an apples-to-apples sense how that looks quarter-over-quarter versus your last set of disclosures? Obviously, you\u2019re changing the numerator and the denominator a little bit here. So it\u2019s all fuzzy in the comparison. But I just wanted to understand incrementally how much more hedged? And kind of when you\u2019re thinking about the shifts here anything to note in terms of the competition or how you\u2019re thinking about it? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So let me turn it to Kirk for the credit metrics, and then Chris Moser can talk about the hedge. Kirk Andrews : Hey, Julien. So as far as the timing here, I think, that\u2019s really largely going to be governed by getting at this, what I call, efficiently from a capital perspective. I mean, if you look at our maturity for a second, I\u2019m sort of focused on the unsecured side for a second, given all the successes we\u2019ve had is what I often sort of refer to from time-to-time is we\u2019re kicking cans down the road, we\u2019re making hay while the sun shines and continue to refinance things. Our nearest maturity is 2024, not surprisingly, it also happens to be our nearest call window. So the next call window we have for that \u2013 or first call window, which is roughly half the coupon, so call it 103, spot of 125 is around May of this year. So if we\u2019re going to go to the unsecured side, I think that\u2019s probably the \u2013 if you want to call it, if you will, the temporal governor there, so that we know we got a price at which we can attack, not necessarily implying 100% certain. That\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going to go, but that\u2019s probably a good way to think about on the unsecured side. By the way, I think that maturity is probably about $730 million, so well enough there to satisfy the $600 million. The best and most efficient from a capital standpoint is on the foot side of that question. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a pretty significant term loan. That term loan actually matures sooner, that\u2019s in 2023 maturity. That one is available for us to delever at par. So it probably would be right now if you put a gun in my head or a combination of those two things. So that\u2019s probably the two buckets we look most closely to. But in terms of timing, I think about that May inflection point and after is being probably the bulk of that $600 million right now. Chris Moser : Julien, good morning. Chris here. As far as the hedge disclosures go, listen, we heard from a lot of you that the base load revenue hedge disclosures we used to do were at best insufficient and at worst confusing. So we decided to move to a regional gen portfolio and the full gross margin. In terms of apples-to-apples, you should think of us as that we\u2019ve been scaling sellers in 2020 with a combination of some summer and some around the clock as well. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But anything else to consider in the context of your hedging. Do you have disproportionate summer or exposure or any kind of \u2013 when you think about layering those in, is it that a premium or discount versus what you\u2019ve already locked in? Chris Moser : Yes. I mean, I think that the summer prices have been up slightly between the last disclosure and now. I wouldn\u2019t say materially, if we\u2019re talking about 2020, so to speak. I think that this summer, you got the low reserve margins and high prices. There\u2019s plenty of time for GenOn load to prepare for that. It\u2019s been a little rainy down there so far. And in the most recent way too early weather forecast, I\u2019ve been seen a little bearish Texas in 2019. I mean, it\u2019s pretty early to get that, but the first seasonal outlook I saw, I think it was from CWG, I\u2019m trying to remember. It had a kind of soft in Texas. I mean, 2020, you\u2019ve got a whole another year of load growth, which, according to the CDR 2,000 megawatts a year, I mean, and that\u2019s peak load growth going from 74.8 to 76.8. It\u2019s \u2013 Texas needs some new generation. A quick call out, I think, we\u2019re very \u2013 we\u2019d like to commend the Public Utilities Commission of Texas for taking the actions they\u2019ve did in terms of adjusting the ORDC out there. I think that\u2019s helpful. Obviously, we support a well-functioning market in Texas. We\u2019ve got way too big in investment down there not to. And I think we\u2019re responding in a bunch of different ways. I mean, we\u2019ve added some reliability work at plants working on some load management and that, and I think that ORDC changes help incent a load response, which is nothing, but helpful for a functioning market. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. I agree about the updated hedges. Thank you very much. Chris Moser : Awesome. Thanks, Julien. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your question, please. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hi, Praful. Praful Mehta : Hi. So quickly just on Slide 23, again on the hedge disclosure. It is helpful, I think to have it this way, so appreciate that. Just wanted to understand, does the chart then imply that for 2020, your hedge pricing is below the current forward curve because you have a 77 million negative on the mark to market. Is that a fair way to read that chart? Chris Moser : So I think the way to read that is that we\u2019ve been scaling sellers of 2020, as the market has continued to move up. Praful Mehta : Got you. So there is \u2013 effectively, the price points at which you\u2019re selling or the time of day you\u2019re \u2013 or the \u2013 you\u2019re not selling peak or you\u2019re not locking in hedge pricing that is peak. Is that a fair way to\u2026 Chris Moser : No, no, don\u2019t think about it like that. Don\u2019t think about it like that. Think about that if we sold peak, the peak has moved up since we sold it. And if we sold off peak, the off peak has moved up since we sold it. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re marking it against the relevant numbers. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, It\u2019s a mark-to-market, Praful calculation. So it takes into consideration, where we \u2013 what time of the day, or what, block of energy we sold in the market and then, just marking it against, where the last expectation is or where the forward market is. Chris Moser : Yes. It doesn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not commenting on we sold off peak, but the peak is up. I mean it\u2019s literally what sales that we make compared to where the market is now. And as you\u2019re scaling seller on the market that\u2019s moving up, you would see some mark to market losses, which is what you see on that chart. Mauricio Gutierrez : And if I can just make a comment because this is a, I think we heard loud and clear from our investors, we want to be very transparent in our disclosures. We want to provide disclosures that help you understand better our company and better the financials going forward. So we believe that moving into these open energy margin with the mark to market of all our hedges, not just power hedges, but all our hedges, just helps you better understand the model the potential \u2013 the earnings potential of our company. So we\u2019re going to continue to provide additional disclosures. But right now, we think that this move is a step on the right direction. Praful Mehta : Yes, agreed. And I think the mark to market the way you\u2019re describing it exactly is the right way for us to make it easier to read through. So appreciate it. Appreciate the disclosure. And just quickly on the second question, on the credit metrics now that you\u2019re transitioning to more investment grade profile, is that going to go hand in hand with hedge percentages as in, do you add more flexibility to how much you need to hedge going forward? And will that allow you to stay more open if you believe on a fundamental basis that curves don\u2019t reflect the true fundamentals in the 2020 or 2021 timeframe? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, I think Praful what you \u2013 what we \u2013 we don\u2019t look at the credit or the steps that we\u2019re taking on the balance sheet on isolation. I think Kirk already provided a pretty good overview that this is a combination of perfecting our business model and making it more predictable. So you\u2019re just describing what we used to do in the past, which was try to make our generation earnings more predictable. Well, if we are able to now combine it with a more balanced approach to retail, then we don\u2019t have to rely so much on the market. We can just point generation to retail. So one of the key priorities is a more predictable business, which you know, that will improve the assessment of rating agencies and the risk profile of our earnings. The second thing is the balance sheet and all the benefits that Kirk already explained around the balance sheet. And lastly is consistently returning capital to shareholders. If you think about those three priorities, I think we have a tremendous opportunity given the financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves to rerate the stock and to create shareholder value for \u2013 long-term shareholder value in the coming months and years. So it is a combination of all three things that we are looking to enhance the valuation of our equity. I think that\u2019s how you should think about it, they\u2019re all related. Praful Mehta : Got you. Fair enough. Thanks so much guys. Appreciate it. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Praful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. One question just on the move to investment grade, and then one or two follow-ups. Can you put a cash flow value like an annual cash flow value of, if you\u2019ve got investment grade, what would that mean in terms of either interest cost savings, reduced collateral or something else. I\u2019m just trying to quantify a little bit of what the free cash flow impact of going from sub high grade to \u2013 going from high yield to high grade? Kirk Andrews : All right, let me take that in two pieces. So the way I think about it, Michael, when you\u2019re telling me some [indiscernible] addressing your question. So step one is that incremental delevering, that will create some cash flow there. So rule of thumb, if you\u2019re talking about reducing interest with fund secured notes, with a coupon of 6, that 600 you\u2019re talking about, $35 million-plus or minus just nice round number 2 to 5. On an annualized basis, which I think, you find this about a little less than 2% accretive to the free cash flow. Over time, and I want to emphasize over time because that\u2019s the benefit and then the delay that comes with it of all of the success we\u2019ve had as extending maturities tax. When we go to refinance that debt, I think, relative to some investment grade \u2013 obviously, we\u2019re strong BB right now. Kind of rule of thumb, it depends on where the markets are. If you think about maybe 25 basis points type of improvement, could be a little more, could be a little less, but 25 basis points probably a decent rule of thumb. And we have to keep in mind also that one of the things that comes along with moving to investment grade, which by the way, is one of the other reasons to go to that strong investment grade if you decide to target the ratings is callable debt is no longer available, right? You\u2019re issuing bullets and that\u2019s understandable because it tends to be the case that you\u2019re a lot closer to have the treasuries if you\u2019re less volatile in interest rate environment. But if you ask me if there\u2019s one single cause I can think about it, it\u2019s probably that one. Not really offset by a benefit on covenants because we successfully taken most of the covenants on our unsecured notes to investment grade testing at this point. But again, going back to second part of my answer, yes, roughly 25 basis points plus or minus. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay. One question on the hedging. The revenue side, I think relatively easy to kind of back it \u2013 trying to back into that, but just trying to think to the fuel. So can you remind us for the Texas plants, what\u2019s the mix of 8,800 versus 8,400 versus lignite in terms of the coal being used? And kind of similar question for the Midwest gen plants? Kirk Andrews : So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve broken 8,800 and 8,400 before, but you can assume zero lignite and a mix of the 8,400 and 8,800 for both sets of generation facilities. Chris Moser : In Texas. Kirk Andrews : No, in Midwestern. Michael Lapides : So you\u2019re now using 8,400 because Midwest gen before your acquisition was predominantly 8,800, you\u2019re now using a mix of 8,400 and 8,800. So we should kind of look at where those both respective curves are trading and use some kind of blend between the two? Chris Moser : Yes. I mean the blend is different in the different regions. But it\u2019s fair to say that the \u2013 it\u2019s all PRB at this point that lignite is out of the question. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then thinking about the Texas coal plants. Just curious, your thoughts on the economics of both limestone and parish given, we\u2019ve seen a little bit move in the forward curves, but given how weak the off peak is, just kind of thought process of the viability of those coal plants and your views on viability of other coal plants in the Texas market and whether there\u2019s another wave of coal plant retirements coming? Chris Moser : Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say that as you go forward with \u2013 to your point, low off peaks, what you\u2019re seeing is a concentration of value on the peaks and then within the peaks, the concentration of value in the summer as well. And so with high forward summer prices that voice all bodes and certainly the coal plants do well in that scenario as well. If you run out the curve, 10 years or something like that, obviously things look different because it\u2019s a relatively backward dated curve when you get out that far. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay. Last item, Agua Caliente, how do you think about the timing of actually being able to do anything with it, just given some of the window comments and cash traps et cetera. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean, We are evaluating Agua Caliente, as you know, the expected sale to Clearway didn\u2019t happen, and we\u2019re going to be waiting for a better environment when we monetize that asset. It\u2019s contract is under long-term contracts. And it\u2019s not necessarily fits the profile of our current platform. So I mean we\u2019re going to look out beyond 2019 and evaluate the options. But I think we\u2019re not going to be forced to do something in a challenging environment. We\u2019re going to do it when we think are better times. And just, I mean, just as a way of just additional context, I mean, remember Agua Caliente is not in our 2019 financial guidance. So it really doesn\u2019t have an impact one way or another. Chris Moser : Hey Michael, I have one more follow-up thought on that. If you look at the shape of the reserve margins, we have \u2013 our version of it on Page 5 there, you see that as you get into 2022 and 2023 that you\u2019re back in that 7% range or something like that. And I would suggest that the pricing in 2022 and 2023 does not reflect a 7% reserve margin. So either the reserve margin is right, in which case the price is wrong or the price is right and the reserve margin is wrong. And so one of those two things had to give. But as of right now, they\u2019re in a state of call it, cognitive dissonance. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated. Operator : Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your question, please. Ali Agha : Good morning. Just couple of quick ones. One from a big picture perspective. If I look at the wholesale disclosure, you\u2019ve given us and the trends that you\u2019re showing us 2020 over 2019 and then a load on top of that the margin enhancement plans, you have over 2020 over 2019. So just from a big picture perspective, as we stand today is it fair to say that 2020 EBITDA is probably looking pretty flattish with 2019 that\u2019s the way to think about it? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean I think when you think about 2020, it looks pretty consistent with 2019. Obviously, there\u2019s always puts and takes. In 2020, we have the impact of margin enhancement, the curves are backward dated, so you have more degrees of freedom on your retail. On the generation side, your capacity is under some pressure. But so, I mean there are puts and takes, but it\u2019s pretty consistent year-over-year. Ali Agha : Got you. And then also to clarify, Mauricio, I think you recently mentioned that Agua Caliente, you said, is not in the 2019 forecast and maybe I misread. But I thought looking at one of your slides, that it included about $40 million of Agua Caliente in 2019? I think it\u2019s Slide 10 footnote? Can you just clarify that? Kirk Andrews : Yes. Ali, it\u2019s Kirk. That\u2019s distinction that I think we\u2019re making. So I think what Mauricio is referring to is our existing guidance range, which we established on our third quarter call. At that time, our expectation was Agua Caliente would be sold very early in the first quarter. So we did not bake that into our budgeting or forecasting for the year, that\u2019s the basis on which that guidance was established. Ali Agha : Okay. Kirk Andrews : Now let me say that why we\u2019ve got the footnote there, right? Now that we know Agua Caliente is not going to be sold, right. It is going to be \u2013 its results will be included in our financial results that\u2019s the distinction between the two. Ali Agha : Okay. But you didn\u2019t change, I mean, it\u2019s within the guidance range, but are we assuming that it\u2019s accretive? Kirk Andrews : Sorry, what was that Ali? Ali Agha : I was just thinking is it additive or is it replacing some other $40 million, so it doesn\u2019t really net-net make any change, I am just clarifying that? Kirk Andrews : Yes. Well, obviously we\u2019ve got a $200 million range on EBITDA. So certainly over time, the portfolio evolve, right. We reforecast, we take another look at it et cetera, et cetera. So it certainly included as we look at our expectations now going forward, but it\u2019s in the range. Ali Agha : Got you. And last question. Just to clarify that this $1 billion buyback again is the plan to complete that in calendar 2019 or does that sort of slip into 2020 as well? Mauricio Gutierrez : No, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re targeting 2019. Ali Agha : I see. Okay. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Agha. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any further remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Jonathan. It was good talking to all of you. I look forward to continuing our conversation in the days to come. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I\u2019m joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. I\u2019d like to start the call by highlighting the key messages for the first quarter on Slide 3. First, our business performed well during the quarter and in line with expectations, demonstrating the value of our integrated platform. We\u2019re also reaffirming our 2019 guidance ranges. Second, our integrated business is well-positioned for summer operations and the fundamentals in our core markets are getting stronger. Finally, we are on track to achieve our 2019 capital allocation goals, complete our current $1 billion share repurchase program, achieve our new credit metrics by year-end and provide you clarity on the remaining $872 million of excess cash by the third quarter earnings call. Moving to Slide 4, I want to review the financial and operational results for the quarter. We achieved top quartile safety performance and delivered $333 million of adjusted EBITDA. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have provided our EBITDA on a same-store basis, due to the changes we\u2019ve had in our generation portfolio, either through asset divestitures, retirements or deconsolidations. Our EBITDA increased by 15% from the same period last year, driven primarily by cost savings, higher realized power prices, partially offset by increases in retail supply costs. It is important to note that the distribution of our earnings has also changed with the third quarter now responsible for a larger percentage of earnings. Recognizing all of these changes, Kirk will provide additional details on the quarterly results in his section. We continue to make progress on our cost savings and margin enhancement targets. I\u2019m pleased to report that during the first quarter, we achieved $20 million of margin enhancement and that all transformation plan targets remain on track. We also completed $500 million of our current $1 billion share buyback program during the quarter, repurchasing over 4% of our market cap at an average price of $42.21 per share. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and plan to complete the remainder of the current $1 billion share repurchase program in 2019. Finally, we are getting ready for summer operations with an expanded spring outage program on our generation fleet and the activation of our summer readiness program across the company. These measures are taken to ensure NRG is able to provide safe and reliable performance during the summer months. Now turning to our market update on Slide 5. Starting with ERCOT, the supply demand balance remains the tightest it has ever been, following some plant retirements and sustained low growth. The chart in the upper left, which we first introduced on the fourth quarter call, shows how future reserve margins are dependent on new builds, particularly wind and solar. A closer look at this new capacity for 2020 and 2021 is in the table below. It highlights the lack of viable new builds necessary to keep pace with ERCOT\u2019s 2% annual demand growth. We see limited wind developed, given transmission constraints and a few large gas projects remaining in the CDR have already been delayed by an average of four years. We do, however, expect the majority of solar to be completed as purchased power agreements are executed, but remain skeptical of significant merchant developments given the economics. Both the PUCT and ERCOT understand the situation and have taken steps to improve the energy-only market to better reflect the scarcity conditions in the system. We believe these changes will have an impact on forward prices, eventually helping justify the long-term investments necessary to increase the reliability of the system in the long run. On the right-side of the slide, we highlight our readiness for this summer and the steps we have taken to further strengthen our integrated portfolio. Starting with Retail. We are proactively educating our residential and business customers and providing them with options and tools to manage higher energy bills. We\u2019re also providing energy conservation alerts and enhanced demand management options. Moving to Generation. As part of our summer readiness program, we are planning to return to service our Gregory plant, which has been offline since the fall of 2016, due to the bankruptcy the esteemed host. This is a 385 megawatt of combined cycle capacity that provides additional reliability to the ERCOT system ahead of the summer. Last, while our platform today is best positioned to provide more predictable results relative to pure retailers or wholesale generators, we continue to take prudent steps to further enhance our ERCOT business. Given our scalable platform and track record of integrating new businesses, the expected higher volatility in the market creates an opportunity to acquire small to medium-sized customers books and platforms to add value. And as I discussed last quarter, our Generation or supply business must grow with retail. We are well underway in executing our PPA strategy to complement our physical assets. This strategy allows us to better serve our customers, improves our position management and it is capital-light. I will provide you a more comprehensive update on the next earnings call. Now moving to the East markets on Slide 6, the focus remains on regulatory changes. Since our fourth quarter call, FERC has directed PJM and NYISO to implement tariff changes for fast start resources. This allows a whole new class of assets to set price. I mean, this is a clear positive for energy price formation in the East. PJM has also announced its intent to run the 2022, 2023 capacity auction in August under the existing market rules. The timeline for FERC action remains uncertain, but we remain confident that FERC will protect the integrity of competitive markets. We continue to view a strong MOPR of the simplest and most effective way to reduce the harmful impact of nuclear subsidies in the market. In ISO New England, a proposal has been put forth that would compensate generators for fuel scarcity. We continue to believe these changes are positive for fuel security reforms overall. However, reform is coming too slowly and the current ISO New England fuel security proposal pending at FERC is insufficient. We look forward to working with the ISO on this matter. Moving to the right-side of the slide, we highlight the strength and diversification of our Northeast portfolio. Our existing portfolio is primarily large capacity and fuel-resilient generation located in key load centers and provides a solid foundation for continued growth of our retail business in the region. While the regulatory activities in the region provide some uncertainty, we\u2019re optimistic about these regulatory outcomes and more importantly, believe our integrated [Technical Difficulty] well-suited to succeeding the region. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kirk for the financial review. Kirkland Andrews : Thank you, Mauricio. Starting with the summary of financial results you find on Slide 8, consolidated first quarter EBITDA was $333 million, with $153 million from Retail and $180 million from Generation. The bar charts in the center of the slide provide a walk from our first quarter 2018 consolidated EBITDA to this quarter\u2019s results. Starting on the left-side of this chart, we start with first quarter 2018 consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $336 million. Next, in order to arrive in an appropriate basis for comparison to 2019, we eliminate the impact of asset sales, retirements and deconsolidations from our first quarter 2018 results. The total EBITDA impact of these items is $47 million and is comprised of four elements. One, Ivanpah and Agua Caliente, which were fully consolidated in our first quarter 2018 results before circumstances required to change in accounting later in 2018 to equity method; second, BETM, which was included in our first quarter 2018 results, but was sold later in the year; third, the pro forma impact of the Cottonwood lease, which began in early 2019 following the sale of the South Central Portfolio; and finally, EBITDA from the Encina facility, which was retired when the Carlsbad plant was brought online at the end of 2018 and sold to Clearway. Deducting the $47 million impact of these items from first quarter 2018 results provides a baseline for comparison to our reported results for this quarter. From this new baseline, we address the quarter-to-quarter changes starting with three elements related to the Transformation Plan initiatives. First, we incurred $15 million in incremental SG&A expense related to margin enhancement programs, we expect to begin to produce results later in 2019. Next, we realized $20 million in EBITDA from our margin enhancement programs during the first quarter; and third, having delivered $80 million in Transformation Plan cost savings in the first quarter of 2018, we realized $130 million in savings this quarter or an incremental increase in savings of $51 million. Turning to Retail. Non-transformation Plan retail results for the quarter were $58 million lower, primarily due to increased supply cost and more favorable weather in the first quarter of 2018, which were partially offset by EBITDA from the XOOM acquisition. Finally, Generation results for the quarter were $46 million higher, primarily due to higher realized prices during the quarter. Both the higher retail supply costs and higher realized prices in Generation are in part the result of intersegment power sales between Generation and Retail, which are typically based on average annual power prices. As power prices in ERCOT have become increasingly seasonal with lower prices during the shorter periods, such as the first quarter and higher prices during the summer, the resulting annual average price implies a premium to observe pricing in the shoulder periods and a discount to pricing seen in the summer. The annual supply costs for Retail and annual revenues from Generation, which result from these intercompany sales based on average annual prices, will be no different than if those intercompany transactions were executed based on quarterly or seasonal pricing, since these prices form the basis for the annual average price used. As our consolidated results of $333 million for the quarter were in line with our expectations, we\u2019re reaffirming our 2019 guidance ranges. Turning to Slide 9. While our capital allocation plan for 2019 is unchanged from our previous update, we have now completed the first-half of our $1 billion 2019 share buyback program we announced in late February and will continue to repurchase shares to complete the balance of that program. We continue to expect $872 million of yet to be allocated excess capital in 2019, which will become available later this year as we generate the bulk of our free cash flow during the third quarter. We expect to provide an update on the intended use of that excess capital by our third quarter earnings call. Finally, we remain focused on our revised target investment-grade metrics in 2019, as shown on Slide 10, and are on track to achieve those metrics, including using up to $600 million in 2019 capital previously allocated to further reduce balance sheet debt. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to you, Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kirk. Now turning to Slide 12, a few closing thoughts on our 2019 priorities and expectations. I\u2019m very excited for 2019 with another year of strong execution. Our top priority is to further demonstrate the predictability of our integrated platform, achieve our new investment-grade credit metrics and deploy the nearly $900 million of remaining excess cash adhering to our transparent capital allocation principles. We also remain on track on all of our Transformation Plan targets, particularly as we continue to ramp up our margin enhancement initiatives throughout 2019. Our company today is stronger than it has ever been. And as I look to the summer and beyond, I\u2019m confident our platform is best positioned to deliver predictable results and create significant shareholder value in the long run. So with that, I want to thank you for your interest in NRG. Danielle, we\u2019re now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, so wanted to follow-up on a couple of quick things if you don\u2019t mind. First, perhaps this is more of a financial detail question, on the allocation question that you just raised across the year. What does that mean for the balance of the year, specifically looking at third quarter more from a year-over-year perspective as you think about it? Should we expect more of a positive impact on 3Q than you would have otherwise expected for the Retail segment specifically this year? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean, if you think about it now with the changes in our portfolio, the distribution of our earnings are now peak year for the summer months. And particularly, with the intersegment, I mean, you\u2019re going to see an average impact of the prices. While prices have increased in Retail, I guess, power prices have increased for the entire year just given the peakiness of the summer, you\u2019re going to see that impact in our results. Kirk? Kirkland Andrews : Yes, I think, I agree with that on \u2013 in isolation. When it comes specifically to the impact of the intercompany transfer, the dynamic that Mauricio described is correct from a standpoint of year-over-year supply cost, specifically related to that transfer. Overall, certainly, as you know, one, the third quarter in \u2013 on a consolidated basis is increasingly, as Mauricio said, the strongest contributor by far to our results. And so overall, you may see the overall comparison on Retail and Generation in that quarter overall being similar to the directions that you see on Slide 8 for the first quarter. But within that, going back to what I said in the first place, the supply cost related to the intercompany transfer will have the opposite comparison, as you indicated. But there\u2019s obviously a lot more than just intercompany transfer they contribute to our results. So, we certainly expect Generation to be relatively robust and just the overall EBITDA to be more significant than any other quarter of the year, it is \u2013 typically it\u2019s in the third. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. Following back to more of the fundamental, the core business. Can you provide a little bit more of your thoughts on what the impact of full FRR would be to the Midwest Gen Portfolio. I appreciate that you\u2019ve provided some Reg G segment specific disclosure, but it would be curious on how you think about that in financial impact and potential other plant decisions out in the four years? And then separately, Mauricio, can you elaborate very quickly on your commentary about procurement and renewal procurement, potentially later this year? Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. Well, let me start first with the impact of full FRR. And I\u2019m assuming that your question is just specific about Illinois and the impact that it has in our Midwest Generation Portfolio. So, before I turn it over to Chris for additional details, let me just say that, first, you have to put it in context. I don\u2019t think that outcome is a binary outcome, where one looses and the other one wins. We know that our Generation is needed for the common zone to maintain or to meet the expected load. With respect to the FRR, I mean, the states have always have the right to FRR completely if they wanted to. The specifics about how this time around will be done is less clear. There is a lot of a speculation whether certain units can FRR, whether the entire market needs to FRR, there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 there are a couple of considerations there. Remember, Illinois has retail choice, so it will be very difficult to FRR the entire region. But regardless of what the path that they take, we feel very comfortable that under the status quo, we are okay. If they decide \u2013 if FERC decides to implement some sort of RCO, resource carve-out with repricing, I think, we\u2019re better off. And if they decide to go ahead FRR, we don\u2019t have enough information to assess what the impact would be, but it\u2019s not zero since our units are needed. But with that, Chris, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else that you want to add. Chris Moser : No, I would \u2013 Julien, this is Chris. I would echo what Mauricio said, which is the details are going to matter and which path FERC ends up taking at Illinois, ends up taking are going to matter. What I will just echo is that, hey, look, in a 25,000 megawatts zone, they still need a big chunk of our units to clear that zone and to cover the load reliably. So I know that we outlined kind of the impact of Midwest Gen, what percent it is of our earnings in earlier calls and/or presentations. And I would say, I would expect that anything \u2013 any impact would be a fraction of that. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve said that in \u2013 approximately, it\u2019s about somewhat 5% of our total EBITDA. So let\u2019s just put it in context what the impact would be. But again, I think the important thing, this is not a binary outcome, a zero-sum game. With respect to your second question about the PPAs, we introduced our capital-light PPA strategy in the last earnings call. That team has made really good progress. We\u2019re in the middle of executing that right now, but we\u2019re not done yet. So where I\u2019m going to be providing you the more specifics around the progress on that strategy by the next earnings call, because as you hope, you can appreciate, we\u2019re in the middle of execution, and I don\u2019t want to impair our ability to get the best value on those \u2013 on that strategy. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you, all. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is now open. Greg Gordon : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : Just looking at the math here on the cost saves, it appears to me and I just wanted to confirm this that you had $532 million achieved in 2018. And the slide deck shows you have $51 million incremental achieved in Q1. So the targets $590 are basically at $583, so that would corroborate your view that you\u2019re pretty much on point on getting to the cost saves, right? Am I reading that correctly? Kirkland Andrews : Yes. I think, overall, that \u2013 that\u2019s a reasonable way to interpret in term \u2013 in terms of the uptick. That is the case with respect to certain portions of the cost savings is, they aren\u2019t realized on a levelized basis across the year, because in some of our costs, specifically on the \u2013 especially on the O&M side are seasonal in nature. So you\u2019ll see variability in realized cost savings quarter-over-quarter. But going back to your original observation, yes, the incremental increase is a good barometer to see the measure that we are on track towards getting to that $590 run rate in 2019, which is embedded in our guidance. Greg Gordon : Great. And it\u2019s a little bit difficult to suss out from your slides, where you are on a gross margin basis for the year relative to the target, because you give us now, you\u2019re giving us 2Q 2019 through 4Q 2019 expectation of $1.025 billion on Page 19. But it\u2019s hard to compare that with the original guidance that was given of $1.176 billion in the Q4 deck just because you didn\u2019t give us what you actually achieved in Q1. But is it \u2013 it\u2019s fair \u2013 is it fair to say that, you haven\u2019t called anything out there, so that you\u2019re still on track to hit that gross margin target? Kirkland Andrews : Overall to that question is, yes. As I said, the quarterly results of $333 million, as I said, were in line with our expectations. And you\u2019re right, I mean, the realized gross margin, which I think you\u2019ll find we\u2019ll be filing the Q later today with the details around the MD&A with a gross margin is by segment. So that when combined with the outlook over the balance of the year as you cited on 2019, would be the best way to confirm that. But overall, your overarching statement is correct. We are on track and that\u2019s part of why we\u2019re reaffirming the guidance today. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Last question, and this is a bit of a specular one, so I appreciate it if you delivered it and how you can answer it. If we have a super volatile summer in Texas this year, given that your book is, for the most part balanced, would it be your expectation that that\u2019s sort of a theoretically significant upside opportunity for the company, or do you think that the opportunity to generate significantly higher wholesale margins, but that the retail performance will sort of balance that out, and you might do a little better, but you\u2019re not really a net long in the market, right? Is it your goal to just be able to consistently deliver operating results in all types of market environments with limited volatility rather than sort of position to get a one-time benefit from a volatility event? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Well that is exactly what I was about to say, Greg. Our goal in rebalancing the portfolio and integrating Generation and Retail is to be able to provide predictable earnings in a number of market conditions. So if there is an extreme scenario in Texas, let me just, I guess, provide a little bit more specificity. All our price load is hedged. So by \u2013 when we go into the summer months, you have to know that our retail exposure will be completely hedged. On the Generation side, we always carry a little bit of excess generation to manage operational risk. So to the extent that our units perform well, we\u2019re going to have more that is exposed to the market. And if you see really high prices, we\u2019ll benefit from that. If our units operate less, we have a buffer to be able to manage that and not be exposed to high power prices. So overall, the goal of the \u2013 the goal for us in the summer and for that matter on any season is to continue providing predictable earnings with these complementary and countercyclical businesses of Generation and Retail. Greg Gordon : Okay. But it sounds like the way that you\u2019ve hedged your book, a volatility event would allow you to run the assets that where you do have length at higher load factors and higher prices. And so they\u2019re \u2013 and given that you\u2019re hedged on the Retail side, there actually might be a modest benefit to the overall system performance? Kirkland Andrews : Yes. Greg, I would say, modest benefit is probably the better way to think about that. And certainly, within that bandwidth of reasonable scenarios, as Mauricio said, it depends on the load that we have not yet locked in and priced, right? We have \u2013 there\u2019s two determining factors there. One is the price to the customer of that load and we\u2019re obviously very sensitive to that, because we\u2019re in a business of maintaining our customer base; and two, is the supply cost you realize when you lock that in, right? Obviously, the latter of those two scenarios is going to be driven by the evolution of prices in ERCOT, which on the other side of the equation benefit Generation, but it all depends on where we lock those prices on the Retail side. So I\u2019m painting a picture of a scenario where, yes, you\u2019ll realize some benefit on the length on the Generation side, but some of that may be offset by supply cost in the Retail side. We said, if we decide, it is like [indiscernible] for the long run to maintain discipline in the near-term on price where Retail is concerned. Chris Moser : And Greg, this is Chris. I would just throw out one thing that is slightly more medium-term than what happens this summer if it\u2019s super volatile. I think in a super volatile summer, you may see some retailers that aren\u2019t as well capitalized or hedged as us that end up shaken loose that, we do have Elizabeth and her team does a great job of buying and moving things into the book. And so that may provide an opportunity for us to grow the retail side, if we do see what you described as super volatile this summer. Mauricio Gutierrez : And super volatile will also impact next summer or the following summer, which gives us an opportunity to increase our hedges and capture higher gross margins on our generation part of the business. Greg Gordon : Very detailed answer, guys. Thank you. Have a great morning. Kirkland Andrews : Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you. Good talking to you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Your line is now open. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Angie. Angie Storozynski : Good morning. On the Retail side, just wondering given the stress moves. Are you still considering third-party M&A on the Retail side? And could it be actually a larger transaction? Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Angie, I mean, as you know, we don\u2019t comment on M&A. But we have said that we\u2019ve come a long way on rebalancing our portfolio between Generation and Retail. I feel very good about it, but there\u2019s always an opportunity to perfect it. I have said that before in the past. Our focus right now is, how do we grow our Retail business in the East. We have a really good platform. We have been doing it organically, very successfully. But the way I would characterize the M&A opportunities are probably smaller to medium-size and they\u2019re limited. So we\u2019re going to be very opportunistic and we\u2019re going to be very judicious about where we deploy our capital on the space. And this has to be \u2013 they have to be businesses that just complement our existing platform. We already have a platform in the \u2013 in Texas. We already have a platform in the East. So this is really a tuck-in transaction for a lack of a better word. So they\u2019re smaller and medium size. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then the second question, you mentioned the progress on your buyback plan. When can we hear about the update for the remainder of the year? How much more money you plan to dedicate to buyback? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So the remaining cash of $872 million. As you all know, we already allocated $1.6 billion, that\u2019s mostly on returning capital to shareholders and to achieve our new credit metric investment type of metric ratios. So I will be in a position to provide that by \u2013 in the third quarter earnings call. As I said, this was kind of a unique year, because a lot of our excess cash was front-loaded given the asset sales. And now that the distribution of our earnings have become even more peak here in the summertime. We really need to wait for \u2013 the \u2013 having that excess cash, I guess, coming through the door before we can allocate it. So you should expect that from us on the third quarter earnings call anytime. So how we\u2019re going to allocate that? We\u2019re going to be consistent with the way we have allocated that on our capital allocation principles. We look at growth and we look at returning capital to shareholders. We have a very clear and transparent way of measuring our \u2013 the return hurdles that we have when we allocate for growth, but that\u2019s not sufficient. They also have to be superior to the \u2013 I guess, implied return of our own shares that we believe continue to be undervalue. So I think, we\u2019re going to be very consistent in the way that we have approach it in the past. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Angie. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Hey, good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hi. Just a clarification on the buyback. The $500 \u2013 the $400 million that you did with the bank accelerated repurchase, do you know if all that stock actually got bought by now in the market, or is some of that still to be bought? Kirkland Andrews : No, we know that at the quarter-end and you\u2019ll see this when we file the Q later today. That program was still outstanding, but subsequently to the quarter-end, I think, September and mid-April. The bank completed that accelerated share repurchase program and we\u2019ll deliver the balance of the share, so that program\u2026 Steve Fleishman : Okay. So that\u2019s in your average price of buying and everything that part of it? Kirkland Andrews : Yes, that\u2019s correct, it\u2019s reflected. Steve Fleishman : Yes. Kirkland Andrews : Even at the first quarter-end event, it\u2019s reflected in that. And I I believe on one of those pages in the press release, there\u2019s a footnote that tells you what our shares outstanding are up to the minute and that shares outstanding reflects the complete impact of that first $500 million [indiscernible]. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And just \u2013 maybe just a little more color on Texas for this summer. And just I know you brought this plant back, which you did not do last summer. So I assume that suggest it\u2019s even tighter in your view than last summer. Just how \u2013 what\u2019s your sense on the risk of major volatility events price spikes or things like that, just any further color for this summer? Chris Moser : I mean, as you will know a lot more when we get to next week and they come out with the SARA and the CDR, which I think is coming out Wednesday or Thursday of next week on 8th date, that is \u2013 that will give us a look. I expect that to show probably negatives in the base case. It doesn\u2019t, okay? But keep in mind that SARA normally doesn\u2019t count the full use of the D.C. tied. It doesn\u2019t count all of the ERS or the private used networks. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of things that are above and beyond the SARA. But it\u2019s going to look pretty bad. I mean, the seven and change reserve margin is going to be awfully tight. Going the other way, Gregory will be in there, so you\u2019ll see a slight uptick from that. But in terms of what we\u2019re seeing so far this summer and so far what we\u2019ve seen this spring, we\u2019ve had some disappointing days, where the expectations were pretty high from a hey load is pretty good and we\u2019ve got a heck of a lot of averages and you do kind of a net load calculation and you\u2019re like wow we\u2019re up in the middle of 70s and prices aren\u2019t doing much. It\u2019s been raining down there at the drought monitor. People start to look at the drought monitor around this time of the year, and we\u2019ll see what that shows. But it\u2019s been relatively wet down there and looking at it. And so forward reading, it looks like we\u2019re leaning towards El Ni\u00f1o, which isn\u2019t particularly bullish. But we\u2019ll have to see and, like I said, we\u2019ll take a look at the SARA when it comes out. But hey, look, at 7.5 reserve margin super tight, but a lot of the other things are going are kind of trending the other direction. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Kirkland Andrews : Yes, take care. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey, good morning, Praful. Praful Mehta : Good morning. So maybe first a detailed question on Page 33, where you have your free cash flow for the year \u2013 for the quarter. This seems to be a big working capital collateral draw, which has reduced your free cash flow before growth for the quarter. I just want to understand why the $384 million? What\u2019s kind of driving that? And how does that trend down over time? Kirkland Andrews : That\u2019s basically just collateral postings related to two things. One, the components of collateral postings related to the mark-to-market on our hedges that we put in place. That collateral comes back to us, obviously, as those hedges roll off and realize is the case over the course of the year. And also to some extent, working capital receivables versus payables around the context of the Retail business. I think, this is probably the two primary components of that. I mean, if you follow the company, I know that you have. I mean, the first quarter tends to be our light quarter on a free cash flow basis. This is not unusual at all for us, because even though there\u2019s an EBITDA distribution here, I would say, even the free cash flow is even more acutely biased towards that, kind of third quarter piece of the year. Praful Mehta : Gotcha. Thanks for that color. And then maybe a little bit on Texas, again. It sounds like while the reserve margin is tight, the other conditions, especially weather and if it\u2019s wet, clearly, it won\u2019t be that beneficial. But as I understand your previous comments, it sounds like most of the benefit that you expect to get out of a tight Texas is more true hedging in the forward curve and the actual event during the summer itself may not be that beneficial, because you don\u2019t have that much Generation open. Is that a fair way to understand how you look at Texas at this point? Mauricio Gutierrez : I mean, I think that\u2019s fair. If you look even at our hedging disclosures for the balance of the year, we\u2019re 93%, 94% hedged. So, we really have \u2013 our excess generation is really going to be with an eye towards managing our operational risk. And \u2013 but if there is high prices this summer, it will definitely impact forward years, and that just gives us a really good opportunity, where our portfolio is more open. I mean, if you look at 2020, we\u2019re only 50% hedged and 2021. So it creates an opportunity for hedging in the future and it creates \u2013 now there is a modest upside. But again, our goal is to make sure that our platform performs on a number of market conditions. Praful Mehta : Gotcha. That\u2019s super helpful context. And then finally, just on PJM, with this fast track reform, it sounds like \u2013 I just want to get your view on has that had moved yet in terms of is it reflected in the forward curve? Do you see some bullish impact already, or do you expect to see it later down the road? How do you see this fast track reform to actually impact prices? Chris Moser : I think it\u2019s been \u2013 this is Chris. I think it\u2019s been slightly muted by the change between what PJM was asking for and what FERC delivered. And also I think that there was \u2013 I think there was a little bit in the forward curve to begin with. I mean, this has been sitting there. We were expecting this to happen in September. So this has been in the forwards for this summer for a while. Will \u2013 I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to \u2013 I don\u2019t expect the curves to run up $3 on this, would be my suggestion. Praful Mehta : Yes, I mean, that\u2019s exactly. We didn\u2019t see that much move, so I just wanted to get the context, so that\u2019s why I\u2026 Chris Moser : I think it was mostly expected and then slightly disappointed that FERC didn\u2019t do exactly what PJM asked, which was the two hour, instead of a one hour. Praful Mehta : Gotcha. Well, I really appreciate it, guys. Thank you. Chris Moser : Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Praful. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question. Our final question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. An ERCOT renewable question for you, which is the Q in ERCOT for solar, I think, continues to grow. And obviously, a small percentage of what\u2019s in the Q will likely get built. But how do you think about what \u2013 for your base case, like given how big the Q is? What you guys are assuming actually gets built when you think about what the market looks like two, three, four years from now? Chris Moser : So the is Chris, Mike. I would look and say, I think, we probably shared this in the past that when we look at wind build in the CDR versus what we see wind delivered, it\u2019s been in that 30% to 40% range over the past three years or so. So I would be slightly bearish even to that, because I think that Greg [ph] pretty well supplied with 22 gigs of wind already on the system and the Greg was built for far less than that. When you then talk about solar, I think that we\u2019re going to see some solar coming. I think that Texas needs new build right now, because good load, the peak load is growing at 2,000 megawatts a year. And so we need a bunch of a \u2013 a bunch of new build and solar seems like the most likely part of it assuming they can find PPAs for that. So that\u2019s kind of a quick, and then there\u2019s very little gas really. I mean, I think gas is only 10% or 15% of the interconnection queue these days. And like Mauricio mentioned in his initial remarks, I mean, some of the gas that is expected in 2021 has been postponed three or four times already. So that\u2019s a real quick snapshot on it. Michael Lapides : Yes. And when you think about where the utility scale solar will come, am I right in thinking about it that it will be unlike the wind in West Texas, the utility scale solar has the potential to be a lot closer to the load pockets? I\u2019m just trying to think about what \u2013 if we get several gigawatts in the next two to three years of total new installed, how you\u2019re thinking about the impact on kind of future pricing? Chris Moser : I think that solar sighting is going to be sprinkled across the grid. So as opposed to like a very concentrated approach out in the panhandle that we\u2019ve seen in the wind. I think solar will speckle the landscape a lot more, so to your point, may be closer to some of the load zones. And then impact on pricing, I\u2019ll just leave you with this thought. There\u2019s no unit in the system that\u2019s a $9,000 cost, right? I mean, the prices are administratively set. So whether whether the unit is zero marginal cost like solar or a $30 gas unit, it doesn\u2019t really matter when you get to scarcity. And the \u2013 if we need a lot to get to a 10% reserve margin in 2021, and I don\u2019t think a lot of that winds probably going to be there to do that. So I think it\u2019s going to stay tight for a while. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Chris Moser : You\u2019re welcome, Michael. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Michael, and thank you for your interest in NRG, and I look forward to talking to you in the next earnings call or in a roadshow if I see you before that. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Kevin Cole. You may begin. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Lateef. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call is scheduled for 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation. And now with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I am joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. Over the past 3.5 years we have made significant progress in transforming our company from a traditional IPP to an integrated power company focused on our customers. We monetized our excess generation and rebalanced our portfolio. We streamlined our operations. We slashed our debt. We achieved our targeted credit metrics. We are perfecting our business to make it more stable. And through all of these efforts, we created tremendous financial flexibility.  As you can see, we have come a long way and I am very pleased with our progress and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. However, the recent stock price performance does not reflect our confidence in the resiliency of our integrated model to deliver predictable and robust results. Our confidence in the business remains absolutely unchanged. We will continue to demonstrate the value of our business year-after-year. So with that on Slide 3, we have outlined the key messages for today's presentation. First, our business delivered another quarter of stable results demonstrating the value of our integrated platform during a period of volatile prices. And today, we are reaffirming our full year financial guidance. Second, we continue to perfect our integrated platform with the acquisition of Stream Energy and the execution of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of solar PPA generator. And third, we're making good progress on our capital allocation plan. During the quarter, we fully completed our debt reduction program and we have finally achieved our targeted investment grade credit metrics. In addition, we are announcing an incremental $250 million share repurchase program, which brings our total 2019 share repurchases to $1.5 billion.  Moving to the financial and operational results for the second quarter on Slide 4, we achieved top decile safety performance and delivered $469 million of adjusted EBITDA. The second quarter results were driven primarily by higher wholesale power prices, offset by higher retail supply costs and mild weather, demonstrating the complementary nature of our Generation and Retail businesses.  On the right hand side of the slide, similar to last quarter, we have provided our EBITDA on a same-store basis adjusted for asset sales and the consolidations. As you can see, for the first half of the year, our business delivered $801 million or 7% higher than last year. Now beyond these financials, we made significant [Technical Difficulty] further perfecting the stability and predictability of our platform. We launched our previously announced capital-light strategy signing approximately 1.3 gigawatts of solar PPA generator at an average length of 10 years, which complements our Generation portfolio, allows us to better serve our customers and further balances our integrated platform.  In addition, we closed on the acquisition of Stream Energy. This acquisition increases our national multi-brand retail leadership position and adds more than 600,000 Residential Customer Equivalents or RCEs with a run rate EBITDA of $65 million. We also achieved our investment grade credit metrics by reducing our total debt by $600 million and executed on a number of transactions in the debt markets at very attractive levels. This completes our balance sheet strengthening program and Kirk will provide additional details in his section.  Also during the quarter, we completed the latest $1 billion share repurchase program, bringing our total year-to-date to $1.25 billion. In addition, we are announcing an incremental $250 million share repurchase program to be completed by year end. We will address our plans for the remaining $259 million of 2019 excess cash, as we usually do, on the third quarter earnings call. However, we\u2019re reserving up to a $124 million of this capital for the Petra Nova project.  Let me give you some context. Back in 2014, when we closed the financing for this project, NRG and our 50-50 partner JX Nippon provided a financial guarantee to Petra Nova\u2019s lenders. These guarantees were to remain in place to support a one-time debt service ratio test which proscribe a prepayment of principal in the event the ratio fell below the threshold.  We have been in active negotiation with the project lenders and we now expect to fund the prepayment in the third quarter. Although, the final prepayment amount has not yet been determined, our obligation is limited to the guarantee amount. Once the debt prepayment is made, the guarantee will terminate and the remaining debt will become non-recourse to NRG.  So now moving on to our summer update on Slide 5, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the position of our integrated model, even though we are only in the middle of the summer. As you can see on the left hand side, second quarter weather was milder than normal particularly in June which impacted both prices and loads. Our portfolio so far is performing well. Starting with Retail, as expected load. We\u2019re also providing energy conversation alerts and demand management programs which help consumers manage load during peak hours. The milder weather during the second quarter has resulted in lower volumes. Unlike any other consumer business, if we sell less of our product, it will impact our results.  For Generation, we are maintaining excess length to help ensure against unplanned outages and load spikes. We expanded our pre-summer maintenance program to ensure our units can withstand increased run times. And we returned to service our Gregory plant, a 385 megawatt combined cycle plant which provides additional reliability to our platform and to the ERCOT system ahead of this tight summer.  Given [how rich] is our portfolio, we expect to have limited exposure to price or volumetric risk. I know we\u2019re only halfway through the summer, and as we\u2019re seeing this week, ERCOT is in the middle of a high-load high volatility period, with the rest of August still ahead of us. We remain focused across the organization on ensuring reliable operations and a successful summer. Now turning to Slide 6, I want to provide you an update on the ERCOT market. The supply demand balance remained tightened than it has never been, given strong load growth, previous asset retirements and lack of newbuilds. In May ERCOT released their semiannual Capacity Demand and Research report or CDR, which outlines the expected supply demand balance in the system and is shown in the upper left side of this slide.  As you can see, future reserve margins are dependent on newbuilds, particularly wind and solar. While the CDR report is helpful in understanding what is planned or possible, it has historically been a poor indicator of what actually gets build in the current year. In fact, we have seen less than 50% of renewal project included in the CDR reports completed.  And a closer look at the report reveal that 1.7 gigawatts are included from three natural gas plants that have already been delayed by an average of five years with no signs of moving forward. The report also does not yet include nearly 1.4 gigawatts of thermal generation that has already announced plans to retire. Together, these accounts put 4% of the reserve margin. Keep in mind that a little more than half of the 7 gigawatts of solar included in the report have posted financial security for interconnection. In the table on the lower left hand side, we tried to adjust for some of these factors and estimate what is the amount of megawatts required from solar to maintain a reserve margin of 10% to 12%. As you can see in the table we estimate over 17 gigawatts of new renewables are necessary to achieve those reserve margins in the next three years. We see this as a challenging given our recent experience signing solar PPAs and the backward dated forward power prices. Let me be clear, the ERCOT needs a tremendous amount of investment to just simply maintain the low reserve margin it currently has. Now from a platforms perspective, we\u2019re looking to facilitate solar newbuilds to improve grid reliability and rebalance our portfolio by entering into medium term PPAs. This PPAs help enable the developers to obtain cost-effective financing and tax equity to economically develop the project. And for us, they complement our generation profile, lower our cost structure and allows us to better serve our customers. From a market perspective, we expect ERCOT to remain tight and volatile for the foreseeable future, even in the face of a large renewable build-up. This price environment should prove difficult for pure retailers or generators that will be exposed to swings in the market. Our integrated platform is well positioned to thrive during this volatile and emerging renewable newbuild cycle. And you can expect us to deliver strong and predictable results.  I want to give one last comment regarding our markets. As you all know FERC issued an order earlier this month directing PJM to delay the August capacity auction. While we\u2019re hopeful a final order will be issued by the end of the year, the timeline FERC action remains uncertain.  We continue to view a strong MOPR at the simplest and most cost effective way to reduce the harmful impact of subsidies on the capacity market. And as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have come a long way in achieving our goals.  Slide 7 summarizes how we have transformed our business. We have significantly rebalanced our portfolio and streamlined our operations. Today, we have two complementary encounter cyclical businesses that provides a stable and predictable earnings under various market conditions.  We are focused on perfecting our business and making it even more stable with the generation fleet that supports our retail operations. The more balanced we are, the less exposure we have to the market and the more synergies we can achieve between the two businesses by crossing more Generation with Retail.  We are no longer your traditional IPP exposed to the feast and famine of power cycles. By having deliberately changed the risk profile of our business, we have also realigned our balance sheet and achieved investment grade credit metrics.  Now, our focus will turn into achieving investment grade rating. We recognize that this business model is relatively new but we\u2019re working hard to demonstrate the stability of our platform. Finally, we have created tremendous financial flexibility of our business with our actions. Now, with our deleveraging program behind us, we will focus our excess cash in 2020 and beyond on perfecting our model and returning capital to our shareholders.  With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review. Kirk Andrews : Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 9 for the second quarter NRG delivered $469 million in adjusted EBITDA and $230 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. This brings total adjusted EBITDA for the first half of the year to $801 million. As we did last quarter we provided a walk from our first half 2018 results to 2019 to provide some additional details behind the year-over-year drivers for our results.  Starting with our first half 2018 results we again eliminate the impact of asset sales, retirements and deconsolidations from our prior year\u2019s results. Deducting the $103 million impact of these items from 2018 results provides a baseline for comparison to our reported results for the first half of this year. Year-to-date our results are positively impacted by incremental savings and margin enhancements from the transformation plan which positively impact results by $66 million versus the prior year. Next, year-to-date Retail results are $123 million lower primarily due to higher costs which impacted gross margins with the remaining variance coming from XOOM Energy which closed June 1st of last year and weather as 2018 saw a positive benefit while the milder weather through June negatively impacted our 2019 Retail results, leading to a $35 million year-over-year impact.  Year-to date Generation results were $108 million higher as more robust wholesale prices drove higher gross margins, offsetting the opposite impact of supply costs out of Retail, further validating the effectiveness of the integrated model.  Behind the higher wholesale -- beyond the higher wholesale price impact rather, higher emissions credit sales in 2018 were offset by the benefit of the Midwest Generation asbestos settlement in 2019. While we increased major maintenance expenditures in 2019 to ensure our Texas fleet, including the Gregory plant, was fully prepared for reliable operations ahead of the valuable summer months.  With our strong outlook for the summer together with our significant hedge position for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2019 guidance ranges of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion in EBITDA and $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion of free cash flow. While we're maintaining our ranges for the subcomponents of our businesses as well, given year-to-date results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, Retail results are more likely to trend below the midpoint while Generation is trending above its midpoint.  As in years past, we expect the bulk of our EBITDA to come in the third quarter, which consistent with past performance is expected to represent more than 40% of our annual results. We will update and narrow our guidance ranges on third quarter earnings call.  During the second quarter we deployed over $1 billion in excess capital continuing to return capital to shareholders as well as achieving our balance sheet targets. Specifically, we completed the remaining $500 million of our share repurchase program announced on our fourth quarter earnings call, bringing year-to-date share repurchases to $1.25 billion, reducing share count by over 10% or 32 million shares at an average price of $38.80. And as Mauricio mentioned earlier, we are announcing an additional $250 million share repurchase program, which brings total 2019 capital allocated to share repurchases to $1.5 billion. This past quarter we also successfully executed a number of transactions in the debt markets through which we completed $600 million in debt reduction in order to achieve our target investment grade metrics, extended our nearest maturities and significantly reduced our interest costs. Part of our refinancing included repaying our secured term loan in its entirety using both the $600 million in cash with the balance funded with the new secured notes. These new secured notes contain fall-away covenants which automatically release the collateral, making the notes unsecured upon NRG receiving investment grade ratings from two ratings agencies. This covenant feature allows us a clear path to ensure the profile of our balance sheet aligns with that of investment grade without the need for additional refinancings in order to do so. Our refinancing and debt reduction activities this past quarter in total will also result in over $25 million in annual interest savings.  And turning to Slide 10 for an update on capital allocation. With our refinancing activities during the second quarter, we have completed the allocation of 2019 capital toward improving our balance sheet, enabling the achievement of our targeted investment grade metrics and further improving our overall maturity profile. Our new $250 million share repurchase program announced today brings total capital allocated to return of shareholder capital to over $1.5 billion in 2019 or more than 50% of 2019\u2019s excess capital returned to shareholders.  On August 1st we close the Stream Energy retail transaction which including transaction costs and working capital adjustments totaled $325 million. With the closing Stream and our new $250 million share repurchase program, based on the midpoint of our reaffirmed guidance, we expect approximately $250 million in 2019 capital remained to be allocated as we generate the remainder of our free cash flow over the balance of the year.  As Mauricio mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, we now expect to finalize the contractually required one-time leverage test for our Petra Nova project which provides a formula for press-forward payment in the event the debt service ratio falls below defined minimum threshold. Having successfully extended the deadline for this one-time test originally scheduled for 2018, as the operator of the oilfield had taken steps to improve production, our expectation was the extended timeline would allow time for the ratio to exceed the threshold and avoid a delay in repayment.  As the year progressed, despite the production improvement initiatives, oilfield production continued to lag expectations. And based on our latest discussions with the lenders and the updated reserve forecast they provide, we are now unable to further extend the deadline to allow more time for improvement and expect that this test will result in NRG being required to fund our 50% share of the required prepayment in the third quarter. Although the exact prepayment amount is not yet finalized, NRG\u2019s obligation could be up to $124 million or 50% of the project\u2019s debt. As a result, up to $124 million of our remaining excess capital is now reserved to fund this obligation during the third quarter. Following prepayment of the Petra Nova debt which is not consolidated on NRG\u2019s balance sheet, the guarantee supporting contingent prepayment obligation has been eliminated and any remaining debt is non-recourse to NRG.  Finally, turning to Slide 11, with our targeted deleveraging now complete, NRG\u2019s total debt is now under $6 billion or approximately $5.4 billion net of our -- of only our target $500 million minimum cash balance. That of course assumes that all capital is fully allocated. Based on the midpoint of our 2019, EBITDA guidance displaces us at the midpoint of our targeted investment grade credit metric range or 2.625 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Including our full year\u2019s run rate EBITDA contribution from the Stream Energy acquisition, this ratio reaches the lower ratio of our investment grade metric range or approximately 2.5 times, placing us in even stronger balance sheet position as we move into 2020.  And I\u2019ll turn it back to you Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kirk. Turning to Slide 13, I want to provide you a few closing thoughts. During the quarter we made significant progress on our priorities of perfecting our platform, maintaining a sector appropriate capital structure and disciplined capital allocation.  Today, I'm pleased with the conclusion of our nearly four year chapter of strengthening our balance sheet. I want to thank Kirk and the entire team for their relentless discipline in getting us to a best-in-industry investment grade balance sheet.  The financial flexibility that we enjoy today enabled us to further perfect our platform for the recent acquisition of Stream Energy, pursue our capital-light PPA strategy, and take advantage of the current [dislocated] stock price through incremental share repurchases. NRG is clearly stronger than it has ever been. We now have the stability and financial flexibility to thrive and take advantage of opportunities through all market cycles.  So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Lateef, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : I wanted to first ask you about the solar PPA announcements. That\u2019s certainly very interesting strategic decision here. How are you thinking about scaling these commitments over time, both with respect to PPAs rather than necessarily owning assets outright? And then secondly, probably relatively more critically, how do you think about this shifting your perspectives on further build out of solar in Texas? Certainly we hear a variety of different viewpoints out there. You are not necessarily using your balance sheet obviously, but you are seeing other developers pivot. How do you think about that and the state of the portfolio you have? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Well, first of all, I am very pleased with the execution of this capital-light strategy. Kudos to the origination team. As we\u2019ve disclosed today, we closed on 1.3 gigawatts. That\u2019s a good progress. But what I can tell you is that we continue to be in the market executing on additional volumes. Our goal is to complement the existing Generation portfolio that we have to better match our Retail load. So when you think about how much more you need to think about the Retail load as the guideline on how much we're going to complement more our Generation portfolio either through solar PPAs or other efficient ways of acquiring I guess length or Generation.  Now we respect to the solar, the second question that you had around the solar view, what we wanted to do is to illustrate, if we were to maintain a 10% to12% reserve margin which we think is the minimal to have reliable operations over the long-term, we wanted to put it in the context of how much solar you will need. And as you can see, it\u2019s a pretty significant number over 17 gigawatts, including solar and wind. I can't tell you whether it\u2019s going to be one or the other or if the pricing in those will change that will make thermal generation or conventional generation being built. What I can tell you is that ERCOT needs a lot of generation. It needs a lot of investment. And even the number that we\u2019re providing you are only sufficient to maintain a -- the current load reserve margin that we have. I think that\u2019s the main point that we were making. Obviously the implication of that is we expect the ERCOT market to continue to be robust over the foreseeable future, but more importantly to be pretty volatile. And we know that our business does well when we have both lot of volatility and perhaps less of other robustness because we have really reduced our exposure to market by balancing our Generation and Retail businesses. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : And then if could just follow up here real quickly. Strategically, we've seen some comments from your peers of late about their views about the depressed market environment and valuations. Anything comparable that you would offer at this point, I mean just with respect to your differing business models and take private scenarios et cetera. Just any commentary there? Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, that\u2019s a lot of questions in one question Julien so let me see if I can just touch that. The integrated model or our view on how we are positioning our company given the market trends that we\u2019re all serving today, and I'm glad you\u2019re asking that because I do believe that we actually have a very unique and differentiated platform. As I mentioned to you our goal is to better balance our generation in our retail businesses. I mean these are two complementary and counter-cyclical business. So to the extent that we match them better they may become even more complementary on a relative basis. Now when I say better balance, it also brings other benefits. We can actually increase the matching internally between our Generation and Retail which maximizes the synergies that we have talked about now for 10 years, collateral synergies friction cost synergies. To the extent that we better match those two, we reduced our exposure to the market. I mean we will continue to interact with the market but we don\u2019t necessarily have to if it\u2019s perfectly matched, which makes our platform a lot more stable which is one of the goals that we\u2019re trying to achieve with this new integrated platform, stable and predictable earnings.  If you look at the better balance, we have, as I said, more complementary and it\u2019s important on a relative basis. So if you think about where we were let\u2019s say five years ago when our Generation business was outsized from our Retail business, we actually got excess generation and that excess generation was exposed to wholesale power prices. Now we have reduced that significantly. I'm not saying that\u2019s good or bad, all I'm saying is that that\u2019s not the model that we\u2019re pursuing. We\u2019re pursuing a model that is a lot more balanced than it has ever been. Now from a dynamics standpoint, when you have a more integrated portfolio like we do in a rising commodity price environment, obviously our Generation margins will increase and our Retail margins will slightly decrease. And when the commodity prices are declining, the opposite happens. Our Generation margins decreased and our Retail margins increase. What I can tell you is that we actually have a lot more degrees of freedom in terms of how much of the wholesale price increases or decreases we can actually pass to our customers.  We know having been in the business now for over 10 years with empirical data that consumers, that the wholesale price is only one factor that consumers take into consideration but it is not the only factor. If that was the case, we would not have seen the growth that we have experienced in any of the premium brands that right now exists in the market. So I mean I hope that, that at least provides you a -- I guess perhaps a slightly different perspective on how I think about how we\u2019re repositioning the company going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Greg Gordon : A couple of blocking and tackling questions first. When I look at slide -- in the back of the slide deck, Slide 33, your guidance for cash flow from operations and free cash flow before growth is unchanged and it has $95 million working capital assumption for the year. But in the quarter, there was a fairly large working -- collateral postings on Slide 35, it says 246. So is that basically expected to reverse out over the year, can you give us some -- and full year guidance is still okay? Kirk Andrews : Greg, it\u2019s Kirk. That\u2019s correct. I mean typically speaking we're in the sort of middle of our collateral or liquidity intensive period. There is always the cases we come through the summer and enter into the fall that\u2019s when we tend to get that collateral back from those postings or hedgings that are more acute in summer and obviously moving, so the power price effect that. So short answer is yes. And the only other change to it that in know of because obviously we adjusted the interest payments a little down to reflect partially -- or impact some of the refinancing we did and we have a slight uptick in not really working capital but changes in other assets and liabilities over the course of the year, some of that has to do with the asbestos settlement. So that\u2019s the other reason for a little bit of the changes between the lines EBITDA and adjusted cash from operations. But obviously we don\u2019t expect that to have an impact on the bottom-line on free cash flow before growth and we do expect the collateral to return and we're in line with our year\u2019s expectations on cash flow. Greg Gordon : And Mauricio when I look at Slide 15 and the realized cost savings, margin, working capital improvements et cetera on the slow card, you didn\u2019t have anything in the script with regard to your feelings on being able to hit those targets but should we assume that to be full on track to hit those targets in \u201819 and \u201820? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, absolutely, I -- we have something on the priorities but I\u2019m very comfortable hitting our cost savings targets by the end of the year, margins enhancement this year and next year. So everything is on track. Greg Gordon : And then when we talk about these -- the potential for up to a $124 million turnover reserve guarantee. It's obviously - it\u2019s in the 10-K, it's been in the 10-K but probably still surprises some people. What is going to -- you said that there is a proscribed calculation, is it certainty that you will have to post for $124 million or there is sort of sliding scale of potential payments you have to make inside of range so to speak? And then is it should be our expectation that whatever the remaining cap is net of that obligation that you will allocate on a Q3 call? Kirk Andrews : It\u2019s Kirk. I think as Mauricio said we will update our plans for our excess capital for you on the third quarter to answer your questions. Yes, as to the 124 million that is the maximum amount that is not necessarily the expectation, it is dependent on the finalization of that calculation but as I indicated once that calculation is made and that payment amount is set which we do expect to happen in the third quarter, the obligation falls away. The one time test is a one-time guarantee and any remaining that is not recourse to NRG. So in short what I would say is we expect to make a payment, which I\u2019d tell you exactly what that payment is except to say it is absolutely limited to the amount of our guarantee which is that $124 million. Greg Gordon : My last question Mauricio sort of a different question along lines of the solar contracts that you\u2019ve entered into the -- fundamentally as you think about managing the business you talk about really what you\u2019re trying to do is manage the spread between your cost of goods sold which is your fleet in your contracts and your revenue line which now has sort of fundamentally matched Retail. Are these -- is this sort of strategy fundamentally reducing your run rate costs of goods sold in the marketplace? And is it one of the reasons why amongst other things you\u2019re confident that your EBITDA and free cash flow profile is sustainable over time? Can you talk about what that does in terms of offsetting people\u2019s concerns that perhaps over time Retail margins might -- if retail revenues come down, if your cost of goods sold stays static and therefore margins would come under pressure. I think what you\u2019re telling us is that you can manage the numerator and the denominator for the time and that\u2019s why you\u2019re confident that you\u2019ve actually perfected the model? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes I mean that\u2019s exactly the goal of the strategy. I mean when we look at our total Generation portfolio our goal is to reduce as you said the cost of goods sold which now becomes our cost of Generation. And I will tell you that we have executed some of these PPAs at very attractive levels compared particularly to the market. I mean we are in the process right now of executing in the market and depending on the location because all of these PPAs are spread out depending on where we have the load. So they have very different pricing. Also the tenure is different. I mean on average it\u2019s ten years but some of them are a little longer than that, some of them are little shorter than that. And the impact of these PPAs will come in full earnings some time in 2021. I can\u2019t give you any more details in terms of where we have entered into these PPAs because obviously we\u2019re still in the market. But what I can tell you just from a order of magnitude, so far we have reduced our -- basically our cost of goods sold which translates into EBITDA, let\u2019s say about 2% of our EBITDA. So I mean that at least gives you some order of magnitude in terms of what to expect. And as you said as we lower our cost of production we have a lot more degrees of freedom in terms of the way we maintain the savings that we have or the cost comparisons that we have that we pass it to our customers to gain market share.  But then I mean it creates a lot more optionality for us. And just keep in mind that this notion that if wholesale prices will decrease they will decrease our margins, it assumes that we basically will do nothing. We\u2019ll do nothing to change the cost structure and the repositioning of our company. And I have to remind everybody that starting in 2020 we have basically full financial flexibility. We don\u2019t have to wait, one or two or three years.  Starting in -- even this year we have financial flexibility but it will -- so if you think about our stable platform this year we produced between $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, by the time 2021 we are all seen. I mean we're going to have over $2.5 billion that we can deploy to continue perfecting our platform. So I think it's important to put it in context the position that we have put ourselves in place. We are done with our deleveraging and our strengthening of our balance sheet program. And now we have this full financial flexibility to allocate into perfecting our model and returning capital to shareholders which I think is incredibly important as a stable cash flow business that we have. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Your line is open. Angie Storozynski : So I have only one question. So given what you\u2019ve just said right that you have plenty of levers to react to lower power prices, can you tell us if you can largely or fully mitigate the backwardation and the impact of the backwardation in forward power curves on your EBITDA or free cash flow i.e. there isn't -- basic initiative of your earnings is not similar to the one that we see currently in ERCOT power curves? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Angie what I can tell you unequivocally is that we have created a platform that is sustainable and predictable. What mean sustainable and predictable is, year-in, year-out we're going to produce the excess cash that we produce today. Now we're going to have this incredible financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves to have to increment that all. So the value proposition that we have today is to have a stable cash flow business that grows at a 2% to 4% a year with an investment grade balance sheet and significant excess cash to grow the business in an accretive way and to return capital -- meaningful capital to shareholders. We think that combination of those three things will eventually change and we raise the valuation of stock which if I\u2019m not mistaken right now is somewhere in the mid-teens to high-teens free cash flow yield. We don\u2019t believe that business that I describe to you today should be there. And if it gets re-rated closer to where we think should be, then our stock price will be much, much higher than it is today. Obviously, we also appreciate that this is the first year that we are showing the benefits of this platform. 2018 was a good test, we had a very volatile summer. 2019 is very important because it continues to demonstrate that our platform performs and there are a lot of different pricing scenarios. So now it is up to all that, if this continues to happen and we\u2019ve taken care of our balance sheet and we can demonstrate that to our shareholders and to rating agencies then we're on the path to re-rate the stock. Angie Storozynski : And just one last question. I was definitely the one surprised by the Petra Nova mention. Is there any other legacy business that might have any types of cash flow implications like I don\u2019t know, even call it something else to whether there is type of guarantee? Kirk Andrews : It\u2019s Kirk, no, the two remains are legacies. In addition Agua Caliente that we have obviously minority stake with remainder being owned by clearly formerly yield and the balance with Midwest Generation. That debt is non-recourse top NRG so there are no financial guarantees. This Petra Nova leverage test is a product that\u2019s unique if go through Petra Nova. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your question please. Shahriar Pourreza : First just on the IG status. Can you maybe just elaborate a bit further on how the conversations are going with the agencies? And obviously outside of presenting very healthy metrics today, can you just get the agencies to look after philosophical issues about having an IG related IPP, are you still trying to gain confidence on the retail business and as you\u2019re thinking about timing or we think in the back half of 2020? Kirk Andrews : Shahriar, I\u2019d answer the last part of your question, I think that\u2019s probably the realistic case. Back half of 2020 is probably the early timeline in fact of when we would expect that movement to make. Obviously on an unsecured basis we\u2019re two notches away from the minimum threshold of the investment grade that being triple B minus, that\u2019s not say that\u2019s our aspiration that\u2019s sort of the inflection point between sub-investment grade and investment grade. But I think on that timeline is probably reasonable. Certainly between now and then we need to see at least one notch uptick could be at least then one notch away. And I think in much the same way is that although we\u2019re more frustrated with the reaction in stock pricing, we\u2019ve obviously got to demonstrate that to our equity investors. The mandate still holds on the other side of the equation with the rating agencies. I think delivering the numbers that we\u2019ve now reaffirmed for this year which confirms that notwithstanding the sell off that probably represents some of the prices that happens our ability to do so, we are able to do so. So delivering on that this year continuing to execute.  And the background as I\u2019ve mentioned you this before we\u2019ve been very pleased with the level of dialogue with rating agencies. I think they\u2019ve dug in to understand to their credit Retail business in particular a lot more. So I think the progression of the dialogue and their perspectives on Retail and understanding how we operate the model and how Retail truly operates in tandem with Generation has been constructive and productive. And it\u2019s up to us to continue to execute which we have confidence to do so. But it will take probably that amount of time in order to get those two notches behind us on our way to the base. Shahriar Pourreza : And then just lastly on this token dividend, you guys still keep it. At what point do you make a decision to either grow it or remove it completely? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, well, when you think about capital allocation because I mean that\u2019s really -- I think your question Shahriar how we think about capital allocation going forward and what I will tell you is that we have no changes neither on our philosophy on the principal that we have provided to all of you. I think the only thing that has changed is the fact that we have completed one of our priorities which is achieve an investment grade balance sheet. That\u2019s basically not out of the way. What that means is that we have all the excess cash that we will generate it will be to perfect our model or return capital to shareholders. Like I said Shahriar, I do believe that a business that is stable and growing a lot of excess cash needs to provide -- needs to return a meaningful part of that to the shareholders. Today that\u2019s one of the most efficient ways to do is through share buybacks. I think we speak 250 million incremental share buyback that we announced today, to take advantage of what I believe is an undervaluation of our stock without any changes to the fundamental drivers -- value drivers of our business. Now as we go into 2020, obviously, we're going to evaluate all the other different options, I don\u2019t know what the market is going to -- where it\u2019s going to be at the end of the year, I\u2019m going to evaluate all that. What I will tell you is that our goal is to re-rate the stock to its fundamental value and we're going to evaluate all options that we have available to us to ensure that we do that. Shahriar Pourreza : And just Mauricio one last on capital allocation. I just want to confirm because obviously certain retailers have hit the block right now that your -- from a capital allocation standpoint you are sort of out of the market and you're not looking at further inorganic retail acquisitions? Mauricio Gutierrez : That we are out of the market? Shahriar Pourreza : Right, so are you looking at additional retail acquisitions similar to Stream or you\u2019re sort of out of the market? Mauricio Gutierrez : I mean I don\u2019t comment on M&A either specific processes or anything. What I will tell you is that, when I think about inorganic growth I will always adhere to the capital allocation principle that we have outlined for all of you. We have to meet the threshold -- the financial threshold that we have and they have to be a better investment than investing in our own stock. I have said before that while we have rebalanced our portfolio pretty good the past couple of years, we can still perfect that platform. In Texas our Retail is a little bit bigger than our Generation and in the East our Generation than bigger than our Retail.  So we're executing on our capital-light strategy in Texas to rebalance our portfolio. We acquired Stream to rebalance our Retail and we're going to continue to look at all the opportunities. I mean that is the -- I guess the benefit that we have afforded ourselves with the financial flexibility that we have today. We can be opportunistic about when to do it. But obviously where the stock price is today, the bar is a little bit higher than it was not too long ago when our stock price was started to reflect the fundamental value of our business. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your question please. Praful Mehta : Thanks again for all the color on the business model, it was very helpful. I guess just following up a little bit on that. Slide 20, you have the wholesale gross margins which clearly have come down a little bit from Q1 given the drop in the power prices. But I\u2019m assuming as you talked about in your business model points that some of this drop in the wholesale gross margin will be made up for on the Retail side in 2020. Is that a fair way to think about how we should look at Slide 20 today? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes I think the way you need to think about ERCOT is an integrated model. So while we only give you one side of leg, the Generation, we haven\u2019t provided you the Retail sensitivity to it. And to be candid, I mean that\u2019s being up -- is on -- is up to us to improve our disclosures.  What I think about our business? I don\u2019t think about it as two completely separate businesses, one Generation, one Retail. Our disclosures have been really good on Generation. I think where we need to do our better job is to enhance our disclosures to capture the integration of our business because when I think about how do we manage our business, I think about it as an integrated business where the gross margin, the combined gross margin is what matters. I care less about where it comes from, whether it\u2019s Generation or Retail, I care about delivering the total gross margin year-in and year-out.  I mean various other puts and takes. I mean in the Northeast you have capacity a little bit lower and -- but that\u2019s being offset by margin enhancement and then we have the impact of Stream. I mean my point here is, you cannot look at our business just on a static basis, with the amount of the financial flexibility we have to improve it. It\u2019s like saying that we\u2019re not going to do anything but we have all this excess cash available to deploy in the most meaningful way that creates value for our shareholders.  So yes, I'm very comfortable with our platform in 2020 and beyond. And as I said our goal is to provide stable earnings, stable excess cash with a modest growth. That\u2019s our goal. Praful Mehta : Yes, now that additional disclosure on the Retail side would be super helpful to kind of complement the points you made on the business model. I guess moving on to the PPA side for solar, I guess it\u2019s a little different from your perspective because you obviously have the option to sign more solar PPAs at pretty low prices which is helpful for your Retail. But then you\u2019re bringing in a lot more Generation at pretty low pricing but you\u2019re kind of drawing more solar into the market. How do you balance that, does it a benefit from your perspective as you said to have volatility so just bringing in a lot of solar generation by offering them PPAs may not be the right solution from a holistic business perspective? Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, I -- you may say it may not be, I think it is. And the reason why is -- we have a very valuable franchise in ERCOT. And we want to make sure that the competitive market continues to work and work well in the state. We need so much capacity to even maintain this current reserve margin. It really doesn\u2019t matter if we bring 10 or 15 gigawatts of renewables. You\u2019re going to continue to have tight reserve margins, which is not going to affect the scarcity conditions in the system. I mean all this is not going to be affected if you basically keep your reserve margin at 8%, 9%. That other is administratively set. So I actually think that if the competitive market works well, it\u2019s going to provide a right price signal and the cheapest technology is the one that is going to get built, the cheapest technology to meet the needs of the system. And if that happens whether it\u2019s solar wind or conventional with high ramping capacity, we think that that\u2019s going to require some time. And that\u2019s why I say for the foreseeable future ERCOT, I expect really tight conditions with strong prices and tremendous amount of volatility, Chris, is there anything that you want to add? Chris Moser : No, I was just going to point out that we\u2019ve seen ORDC has really been doing its job since the commission tweaked it earlier this year, it\u2019s been a noticeable difference in pricing, whether it was like a $4.50 adder for this mild July that we had which compares to like a $5 adder, last year when July was smoking hot. Over the last couple of days where we\u2019ve seen $100 to $200 tagged on in these hot days of August, ORDC just like Mauricio said, just doesn't need costly marginal cost units -- unit to impact, it\u2019s administratively set. And to the extent that you could build almost 20 gigs of renewables and that you need to do that just to stay flat in terms of reserve margin, yes, I\u2019m not too worried about it. And don\u2019t forget that there is another quarter turn of ORDC coming next March too, so I think we should be okay for a while. Praful Mehta : All great points. And then just finally clearly you guys are executing on the business model and the market I agree needs time to understand and fully see the execution off the business model. But if at some point you don't see the stock price perform and you're hearing and you're still having the same conversation, is there a point when you look at go private as a transaction that\u2019s possible or is that something that's not on the table at this point? Mauricio Gutierrez : I am sorry, the going private? Kirk Andrews : The market doesn\u2019t. Mauricio Gutierrez : I mean right now our focus is on executing that strategy that we have. As I already mentioned to you Praful I mean we believe that this is a very compelling value proposition. I also recognize that this is a new business model for the competitive power sector. I rather no longer refer us as IPP but as an IPC we're truly now an integrated power company. And so to the extent that we continue to demonstrate the viability and the stability of this platform, not just to our shareholders but also to rating agencies. I think that there is an opportunity to re-rate the stock. But obviously if that doesn\u2019t happen, once we feel that we kind of exhausted all our efforts to demonstrate the stability of our business, then we will explore all options to maximize the value of our shareholders. So I mean that\u2019s something we just have to do. But I don\u2019t think that time yet, I mean we only have provided -- we\u2019ve proven this technology for two years, 2018 very successfully, 2019 we're on track to deliver very successfully. So recognizing that I think we need to give ourselves some time and we need to give our shareholders and the rating agencies some time to digest this strategic shift. And when we feel that we have given enough time and the market is not responding which I\u2019m still hopeful that it will and I\u2019m convinced that it will because we have a very strong value proposition, then we will evaluate something else. But right now all our focus, a 100% our focus is on executing this strategy. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the CEO of NRG Energy, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Brian. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call is scheduled for 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I\u2019m joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. I would like to start the call with our key messages on the Slide 3 that highlights the simplicity of our value proposition and demonstrate the predictability of our platform, particularly after the summer we experienced in Texas with significant weather and price volatility. First, our integrated platform performed well during the summer, allowing us to narrow our 2019 guidance around the midpoint of our range, and validating again the resilience of our business. Second, we\u2019re initiating 2020 guidance that further demonstrates our ability to deliver robust and predictable results through varying market conditions. And third, we\u2019re providing additional clarity on our capital allocation philosophy, given the financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves. We are introducing a framework consistent with our goal of growing and perfecting our business, while returning meaningful capital for shareholders. These framework targets 50% of excess capital towards growth and 50% to be returned to shareholders, supported now by a more significant dividend policy. So moving to our third quarter results on \u2013 highlights on Slide 4. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the quarter, we remained a top decile safety performance and delivered $792 million of adjusted EBITDA, or 33% higher than last year on a same-store basis. This was primarily driven by higher realized power prices, margin enhancement, and retail customer growth, partially offset by higher retail supply costs and higher unplanned outages. In the summer in Texas was particularly challenging, given the extreme weather and price volatility that resulted in record prices and record demand. I\u2019m very proud of our generation and retail teams for their ability to deliver a strong financial performance during a period of extreme price volatility. It is exactly in this price environment that our platform demonstrate the benefits of the integrated model. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA results now stand up $1.6 billion, a 19% increase from last year, allowing us to narrow our 2019 guidance range around the midpoint to $1.9 billion to $2 billion. During the quarter, we continue to execute on our capital-light strategy, signing an additional 100 megawatts of solar PPAs, bringing the total to 1.4 gigawatts this year. While we continue to pursue additional solar PPAs, which allows us to better serve our customers and further balance our integrated platform. Also, during the quarter, we completed $55 million of our current $250 million share repurchase program, leaving $195 million to be completed over the balance of the year. Moving to the right side of this slide, we\u2019re initiating 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and free cash flow before growth guidance of $1.275 billion to $1.475 billion. This guidance further demonstrates our ability to deliver stable and predictable results through varying market conditions. Kirk will provide additional details on both guidance ranges later in the call. Finally, as part of the long-term capital allocation policy that I will discuss in more detail later in the presentation, I\u2019m pleased to announce that beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we will increase our annual dividend from $0.12 per share to $1.20 per share, or about 3% yield, with a target annual growth rate of 7% to 9%. Now turning to Slide 5 for a closer look at the summer in Texas. On the top left chart, we show weather represented a cooling degree days by month. As you can see, summer weather was mixed. Mild temperatures are early in the summer, with warmer weather in August and September, presented unique challenges for the power grid. This resulted in power prices significantly different from their forward indications. As you can see in the lower chart, July prices came in below forecast, while August and September came in significantly above, driven primarily by warmer weather, coupled with lower than expected wind generation and increased unplanned outages. Like the rest of the market, we also experienced some increased unplanned outages. The most notable one being WA Parish unit 6, after running reliably for over 200 consecutive days. The cost of the outage was a one-off and we do not expect to see a repeat in the future, as the circumstances were specific to that unit. However, the unit meets most of August and September, limiting our ability to benefit from higher prices. Now turning to the right side of the slide, our integrated platform provided stable results through July\u2019s low load, low price and August and September\u2019s high load, high price environments. Underpinning our success was strong supply and risk management, enhanced customer outreach, and build management tools provided to residential and commercial customers. Now between the summer of 2018, with volatile forwards and disappointing real-time prices, and the summer of 2019 with almost the opposite higher real-time prices, we have now demonstrated the strength and predictability of our integrated model through two very different market conditions. This is one more example of what underpins our confidence in the stability and predictability of our business. Now, as we entered 2020 with limited calls on our capital, I want to take a moment to review our capital location track record on Slide 6, particularly in light of the financial flexibility we have created for ourselves. As you recall, we have outlined three distinct phases on our transformation. First, in 2016 and 2017, we focus on stabilizing the business through selling or closing underperforming assets, focusing on our core integrated business and strengthening our balance sheet. If you recall, my first commitment to you nearly four years ago, was to leave no doubt in our balance sheet strength, and that is where we committed our excess cash. We allocated 70% of excess cash during this period to debt repayment and 20% to resolve legacy commitments. Next, in 2018, we entered Phase 2 with a focus on right-sizing the portfolio to better integrate and align generation with retail. During this period, we executed over $3 billion in asset sales, which reduced our generation portfolio by 50% and strengthened our balance sheet to investment-grade credit metrics, creating tremendous financial flexibility. And with this financial flexibility, we completed two accretive mid-sized retail transactions by allocating 18% of our excess cash and took advantage of our dislocated stock price by allocating nearly 50% towards returning capital to shareholders and reducing our share count by over 20%. Now as we move into our next phase of redefining our business and with significant financial flexibility, I want to provide additional clarity and refinement into our long-term capital principles and priorities. As you can see on the right-hand side, our commitment to safety, operational excellence and balance sheet remains unchanged. Our enhancement today will focus on growing our business and returning capital to shareholders. Like I have said in past calls, I believe a predictable cash flow company like ours, should regularly and meaningfully return capital to shareholders. It creates discipline and it is part of our overall value proposition. Let me further unpack these on Slide 7. Starting on the left-hand side, you can see our updated capital allocation framework waterfall. We have come a long way in achieving our goals. We continue to maintain top decile safety and operational excellence and have achieved what we believe to be investment-grade credit metrics. Today, we are establishing a target allocation mix of 50% to our traded growth investments and 50% to return of capital. For those listening that are new to the NRG story, prior to today, returning capital to shareholders was primarily viewed through the lens of unallocated growth capital, which is no longer the case. I believe a long-term commitment through a strong dividend policy, complemented by share repurchases, is an important attribute for both value creation and broadening our shareholder base. First, on growth. As you can see on the waterfall, there is no change in our investment criteria. These capital will either be deployed in good, sound investments that meet our financial thresholds and are consistent with our strategy or they will be returned back to our shareholders. Next, on return of capital. We are increasing our annual dividend from $0.12 to $1.20 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and targeting a 7% to 9% annual growth rate. While I continue to see our stock as one of the most compelling investment opportunities, I also believe a more significant dividend policy, provides added visibility in returning capital to shareholders and helps broaden our investor base, as we continue to execute and validate the stability and predictability of cash flows. We will also complement the dividend with significant and programmatic share repurchases. On the right side of this slide, we want to illustrate the magnitude of the excess cash and the impact of our refined capital allocation policy. If we simply maintain the existing earnings power of our business, while deploying 50% of our excess cash at the midpoint of our hurdle rate, and the remaining 50% of excess cash used to grow the dividend and for share purchases, you can see in this scenario that over the next five years, we would generate over $8 billion of excess cash, or 80% of our market cap, grow our annual free cash flow before growth by 50% and shrink our share count by 30%. We are an increasingly stable and predictable cash flow company that through the combination of compelling growth investments and share repurchases are on track to double our free cash flow per share over the next five years, while paying a compelling and affordable dividend with 7% to 9% annual growth. So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review. Kirkland Andrews : Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 9, NRG delivered $792 million in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and $433 million in free cash flow before growth. This brings total adjusted EBITDA through the first nine months to around $1.6 billion, with $637 million in free cash flow. After adjusting for a $57 million reduction in EBITDA for asset sales and deconsolidations in 2018, our third quarter results were $198 million higher than 2018, driven by generation, which benefited from higher realized power prices in Texas and lower costs from transformation plan savings. These elements were partially offset by lower capacity revenues and generation volumes in the East and the West, while retail remained flat for the quarter with higher supply costs and milder weather at the beginning of the quarter, offsetting our margin enhancement initiatives and contributions from acquisitions. The bulk of the third quarter retail load and EBITDA was generated during the back-half of third quarter, resulting in higher working capital, driven by receivables. As a result of a greater portion of the cash flow associated with third quarter retail EBITDA, that cash flow will be realized during the fourth quarter as the receivable balance unwinds, and we\u2019ve already begun to see this significant cash flow materialized over the month of October. With these results to date, we\u2019re narrowing our 2019 EBITDA guidance range to $1.9 to $2 billion in EBITDA. As I alluded to last quarter, higher power prices in ERCOT have driven higher realized and expected EBITDA for the Generation segment, while the corresponding higher cost drives lower expected EBITDA for Retail. These elements are reflected in the revised segment components of our narrowed consolidated guidance, which nonetheless remain centered around our original midpoint. While midpoint EBITDA guidance remains unchanged, our revised 2019 free cash flow guidance midpoint is lowered by $50 million, due to the cash flow impact from outages during 2019, including WA Parish. Although, the EBITDA impact of these outages was offset by other items, our free cash flow outlook is slightly lower, primarily due to increases in maintenance CapEx, resulting from the outages. During the third quarter, we finalized the contractually required one-time leverage test for our Petra Nova project. Although, as I indicated on our previous earnings call, NRG\u2019s obligation could have been up to $124 million, we were able to keep the amount required from NRG to only $107 million. We satisfied this obligation in two parts. First, $95 million of cash was contributed by NRG to the project in the third quarter; and second, NRG posted a $12 million letter of credit, which may be drawn by the project at a future date. Having now satisfied our legacy obligation under the leverage test, the guarantee supporting this obligation is now eliminated and the remaining debt at the project is non-recourse to NRG. Finally, since the announcement in August of our $250 million share repurchase program, we\u2019ve completed $55 million in additional share purchases at an average of $37.62 a share. We expect to complete the remaining $195 million of repurchases under that program over the balance of the year. Turning to Slide 10, you\u2019ll find our newly announced guidance ranges for 2020. Specifically, we expect $1.9 billion to $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA for 2020. As shown in the table on the right-hand side of the slide, based on the midpoint of our guidance ranges, this implies about $50 million of year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA, driven by the final component of our margin enhancement program, or $80 million and the full contribution from the Stream acquisition. These are partially offset by higher year-over-year retail costs. We expect $1.275 billion to $1.375 billion in free cash flow before growth in 2020, converting approximately $0.70 of EBITDA into cash. Our 2020 guidance ranges exclude any EBITDA or free cash flow associated with Agua Caliente, as we are targeting the sale of our remaining stake in that project during 2020. Turning to Slide 11 for a brief update on 2019 capital allocation. Changes since the prior quarter are highlighted in blue include a slight adjustments to total capital to reflect the midpoint of our revised free cash flow guidance. Growth investments now reflect $95 million in cash contributed to Petra Nova, as well as a small increase associated with the purchase of retail books. As a result, we have about $80 million of 2019 excess capital remaining to be allocated, which we\u2019d expect to allocate using the newly announced guideline Mauricio outlined earlier, or approximately 50% for growth and 50% to share repurchases. Finally, as I mentioned during my review of third quarter results, we\u2019ve seen significant positive cash flow since the end of the quarter. In order to show this more clearly, on the upper right of the slide, I\u2019ve included a liquidity table to show the significant change in liquidity, which is the sum of cash and credit facility availability as of November 1, as compared to the quarter-end. Over the month of October, our liquidity improved by over $450 million. Net of the non-cash reduction in letters of credit posted over 50% of this improvement in liquidity represents free cash flow before growth during the month of October. And finally, turning to Slide 12. The midpoint of our newly announced 2020 guidance range places us on track to achieve the low-end of our target investment-grade metrics for about 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA, making 2020 the second year of investment-grade metrics for NRG. We continue to believe that these consistent and strong credit metrics, combined with a continued execution and an active dialogue with ratings agencies, places us in a position to earn an investment-grade rating in the next 12 to 18 months. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kirk. Turning to Slide 14, I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2019 priorities and expectations. Our top priority for sometime has been to demonstrate the predictability and stability of our integrated platform. And this summer marks another year of delivering stable earnings through volatile market conditions. As you can see on our scorecard, we\u2019ve made significant progress across all other priorities from perfecting our business and reducing debt to delivering on our transformation goals. We will continue to simplify our disclosures to help better understand the value proposition of our integrated platform going forward. As we move into 2020, I\u2019m confident our platform, coupled with clear and compelling capital allocation principles, is well positioned to deliver strong and predictable results and create significant shareholder value. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Brian, we\u2019re now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Congratulations. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Julien. Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, so perhaps first off, I\u2019m curious on the new growth strategy, if you could elaborate a little bit. How do you think about the finding investments that achieved those hurdle rates? And how do you think about sort of over time contrast and that against your own levered and unlevered yield as it stands today? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Well, I don\u2019t think there is a new growth strategy. I think what we\u2019re doing here is to provide more clarity on the return of capital policy that we have long-term. In terms of growth, I don\u2019t think anything has changed from my perspective. In the near-term, I continue to see opportunities in the \u2013 primarily in the retail space. I will say, small to medium-sized companies similar to what we executed in the past year-and-a-half with XOOM and Stream. And the number of those opportunities are still limited, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to focus in the near-term. I mean, medium and long-term, we will see where these opportunities are. I mean, as we continue to perfect our model, obviously, we\u2019re looking at, how do we enhance the products and services that we provide to our customers. But I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a new growth strategy. It\u2019s just providing more clarity on our return of capital to shareholders. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: But are there still opportunities to acquire retail platforms at this point, given just the consolidation we\u2019ve already seen? And then maybe I\u2019ll ask at the same time, the 7% and 9% dividend growth, that\u2019s basically predicated on not just the repo, but also finding these platforms and deploying capital allocation? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So I mean, we still see some opportunities. I mean, where, as you mentioned, I mean, there is some \u2013 there\u2019s a pretty fair activity in terms of our consolidation in the retail space. We\u2019re evaluating what will be complementary to our business in terms of products, regions, channels, just like we did with XOOM and Stream, which gets us into the referral sales channel. We\u2019re evaluating what else, where are these other opportunities that can complement and enhance and grow our our retail business, but that\u2019s where I see right now the most immediate opportunities. Obviously, we\u2019re still executing on our capitalized strategy to continue perfecting and balancing our portfolio. But, as I said, I mean, that\u2019s capital, right? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Okay. Thank you very much, guys. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning. How are you? Greg Gordon : I\u2019m good. I\u2019m good. So I guess, just to follow-up on Julien\u2019s point. I mean, you are reiterating a pretty high hurdle rate for growth capital investments. And it would seem to me that the depth of the market for either assets or businesses that have those type of returns could be pretty shallow. So you\u2019re committed, if you can\u2019t deploy that capital in any given year to pivoting to buybacks with that money? I mean, I know you \u2013 if you just talk through your thought process on that and how you\u2019ll communicate that going forward? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean, the long-term capital return \u2013 the return of capital policy that we\u2019re providing today does have some flexibility embedded in it, I mean, if we cannot find growth opportunities that meet our financial thresholds. And importantly, that is superior to buying back our own stock, then we\u2019ll return that capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. So that\u2019s where the flexibility is embedded in our plan. But again, what I wanted \u2013 the goal of today is to provide more clarity in terms of what is that return of capital philosophy that supports the value proposition of NRG. Greg, as I said in the past, I mean, the value proposition of the company it is to have a business model that is balanced, that provides the stable and predictable earnings with an investment-grade type of balance sheet and a very clear and transparent capital allocation principles. And part of those principles is to returning a meaningful part of our excess cash to shareholders. What we are doing today is providing that clarity in terms of what is meaningful. And what I\u2019m saying today is $0.50 of every dollar of excess cash will go to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and 50% will go to growth. But if we cannot find growth opportunities that meet the threshold that I just said, then we\u2019ll return that capital for shareholders. Greg Gordon : Great. Are there any \u2013 is there any type of investment that\u2019s \u2013 that you would say is sort of off limits? Like are you not interested in more power generation, or in the right markets, if you have the right retail load \u2013 mix is our power generation assets potentially part of the capital deployment scenario? Mauricio Gutierrez : I mean, at this point, we\u2019re being very successful with our capital-light strategy on the generation side. Given where we\u2019re seeing the economics. I don\u2019t see immediately opportunities in generation. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re creating optionality within our portfolio. I mean, we have a lot of assets. We have a lot of power plants across our fleet. But I don\u2019t see that today. I mean, I think the most immediate actionable opportunities are within the retail space. Greg Gordon : All right. Thanks. One last question. When I look at the hedges, I see that you\u2019ve rolled the hedges forward to 2021, and it looks like you\u2019ve got some pretty good marks in there. You also mentioned that you\u2019re going to continue, however, to evolve your disclosures. Can you maybe give us a little bit more on where you think you\u2019re heading there? So few questions, sorry. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean, when I think about the business, I don\u2019t think about it two different businesses, I mean, generation and retail. I actually think about it as an integrated platform. So one of the improvements that we\u2019re going to do on the disclosures is, how do we think about that integrated platform. I think we\u2019ve been very good at providing disclosures on the generation side of the business, but now we have to do a better job in providing them holistically for the integrated model as a whole. Greg Gordon : Great. And Kirk, can you comment on the hedge position? It looks like you have some pretty good marks there? Kirkland Andrews : Yes. I mean, I think we\u2019ve taken advantage of some higher prices, as we always have at the end of the day, that\u2019s obviously improved our position. But we\u2019re mindful of the fact that, the balance of that whether we hedge or whether we remain open, that obviously provides a backdrop or support for the retail supply, especially around ERCOT. But yes, certainly a product of well-timed hedging taking advantage of rally and market prices beyond the prop here, certainly. Greg Gordon : Okay. Thank you, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fleishman : Yes. Hi, good morning. So maybe\u2026 Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Steve. Steven Fleishman : Hey, Mauricio. So maybe just a little more color on, obviously, retail has been hurt by the supply cost and the like. But just how\u2019s retail performing, both in terms of the traditional ERCOT business, customer count, things like that? And also, how would you characterize how the acquisitions have gone so far in retail? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Steve. Well, let me turn it to Elizabeth. Elizabeth Killinger : So first, I\u2019ll start with the acquisitions. We are very pleased with both the XOOM and Stream acquisitions. They have integrated very seamlessly into our organization. And in XOOM\u2019s case has set records in selling once it was under our ownership and Stream is integrating well. They\u2019re both culturally and from a team and business process perspective, that\u2019s going very well. We do have some noise in our customer account inter quarter, really because of the acquisitions from the small book transactions, which includes expected early attrition. And so we will \u2013 we \u2013 that\u2019s part of our valuation model. And overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the strength and the performance of our acquisition and retention engine. In light of some customer price pressure \u2013 or bill shock pressure that customers have experienced. So we\u2019ll continue to run this business and balance both EBITDA and customer account with an eye towards long-term growth, which we have demonstrated year in and year out, both on earnings and customer count. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then just at a high level, I mean, just to try and simplify, what you\u2019re seeing in the mix here is just the supply cost retail going up because of higher ERCOT prices and you are capturing that essentially in generation with better numbers 2019, 2020 than you might have initially expected\u2026 Mauricio Gutierrez : That\u2019s correct. Steven Fleishman : Is that\u2026? Mauricio Gutierrez : \u2026that\u2019s absolutely correct, Steve. I mean, this is a complementary and countercyclical nature of these two businesses. But as I said in the past, I mean, I\u2019m focused on total gross margin for the company. Let\u2019s focus on the segments and making sure that that top \u2013 that gross margin is just stable and predictable regardless of market conditions. Steven Fleishman : And then just lastly, on the PPA strategy, I saw you added a little bit more in Texas. Just what \u2013 where should we maybe see that going over the next year or so? How much more do you want to do? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Well, I mean, as you noted, I mean, we only executed 100 megawatts this quarter. And I think that is an indication of the slowdown that we\u2019re seeing on solar development. We\u2019re just not seeing the attractiveness on the solar PPA that we saw initially. I mean, there has been an increase in cost for some of the solar developers, tariffs. So I think that\u2019s having a very active strategy like this just gives us a lot of visibility in terms of the speed at which solar development is happening and what I\u2019m telling you is slowing down a little bit. In terms of how much more from the 1.4, the governing number here is the size of our retail business. So if you look at our retail business big long versus our generation, I would feel comfortable if we execute that\u2019s close to 2 to 2.5 gigs, but obviously, that\u2019s going to depend on the economics that we can achieve on the PPAs. So, what I think, that\u2019s a good observation, Steve. Steven Fleishman : Is it just less \u2013 you\u2019re not seeing kind of some of the irrational price offers, I guess, that might have been there before in terms of \u2026? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean, I think, some of the offers that we saw earlier, we don\u2019t see it anymore, and I think it\u2019s a function of two things. One, I mean, keep in mind that the counterparty that we\u2019re talking about are pretty high-quality counterparties, because we can provide them a \u2013 an average of 10-year contract with balance sheet that is investment grade. So we actually enable them and put them at a higher competitive position vis-\u00e0-vis other developers. But I think it\u2019s also impacted by perhaps higher costs due to tariffs that have been imposed. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : You\u2019re welcome, Steve. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Will Grainger with Citi. Your line is open. Praful Mehta : Hi. This is actually Praful from Citi. So on the EBITDA profile that you provided over the longer-term, as you think about your capital allocation, just wanted to understand you think about any degradation of EBITDA in that profile, especially if there\u2019s any replacement needed for existing assets that \u2013 existing generation assets that need to be replaced. How do you think about that in that mix? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. No, good morning, Praful. So the way I think about it is, perhaps we need to do it on a regional basis. In Texas, I feel very stable, because we have pretty well balanced portfolio between generation and retail. So, whether you have a contango or a backward-dated curve, your retail margins can expand, while your generation contracts on the other way around. So I see that very stable in Texas for the foreseeable future. The East, this is slightly different, because our generation continues to be bigger than our retail and is primarily driven by capacity prices. The good thing in the East is that, we know exactly what it is in the next three years. So, we have good, I mean, everybody has good visibility on that. Beyond that is going to depend on what happens with FERC and the actions that they take around the out-of-market subsidies for nuclear resources. And that\u2019s really going to depend on that regulatory outcome. What I will say is that, we have actually seen a, let\u2019s call it, a nicer price in California. Capacity prices have increased significantly. So, while we have seen some pressure in capacity in the East, we actually have seen some gains in the West that have balanced each other out. So I would say that \u2013 I just feel very comfortable with the guidance that we have provided for 2020 as a base to do the calculations. And obviously, what we provided was illustrative, but I feel very, very comfortable with that. Praful Mehta : Gotcha. That\u2019s super helpful context. Then in terms of what you said on the growth CapEx and retail, giving you\u2019re a pretty balanced, as you said, in the Texas market already, should we think about the incremental retail that you\u2019re looking to acquire in the near-term to be in different markets other than Texas, or how should we think about that? Mauricio Gutierrez : No, I think it will be both. I mean, obviously, I want to grow the East to better balance. But I will say that, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re not growing in Texas. I mean, we have a pretty commanding lead, I mean, a little over 30% of market share. So, I mean, there\u2019s still \u2013 if we can grow Texas, I mean, think about Texas in the context of, there is organic growth in Texas as a whole. The market is growing 2%. So, we can grow with the market. And then number two, if we can add additional market share from competitors, either through organic initiatives or inorganic acquisitions. I mean, we\u2019re going to do that. But that is value for me regardless of where the region. And then on the rebalancing side in Texas, I mean, we\u2019re going to continue to take advantage of these new technologies that are coming into the market and I mean, we\u2019re doing it at very attractive levels. We\u2019re participating on that and. And all this does is just lower our cost of serving load So yes, I\u2019m good with them. Praful Mehta : Gotcha. Super helpful. Then just finally, in terms of like the breadth of retail, would you look at distributed generation or some of those types of assets as well as part of your broadened retail mix, or are you kind of going to stay more focused in terms of what you acquire? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean, if your question on distributed generation is something like residential solar. No, I\u2019m not. I think we have been there, we have done that. We\u2019re focused on continuing to establish a much closer relationship with our customers creating more loyalty and infinity, providing more products and services. But we don\u2019t have to vertically integrate every single product that we offer to our customers. I mean, I\u2019m okay partnering. And actually, today, we offer residential solar. We just offer it through partners. And what is important to me is that, we maintain the relationship with a customer, that we give them best-in-class interface to all the products and services that we provide, whether we do them all in-house or not. And in the case of some of the distributed resources, I\u2019d rather partner than vertically integrate. Praful Mehta : Gotcha. Super helpful, Mauricio. Thanks so much. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ali Agha : Thank you. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning. First question, for you, Kirk. As you unveil your higher or more aggressive dividend policy, wondering if you\u2019ve had discussions with the rating agencies. Does it have any implications on their thinking regarding investment-grade? And just from a priority point of view, where does investment-grade or achieving that fit in versus capital allocation, et cetera? Mauricio Gutierrez : Kirk? Kirkland Andrews : Well, I mean, first of all, it\u2019s Kirk. We\u2019ve obviously allocated the capital necessary to achieve the metrics, both in 2019 and sustain them into 2020. So from a capital allocation perspective, we feel very comfortable that we put our money, where our metrics need to be in are, if you will. As far as the dividend is concerned, we \u2013 based on our ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies, I think, certainly, they\u2019re very focused on capital allocation. Our first priority, which we say to you and say to them, notwithstanding the fact we don\u2019t perceive the need for capital. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that our priority goes first to maintain those balance sheet metrics. That\u2019s a very important part of the dialogue, both with our investors as well as the agencies. And we feel comfortable that the dividend commitment is right-sized relative to our confidence in the overall magnitude of free cash flow, still affording us a lot of financial flexibility around that. And because the chart Mauricio showed, depicts the combination or the benefit of ongoing share repurchases to a significant degree, i.e. shrinking the denominator, keeps us from needing to grow the overall dividend at the same magnitude as the growth on a per share basis. So that also keeps the capital necessary for that very manageable. So I think all that factors in both to our thinking about the dividend, as well as the dialogue we have with the rating agencies around that topic. Ali Agha : Gotcha. And then secondly, coming back to the \u2013 this integrated model. So, as you depict to us on Slide 21, at least on the wholesale side, you\u2019re seeing this \u2013 currently, this downward trend, 2021 over 2020. When you think about the retail business, how much of that roughly do you think is offset? And on an integrated basis just big picture-wise, how does 2021 today look to you relative to 2020? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I would say pretty flat. I mean, we have the ability to expand margins on that environment. So when I say that is complementary and countercyclical, I mean, if there is a \u2013 if there is some backwardation in the curve and that\u2019s putting some pressure on generation. I expect retail to expand those margins. And keep in mind that we\u2019re also, in 2021, we\u2019re going to start seeing the benefits of the PPAs that we have also signed. So they tend to be somewhat very attractive compared to market. So all it does is, we\u2019re serving low at a lower cost of goods sold for a lack of a better word. Now, like I said, I mean, you also have to look at the East is slightly different, right? Like I said, I mean, it\u2019s driven primarily by capacity revenues. But we provide very clear visibility in terms of what those capacity revenues are for the next three years. They\u2019re locked in, so there\u2019s no surprises. And we can adjust our maintenance programs. We can adjust our cost structure depending on what the earnings profile of those assets in these would be. So I mean, that\u2019s a lever that you perhaps actually that you don\u2019t see in these one dimensional sensitivity that we provide, is what else can we do around the cost structure of the company to ensure that we maintain competitiveness in our fleet. Ali Agha : Gotcha. And final question, which \u2013 one of your peer companies talked about this concept of retail backwardation, where they\u2019re seeing negative margins in the first couple of years turning to positive as they sign fixed price longer-term contracts. Just curious, are you seeing any of that in your portfolio in your markets? Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, everything that we do, I mean, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about commercial and industrial long-term transaction? Is that what you\u2019re talking about? Ali Agha : Yes. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So I mean, I guess a couple of things. Number one, when we do any C&I transaction, we back-to-back it with supply. So we\u2019re basically locking a gross margin for the term of the transaction. We always have the option to either source it internally through our generation or source it from the market depending on what\u2019s the most optimal way for us. And then number three, you\u2019re always going to see the impact of though \u2013 that business in our earnings. So, transparency, clarity, visibility, it is important. So, while I can \u2013 I mean, in a contango market on a backward-dated market, when you\u2019re doing a term deal, is there \u2013 are you levelizing the curve, and it creates a different dynamic? Yes, of course. But I mean, the most important thing here is supply. We\u2019re trying to lock in a margin through the term of the deal. And we want to make sure that supply and the \u2013 I guess, the C&I deal, the revenue line and the cost line is pretty consistent. Ali Agha : Okay. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any closing comments or remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you. Well, thank you very much for your interest in NRG and look forward to talking to you in the upcoming weeks. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Twanda. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call is scheduled for 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation. And now with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. And thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass business and Chris Moser, Head of our Operations. This earnings call marks the four year anniversary since we started a new direction for NRG. We have accomplished many things together. We refocus and streamline our business to better serve our customers. We significantly reduced our total debt and strengthened our balance sheet which is now on a path to an investment grade rating. We provided discipline and transparency on how we invest our capital and most importantly we have done it the right way for our employees and our stakeholders. The company has never been stronger or with a brighter future than it is today. I'd like to start by highlighting the key messages for the quarter on a slide 3. First our integrated business delivered EBITDA in line with our 2019 expectations during a period of volatile market conditions further validating the benefits of integration between retail and wholesale. As such we're also reaffirming 2020 guidance. Second we have a comprehensive sustainability framework with industry leading carbon reduction goals. Given that I view these frameworks as foundational to our business and an integral part of our long term strategy I will provide additional details later in the presentation. And third we continue to execute our capital allocation strategy by adhering to our principles and our commitment to being excellence towards shareholder capital. Moving to the business of financial highlights on Slide 4. Beginning with our 2019 scorecard on the left hand side of the slide we executed well on all our priorities. We delivered a strong financial and operational results despite challenging market conditions during the summer. We also had our best safety year ever marking these the second back to back years of record performance Congratulations to all my colleagues for this remarkable accomplishment. With respect to our transformation plan, we deliver on our goals. We have now completed over 90% of the plan with all cost savings on working capital completed and $80 million of additional margin enhancement remaining to be achieved in 2020. After two years of focusing on rightsizing the business and strengthening our balance sheet, in 2019, we focused on perfecting our integrated business. We signed 1.6 gigawatts of medium term solar PPAs in (inaudible) returned our Gregory plant to service ahead of the summer and acquired Stream Energy adding important capabilities to our retail portfolio. We also announced the acceleration of our science based carbon reduction goals to align with guidance from the new intergovernmental panel on climate change to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius so as to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Finally, we continue to add year to our capital allocation principles and provided additional transparency into our long term capital allocation plan. In 2019, we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend. We also announced the increase of the dividend from $0.12 per share to a $1.20 per share with the first payment made in the first quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter, we received an upgrade from Moody\u2019s with a positive outlook moving us closer to our goal of a solid investment grade rating. On the right hand side of this slide, similar to how we have presented the financials throughout the year, EBITDA is shown on a same store basis adjusted for asset sales and deconsolidations. We ended the year with $1.977 billion of EBITDA or 24% higher than last year. While we deliver on EBITDA, our free cash flow came in the large expected range due to timing issues with Kirk which Kirk will address in greater detail later in the presentation. On the next two slides, I want to talk to you about our comprehensive sustainability framework. It is one that expands across our business from operations on employees to customers and suppliers. Sustainability is embedded in our culture aligned with our strategy and necessary for our long-term success. Beginning on slide 5, our sustainability philosophy is guided by three core principles : accountability, transparency and engagement. So let me start with accountability. Good intentions are just not enough. We need goals that are clear and measurable. We have a few examples in this slide including safety, environmental responsibility and our commitment to inclusion and diversity. You have heard me say this before, safety is our number one priority. We measure and report our safety performance every quarter and we hold ourselves accountable to top (inaudible) performance. In this way we\u2019re able to take corrective actions to improve our performance in the areas where we fall below our standards. Like safety we have many other goals across our business that measure not just what we do but how we do it including our carbon reduction goals which I will address in more detail in the next slide. Measurable goals are important. But we also need to communicate our progress in a clear and transparent way. We do this every year with the release of our sustainability report. We were the first and only company in our sector to comply with the sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB back in 2016. We were one of the first companies to publicly commit to the task force on climate related financial disclosures or TCFD. And recently we were awarded a leadership level across all three Carbon Disclosure projects or CVP programs on climate risk water security and supply chain engagement. Finally we are committed to engaging and investing in the communities where we live and do business from major cities with large concentrations of customers to smaller communities that are home to our power plants and employees. In 2019 alone we donated to almost 700 organizations. But we aren\u2019t just focused on monetary donations. We're also investing our time in the communities with over 11,000 volunteer hours my our employees across 264 organizations. We also participate with organizations like CECP where we presented our sustainability framework and long term strategy to investors. This engagement is something that makes us very proud and defines us as a company. Now let me turn to Slide 6. I want to talk to you about our decarbonization efforts as we transition our business away from traditional generation and closer to the retail customer. In September of last year we accelerated our carbon reduction goals to confirm with a 1.5 degree trajectory. This means reducing our carbon emissions 50% by 2025 and to be net zero by 2050. These goals are some of the most ambitious in the sector and we're proud with the progress that we have made to date. We are already 83% of the way to our 2025 goal with clear line of sight to achieve it with our current portfolio. Although our baseline is 2014, we have been decarbonizing our fleet since 2010 as you can see on the left hand side of the slide. We have reduced our carbon emissions by 40 million metric tons in just the last 10 years. That is the equivalent of taking 9 million cars off the road every year. As you can see, our actions move the needle. We will continue to share our progress and plans in the months to come. From an earnings perspective, as we progress towards decarbonization, cogeneration is contributing less and less to our earnings. Moving to the right side of the slide, in just the last six years coal as a percentage of our total revenues has decreased 55% and that is inclusive of capacity revenues. This is an important distinction as energy revenues have been the bulk of the decline and our coal assets in the east now act primarily as insurance for grid reliability and not for electric generation. Finally, sustainability is an integral part of our culture and incorporated in our strategic decisions. We continue to take concrete actions to limit our own carbon footprint while also providing customers with cleaner energy choices such as electricity plants from renewable resources. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the future and be on the lookout for the release of our annual sustainability report in early May. Now turning to slide 7, I want to provide you a brief update on our core markets. Beginning on the left side of the slide, as you can see on the chart electric demand in ERCOT continues to grow at the fastest pace in the nation between 2% and 3% per year for the foreseeable future. Now as you all know the direct result of this robust (inaudible) growth is a record-high supply and demand balance for reserve margin. This requires a tremendous amount of generation investments simply to maintain the current low reserve margin. As a large participant in the market we are looking to facilitate solid new builds to improve reliability and rebalance our portfolio by entering into medium term PPAs. These PPAs enabled the developers to obtain cost effective financing and tax equity to economically develop the project. And for us they complement our generation profile, lower our cost structure and allows us to better serve our customers. From an overall market perspective, we expect ERCOT to remain tight and volatile for the foreseeable future. Our integrated platform is well-positioned to thrive during this volatile and emerging renewable build cycle. Moving to the right side of the slide, we are seeing steady progress in all of our core markets with FERC ISOs addressing the current market design and adapting it to the evolved grade of the future. While progress has not been perfect we support efforts that create durable markets that benefit consumers and foster the transition to a cleaner and sustainable energy future. In ERCOT regulators continue to refine our scarcity pricing mechanism to incentivize new generation which is predominantly renewable and intermittent while adequately compensating existing resources that provide firm generation. In the East FERC issued a ruling on the PJM capacity market proceeding which resulted from its finding that current market design is unjust and unreasonable. This ruling seeks to correctly account for resources that receive state subsidies particularly out of markets nuclear subsidies that stifle development of renewable energy and distorts the integrity of competitive markets. This ruling is just the most recent in a series of market reforms that PJM and FERC have undertaken since 2004 to protect the integrity of competitive markets. Moving to capital allocation on slide 8. You can see that our track record is directly in line with our roadmap to value creation of stabilize rightsize and now redefine our company. During 2019 we achieved our investment grade credit metric target. We announced the highly accretive stream retail transaction and closed it within three months. And in line with my commitment to returning capital, we increased our dividend tenfold and executed $1.44 billion in share repurchases. For our 2020 capital allocation plan, we are already executing. We paid our first dividend under our recently announced a $1.20 per share with 7% to 9% annual growth dividend policy. We have already begun executing share repurchases under our current $400 million share buyback program consistent with a 50% return of capital commitment. And like in 2019 and every year since I took over as CEO, you can expect disciplined and timely allocation of our excess on permitted capital as we earn it throughout the year. Last, I want to remind everyone about our capital allocation framework on the right side of the slide. As you can see on the waterfall, we remain committed to maintaining top docile safety and operational excellence. We will continue to have a strong balance sheet having now achieved investment grade credit metrics. And last quarter we provided enhanced visibility into our long term capital return philosophy at least 50% will be return through our mix of dividends and share repurchases. For the other 50%, we remain committed to our growth investment criteria which must meet or exceed our financial professionals and be consistent with our core strategy or it will be returned to shareholders. Now given that the seasonality of our cash flows and liquidity ultimately in form capital allocation, it is my intention for the 50% return of capital to be allocated more programmatically with a dividend paid quarterly and share repurchases throughout the year. At the risk of being redundant, as we have consistently said on nearly every earnings call and every meeting, we are committed to being prudent allocators of shareholder capital. We will continue to demonstrate our discipline by every year into our stated principles and allocate capital to opportunities that maximizes long term value for your investment. That's our mindset. So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review. Kirkland Andrews : Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary on slide 10, NRG finished 2019 with $1.977 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.212 billion in free cash flow before growth. Retail delivered $920 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $32 million decrease versus 2018 largely due to higher supply costs in the ERCOT region. Highlighting the benefits of our integrated platform posted higher wholesale prices particular in ERCOT benefited our generation segment which delivered $1.057 billion in 2019. Moreover as our prior year 2018 generation results included approximately $180 million in EBITDA from assets subsequently sold as well as (inaudible) results prior to their deconsolidation. On a same store basis, our 2019 generation EBITDA results represented over $400 million year-over-year increase in EBITDA. Our consolidated 2019 results also include the benefit of the full run rate of $590 million from cost savings as well as $135 million of margin enhancement from our transformation plan. 2019 free cash flow before growth was $1.212 billion. Although these results represent a $92 million increase over 2018 free cash flow fell short of our guidance range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion due to the impact of a delay in the timing of certain cash flow items which will now contribute to 2020 free cash flow. In total on a net basis the impact of these timing-related items was approximately $60 million. The largest component of these items was to delay in the receipt of $34 million in A and B credit refunds due to NRG in 2019 as a result of the Tax Reform and Jobs Act. NRG filed the required documentation associated with these refunds on time. And we fully expect to receive them in 2020. The balance of the net timing impact primarily consists of other working capital-related items which we now expect in 2012. And as a result, the full amount of the $60 million will be realized in this year. Turning to an update on share repurchase activity we completed the latest $250 million share repurchase program announced in 2019 and have now turned toward executing on programmatic share repurchases in 2020 as a part of our revised capital allocation framework announced last quarter. This framework includes our commitment to returning at least 50% of the annual free cash flow to our shareholders through a combination of our increased dividend and ongoing share repurchases. As a result in 2020, we expect to execute on approximately $380 million of incremental share repurchases, which I\u2019ll explain in greater detail in a few moments. In 2019, reduced debt by $600 million and achieved our target investment grade metrics for the year. We also realized an important milestone as we continue toward our goal to align our ratings with our credit metrics and our reduced risk profile, as we received an upgrade from Moody's to Ba1, one notch below investment grade with a positive outlook. Finally, as Mauricio mentioned in his opening remarks, we\u2019re reaffirming our 2020 adjusted \u2013 consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and consolidate free cash flow before growth guidance of $1.275 billion and to $1.475 billion. Turning to slide 12 for a final summary of 2019 capital allocation, with changes since our prior update highlighted in blue. After adjusting for 2019, actual cash flow results our total 2019 excess capital available was $2.845 billion and was allocated as follows, just over $700 million or approximately 25% was used to fund reductions in total debt in order to achieve our target investment grade metrics. $1.44 billion representing just over 50% of total capital was used to fund share repurchases during 2019. We ended the year with $60 million remaining under the most recent $250 million buyback program and have completed these repurchases during early 2020. Dividends in 2019 under the prior dividend policy represented the balance of return of shareholder capital and of course will represent a significantly more robust component of capital allocation going forward, $551 million was allocated to growth in other investments or approximately $830 million increase versus our prior update, reflecting M&A fees and other integration costs associated with our retail acquisition. After a slight shift in transformation plan cost to achieve from 2019 to 2020, we ended 2019 with $35 million in unallocated capital which will be part of the 2020 summary and I'll now turn to that on slide 12. As shown on the left of slide 12, the combination of $35 million carried over from 2019 plus at the midpoint of our 2020 free cash flow guidance leads to just over $1.4 billion in capital available for allocation in 2020. As I mentioned before, we ended 2019 with the $60 million balance remaining under our latest buyback program which has now been completed in 2012.  Adjusting for that 2019 carryover we have $1.35 billion in 2020 capital remaining to be allocated to which we then apply our framework of 50% return of shareholder capital and 50% toward potential value accretive investment opportunities. $675 million will be returned to shareholders in 2020 via our increased dividend for $295 million and the balance of $380 million through ongoing share repurchases of which we have executed $62 million year to date. The remaining 50% of excess capital is available for potential investment opportunities of which only $61 million are currently identified. As shown in the box below the chart this consist of the balance of cost to achieve associated with the transformation plan, our ongoing commitment to legacy GenOn pension obligations and cost associated with readying the site of our retired and senior generating station in California to be marketed for redevelopment. This site is located in San Diego County and is a prime location for real estate developer. As with our successful sale of the Potrero site outside San Francisco just a few years ago the Encina site represents a similar compelling opportunity for monetization. The balance of $640 million in unallocated capital remains available for accretive investment opportunities. However should we be able to find sufficient magnitude of strategically consistent value enhancing opportunities which exceed both our hurdle rate as well as the opportunity cost of our own staff. We intend to allocate any remaining balance of this capital to our shareholders. Finally turning to Slide 13 based on 2019 actual results we ended the year near the midpoint of our target investment grade metric range. For 2020 We remain on track to further strengthen our investment grade credit metrics to 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA making 2020 the second year of achieving investment grade credit metrics for NRG. Importantly we expect to achieve these results without the need for additional capital allocation toward debt reduction. We continue to believe that the combination of our stable cash flows and strong credit metrics along with the continued execution places us in a position to build on our recent ratings upgrade toward achieving investment grade ratings over the next 12 months to 18 months. And with that I'll turn it back to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kirk. Turning to Slide 15 I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2020 priorities and expectations. As always our top priority remains delivering on our financial and operational objectives and adhering to our capital allocation principles. In addition to completing our transformation plan, we remain focused on further perfecting and growing our business. These means rebalancing our current portfolio through additional asset optimization efforts and growing our customer base with compelling retail products supported by capital light generation supply. With a large asset sales completed, we're looking at further optimizing single assets and our real estate portfolio at large. An example of that is what we're doing at the Encine site getting it ready for commercial redevelopment and the development on sale of canal 3. These type of projects are generally highly creative, don't use permanent capital and further simplify our story. We will also continue to enhance and simplify our disclosures to better line with the way we manage our integrated business. In the next earnings call, we will provide additional disclosures around our ERCOT platform. Finally and like I said earlier, our company today is stronger than it has ever been. We have the financial flexibility to continue perfecting our platform to make it simpler and more predictable, while consistently returning significant capital to shareholders. I am very excited for 2020 and the future of our company and I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. With all, Twanda, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I really have two. One is how far into the year will you kind of seek growth-related opportunities before you decide to pivot and utilize that capital for share \u2013 for share buybacks? That's question one. Question two, just wanted to think about the \u2013 the asset base and how you're looking at whether it's the -- some of the fossil plants in the northeast or some of the gas plants in California, what could potentially you know not be a long-term core asset for NRG? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Michael. Good morning and thank you for your questions. I mean the first one related to the timing on you know whether we allocate this capital to grow or we reallocated to share buybacks. I think during the second half of the year, we're going to have more clarity in whether we have actionable growth opportunities that not only meet our financial thresholds but are better than the opportunity cost of buying our own shares. So you know I think at that time we will now start you know reallocating the capital to share buybacks. And then with respect to your second -- yes with respect to your second question about I think it's more broadly just what is core generation in our portfolio. I think in the past I said you know Texas is pretty well balanced and we're actually complementing our supply generation with PPAs. In the East and particularly California, I mean in the east we -- our generation is bigger than our retail supply. So either we grow our retail or we reduce our generation position and we're evaluating that. Now keep in mind that you know the model that we have going forward is we really want generation that serves our a purpose and that purpose is to you know better serve our customers in the most cost efficient way. So we're constantly and continuously going to evaluate you know our generation portfolio in light of that \u2013 of that priority. California is less \u2013 strategic less because you know we don't have a retail business so you know while we have you know benefited from an increasing capacity price in California, you know we're going to continuously evaluate that portfolio through the lenses of our long term strategic goals. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you very much for that. And then finally when you're looking at cost management opportunities kind of longer term, where do you think the greatest opportunities exist and I'm thinking kind of post 2020? Mauricio Gutierrez : I think you know first I'm assuming you're talking about opportunities for growth or is that what you're referring to Michael? Michael Lapides : No I'm talking about costs management. So reducing OpEx\u2026 Mauricio Gutierrez : Oh costs management? Michael Lapides : Yes. Yes. Mauricio Gutierrez : Okay. Well a couple of things, you know we've been completely focused right now on executing our transformation right now. So I mean I'm very pleased with the progress that we have made. We're not done yet. We've got to deliver on the margin enhancement. You know as we finalized that, we're going to start looking you know how do we \u2013 you know where are the other opportunities are, as we integrate the portfolio and simplify the story, even beyond the \u2013 let's call it the big asset sales, I think there is an opportunity to further streamline the inner workings of our organization which will translate in cost savings. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning. Praful Mehta : Can you hear me? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, good morning. Praful Mehta : Okay, morning. All right. So the first question was on PJM and Mauricio you talked about the assets are basically getting more capacity rather than energy. Given the uncertainty with what's happening with the FERC ruling allowed capacity auctions and the capacity market, do you see any concern that if every state were to step away from the PJM capacity market that it has a risk for you in terms of your capacity revenue or kind of how do you see that playing out? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So let me provide you just a little bit of context and perhaps I \u2013 I'll turn it over to Chris to talk about how it\u2019s going to play out. I mean I want to remind everyone that our total exposure to PJM is less than 5% of our EBITDA. While we have been and very active on the PJM discussion, I also -- I\u2019m mindful that is \u2013 the exposure that we have is just less than 5% of our EBITDA so we need to allocate resources accordingly to that. Having said that I will tell you that I was very pleased with the third quarter. I think it is very consistent with what they have done in previous years which is maintain the integrity of competitive markets which have greatly benefited consumers across the PJM footprint. So with that said, Chris in terms of what to expect next? Kirkland Andrews : Hey, Praful, it\u2019s Kirk. I would say that I agree with Mauricio there that FERC MOPR ruling was positive for competitive markets and should help mitigate some of the impact of handouts to some local utilities. You're talking about states pulling out arguably that\u2019s the FRR process and I think as states look at that they may see that FRR is an inferior alternative for consumers who have a region wide capacity market. I mean if you look at the history of FRRs they\u2019ve consistently cost the consumers in that area three times to 10 times the prevailing auction rate. They shift risk on to a captive set of ratepayers locked into local monopoly. The latest numbers I saw from the IMM indicates that the nukes that are getting the right now are profitable without them so it's unclear to me why an FRR would be the choice of anybody except the ones receiving those subsidies. So yes there's obviously a lot of smoke around this right now and a lot of states are talking about it. But I mean if you dig into what FRRs have done in the past and what they're expected to do in the future it doesn't seem like a great idea for me. Praful Mehta : Got it. Well that's super helpful color there. Maybe moving on to more strategic question which is as you know ESG and you've talked about it as well in your slides. It\u2019s become a big focus investor focus has changed and continues to change with environmental becoming a big factor. Do you see at some point going private is an option that you would consider or how would you look at that go private given how generally investor perception is changed over time. Kirkland Andrews : Yes. Well first I agree that ESG has gotten a lot of focus lately. For us this has been a focus of the company since I became CEO. I mean as you can see from the progress and the details that I provided today on the presentation I mean you don't build this overnight. This is the result of 3.5 years you know 4 years of intense work and intense focus on ESG. So not only it\u2019s important for us it's foundational and it's imbedded in everything that we do. To your second question around going private. Right now, it\u2019s not most on me that you know where our stock price is and you know the difference between that it really doesn\u2019t reflect the fundamental value of our company. We continued to be focused on executing and delivering on our results, we believe that the value proposition that we have of a business that is balanced between generation and retail, that provides a stable and predictable earnings, with a you know, investment grade metric balance sheet and a meaningful return of capital shareholders is compelling and you know if that doesn't translate, you know we will evaluate all options, my goal \u2013 my mandate is to maximize shareholder value and everything that we do and all the decisions that we take on allocating capital is with that mindset. So you know, I mean right now we're going to be focused on executing but it\u2019s not a lot for me that at some point we will have to evaluate all options. Praful Mehta : Got you. And just to clarify on that when you say to evaluate all options is there a time window, we should be thinking about in terms of -- if the public market works or not, how should we think about that? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes I mean right now we're still in the final year of a three year transformation plan that we have done. We are on a path to achieving investment grade credit rating. I think, when we start seeing the all of those things finalizing and you know obviously we already provided enhanced visibility on our capital allocation. So when these things start you know all visible to shareholders and you know, we just don't see, we continue to see a significant gap between the stock price and the fundamental value of our company. I think that will be the time to start evaluating all other options. Praful Mehta : Got it. Very helpful, very clear. Thanks so much, Mauricio. Kirkland Andrews : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our final question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning to you. Thanks for the time again. Just following up on sort of the capital allocation conversations here. Can we talk a little bit more about the unallocated piece and just how you think about finding opportunities that meet this more stringent hurdle rate? And again I'll say it I mean I appreciate the capital allocation diligence that you've articulated here but given just how high of a threshold that is, how do you think about maybe the timing but also related to that the opportunities that that might be available at that sort of 15% beyond just retail, it would seem as if buybacks would be the obvious default here and so. Any thoughts on that? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Julien. Well, first of all, the recent price of our stock is never lost on me and particularly when it comes to capital allocation. So as I think about these growth opportunities as I said before and not only they have to meet our financial hurdles, but they need to be superior to the cost of not buying back our own shares. So having said that, there are some areas of opportunities that are consistent with our long term strategy, I will say that retail while there has been a lot of consolidation, there's still some opportunities I would say in the small to medium size companies. And given the scale that we have and the scope of our operational platform, we can achieve significant synergies when looking at these opportunities. I don't see the same attractive opportunities in the generation side. That\u2019s why we have been executing on our capital like PPA strategy. So I mean, I don\u2019t disagree with you I mean, particularly with the recent performance of our stock price, it makes it so much harder to allocate capital to growth or in this case you know it makes the probability of reallocating that capital from growth to share buybacks, you know much more probable. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it and if I can follow up on one more niche type issue here, how are you thinking about New York ultimately given some of the new rags and compliance and just strategic options broadly? Kirkland Andrews : Hey Julien, Kirk here. You \u2013 if you go look at that 10-K there's a line in there that says in effect late last year New York finalized the more stringent regulation that will result in the retirement of the asset of the story at Pratt & Whitney\u2019s in early 2023. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. All right. So it's pretty definitive? Kirkland Andrews : Yes, I mean the filing will go in, in a couple of days but that line is in the 10-K somewhere. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. All right. Excellent. Thank you all very much. Kirkland Andrews : No. Yes. The one thing that I will say just keep in mind that you know that is you know it's very valuable to look to New York City and as we always do with our portfolio, we try to evaluate you know what is the most you know profit maximizing way of you know \u2013 or looking up that you know these real estate sites. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks. Kirkland Andrews : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Thank you. Due to the interest of time, that is all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez for to close. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Twanda. Once again, thank you very much for your interest in NRG and I look forward to continuing our conversation. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nate Stubbs, VP, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Nate Stubbs : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss the results of Vivint Smart Home and APX Group Holdings for the three month period ended March 31, 2020. On today\u2019s call, we will be presenting the results for Vivint Smart Home. In the press release we issued today as well as the accompanying presentation, we also provide tables with reconciliations for the results of APX Group Holdings. Joining me on the conference call this afternoon are Todd Pedersen, Vivint Smart Home\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; Dale R. Gerard, Vivint\u2019s CFO; and Scott Hardy, Vivint\u2019s COO. I would like to begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including with regards to the company\u2019s future performance and prospects. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance. You should not put undue reliance on these statements. You should understand that a number of important factors, including the items discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2020, as such factors may be updated from time to time in our filings with the SEC, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In today\u2019s remarks, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for historical periods to the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are available in the earnings release and accompanying presentation which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website or on the financial information page of the Investor Relations portion of our website. I will now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Pedersen : Thanks, Nate, and good afternoon to everyone joining the call. I hope everyone is staying safe in the current environment. And today, we will cover three main topics : discuss our financial and operating results for the first quarter, review our customer engagement and the performance of our platform during this difficult time, and highlight key elements of our business and actions we\u2019ve taken that give us confidence in our performance for the remainder of 2020 and beyond. We\u2019ve had a great start to 2020, and we are pleased to see significant improvements in our key metrics year-over-year. Revenue in total subscribers continue to grow, and EBITDA margins continue to expand despite the challenges related to the current environment. Dale will provide more specifics on the financials during his remarks, as well as share updated thoughts about our full year 2020 performance. The remainder of my commentary will focus on the Vivint Smart Home story in the context of COVID-19. Why our customers value our services even more during difficult and uncertain times like these, why we think our financial model is built to withstand the current environment, what proactive operational measures we have taken to protect our employees, our customers and our business and how we plan to get back up to speed with our direct owned sales teams. Our services qualify is essential under the guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In a time when we\u2019re asked to stay at home for an extended period, there\u2019s no better time to have a comprehensive smart home system. Vivint Smart Home provides essential services to nearly 1.6 million customers across North America. Vivint services include life-saving and life-protecting 24/7 professional monitoring for emergency situations such as medical, fire, carbon monoxide and burglary alerts. Our vertically integrated model includes dedicated customer care and monitoring teams to ensure that we respond to these alerts from our customers within seconds. Our cloud platform and proprietary technology also allows customers to seamlessly manage and protect their homes, whether they\u2019re sheltering in place or away. Vivint takes care of our customers and their families while providing the peace of mind that people demand during times of heightened awareness, anxiety, crime and uncertainty. We\u2019ve been securing and creating smart homes for over 20 years. So I can tell you from experience that Vivint has a history of exhibiting strength and resiliency through challenging economic times. For example, we only witnessed a slight increase in customer attrition in 2008 and 2009 during the global financial crisis. Although the current pandemic poses a unique set of societal problems compared to then, we are confident that our customers will continue to value home security and smart home technology. In fact, a case can be made for pent-up demand forming as a result of this crisis. We have long believed the total addressable market for smart home presents a massive opportunity, and in the not so distant future, the vast majority of the 150 million homes in North America will be running on a comprehensive smart home operating system. We believe Vivint is the best-positioned provider to take advantage should demand accelerate in this way. We are confident in our value proposition because it has been proven over two decades. Today, we have over 21 million connected devices on the Vivint Smart Home proprietary cloud-based platform, and we are uniquely qualified to help our customers deal with the current environment across the various smart home devices we support. From door locks, cameras, security monitoring, thermostats, lighting controls, smart speakers and many other connected devices. All of these innovative products are designed to work together seamlessly through our elegant platform that homeowners can control from their in-home touchscreen hub, through a single app on their phone or other devices or by simply using their voice. Even prior to the current health and economic crisis, we already had the industry-leading engagement on our smart home operating system, with over 13 interactions a day on average and over 1.4 billion daily events being processed on our cloud platform. During the current pandemic, our platform has continued to seamlessly handle all daily interactions as our customers have relied even more on their smart home systems for various and often evolving use cases. Some of these use cases are very intuitive, such as our next-generation doorbell camera that intelligently detects packages and actively helps protect them from porch pirates. With more than 1 million packages that are still on - go missing from porches every day, our newest doorbell camera helps provide homeowners with peace of mind by helping to prevent crime before it happens. Other use cases have become increasingly important while we\u2019ve been sheltering in place, such as using indoor smart cameras to keep a watchful eye on elderly parents while social distancing or to make sure kids are doing their homework during the sudden era of distance learning. Customers are relying even more on smart smoke detectors as more home cooking takes place. And they are recognizing the value of our AI-powered outdoor cameras that recognizes potential lurkers and can sound an alert to scare way potential thieves. Whatever it may be, our customers have been more reliant on the various smart devices that we professionally installed for them in these ways and more. And they continue to lean on our nationwide team of dedicated smart home employees for a more urgent interaction such as real-time security monitoring or to get help in the event of medical emergency. The bottom line is that frequent engagement in the Vivint system is a very good indicator for us, and it\u2019s happening across our customer base during this pandemic. Although our value proposition is clear and we fully expect that our current customers will continue to make the most of what their Vivint system offers them, we also acknowledge that our ability to capitalize on any near term demand for new smart home systems is limited, particularly in light of state sheltering in place, coupled with our own decision to pause all direct-to-home sales in mid-March. Overall uncertainty at the macro level remains at historic highs, and we are closely monitoring how that continues to impact the credit markets and unemployment rates. There are very real risks that the world could be hit with additional waves of the virus, causing more social and economic disruption before a reliable vaccine is ready for widespread use. Fortunately, we benefit from a highly predictable and recurring revenue model, in which roughly 90% of our expected revenue for 2020 was under contract at the beginning of the year. Vivint has also implemented a number of operational changes and safety procedures to continue to protect the health and well-being of our employees while still providing the exceptional service levels our customers have come to rely on. All of these considerations give us great confidence in our ability to weather the current economic environment. To give you a sense for the actions we\u2019ve taken, we have transitioned our highly nimble workforce, including all corporate employees and more than 1,500 of our customer care professionals, to effective work-from-home environments, where they continue to provide uninterrupted customer service and maintain our high-quality standards. We are maintaining our geographically dispersed central monitoring stations to provide 24/7 professional monitoring services for all emergencies. Furthermore, we are now conducting daily fitness-for-duty assessments for all customer-facing employees, which includes a temperature and symptoms check. We are contacting customers before a visit to determine if anyone in the home is experiencing signs of illness or has been exposed to COVID-19, and rescheduling appointments when necessary. We are closely following CDC guidelines for social distancing and hand-washing, including cleaning workspaces and surfaces and not shaking hands with customers. And of course, we\u2019re using protective sanitary equipment during service visits such as disposable gloves, masks and hand sanitizer. We have implemented detailed business continuity plans intended to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our customers, employees and communities, and to protect the financial and operational strength of the company. Dale has more of the details that he\u2019ll share during his remarks around these efforts. But rest assured that we\u2019re remaining judicious around overhead spend, budgets, projects and everything else related to our goal of getting to cash flow neutral. That philosophy has not changed as a result of the pandemic, and we are tracking ahead of our previously stated timeline of 18 to 24 months. Moving now to our plans to resume direct to home sales, which account for about 50% of our new subscriber adds. Our sales teams are ready to hit the ground running, and they have received extensive training on proper interactions with customers in light of the current environment. The key gating factor is that we must follow individual state guidelines in ramping our sales teams across the country. At this point, many states have reopened, and we estimate that our direct to home sales teams are operating at about 70% of their full capacity. In time and assuming no further major setbacks from COVID-19, we\u2019re optimistic that the upcoming summer sales period will proceed. While all of this is happening, our priority remains to take all appropriate steps to protect the health, well-being of our employees and customers. Our other sales channel, national inside sales, which onboards nearly half of all new accounts in a normal environment, has continued to operate without material interruption throughout the pandemic. While we anticipate eventually reaching a full deployment of our direct to home sales channel in the U.S. over the next few weeks, in Canada, because of the lack of consumer financing options and that each account sold there historically has required a significant cash investment by the company, Vivint will no longer originate new customers through the direct-to-home channel. We will continue to sell smart homes through our national inside sales channel. Furthermore, we remain committed to our customers in Canada, and we\u2019ll continue to operate there with dedicated support and services. We anticipate that funding the vast majority of our new customers via the Vivint Flex Pay program will continue to be a key driver in our strategy of profitable subscriber growth. Our external customer financing partners have expressed their commitment to maintaining their current underwriting standards of new smart home customers through the current economic downturn. We believe that we are widening our lead over the competition in enabling customers to easily finance a full smart home experience while also dramatically improving Vivint\u2019s unit economics and the company\u2019s cash flow dynamics. I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through specifics of our first quarter results, as well as to provide our updated thoughts on the remainder of fiscal 2020. Dale Gerard : Thanks, Todd. I\u2019ll walk through the financial slide portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our earnings release. On slide eight, we highlight our revenue, adjusted EBITDA and covenant adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. For first quarter 2020, revenue grew by 9.8% to $303.2 million. The growth in revenue is attributable to a 7.1% increase in total subscribers as well as a 2.3% increase in the average monthly revenue per user. In the center of slide eight, adjusted EBITDA has scaled nicely for the first quarter. The primary drivers were lower net service costs and continued scaling of our general and administrative expenses. For the quarter, we are proud to have scaled adjusted EBITDA margins by 570 basis points to 44.5% of revenue compared to 38.8% in the first quarter of 2019. Meanwhile, covenant adjusted EBITDA, which is a calculation used for our debt covenants, scaled by 840 basis points to 62.6% of revenue compared to 54.2% in the first quarter of 2019. As you look on slide nine, we highlight a few data points for the subscriber portfolio, which were strong across the board. Total subscribers at quarter-end grew from 1.45 million to 1.55 million or 7.1%. Average monthly revenue per user, or AMRU also increased to $65.27, up 2.3% year-over-year. AMRU has been moving up nicely due to recognition of deferred revenue and effective cross-selling of new products, such as our newest generation of outdoor and doorbell cameras. On the next slide, slide 10, we highlight a few points on new subscribers. New subscriber originations were 50,053 for the first quarter, which is strong considering that direct-to-home sales were paused in mid-March. We continue to refine and improve the underwriting requirements of our business, decreasing the number of retail installment contracts or RICs. We saw favorable year-over-year trends in subscriber financing mix during the first quarter, highlighted by a 53% reduction in the number of subscribers financed through retail installment contracts. By shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards our third-party financing partners and pay in full, we are able to reduce our net subscriber acquisition cost and improve our cash flow dynamics. As we look to the future, we will be focused on delivering a true smart home experience to millions of homes in a profitable and cash neutral way. Moving to slide 11, we will cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber. The reduction in net service cost continued to be a significant driver of our earnings improvement during the first quarter of 2020. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber, moving from $17.04 in the first quarter of 2018 to $13.83 in the first quarter of 2019, and now to $11.76 in the most recent quarter, a $5.28 improvement versus 2018. This represents the lowest service cost per subscriber in the last five years by a significant margin and demonstrates the advantage of Vivint\u2019s vertically integrated smart home cloud platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support. As we continue to make improvements in all of these areas, we\u2019re seeing continued positive trends in both the cost of service and customer satisfaction. The result is that our net service margin continued its increasing trend, moving from 68.6% in the first quarter of 2018 to 74% in the first quarter of 2019 and now to 77% in the most recent quarter. These efforts largely explain the improvement seen in our adjusted EBITDA. On the right-hand side of slide 11, we highlight our average net subscriber acquisition cost in the last 12 month period. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2020, net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber decreased to $960. That\u2019s 16% lower year-over-year as we continue to drive down the number of new subscribers that are financed on a Vivint retail installment contract and shift to a higher mix of customers utilizing our financing partners or paying in full for the purchase of their smart home products. During the quarter, we also benefited from pricing leverage on the point-of-sale purchase and installation of equipment. Before the recent pandemic hit, we had already put in place a number of cost-reduction initiatives that were completed during the first quarter and that are expected to meaningfully reduce G&A and overhead costs by streamlining operations, focusing engineering and innovation and driving better customer satisfaction. In addition to these actions and because analyzing how we can operate more efficiently is a continuous exercise of Vivint, we initiated another round of cost-cutting post COVID-19 to further reduce our discretionary spend. Slide 12 covers the lifetime value of our customers and the benefits of a reoccurring revenue model. In the last 12 months, we\u2019ve added approximately $1.75 billion of lifetime value. We continue to see nice backlog numbers, which, as a reminder, represent revenue adjusted for attrition that we expect to recognize over the lifetime of a customer. Backlog at quarter end was $5.73 billion, up 9% compared to $5.24 billion a year ago. Slide 13 depicts our typical subscriber walk that illustrates the changes in total subscribers at quarter end. As expected, our attrition has trended higher than our historical averages given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end of term lifecycle phase. Our attrition dynamics are driven by two primary factors. First, the rate of attrition for a customer cohort changes as it progresses through different phases of the life cycle. We define these phases as interim, end of term and post initial term. Each phase carries with it a corresponding expected attrition rate, with attrition at its highest during the end-of-term phase. As we have shared in past earnings calls, the cohort attrition curves remain fairly steady. The second factor that affects attrition is the percent of total customers in each stage of the life cycle. The percent of customers in the end-of-term phase rose in 2019 and will stay elevated in 2020 before falling again in 2021. In the first quarter, attrition trended slightly higher sequentially by 20 basis points to 14.1%. This remains higher than our long-term trend for attrition, but is in line with our expectations given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end-of-term phase. Now we know there\u2019s a lot of curiosity out there regarding how we think our attrition curve may change as a result of the pandemic. Echoing Todd\u2019s commentary about our past experiences through severe economic downturns, as well as propensity for customers to focus inward and prioritize home security during times of crisis, at this point, we have no reason to think the same structural curve that we\u2019ve discussed previously won\u2019t continue to hold, with a life cycle impact that I spoke about being the primary driver. As a case in point, our portfolio has performed slightly better than expectations in terms of attrition and other leading indicators through the end of April. That\u2019s a good segue into slide 14, where we address our business activity in the interim period since our first quarter ended in March. The key takeaway on the sales front is that we continue to see robust demand for our products and services, and we have continued to acquire new Vivint Smart Home customers, primarily via our national inside sales team, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. On the cost side of the equation, we have curtailed discretionary spending to preserve cash and improve our highly variable cost structure. And as a result of these actions, some of which were initiated as normal course prior to COVID-19, we have achieved greater than $30 million in annualized fixed cost reductions. We have also fully drawn down on our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to increase our cash position, which stood at $305 million as of April 30, and preserved liquidity and flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the global financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our goals regarding cash use and are aiming to get to cash flow neutral ahead of our previously stated 18 to 24 month time frame. Finally, moving to our financial outlook for the year on slide 15. I\u2019ll first share some of the fundamental characteristics of our financial model. Over 95% of our revenue is reoccurring, which provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. Most of our new subscribers that finance their smart home systems choose to enter into five year contracts and remain on the platform for approximately eight years driving significant lifetime margin dollars. Our strong unit economics and scale has contributed to our ability to drive significant adjusted EBITDA improvement. That said, most companies have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. And although we believe our reoccurring model makes us resilient to the full impact of the pandemic, it will affect our outcome for the year. In terms of revised guidance, we expect to end 2020 with 1.55 million to 1.62 million total subscribers. Our estimate for 2020 revenue is $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion versus previous guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.29 billion. And finally, we are reaffirming our previous 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance of between $525 million and $535 million. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And nice job here in the midst of this turmoil. I wanted to - I guess I wanted to start with the subs growth guidance. You reduced that growth expectation by quite a bit in percentage terms, not by much in terms of absolute number of subs. But I wonder what assumptions you\u2019re making on distribution there. Are you thinking that all of the distribution now, from now until the end of the year is going to be from inside sales? Or do you think at some point, you\u2019ll be able to get back out again? Or just what kind of assumption is built into that in terms of selling motion? Todd Pedersen : This is Todd Pedersen speaking. Thanks for the compliment, by the way, on the quarter, we were super happy with it. So it is - it\u2019s a result of our direct-to-home program being put on pause, which was about mid-March. Obviously, like anyone else, we\u2019re trying to be respectful around the states being shut down. And here\u2019s the update on that. We have re-launched that program. We are - by this weekend, we feel like we\u2019ll be about 70% of what we normally would be from a sales rep perspective. There are still states that are not open to do business on the door-to-door program. We kind of - we\u2019re making some adjustments on where they might change as far as markets go. So that - so the number of subscribers is a result of that. The thing I would say, though, is the places that we have deployed. And it\u2019s early, still, but the receptivity and the per-rep average, if we look at it on a daily basis on a per-rep basis is very strong. So we\u2019re trying to - we\u2019re optimistic because we are having great interactions with consumers. We\u2019ve adjusted the process on how we sell in the neighborhoods and not going in people\u2019s homes if they don\u2019t feel comfortable with that. And trying to kind of practice social distancing, but we\u2019re optimistic by trying to make sure that we\u2019re conservative on the projection side. Rod Hall : Okay. Yes, that\u2019s great. Because I figured maybe people will just - even though the sales force is operating, people wouldn\u2019t want them in their house and things like that, so that\u2019s good. Todd Pedersen : It\u2019s actually just - I want to be clear on this. They\u2019ve - it\u2019s been amazing how welcoming people are. Again, we\u2019re wearing masks, gloves, keeping our distance. They can actually e-sign to a cell phone or a tablet, so not to interact directly with the customer, not to go into their homes, but the productivity per rep is really good. So the receptivity from consumers and the demands for our product and services at this time is quite amazing, so... Rod Hall : Okay. Thanks, Todd. And then if I can follow-up on that. I - your guidance now still implies EBITDA margin at least that\u2019s improving this year over last. And I see the big improvement in net service cost per sub, which seems like it\u2019s driving the nice margin improvement. Are you guys assuming that - I guess you\u2019re assuming that can continue along through the year, is that correct? Are we interpreting that the right way, the guidance? Scott Hardy : Yeah, Rod. This is Scott. As we\u2019ve shared, we continue to see impressive gains on service costs, and that\u2019s a function of the vertically integrated business model that Todd talked about, having the integrated software platform, the hardware, the diagnostic tools, controlling the installation process, that\u2019s really helped us drive some significant improvements, both on the cost side and, importantly, on the customer satisfaction side. That said, historically, our service costs have been seasonally lower in Q1. Our service costs tend to be highest in the early months of a customer\u2019s life cycle. So given the seasonality of how we generally put new customers on, particularly in the summer, we tend to see service costs increase in the back half of the year. So while we\u2019re really encouraged by the current trends on service costs and the Q1 results, we wouldn\u2019t anticipate a sustained full year results at that level. Todd Pedersen : I want to add something to that. This is - it\u2019s super important to cite this. We\u2019ve been reporting publicly for about seven years now. And if people go back a few years back - and again, without public shareholders, we had debt holders. Our service costs several years back was north of $18 per subscriber per month, which, by the way, the business still worked at that level. But the - our decision to build out and own a proprietary technology stack, the operating system, the firmware, the hardware, the hardware development, again, like Scott mentioned, the diagnostic tools, this is an incredible and important moat we\u2019ve created and the capability that we have as a company to continue to enhance and tweak these - all of these functions of business to continue to improve the service cost. But really, really important is the delivery of the products and the service to customers. So customer satisfaction is way up. This is not we reduce cost and our service levels are worse, this is our service levels are as good as they\u2019ve ever been. So we\u2019re incredibly pleased with these results. Scott is being a bit modest. Rod Hall : I was just curious what drives that EBITDA margin expansion then in the guide. Is it something else or is it probably service cost? Dale Gerard : So this is Dale. So it\u2019s going to be some service costs for sure, Rod. And then I think as we said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve done a lot of going through our cost structure, we had taking out costs, so we feel really good about - we\u2019ll see that in the back half of the year. We did a lot of that in the first quarter, some of that early April. And so that $30 million we talked about, we\u2019ll see - on an annualized basis, we\u2019ll see some of that throughout the next nine months or eight months of 2020. So it\u2019s really kind of holding the - seeing the revenue come in, in terms of the subscribers and then servicing costs and then taking that out of cost. And it\u2019s not only on the G&A and the service side, but we also took out overhead costs. And I think you saw that in the fact that our net subscriber cost was $960. Some of that is upfront, but we\u2019re also attacking expense overhead within the sales process. Todd Pedersen : Look, there is the reality. We have - we\u2019re now starting to get the benefit of all the investments we\u2019ve made in the technology stack, and we\u2019re getting operational efficiencies there. But even from a corporate side, because of the tools and technologies and our ability to deliver, and we\u2019re able to bring back some of those costs and get operational efficiencies from a corporate perspective also. So we\u2019re super pleased with all of this. And this is all - this process, and you all noticed, we started this before COVID hit, so this is just a continuation of what we\u2019re already focused on. Rod Hall : Great. All right, guys. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Todd Pedersen : You bet, Todd. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Michael Fisher : Hey, guys. This is Michael Fisher on for Amit. I wanted to get into - you mentioned the cash flow neutral target is tracking ahead of the initial 18 to 24 months. Can you talk about maybe any of the drivers or what\u2019s kind of shifted since you initially put that target out that\u2019s maybe enabling some upside? Todd Pedersen : Yeah. So there\u2019s - it\u2019s multiple fronts. Obviously, the net subscriber acquisition cost is something that we focused on. You\u2019ve seen a gain there. You\u2019re going to see continued improvement there. We\u2019ve - I think we show a reduction in RICs from last year to this year of about 50%. You\u2019re going to see that improve. In fact, it\u2019s going to be one of the biggest gains that you\u2019ll see from the company. So really important. We\u2019re trying to make sure that we\u2019re financing these product sales off-balance sheet. We - and again, mentioned that we\u2019re now not onboarding new customers from the direct-to-home side in Canada, which we - we have never found a partner to provide the consumer financing. So those subscribers were all again on-boarded on balance sheet. They were great subscribers, great credit scores, but there was a large amount of cash usage. We are still servicing the customer base up there, and they are our customers, but the exchange rate and the lack of consumer financing available there, we\u2019ve chosen to halt that. Now we are still onboarding customers that call in and/or are referred into the company, so we have full capability of installation and service up there. And then just a plan of production in expenses and cost and reducing some budgets and eliminating projects here and there. So we\u2019re just really fine-tuning the way we operate this business. We intend, just so everyone knows, to take some of those savings, cash savings, and start to focus on growing and building the brand, telling the story. We have an incredible story to tell. We have an incredible technology and service that we can deliver to consumers, which is in very high demand right now, especially in this period of time. And just the quality of product and the design and the delivery of the services has now come to a point where like, okay, it\u2019s time to really focus on growing this business as we take advantage of this large market that we\u2019re part of. Michael Fisher : Okay. And then just to dig a little bit on the permanent fixed cost savings of $30 million, is that mostly - again, is that service cost savings as well flowing through or the drivers there? And then the $20 million in restructuring expense, is that part of the initiative to generate the cost savings? Dale Gerard : Yeah. So we\u2019ll kind of break those down. The $20 million really relates around the changes in personnel and cost reductions that we did at the beginning of March. So we kind of - we\u2019d actually talked about on the fourth quarter call from 2019 and put out, and so that\u2019s really what is included in that restructuring charge there. It\u2019s - some of it\u2019s severance and most of - half of it or so is related to stock-based comp, which was - as we - those people left and their equity - kind of their treatment of their equity changed. And then the other cost, as Todd said, we really focused on cost, whether it\u2019s in servicing. And again, really focusing on overhead and making sure that we have the right infrastructure, the right cost structure and that we\u2019re spending money in the areas that really provide either servicing customers or they\u2019re providing growth. And so as we think about service, how do we think about our leadership, our structure there, level - kind of tiers, leaders in the field, people that are in the corporate, on the servicing side. And then on the G&A - and innovation, the same thing. It\u2019s like, hey, there\u2019s a lots of products and lots of different things we can go do, but let\u2019s focus in on what we really think the customers want that can drive that kind of next-gen of products. And so it\u2019s really across all areas of the company. It\u2019s not just one area. And we\u2019ve actually - I would say for 2020, we\u2019ve actually taken actions that are greater than the $30 million, but some of those will - that will come back most likely in 2021, such as - not - we\u2019ve discontinued any type of merit increases for \u201820. We\u2019ve actually stopped matching the 401(k). So we\u2019ve taken some actions. Again, we want to be ahead of it. We think that - and we\u2019ve done a lot of these in early April to make sure that we\u2019re in a good position to weather any kind of storm that comes at us here. But some of those will come back next year. But the $30 million is what we think of permanently is not coming back in the budgets and different things that we\u2019ve been doing. Todd Pedersen : And the $30 million, to be clear, is not part of the service cost reduction. It\u2019s separate. Dale Gerard : Yes. Scott Hardy : So you\u2019ll see some of it in the subscriber acquisition cost and a lot of it in the G&A. Michael Fisher : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Mally with Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Edward Mally : Hi, thank you. Just to go back to the attrition trends, away from where you are in the customer contract life cycle, have you seen over the last couple of months any changes in those trends with reduced relocations, for example, or changes in the drivers of attrition? That\u2019s my first question. And then second question, just to clarify on the revolver draw. You noted that it was fully drawn with $305 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of April. Does the $305 million represent the full revolver draw or was it a higher amount drawn on the revolver? Scott Hardy : Thanks, Edward. This is Scott. I\u2019ll tackle the attrition question and then turn it over to Dale to address the question about the revolver draw. On attrition, certainly given the economic impact of the COVID virus, this is something that we\u2019re paying very close attention to. We\u2019re monitoring consumer credit and unemployment trends and candidly feel fortunate that we have a majority of our customer base that consists of homeowners that have a credit score of over 700. So as Dale shared, our Q1 attrition was in line with expectations, slightly better than what we\u2019ve planned. It reflects really the value that we think consumers see in the services we\u2019re providing, particularly in times of uncertainty like this. Q1 was up over Q4 by about 20 basis points. That\u2019s a function of, as we\u2019ve shared in the past, cohort level attrition and then the percent of customers that are coming out of term. That percent has been going up. But overall, we\u2019re actually performing slightly better than we would have expected in Q1. Todd shared, and I think Dale did as well, we have a history of strength and resiliency during economic downturns. We saw that in 2008 and 2009, and through April and even the first week of May. And we\u2019re seeing indicators in terms of notices of cancellation in terms of number of customers that are going into our collection process that are tracking normal and in line with our expectations, which suggests an ongoing resiliency of the business model. We\u2019ve always had a forbearance program for customers that are in some form of financial distress, and that\u2019s where we will defer payment for a period of months and then extend their contract by a meaningful amount. We did see during the last six weeks, a modest and temporary increase in the number of customers that we are proactively calling in and asking for payment forbearance. That peaked really in late March and early April. But as of last week, the number of customers asking for forbearance was coming back into line with our historical run rates. And overall, during that period, it\u2019s well under 1% of our customer base that has done that. So we\u2019re feeling, at this point, that there\u2019s no real change to how we\u2019re seeing attrition for 2020. Dale Gerard : Thanks, Scott. And then in terms of the revolver. So the revolving credit facility, we get the - amended that in mid-February when we did some refinancing efforts. So the revolver has a total capacity of $350 million. Less LCs, there\u2019s about $334 million that\u2019s outstanding that we\u2019ve drawn. And we have $305 million in cash as of April 30. And thankfully, today, we\u2019re still sitting on about $305 million of cash. So we really brought that revolver down. I mean, I was around, when last time there was these kind of disruptions in the market, so we brought that down as really - in case there was some disruption in the financial markets. And we could - we\u2019re able - and we didn\u2019t need it to draw it. We weren\u2019t able to, so we - in the abundance of consciousness, we drew down on that revolver, again, as sitting in cash on our balance sheet. And like I said, we drew down - total revolver outstanding drawdowns is $334 million and we\u2019re sitting on $300 million in cash, which you\u2019ll see when the Q comes out that we used about $30 million in operating cash flow for the first quarter. Todd Pedersen : And again, I think this was asked earlier, but we have given projections of getting cash flow neutral in 18 to 24 months. We are incredibly focused on trying to accomplish cash flow neutrality this year. There are factors that still remain with can we roll out our entire program? Will it last? Do states get shut back down? But what I would say is, it\u2019s our primary factor. I think just through some of the numbers Dale\u2019s thrown out now, we\u2019re doing substantially better than last year and are pleased with where we\u2019re sitting right now, and I think we\u2019ll do a good job towards getting near that level this year. Edward Mally : Okay. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thanks very much. Todd Pedersen : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Shweta Khajuria : Great. Thank you. Going back to the resiliency of the business model. Could you please talk about potentially worst-case scenarios should the economy enter into a deeper recession worse than, let\u2019s say, 2008, 2009? The beauty of subscription model is that it provides great resiliency, and the average life of the subscriber here is pretty long. So could you please talk about how you think about the worst-case scenario and the resiliency of the business model? And then the second question is on the strength in overall e-commerce, so how - have you changed? And I\u2019m sorry if you covered this already, but have you changed the strategic sort of focus towards the strength in e-commerce and that as a channel, given that in the in-person sales channel is paused for now? Thank you. Todd Pedersen : Sure. Thanks for the questions. I\u2019m going to answer the first part of that. So knowing that unemployment rates are continuing to rise, we do understand that there\u2019s risk to some of our subscribers losing their jobs, not having the ability to pay as of yet. And I think we\u2019re kind of in the middle of it, but not at the end of it. We have not - if you\u2019re hearing our numbers here, we are not - we have not yet been affected by that. In fact, we\u2019ve seen slight improvements on all of the metrics in our business. And this is a product and service that provides safety and peace of mind. And with - and this is really important. With the differentiation, with the platform that we\u2019ve developed with camera technology and the software we have around our doorbell camera and packaged theft-detection deterrents, our outdoor cameras with the lurker alerts, just enhancing what we deliver, the demand is higher, whether it be someone who doesn\u2019t have anything at this point or that does have our services. And so it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re completely protected from a continued downside scenario from a macroeconomic perspective, but we\u2019re in a very good position compared to most companies and most industries. We\u2019re deemed an essential service from states for a reason. It\u2019s essential to customers. And really, depending on what their circumstances are with family or be it pets or children or elderly parents that need to be cared and provided for and watched over. So we were - in fact, we\u2019re very proud of the fact that we deliver such incredible services, especially nowadays. But from a company perspective, here\u2019s what I would say, we\u2019ve taken a lot of time and been very surgical about looking at additional potential downsides and continued economic downturn, how we manage the business, how we manage costs in the field and otherwise, how we spend, budgets, prioritization of projects that we have. There are things that we can pull back on more. There\u2019s obviously overhead that can be either reallocated or readjusted to adjust to the current economic environment. So I would say we - this management team has a very organized and detailed and structured plan in the event that the economic downturn worsens and starts to affect us. And that will either be through attrition or lack of demand from the consumers, which we\u2019re not seeing any - either of those at this point. It doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t or won\u2019t, but at this point we have not seen that. Again, Scott mentioned a slight increase in the deferment program - or deferral program, but that\u2019s back in line. It was slight and momentary. So we\u2019re - again, we\u2019re watching on a daily basis every important metric that there is that you can watch in that regard, so... Scott Hardy : Yeah, from an e-commerce perspective, Shweta, certainly our two primary go-to-market channels are direct-to-home and inside sales, and we are testing and constantly piloting other forms of channel distribution to get to market. E-commerce is one of those. I think, certainly, we\u2019ll see a continued trend accelerated by the COVID virus towards the e-commerce. And so that\u2019s an area we continue to test into, to evaluate. It\u2019s not really built into our forecast at this point, and so it\u2019s all upside for us as we\u2019re able to find the right bit and drive acquisition through those types of channels. Shweta Khajuria : Okay. Thank you, both. Todd Pedersen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kunal Madhukar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Kunal Madhukar : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A couple, if I may. One, with regard to the guide, especially on like subscriber gross adds. What are the assumptions that are going into the guide, especially in terms of how much do you think the direct-to-home can kind of get? How much do you think the national inside sales can kind of get? And how does that change - and especially in light of - we may be headed into a new normal, which we don\u2019t even know what it could look like. And so what happens if we have to be in a social distancing kind of an environment for the rest of the year? And then with regard to the financing on the upfront equipment, maybe you haven\u2019t seen it until now, maybe credit is still easy. What happens in an environment where credit becomes tougher? And do you think - how do you think that could potentially impact the subscriber growth for the rest of the year? Todd Pedersen : Yeah. So on the first part of the question - this is Todd. We don\u2019t break out the numbers to the specific channels, but this is what I would tell you. From an inside sales perspective, demand has been up over kind of our expected run rate in that channel. We - obviously, we mentioned we\u2019ve put on pause the direct-to-home program. Not all of the states - as you all know, not all of the states are open for any type of business, let alone someone going into neighborhoods and into homes. We\u2019ve made - well, what I can say is this. In the markets that we\u2019re in, in the states that are opened up, productivity per sales rep is up, which again speaks to the demand and the interest that people have in the services that we deliver - we do deliver. And from a social distancing perspective, we\u2019ve adjusted - from an engagement perspective, social distancing perspective. And then also tools perspective, we\u2019ve changed how we interact and engage with the consumer if needs be. In fact, some customers, we will not engage them directly. We will keep our social distance, and they will ask why won\u2019t we enter their home? But we are not entering homes unless people ask us to. And we obviously have done the physical checks on our sales force and our installation force every morning, making sure they have no signs of the virus, and then also asking the appropriate question to the family or home owner that we\u2019re entering into. But even with the change in environment and how we engage with consumers, which also includes the ability to do video - we\u2019ve all learned this. The ability to do a sales call over video, we have that capability, too, now like anyone else does in this situation. We\u2019ve adjusted, and the performance is very good. Now the question would be, and this is the - we pulled back on our gross subscriber adds because we did pause the direct-to-home program and there are states that still are not open yet. So that would be the difference in the number. But as far as productivity goes and engagement goes - and if this is the new norm, we\u2019re okay with that because we can accomplish what we need to accomplish with - just keep - continue to have social distancing and that type of thing. So we feel very confident in that regard. On the credit side, Dale is going to talk about that. Dale Gerard : Yeah. Just one more. So I think, again, we don\u2019t give out guidance in terms of by channel, but I think what you could take Todd\u2019s - what Todd\u2019s saying is on the direct-to-home, whatever you have in your model for the full year, assume that we don\u2019t have very much for April because that channel was paused. That was pause kind of mid-March. So you could kind of say from mid-March until right now we\u2019re just starting to ramp back up. And as Todd said, we\u2019re probably about 70% of where we would normally be at this point in terms of reps out on the doors. So if you can kind of think through that as you remodel that. In terms of financing, again, we stay in very, very close contact with our two consumer financing partners. We have a primary and a secondary financing partner. We\u2019ve not seen anything at this point. It\u2019s something - it\u2019s one of those metrics, I guess, as Todd said, we watch every day and every morning. Early in the morning I get the report and I look at those to see what was the - what declines were we seeing yesterday, what were the reasons for declines on financing, what approval rates were, all the different things by channel. And so again, we\u2019re in contact with these partners. They\u2019re very committed to the program. They still are open for business and looking to put on new business. And so we\u2019re watching this, but we think that we have really good partners to partner with us here. And our customers - as Todd said, a lot of these customers - the demand for the products there and customers, their FICO score and their financial situation is still allowing them to continue to purchase this and get finance more of the product. Todd Pedersen : And look, anyone that\u2019s in the financial world that\u2019s lending money, whether it be a corporation or an individual or consumer, they\u2019re going to lend into a space or an industry where they\u2019re going to get a consistent return. And if you look at our - the financials and the numbers and you think about the forbearance on our customers, as it stands right now, numbers are trending really well as expected or slightly better than that. And so we believe that as long as our customer base is paying their bill and the demand is there so they can onboard more financing under on to the platform, we\u2019re in good position. Again, like Dale said, we\u2019re in communication with Citizens constantly, and they\u2019ve been a great partner. And by the way, they partner up with some other really large-scale companies that also depend on that financing. So as it stands today, we feel great. Now if that changed and the - Citizens went away, we do have a secondary financing partner. There are others out there we are not engaged with physically. But from a conversation perspective, there are others we\u2019re having conversations with. If it all went away, and that may be the question you\u2019re asking, we would have - we\u2019d slow down growth. But as it stands today in this current - and cut back costs, and there are other measures that we would take as a business. But as it stands right now, we feel like we\u2019re in a good position, so... Kunal Madhukar : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Todd. Thanks, Dale. A quick follow-up on the ARPU, the service ARPU. That declined precipitously on a year-over-year basis versus the declines that we\u2019ve been seeing previously. What happened there? Dale Gerard : Yeah. Again, this goes back to how we\u2019ve talked about the pricing model and Flex Pay model, where ARPU - and a little bit - Todd talked about this a little bit in the fourth quarter call. We\u2019re actually looking - as we continue to drive cash - to cash flow neutral goal here, we\u2019re pushing - we\u2019re starting to leverage pricing upfront on some of the products and some of the sales at the point of sale. And what you\u2019re seeing, a little bit of that is that we\u2019re giving - our ARPU is coming down a little bit. Our service ARPU is coming in a little bit as the customers are paying more for the equipment and financing more. When you look at it out of pocket for a customer, it\u2019s still in that mid $70 a month range. $72 to $75 a month, the customer is paying. It\u2019s just that that bill now is split a little bit differently and a little bit more going to the finance partners, which, by the way, we get all that cash upfront. So the economics on that customer and the return on that capital is much better for us. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing, and you\u2019re seeing that kind of flow through. Todd Pedersen : So this is very, very important. You mentioned the word precipitous. It\u2019s actually - this is actually a good thing. We\u2019ve talked about our objective to get to cash flow neutrality. This is one of those levers. Our old model - and if you look at some of the other models in consumer finance - or consumer-facing businesses, our old model was, we got all $75, but we had to finance that entire SAC on our balance sheet. Now we\u2019re having the consumer finance more of the hardware upfront. We\u2019re getting that cash upfront. And it\u2019s one of the drivers that\u2019s getting us towards cash flow neutrality. So it\u2019s - we\u2019re very, very pleased with the results. And I think everyone on this phone call will feel the same when we kind of finish up the year and we see the results of that. And so there\u2019s no reduction in demand for services. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. There\u2019s an increasing demand for the hardware and services. We\u2019re just using finance as a lever to not have to go back to the debt work. So we\u2019re very pleased with this result. Kunal Madhukar : Thank you so much. Thanks, that\u2019s most helpful. Todd Pedersen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Morgan with Jefferies. Your line is open. Todd Morgan : Thanks and thanks for the question. I guess, I must say, I think you guys are doing a pretty amazing job here. If I\u2019m looking at this, you added 50,000 gross subscribers in the first quarter this year when there was clearly issues. That was a couple of thousand more than you had a year ago, and in before that. So that\u2019s pretty strong. It looks like, if I\u2019m doing some quick math, that you think for the full year that the gross adds might be maybe 50,000 or so less than they were in 2019. Is it - I mean, can I kind of simplistically extrapolate out and say the net subscriber acquisition costs, that\u2019s probably close to $100 million of cash outlays that you would potentially avoid? Is it fair to think of things in that way? And I think you did say you might roll some of that back into sort of brand enhancement. But I mean, that\u2019s a big difference in the cash uses, if I\u2019m thinking about that right. Is that fair? Dale Gerard : Yeah, I think the cash uses, I mean, if you looked at - we\u2019re still putting out about $1,000 on a sub. So if you say we\u2019re going to do less than 50,000 subs despite close to the $50 million of cash saving, $50 million to $60 million. But I think you\u2019re exactly right. That is a large cash savings if we\u2019re not able to do that. And then to the brand question, I think, Todd will give you what - whether we reinvest that money into brand. Todd Pedersen : Yes. So I mean, look, we are interested - we know that the services we deliver are very differentiated and special, and people that have them are raving fans. And it\u2019s getting better and better with technology advancements, and there are innovation centers developing enhancements in the software and the firmware and the deployment. We\u2019re just getting better at it. So we are laying out plans to begin to brand and market the business and services. Because frankly, a lot of people just don\u2019t even know who Vivint is, and we\u2019ve got 1.5 million subscribers. And so we intend to tell that story. Now we are not going to do that until we\u2019re confident that we have ex [ph] beyond - I\u2019d say, we\u2019re not going to do that until we\u2019re cash flow positive. We\u2019re not going to spend our debt to start a big marketing and demand-gen program. You\u2019re not going to see that. But we are feeling confident enough about the plans that we have laid out in the upcoming months. And we need to prep for that, think about that, think about how to tell the story, integrate that into our kind of ongoing financials and investment. So we hope to do it, intend to do it, but we will not do it until we have excess cash beyond neutrality. Todd Morgan : Okay. Great. And then just is there any change in the way you\u2019re sort of thinking about or processing sort of the second-look customers that you\u2019re signing up now? Are there more or less of those? Are you doing anything differently? Thanks. Dale Gerard : Yes, no. It\u2019s - we rolled out the - Fortiva as our second financing partner, rolled those out in April of 2019. That is still the same as it\u2019s always been. They\u2019re kind of taking a look at anything that doesn\u2019t kind of get financed by Citizens, and rightly closes down to them. So really no change in that process at all. Todd Morgan : Okay. Good luck. And thank you. Dale Gerard : Thanks, Todd. Todd Pedersen : Thanks for the question. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Todd Pedersen : We appreciate everyone getting on the call. I know some people had a bit of a difficult time getting on. Thanks for the patience with that. Again, management is incredibly pleased with Q1 performance. Although it\u2019s been a bit of a hectic last few months for us and other companies and individuals across the world, we felt like we\u2019ve responded quickly and decisively. And we look forward to a very good 2020 year. And you can expect us to deliver on the numbers. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nate Stubbs, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Nate Stubbs : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss the results of Vivint Smart Home for the three and six-month period ending June 30, 2020. Joining me on the conference call this afternoon are Todd Pedersen, Vivint Smart Home\u2019s, Chief Executive Officer and Dale R. Gerard, Vivint\u2019s CFO. I would like to begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including with regards to the company\u2019s future performance and prospects. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance. You should not put undue reliance on these statements. You should understand that the following important factors, in addition to those discussed in the Risk Factors section in our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019, and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q issued in fiscal year 2020, including for the quarter period ended June 30, 2020, which is expected to be filed on or about the date of this earnings call, as such, factors may be updated from time to time in company\u2019s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In today\u2019s remarks, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for historical periods to the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are available in the earnings release and accompanying presentation, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Pedersen : Thanks, Nate, and good afternoon to everyone joining the call. I hope everyone continues to be healthy and safe in the current environment. Today, we will cover three main topics. One, discuss our strong financial and operating results for the second quarter; two, review our success in optimizing our portfolio economics and the resilient performance of a recurring revenue platform; and three, talk about the strong demand for our services as homeowners have spent more time focused on reconnecting with their homes. We\u2019ve done a great job as an organization navigating the challenges and uncertainties encountered during the first half of 2020. And we are very pleased with the significant improvements across all our key metrics in Q2. Revenue and total subscribers continue to grow at a steady pace, reflecting healthy demand for our smart home and security solutions despite a pause in our direct-to-home sales efforts for the first six weeks of the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins continue to expand meaningfully and we now expect to be cash flow positive in 2020. Dale will dive into more specifics on the financial results in his remarks and he will also share updated thoughts on the full-year outlook, which we are revising upward given recent momentum in the business. Vivint now delivers smart home and security services to more than 1.6 million customers across North America. Our incredible results during what has been an extremely challenging time supports what we\u2019ve said all along. The customers value the peace of mind that our fully integrated services offer and that our high-margin recurring revenue model is built not only to be resilient, but also to thrive in the current environment. This is a time when people are reconnecting with their homes and we believe that Vivint is perfectly positioned for what could be a lasting change. In fact live video views through the Vivint app and panel increased by 19%, and the views of recorded video increased by 15% from Q1 to Q2. Although our customer value proposition is clear, our ability to add nearly 108,000 new smart home subscribers during the quarter is remarkable, given the fact that we paused all direct-to-home sales from mid-March to early May. We discontinued all direct-to-home sales activities in Canada and we mostly eliminated the number of new customers we generate from retail installment contracts. Despite these self-imposed limitations, new subscribers were off by just 3% from a year ago when no constraints are in place. Our national inside sales team, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t missed a beat and continue to see strong demand in the quarter, generating 25% year-over-year growth in new subscribers. We resumed direct-to-home sales in early May, as states around the country begin reopening their economies. Aside from the delayed start, our summer sales program is proceeding well and we\u2019re actually seeing productivity gains versus the prior year. Another powerful tailwind is that we\u2019re funding virtually all new customers through our paid-in-full or third-party financing with Vivint Flex Pay. This allows us to bring on new subscribers in a much more capital efficient way. Our external financing partners have remained committed to underwriting high volumes of high credit quality smart home customers. And we believe we have a significant edge versus our competitors by providing customers with options to easily finance a full smart home experience, while also dramatically improving our unit economics and cash flow dynamics. The nearly half point decrease in attrition this quarter is another standout result and frankly beat our internal plan by a significant margin. This speaks to the fact that our core value proposition proven over two decades of taking care of our customers and their families is as relevant as ever, as people are reconnecting with their homes in the current environment. Today we have well over 20 million connected devices on a proprietary cloud-based platform that enables customers to seamlessly manage and protect their homes. We believe we are uniquely qualified to help our customers deal with the current environment across the various smart home devices we support from door locks, outdoor and indoor cameras, thermostats, lighting controls, smart speakers, garage doors and many other connected devices. We recently announced a partnership with Chamberlain, the leading garage door manufacturer to integrate myQ Smart Garage technology into our platform. Vivint customers with a myQ Smart Garage can now control secure and monitor their garage anytime from anywhere using the Vivint Smart Home app. All these innovative products are designed to work together seamlessly through our elegant platform that homeowners can control from their in-home touchscreen hub through a single app on their phone or by simply using the voice. Our improved guidance for the full year underscores the confidence we have in our high-margin recurring revenue model. We are seeing healthy demand across all our sales channels for our smart home and security offerings and we are fully prepared to meet that demand. We continue to be judicious around overhead spend, budget and projects, and we now believe that we will be cash flow positive in 2020. To that point, we generated $111 million in cash from operating activities in the second quarter alone. We\u2019re excited to continue reporting our progress on this front. Before concluding my remarks, in light of recent events nationwide, I believe it\u2019s important to express how much we value diversity and inclusion at Vivint. The issues of racial inequity and injustice are significant and we must all take ownership of these issues. We can start by simply listening to each other, engage in productive conversations, re-examining our own views and actions, and ultimately being part of the positive change. I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through specifics of our strong second quarter results, as well as provide our updated guidance for 2020. Dale Gerard : Thanks, Todd. I\u2019ll walk through the financial slide portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our earnings release. Overall, results were very strong across the board and this outperformance informs our decision to raise our guidance range for the full year, which I\u2019ll cover later. But first on slide seven, we highlight our revenue for the second quarter six-month period ended June 30. For the second quarter 2020, revenue grew by 8.9% to $306 million. The growth in revenue is attributable to a 6.8% increase in total subscribers as well as a 2.1% increase in the average monthly revenue per user. Our average monthly revenue per user was up $1.31 in the quarter versus last year. Moving to slide eight. Adjusted EBITDA has scaled significantly in the second quarter and six-month periods. The drivers were lower selling expenses and net service costs and continued scaling of our G&A. For the quarter, we are proud to have expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 2000 basis points to 49.9% of revenue compared to 31.4% in the second quarter of 2019. This is clearly a great result overall and a function of a lot of hard work by our entire organization. Due to some seasonality inherent in our business, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily anticipate sustained full-year margins at that high level. It should be noted, for example, that the lower service costs we saw in the second quarter was due in part to fewer service calls and truck rolls due to concerns over COVID-19, while we do believe to be sustainable on a number of cost reduction initiatives that we completed during the first quarter and then are expected to meaningfully reduce G&A and overhead costs by streamlining our operations, focusing engineering and innovation, and driving better customer satisfaction. In addition to these actions and because analyzing how we operate more efficiently is a continuous exercise at Vivint, we initiated another round of focused cost-cutting during the second quarter to further reduce our discretionary spend. As a result of these actions, we have achieved greater than $30 million in permanent annualized fixed cost reductions. Meanwhile, covenant adjusted EBITDA, which is the calculation used for our debt covenants, was $200.5 million in the period, scaling by $45 million compared to $155.3 million in the second quarter 2019. As you look on slide nine, we highlight a few data points for the subscriber portfolio which were strong across the board. Total subscribers at quarter end grew from 1.51 million to 1.61 million year-over-year or 6.8%. Average Monthly Revenue per User, or AMRU, also increased to $64.66, up 2.1% year-over-year. AMRU has been growing from the recognition of deferred revenue and effective cost selling of new products, such as our newest generation of outdoor and doorbell cameras. On the next slide, slide 10, we highlight a few points on new subscribers. New subscriber originations were 107,980 for the second quarter, which was quite resilient considering that direct-to-home sales were paused in the U.S. for the early part of the quarter. We discontinued all direct-to-home sales in Canada during the quarter and we reduced a number of retail installment contracts or RICs by over 89%. One last point, by shifting a greater portion of our subscribers away from RICs and toward our third-party financing partners and pay-in-full, we are able to grow the point of sale revenue, thus reducing our net subscriber acquisition costs and significantly improving our cash flow dynamics. As we look to the future, we will continue to align the organization on delivering a true smart home experience to millions of homes in a profitable and cash efficient way. Moving to slide 11, we will cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber. The reduction across both these key metrics continue to be a significant driver of our earnings improvement during the second quarter of 2020. We\u2019ve continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber, moving from $16.71 in the second quarter of 2018 to $13.13 in the second quarter of 2019, and now to $9.93 in the most recent quarter, a $6.78 improvement versus 2018. This represents the lowest service cost per subscriber in the last ten years by a significant margin and it demonstrates the advantage of Vivint\u2019s fully integrated smart home cloud platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support. The result is that our net service margin continued its increasing trend moving from 68.6% in the second quarter of 2018 to 75.2% in the second quarter of 2019, and now 80.2% in the most recent quarter. These efforts contributed greatly to the improvement seen in our adjusted EBITDA. It\u2019s important to note here that given the seasonality of how we generally put on new customers, particularly in the summer, we tend to see service costs increase in the back half of the year. Additionally, as mentioned before, we believe service calls were abnormally low in the second quarter due to concerns over the coronavirus. So while we\u2019re really excited and encouraged by the current trends and the corresponding benefits to the margins that we are seeing, we wouldn\u2019t anticipate sustained full-year results at that level. On the right hand side of slide 11, we highlight the recent trend on our average net new subscriber acquisition cost. For the LTM period ended June 30, 2020, net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber decreased to $630. That\u2019s 40.8% lower compared to the prior LTM period, as we have nearly eliminated the number of new subscribers that are financed on a Vivint retail instalment contract and shifted to a higher mix of customers, utilizing our financing partners or paying in full for the purchase of their smart home products. During the quarter, we also benefited from pricing leverage on the point of sale purchase and installation of equipment. Moving on to slide 12. Slide 12 is a normal subscriber walk to illustrate the changes in total subscribers at quarter end. The biggest and most pleasant surprise was a reversal in attrition, which was lower sequentially for the first time in nine quarters. It is worth reiterating that our attrition has trended higher than our historical averages, given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end-of-term life cycle phase. First, the attrition rate for a customer cohort changes as it progresses through different phases of the life cycle. We define these phases as in-term, end-of-term and post initial term. Each phase carries with it a corresponding expected attrition rate, with attrition at its highest during the end-of-term phase. As we have shared in the past earnings calls, the cohort attrition curves remain fairly steady. The second factor that affects attrition is the percent of total customers in each stage of their life cycle. The percent of customers in the end-of-term phase rose in 2019 and will stay elevated in 2020 before beginning to fall in 2021. In the second quarter, attrition reversed course and was lower sequentially by 40 basis points to 13.7%. This still remains higher than our long-term trend for attrition, but was much better than our expectations given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end-of-term phase. And for what it\u2019s worth, our portfolio has continued to perform better than expectations in terms of attrition and other leading indicators through the end of July. Now we know there is a lot of curiosity out there regarding how we think our attrition curve may change as a result of the pandemic. The news on this front is all positive at least thus far. As to the potential drivers, our past experience through severe economic downturns, combined with the unique effects of the current pandemic and leading more people to reconnect with their homes and place tremendous value on our smart home solutions, as well as the general propensity for customers to focus inward and prioritize home security during times of crisis are some of the main factors that come to mind. Before we move to our updated outlook for the year, I\u2019ll point out that several factors tied to our strong second quarter performance leave us feeling very good about our overall liquidity position, which stood at approximately $478 million as of June 30. Our second quarter was strong from an operating cash flow perspective. For the three months ended June 30, we generated $111 million in net cash from operating activities compared to a use of $88 million for the same period in 2019. The strength in cash generation has carried through the end of July and we have repaid all of the outstanding amounts on our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we also saw approximately $6.6 million of warrants exercised, which has a positive impact on our cash position and it increased our public float as well. Finally, let\u2019s move to slide 13 where I will address our updated financial outlook for the year. Over 95% of our revenue is recurring, which provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. Most of our new subscribers that finance their smart home chooses to enter into a five-year contract and remain on the platform for approximately eight years, driving significant lifetime margin dollars. Despite the many uncertainties pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, our reoccurring revenue model has proven resilient to any of the major downsides and we are comfortable with essentially restoring our original guidance for subscribers and revenue that we provided in early March before the country went on lockdown. Meanwhile, our strong unit economics and scale have contributed to our ability to drive significant adjusted EBITDA improvement. And that is reflected in our updated range. In terms of revised guidance based on our stronger than expected second quarter performance, solid demand for our products and services and having the full complement of sales channels available to acquire new Vivint customers, we expect to end 2020 with 1.62 million to 1.68 million total subscribers versus previous guidance of 1.55 million to 1.62 million. Our estimate for 2020 revenue is $1.23 billion to $1.28 billion versus previous guidance of $1.20 billion to $1.25 billion. And finally, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $555 million and $565 million versus previous guidance between $525 million and $535 million. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Paul Coster : Wow, that was pretty awesome. Hard to kick this one apart, it was such a good news under the circumstances, really quite impressive. So Todd, you said you\u2019re going to be cash flow positive in 2020, so you are ahead of expectations. Is it sustainable? Or is the -- does this feel like just, for instance, the RIC number was also just so low. And I\u2019m just wondering, do you think all of this is sustainable? Todd Pedersen : Yes, we actually do believe it\u2019s sustainable. And as Dale mentioned, the reduction of RICs led to that number. And by the way, side note to the reduction of RICs, should -- we should see over time an improvement in attrition number on this pool of accounts that we put on this -- the underwriting on this year\u2019s book of business is outstanding. But yes, it is sustainable. We\u2019ve made some very good changes to the business and I think one that\u2019s listened to us. This is not -- this didn\u2019t just happen. We\u2019ve been working on the changes to the business models of the company, the cost structure for quite some time now and this just kind of a revelation of what we\u2019ve been intending to do. So, I think the answer is yes, it\u2019s sustainable. Paul Coster : Right. Got it. And then, of course, I mean, is it a competition or is it a validation where Google seems to be trying to help ADT catch up with you a bit, what does that mean to you? Todd Pedersen : Well, I think you hit it on the head. It\u2019s absolutely a validation of the model that Vivint delivers into the market, Smart Home as a Service. It absolutely requires great tech. But in the need for -- install ongoing service and providing the bulk of them is critically important to delivering really an elegant situation within. And so, yes, we\u2019re upbeat. When I read the news, honestly, -- that\u2019s great. We\u2019ve been saying all these all along. This is a huge TAM, is a huge opportunity and someone with the likes of Google investing into this space that you\u2019re in, you got to be -- that\u2019s got to be a good thing for us. Paul Coster : Okay, great, Thanks so much. Todd Pedersen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Likewise, nice job in a tough environment. Couple of questions for you. I wanted to start off with the new subscriber linearity and see if you could give us some idea of how that flowed through the quarter? And then secondly, just wondering if you could give us any idea as what attrition might look like as you look forward through the rest of the year. If you can give us any kind of idea for what you\u2019re thinking on attrition in the next couple of quarters that would be useful. Thank you. Dale Gerard : Yes, this is Dale. Hey, Rod. Thanks for joining. I think in terms of subscribers is tough. As we said, we had -- direct-to-home was really paused for the first six weeks of the quarter. So we really started rolling out direct-to-home to the different locations around the second week of May. And we saw a very quick ramp from those teams and continue to see really good production from those teams across all offices, across all states that we\u2019re in. And we\u2019re in most states that we wanted to be in. There is not like areas that we didn\u2019t go to. You roll teams out to where we expected to go out to. And they seem to be reporting well. And then when you look at inside sales, inside sales was really strong in the first quarter and that carried right into the second quarter. That\u2019s a more kind of ratable in terms of -- those are leads coming in from SEO and different referrals and so forth. And that volume and that demand has been very, very strong across the full -- for the full quarter. So we\u2019re seeing that demand continue into the third quarter here. And then, go ahead, Todd. Todd Pedersen : Well, the one thing I want to note and this is very important and again it\u2019s been mentioned already, but the fact that we\u2019ve put the numbers up that we have proven very substantial demand from consumers for the Vivint Smart Home offering. We are not on boarding new customers in Canada, which was a decent percentage of our overall business in the past, and then the elimination of RICs and also the pause on direct-to-home. When you look at it on the whole and you don\u2019t know the past, it looks good, considering, like you said, the environment. But when you really add it up together, the performance of Vivint in Q2 was outstanding. It\u2019s hard to describe how happy we are about how we\u2019re positioned, the consumer view on the product and services that we offer, the value we provide and really demand coming into the company. Dale Gerard : And then just to touch quickly on your question around attrition. I mean, attrition again, we were very, very happy with how the attrition performed in the second quarter. We again think that\u2019s how people are really reconnecting with their homes, really valuing the services that we offer. And we\u2019re seeing the engagement with the platform, even though people are at home, the engagement is as high or higher than what we\u2019ve seen in previous quarters, because people are using it. Just a different way, they\u2019re using the cameras more. They\u2019re engaging more throughout their home with that, with the system. For example, like having deliveries to your front door, being able to use your door-up camera to talk to those people, see what packages are dropped off. Those types of interactions with the system we\u2019re seeing more and more, now that people are actually kind of in their homes and wanting to understand who is coming through that front door or what\u2019s being left at that front door. But we\u2019re also cautious about attrition. In terms of -- we still have a higher percentage of customers in their kind of end-of-term life cycle. That\u2019s still about 20% of our portfolio. And we know those customers normally perform at or have higher attrition, when they\u2019re in that kind of phase of their life cycle. And then we\u2019re also cautious about the economy in the second half. And so what I would tell you from attrition is we think it\u2019s performing really, really well right now. But we\u2019re also cautious as to what it will look like in the -- for the rest of the year, but we're feeling rather confident that we're seeing good performance out of it and will continue through the rest of the year. Rod Hall : Okay, great. Well, thanks for that. And congrats again on the numbers. Thank you. Todd Pedersen : Thank you. Dale Gerard : Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : I guess a couple for me as well. Maybe to start off with on the net subscriber acquisition costs. That came in a lot lower than I think we were modeling at least. And it sounds like it really reflected the fact that you were able to raise pricing on the upfront cost. Was there any other factors that were at play as well that dropped this number down? And I'm just wondering, if you start to raise the pricing for these starter packs, do you think that impedes demand of your subscriber growth eventually? Todd Pedersen : Yes. So obviously, we did change the pricing in our starter kit package. And it was incredibly well received from the consumer. And from a consumer's point of view, the dollars they're paying between ourselves and our financing partner does -- had really didn't change. It changes the balance of it, but it doesn't change the actual dollars paid on a monthly basis. And then I would just say that our performance spoke for itself when it comes to demand. It was increased demand, elevated numbers better performance on a per rep average for the direct-to-home program. And again, Dale spoke to the inside sales group and their performance year-over-year. So absolutely did not affect demand from consumers. Dale Gerard : And then, it's been -- this is Dale. The other point of driving down kind of that net SAC is the fact that we reduced RICs of about -- almost 90% year-over-year. And that's not just a one-time kind of, hey, we did that in the second quarter. Our goal once we started rolling out Flex Pay and bringing on the finance partners was to bring RICs down to essentially zero. We'll have -- probably have some RICs as we go, but that's another big driver of the fact that we were able to take RICs down. And if you recall, RICs, just real quick is, as the -- as their contracts with Vivint is put in our balance sheet, we basically get no money upfront from those customers. So by being able to lower those substantially and move more of that upfront to our financing partners or to the customer actually paying in full for out of their own account, that's enabled us also to bring that net SAC down. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That's really helpful. And then if I could just follow up, when I look at the new subscriber numbers and I completely understand how difficult Q2 was, right, it was down 3% I think or something like that, the new subscriber growth number, I'm curious if you look at maybe the month of June or the six weeks where you were not in a complete shutdown, what did that trend line look like? And then any indication in terms of how that's looked in the month of July as well? Todd Pedersen : So, we probably won't get that granular. But again, when I'd try to reiterate this. When you look at the numbers on an apples-to-apples basis, if you compare to the customers we underwrote in 2019 to 2020, the fact that we're only down 3% net subscriber adds is outs -- when I say outstanding, it's beyond outstanding. We eliminated 12% of the customers we would have underwritten last year and did not this year and still attain that. And on a revenue basis, because of the increase in revenue per subscriber per month, we actually were ahead of last year. So I can't reiterate this enough that it was just a tremendous quarter. And I would say the trend continues. So we can't get too granular on what's happening currently and going forward. But we feel like we're in a very positive situation. It's due to a lot of factors, but really consumer demand increased -- Dale mentioned this, people are really reconnecting with their home and we're seeing the benefits of that. We're one of those companies that really is having a positive effect from the fact that people are home, are looking at their home as their new environment and that we think that might be a lasting change over time. Amit Daryanani : Got it. Last one from me and I'll leave after this. Given the better free cash flow expectations for the year, do we think about the company wanting to delever more quickly? Or how do you think about capital usage, given the fact this free cash flow positivity is getting pulled in a fair amount? That would be great. And congrats on a good quarter, guys. Dale Gerard : Yes. Thanks. I think in terms of how we think about the cash flow, I mean, we continue -- we've said all along we wanted to kind of get to cash flow neutral this year. We're way ahead of our original projections of 12 to 18 months. And then we've also laid out a goal to be three times or less on a leverage ratio, on an EBITDA-to-debt ratio. So I think we'll look at that the cash that we have continued to generate and we'll look at how we want to use that cash, whether that's to pay down debt or to make other investments into the company, whether that's new products, new services. We don't -- Todd has talked about this quarter, we don't really have a brand out there. And so do we want to actually go spend some money on branding the company, which we think would even drive more customers to the growth overall for a long-term vision, so we'll decide how we go. But we're very, very excited about the fact we're able to kind of get this cash flow positive in the second quarter and we believe that will continue throughout the rest of the year. Yes. The last thing, I just recalled, and I said this on the -- as part of my remarks, we get paid down the revolver. We had $105 million outstanding on revolver at end of June and we did pay that down in July. And so we were able to kind of pay that revolver fully back and we're setting cash on the balance sheet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Jeff Kessler : Thank you. And hello, gentlemen. Todd Pedersen : How are you doing? Dale Gerard : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Kessler : I'm doing good, doing good. And I am connecting with my home. One of the -- I'm wondering if the time that -- the downtime for your direct-to-home group, both the temporary period in the U.S. and the still ongoing period, I guess, in Canada, have you spent any of that time you want to call tinkering or fine-tuning what you want to add to that group and how that group actually goes to market and how they sell? Todd Pedersen : That's actually interesting that you would ask. But we actually did and we actually had some -- I'm not going to dig in, because I would say they're more experiments at how they engage and can engage with different types of inbound demand from consumers. But we did. We had to do it kind of overnight as all companies did when the shutdown happened. But we had positive results and I would say it's informing us a bit to how we might think about expanding our sales force, workforce engagement with consumers over time. And, as Dale mentioned, we hope to, at some point, maybe even this year start to build the brand and increase the inbound demand and really knowledge of Vivint's services. I mean, the reality is on an unaided awareness basis, less than 5% of American households even know who we are and what we do. And so, and as part of that test, we think there are some really tremendous opportunities to utilize that group, if additional demand does come in and be really efficient with those needs or increase around of Vivint's services. So yes. Jeff Kessler : Has there been an app or a set of apps, and I know it's probably going to end up in video, but is there -- have you been able to get better sales per -- particularly on the initial package by doing anything with -- by stressing or changing the stress of different apps as the year has gone on? Because this has been a different year effectively in terms -- than we've seen in a long time. Is it -- are there types of video applications or the types of video that have really allowed you to sell a little bit better than you had before? And is it just video, because there could be some other things, there could be another partner is kind of silent helpers in there that would have helped you? Todd Pedersen : Yes. So, here is what I would say, definitely video is a major driver in increased demand for what we do. And there is no one that does it like we do it. I mean, with the professional install, our own proprietary hub, platform, technology stack, kind of the feedback loop, ability to service ongoing with the customer, there isn't anyone anywhere in the realm of the quality of service delivery that we have, connectivity and otherwise. But we did -- we have seen an increased demand in just the general peace of mind of what we provide. And that's viewed or I guess kind of displays itself in the engagement from our consumers with their app. This isn't us emailing them things that we've seen or we know or data that we're showing. This is actual engagement, user engagement in live video views, recorded video views, arm/disarm of the system and the different functionality inside of the system. So I would say there are no other outside apps that are helping push. I think this is becoming very kind of obvious to us and we believe this for a while that this is a huge market segment. We think that 80-plus percent penetration in the U.S. households is very attainable. We're not going to state, well, how many years we think that is, it would be a guess. But the demand is gaining momentum and people's interest in having the smart home that's provided by a premium service provider like Vivint is very much in demand and will be a large market. Jeff Kessler : Okay. And finally, with regard to the market itself, it does seem as if young people moving out of the city or moving out of urban areas into the suburbs, getting into homes and larger homes are beginning to realize that DIY does not necessarily suffice particularly if they need monitoring for a larger home with whatever it is, from 15 to 40 zones. Are you finding that there is an attitudinal change as you talk about people getting more in touch with their homes? There is also on movement of people, what I would call it a de-urbanization, a little bit because of this? Todd Pedersen : Well, I think that's an interesting observation. Here is a couple of notes. One, we provide a DIY-able product and service currently. We are not talking about the numbers on that, but we actually do. The amazing thing for our customers or potential customers is that we can also back that up with truck rolls, answering the phone, technical service capabilities on the back end. So we can kind of end-to-end. However, someone wants to take delivery of our services, we can provide that and for very, very good value with the highest quality of products and services, and reliability for that matter. But it's interesting because DIY is brought up quite consistently to us in this space. And yet, you see Google who has DIY-able products that they've had for quite some time is now realizing that in order to really address the big market that Vivint is addressing, they need to combine up with a company that has the capabilities to go inside of people's homes and deliver service on an ongoing basis in a professional way. That's to say if they want to compete with us really on a grand scale. And then last thing is I'd say about DIY, that's an interesting thing even to my personal life. Through COVID, I didn't even -- I had never used some of the delivery -- food delivery services in the past. Now, that's all we do. So, I don't even go get my own food anymore. It's delivered to me. And so it's -- and I don't mow my lawn, I don't wash my car. No, I don't want to sound lazy. But I have other things done for me and I just don't think that consumers who want a really deep experience with a smart home want to be the CIO or technician of their home to manage 15, 20, 30, 40 devices, which is absolutely happening. People are adding more and more cameras and thermostats and door locks. And the connectivity is going deeper and deeper into the home. And so we couldn't be happier about the position that we're in and the fact that we are a market leader. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Well, I'm sorry, but one quick final question from me. And that is because you brought up an interesting point here, which I deal with all of this -- with all my coverage here. And that is you've talked about service a lot and you talked about the cost of servicing customers. As you become more complex and you have become more complex, how are you -- what are you doing to make sure that your service levels keep up with the complexity that is demanded of you so that at the other end, it's still an easy integration in their minds to how to use the system and have the -- let's just say, have the tech explain to them in easy-to-use fashion? What they can do, what they can't do when you're going from five devices out up to 30 devices? Todd Pedersen : This is really important and this is where Vivint really shines. This -- the fact that we own our operating system, that we in-house develop that, our hub, our platform and again, we do integrate. Everyone on the platform knows that we will integrate best-in-class products into our platform. But we take it upon ourselves to make sure that we control that process and that data flow and the connectivity, because the -- if you're installing a doorbell camera, for instance, that's not too difficult to install and not too much to manage. But you start adding more like -- as you mentioned, more and more devices, connectivity becomes more and more of an issue. The demand on your WiFi gets greater and greater. And allows the unfortunate potential for things to go wrong. Now, with our feedback loop and the fact that our engineering team, software, firmware, hardware design, installation platform, service platform, network, you have this incredible feedback loop that's very immediate by the way. I mean, we obviously tracked and there is 1.5 billion pieces of data daily coming through our AI system. We are watching every last thing that's happening when it comes to service delivered to consumer. Because that -- at the end of the day, if it's not great, service levels aren't great, attrition is going to go through the roof. And you could theorize that going from $16, which we had per sub per month in service cost to $9.93 over two-year period, our service levels would go down substantially and therefore attrition would go up, the reverse has happened. We've done both, reduced our service cost per sub per month, not a little bit, substantially. And then also our service levels are not just maintained well, they're better and they're more enhanced. And that speaks through our attrition numbers that you're seeing, which, by the way, are better than we had hoped for. And we've done this business for a very, very long time and the great thing is it's a very predictable model. But this just -- it just so happens that as we continue to release new hubs, new firmware, new software releases, new installation protocols that we just get better and better and better at that delivery of service and connectivity and quality of service. And it reduces truck rolls and the need to keep up with service demands. If things work, you don't have to answer phones, you don't have to roll trucks. And it just so happens that we are best in class by quite a margin when it comes to those sorts of things. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Well, thanks, Todd, and thanks, Dale, and thanks, Nate. I appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with RBC. Your line is open. Shweta Khajuria : Okay. Thank you. Let me try two please. When we think about service costs, you said that you expect cost to increase in the back half because of dramatic reduction in the quarter from your calls due to COVID. Could you talk about the sustainability of those costs, and not only in the back half, but just generally as we think for the outer years? And then a similar question on EBITDA margins. How should we think about the potential for margin expansion going forward? The margins are already at pretty elevated levels. Even barring this quarter, your guide implies very healthy EBITDA margin. So help us think about the potential for expansion going forward? Thank you. Dale Gerard : Yes, thanks. I think if you think about servicing costs, I think if you looked at the mid to high 70% margins is kind of where we think. I don't want to really quote a quarter dollar, I'd give you a service margin based on what we think. But we think in that 75-ish percent range is probably where we'll see kind of servicing costs come back in the second half of the year. And the reason why it's a little bit more, as you know, we put on a lot of our customers in a 90-day period. And there is always follow-up and service needs. So there are more service calls in that third quarter and just going into the fourth quarter just related to those new installs. And then again in the second quarter, I think we had a lot of times where we had where the calls into call center and into truck rolls were just decreased related around COVID. People not wanting people to come to their homes or -- and I think it goes back also to Todd's point is we have this fully integrated system that we can help, like we can solve a lot of problems over the phone. So when somebody does call in, we can actually log in to help, log remotely into their panel, resolve a lot of the issues, without having to send a truck or sending someone out to their home, which is really important. Shweta Khajuria : Okay. And then on the margins, please? Dale Gerard : Yes, on the margins, I think again, we thought we'd be in that, call it, low to mid 40% EBITDA margins. And I think that's again, when you look at the rest of this year, if you looked at on a full-year basis, I think that's kind of where we are. We're continuing and I think Todd said this and I've said this is we're always looking at ways to optimize in the business and optimize the scale what we have. And so we'll continue to look at that. When you look at it quarter over quarter or for the full year, we're probably looking in that low to mid 40% range. Shweta Khajuria : Okay. Thank you very much. Dale Gerard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kunal Madhukar with DB. Your line is open. Kunal Madhukar : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Great quarter. I had a couple. One, on the service cost side, wanted to understand how it is broken down between truck rolls, the people that are manning the -- or doing the monitoring part, and then the customer service side? And then on the attrition, wanted to get a sense of how much of the attrition is from moves versus not being built and what have you versus any other reason or switching to competitors? Todd Pedersen : Yes. So, we actually don't break the numbers out on the service cost per sub per month down to the actual -- the action that's happening inside of that structure. We just haven't done that and that probably wouldn't be detail that we would dig into. And then so we are just really hopefully and you are also incredibly happy with the results. But we probably gained some efficiencies across the board in all of those actions. And again, back to Vivint's owning of our operating system and technology, and hub development, software firmware releases, these all a result of not just what's happening today in the current environment. This is -- these are investments that we've made into our technology, service delivery, installation protocols over the years. And then there is how we answer phones and training down to the individual person. So there is a lot of things that go into the reduction of our service costs. And then when it comes to the attrition numbers with moves, we also don't want to break that out. I hate giving you that answer on both of those, but we just don't break those out in detail. Kunal Madhukar : That's cool. A follow-up if I may. How do you think with -- and maybe this is -- maybe this might be just the thing about the landscape, but how do you think Google's partnership with ADT kind of changes, how alarm.com become -- which is the operating system for a number of your competitors, how does that change alarm.com and how they operate especially with like Google coming in with its tech stack and everything else? Todd Pedersen : What I would say is I'm not sure with the arrangement is and so you would really need to ask them about this, but getting back to Vivint, the fact that we own our platform, we developed it. And look, we've spent tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars on that alone and do annually on the maintenance and the improvement of that user experience. And the fact that it's fully integrated to our hub in our platform, I'm glad that we're Vivint and we own what we own, which is everything end-to-end and we don't depend on other hardware developers and providers, other platform or app or operating system providers. I'm very -- we've -- and look, our investors Blackstone and others have been very gracious over the years in allowing us to make sure that we own and control that entire technology stack, and it's proving to be very relevant -- and not just relevant, it's critical that we do have that and own that. Kunal Madhukar : Great. Thank you. Todd Pedersen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Morgan with Jefferies. Your line is open. Todd Morgan : Thank you. Great results. Two things. Number one is a couple of companies have talked about supply chain issues in sourcing materials from overseas. And I know you guys typically would stock up early in the year. I don't know if given the very high subscriber adds that you're getting any kind of shortage or any difficulties in that front. And I guess, secondly, is if I look at the net subscriber acquisition costs $630, really great number. I mean, that's down by a third just even sequentially. If I think about the drivers that you called out, Dale, with the higher -- slightly higher package prices and really reduction in the RIC subscribers. Should that not continue to sort of ratchet down pretty rapidly here as you get into the third quarter, which is another big subscriber add quarter? Thanks. Dale Gerard : Yes. Thanks. So two things. We'll start with the supply chain. You're right. We -- based upon the way we do our business and preparing for what I would call the second, third quarter where we put on most of our accounts, we do, do a lot of pre-buy and make sure we have inventory in place based on what we think we're going to do or install for that period. And so we've not really seen any, any disruption in terms of our supply chain. We have a really good Chief Procurement Officer and we're constantly working with all of our vendors in making sure our manufacture -- contract manufacturers make sure that we have product available to our technicians and to our sales reps, so we can install those when we need that. In the terms of the net subscriber acquisition costs, you are right. Based upon where -- what we said we were going to do in terms of how we structure our current pricing model, the fact that we've reduced RICs and we continue to see that reduction go forward, you should continue to see that's -- where it's $630, if you kind of run the math out, you would expect that to continue to come down as we roll in as we report probably third quarter and so forth. Todd Morgan : Great, thank you. Dale Gerard : Thanks. See you, Todd. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Todd Pedersen : Yes. So, we appreciate everyone getting on the phone call for our Q2 numbers. We were happy with the results. We hope all of you were also. And just know that management is very focused on the current economic environment, making sure that we're being cautious about any upcoming economic -- continued downturns impact or individual subscribers, customers or underwriting in their cost structure and investments. So we're -- we look forward to getting on the phone with you all again in Q3. So thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nate Stubbs, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Nate Stubbs : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss the results of Vivint Smart Home for the 3- and 9-month periods ended September 30, 2020. Joining me on the conference call this afternoon are Todd Pedersen, Vivint's CEO; and Dale Gerard, Vivint's CFO.  I would like to begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including with regards to the company's future performance and prospects. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, are not guarantees of performance, and you should not put undue reliance on these statements. I would direct your attention to the risk factors detailed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q issued in fiscal year 2020, including for our most recent quarterly period ended September 30, 2020, which we expect to file on or about the date of this earnings call.  Please be aware that these risk factors may be updated from time to time in the company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that the realization of any such risk factors could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  In today's remarks, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for historical periods to the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are available in the earnings release and accompanying presentation, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vivint.com. I will now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Pedersen : Thanks, Nate, and welcome to everyone joining the call this afternoon. We are pleased to report another quarter of very strong performance. Our results underscore the importance of having a proprietary, fully-integrated AI-driven smart home platform, which is the backbone of our predictable and consistent recurring revenue model.  Touching briefly on a few financial highlights for the quarter. Total revenue and total subscribers grew by nearly 10%, reflecting healthy consumer demand for smart home and security services, along with our ability to retain a higher percentage of our customer portfolio. Our adjusted EBITDA margins continue to build upon previous quarters and expanded to new highs. Finally, we have stated our desire to operate the business in a more cash efficient way, and we are tracking to be cash flow positive by more than $100 million in 2020.  As we continue our focus on optimizing the business, we saw solid improvement across the board in many of our key performance metrics for the quarter. Notably, the last 12-month attrition rate improved by nearly a full point in the quarter and continues to exceed our forecasts. Our LTM attrition rate for Q3 was the lowest in the past 7 quarters, and I believe it speaks to the fact that our core value proposition, proven over 2 decades of reliably taking care of our customers and their families, is as relevant today as ever.  Vivint's fully-integrated and proprietary platform provides smart security and peace of mind to nearly 1.7 million customers across North America. Our customers interact with our systems on average 12 times every day, which provides our AI-based platform with over 1.5 billion pieces of data daily. This creates a real-time feedback loop, which enables us to proactively react to any issues happening in their homes. In many cases, we can identify an issue and are already working on a solution before the customer recognizes that something might be amiss. By controlling the entire customer experience from the design of the software and hardware to the sales, installation and service throughout the life of the customer, we're able to provide a robust, reliable and elegant solution to our customers. We believe that homeowners recognize the value of having increasingly complex systems professionally installed and serviced. In this do-it-for-me age we're living in, we believe we have been the leader in revolutionizing the smart home industry by delivering what consumers demand : a fully-integrated smart home and security solution that is professionally installed and seamlessly managed. We believe this consumer demand is proven and our impressive growth. We added nearly 127,000 new subscribers during the quarter, up 14% from a year ago and driven by positive contributions from each of our major sales channels. In today's environment of uncertainty, homeowners are spending more time thinking about and investing in their homes, which we believe is a very positive sign for Vivint. Our national inside sales channel continued its standout performance, generating 32% year-over-year growth in new subscribers. Meanwhile, our direct-to-home sales channel rebounded nicely from the COVID-related constraints earlier in the year, growing new subscriber adds by 5% versus the prior year period.  With coverage over 98% of ZIP codes in the United States, we believe that Vivint's premier model is in the best position to deliver a full smart home and security solution to virtually every household in the U.S. Consumers continue to expect increasingly complex smart home solutions that include integrated door locks, exterior cameras, interior cameras, lighting controls and thermostats that are professionally installed, monitored and serviced, but we're just getting started. Even though we have nearly 1.7 million subscribers, our unaided consumer awareness is in the low single digits. The fact that we have been a leader in the rapidly-developing smart home market while relying mostly on grassroots efforts by our sales teams makes us believe there's a tremendous upside if we can increase consumer awareness on a national scale. As we look forward to 2021 and beyond, our focus will be on our key objective of building the Vivint brand and investing in new products, services and technologies. We want to do a better job of telling consumers who we are, what we do and how we can enhance our lives by delivering the convenience, security and peace of mind they desire.  In addition, we will look to continue our leadership and differentiation in the smart home industry by increasing our investment in technology and new product development to ensure that we are on the leading edge when it comes to delivering the products and services consumers want. We believe Vivint is the clear leader in the Smart home and security solutions market. We are nationwide a fully-integrated smart home and security provider, and we have an opportunity to expand our business and accelerate growth by investing in our brand and technology and helping people understand the incredible value that Vivint brings.  I believe the company is ready to take the next step, and we're ready to handle the inevitable growth that will come with it. We have the technology and services that we believe consumers would absolutely want if they just knew about them. So we're excited about getting the message out, and we're excited about the possibilities and opportunities that exist for Vivint. I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through the specifics of our strong third quarter results as well as provide our updated guidance for 2020. Dale Gerard : Thanks, Todd. I will walk through the financial slide portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our third quarter earnings release. As Todd mentioned during his remarks, our results for the third quarter were very strong across the board.  First, on Slide 6, we highlight a couple of the key data points related to our subscriber portfolio. Total subscribers at quarter end grew from 1.56 million to 1.69 million year-over-year or 8.2%. Total monthly revenue increased by $6.3 million -- or 6.3% with an average monthly revenue per user or AMRU of $63.79.  On Slide 7, we highlight our revenue for the 3- and 9-month periods ended September 30. For the third quarter 2020, revenue was $319 million, up approximately 10% year-over-year. The growth in revenue was primarily attributable to an 8.2% increase in total subscribers. I would note that the third quarter 2019 revenue includes a $9.1 million reduction to revenue, resulting from a change in estimate related to RIC revenues recorded in prior periods.  Moving to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA increased significantly in the third quarter and year-to-date periods. The key drivers were continued scaling of our cost to service our subscriber portfolio, the expense portion of subscriber acquisition costs related to the origination of new subscribers and general and administrative expenses. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 53% to $154.5 million in the quarter while expanding our adjusted EBITDA margins by nearly 1,400 basis points to 48.4% of revenue compared to 34.6% in the prior year period. This is clearly a great result, and it's a function of a lot of hard work by our entire organization.  Although not shown on this slide, covenant adjusted EBITDA, which is the calculation used for our debt covenants, was $212.3 million in the quarter, an increase of $42.9 million or 25.3% compared to $169.4 million in the prior year period.  On Slide 9, we highlight some of our new subscriber metrics. New subscriber originations were 126,847 for the third quarter, which reflects outstanding results from our national inside sales channel and a nice rebound from our direct-to-home sales channel following some of the COVID-19-related restrictions earlier this year as the pandemic started to take hold across the U.S. Overall, new subscribers grew by 13.8% in the quarter versus the prior year period. We continue our focus to improve the cash flow dynamics of the business as evidenced by the 89% reduction in RICs during the quarter. While this has had some impact on these subscribers, by shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards our financing partners and paying full arrangements, we are able to increase the amount of cash collected at the point of installation, thus reducing our net subscriber acquisition cost and significantly improving our cash flow dynamics.  Moving on to Slide 10. We will cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the quarter. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber, moving from $16.38 in the third quarter of 2018 to $14.43 in the third quarter of 2019 and now down to $9.82 in the most recent quarter, a $6.56 improvement versus 2018. This continues our record-setting trend of achieving new lows in service cost per subscriber, and it demonstrates the advantage of Vivint's fully-integrated smart home and security platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support.  The result is that our net service margin continued its positive upward trend, moving from 68.7% in the third quarter of 2018 to 72.4% in the third quarter of 2019 and now to 80.1% in the most recent quarter. These efforts contributed significantly to the improvement seen in our adjusted EBITDA during the quarter.  It's important to note that given the seasonality how we generally put on new customers, particularly in the summer. We tend to see service costs increase in the latter part of the year. Additionally, as mentioned before, we believe service calls have remained abnormally low in the third quarter due to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. So while we're really encouraged by the current trends and the corresponding benefits to our margins, we wouldn't anticipate sustained full year results at the 80% level.  On the right-hand side of the slide, our net subscriber acquisition costs for the last 12-month period ended September 30 were $209 versus $1,033 in the prior year period. The decrease represented nearly an 80% reduction as we have nearly eliminated the number of new subscribers that are financed via RICs by shifting to a higher mix of customers utilizing our financing partners or paying in full for the purchase of their smart home products. The year-over-year comparison also benefited from pricing leverage at the point-of-sale purchase of products and installation. Moving on to Slide 11. We show our typical subscriber walk that illustrates the changes in total subscribers at quarter end and our attrition rate trend. One of the biggest highlights for the company continues to be the reversal in our attrition rate, which was lower sequentially by 90 basis points and fell to the lowest rate in the past 7 quarters. The third quarter measurement period benefited from a 2% sequential drop in customers that were in the end of their initial term life cycle phase. While the end of initial term mechanics helped, our portfolio has continued to perform better than expected in terms of the number of subscribers canceling and other leading portfolio indicators through October. We believe that the pandemic, social unrest and improved product performance as evidenced by our lower net service cost per subscriber are having a positive impact on our overall attrition rate.  Before we move to our updated outlook, I'll point out that several factors tied to our strong third quarter performance, leave us feeling very good, including our overall liquidity position, which stood at approximately $630 million as of September 30. Our third quarter operating cash flow was strong. For the 3-month period ended September 30, we generated $142.5 million in net cash from operating activities compared to $8.2 million for the same period in 2019. During the quarter, there were approximately 1.7 million warrants exercise, which added approximately $19 million to our September 30 cash position. Finally, let's move to Slide 12, while I will address our updated financial outlook. We believe that the fundamental characteristics of Vivint's high-margin reoccurring revenue model are compelling. More than 95% of our revenue is recurring, which provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. Many of our new subscribers initially sign up for 5-year contracts and remain on the Vivint platform for approximately 8 years, producing significant lifetime margins. Despite the many uncertainties pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, our reoccurring revenue model has proven resilient, and we remain comfortable with our previous revenue guidance. Our better-than-expected attrition rate performance and an improving unit economics have prompted us to update our guidance for total subscribers and adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our guidance for total subscribers to between 1.66 million and 1.70 million versus previous guidance of between 1.62 million and 1.68 million. We are reaffirming our guidance for total revenue of between $1.23 billion and $1.28 billion. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $570 million and $580 million versus previous guidance of between $555 million and $565 million.  Thanks to everyone for joining the call. Operator, you may open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster : I've got three quick ones. First of all, Dale, can you talk to us about the debt refinancing plans? Dale Gerard : Yes, Paul, thanks for joining the call. I think we're actually monitoring the markets to capital markets, and we wanted to get the quarter results now. We think they're strong. We think they're helpful in terms of whatever we decide to do. But we're actually monitoring, and when we're ready, we'll come out to the markets. Paul Coster : Okay. Got you. The service costs are going up in the fourth quarter, although I think you said that they might go up in the third quarter, and they didn't. So obviously, you got a good handle on things. But I also noticed that the average monthly revenue declined. Can you just talk us through that dynamic a little bit? Dale Gerard : Yes. So again, Paul, I think -- and we talked about this a couple of -- over the last couple of calls. We purposely are bringing it down kind of the average subscription monthly, right, because we're charging more upfront. When you look at the overall out-of-pocket to our customer, it's actually increased year-over-year in terms of the total dollars related to the amount they pay for the financing piece, which goes to the financing partner into what they're paying us. And so what we've done is shifted a little bit of what they were paying us in terms of that subscription amount each month to pay the financing partner. But we're able to actually bring more cash in upfront, which is why we're producing the level of cash we are in terms of cash from operations. So that's really the driver behind that. Todd Pedersen : And to add to that, this is Todd, Paul, the $209 subscriber acquisition costs is a direct result of that. So this -- we couldn't be happier about that. But it does -- if you don't understand it, we appreciate the question, but it does look like revenue per subs is coming down, but it's actually not. We're selling more hardware than we've ever sold at a high-margin upfront. And so the business is working very, very well. Dale Gerard : And then we're booked on the service cost fall. Again, we're cautious. We think that there's still calls in terms of truck rolls, and calls coming our call centers are still down somewhat compared to what we think would be a normal trend. And so we do expect, at some point those, calls will come back. But we think there's a big part of this, is where our new hardware, our software is performing better, and thus, that's also a big driver in terms of this. But we're very excited about where that service cost is on a subscriber basis and working very hard to keep it low as possible but -- and still maintain a very, very high-quality customer experience. Paul Coster : Got you. And Todd, it sounds like you feel like you could be doing so much better if there was better unassisted brand awareness out there. And it also sounds like you've got these new products and services in the pipeline. I think, most recently, the insurance product is the one that you're talking about. Is that still the sort of first in line? And should we expect some big splashy event to get the brand out there? Or is it more subtle than that? Todd Pedersen : So speaking to the branding, and again, I had said pretty clearly that until we were positive that we were going to be cash flow positive as a company, on a levered basis, which now we're kind of -- we've kind of put it out there, we're promising $100 million of positive cash flow on a levered basis, which we're very, very excited about, and we know the markets are, too. But we are -- and by the way, that includes money we are going to spend in Q4 on a launch -- a marketing launch.  Now we -- if you know anything about our company, we don't -- we like to test -- spend and test and test and analyze. And so we're going to be very, I guess, strategic and clinical about how we spend dollars on the marketing front, what to say, how to spend results that we can get from that. So we are launching in Q4 a branding and marketing effort nationwide. We've been working on it for quite some time, and we've known for a while that we're going to be cash flow positive for the year. So that -- we believe that's going to give us some great tailwind.  Now as anyone has seen a branding marketing campaign for a national brand goes, it takes time. This is something you've got to be committed to for years, not months. And -- but again, we've got to be very surgical and strategic about how we spend, where we spend and what we say, how we present the products and services that we have to the consumers, but we are launching that. I think in the coming weeks, you'll see something happen, hopefully. And then the next question was what, Paul, again? Dale Gerard : That was it. Todd Pedersen : No, no, there's something else. Paul Coster : The new products' insurance. How many insurance for the first in line? Or is there anything else coming on? Todd Pedersen : So we are -- so we are still very pleased with the way insurance is going. Again, we're not announcing numbers yet. We're being very patient about how quickly we launched that product, how we partner, how we position ourselves to our consumers. But I can say this, we believe we've got an incredible advantage because of the view we have into the data that is delivered through our smart home platform that is proprietary to pivot.  And I say this with everything. This is going to be a huge advantage for our customers because they have a Vivint product and they believe in our services, not just smart home technologies, but services that we have and are going to be delivering. They're going to be the recipients of the benefit of that. So we're really excited.  And again, maybe at some point next year, we start talking about the numbers and the relevance to the future of the business, but committed to it and continue to test and expand that product and service. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : Congrats on the quarter. It's really nice to see. I guess I just wanted to touch on the attrition rate. Obviously, you guys -- it's coming down. Just would love to hear your puts and takes, what you're hearing from your base in terms of what's keeping them on board. Or I guess, said another way, what's causing them to not roll off the platform? And then kind of how that's changed from kind of your guys' commentary maybe 2 or 3 quarters ago, where you've talked about attrition rates possibly being higher into the end of the year? And then I have a follow-up. Todd Pedersen : So this is -- attrition is an interesting thing. There's no one like silver bullet in attrition. It's a lot of little points of interaction with customers that determines their life cycle with us [indiscernible].  We've continued to improve. And again, this is really, really important. This is the differentiator with Vivint than everyone else. We create our own customers from a sales perspective. We professionally install the hardware that our engineers have designed and have written the software and the firmware for. We own our platform. It's this incredible cycle that -- and it's this feedback move that no one else has at this point. Others are trying to recreate our partnership to recreate that. But it's all -- it's lots of little points of contact and knowledge that we have to improve reliability of the product. It's how we answer calls, it's how we do installs, installation protocol, service protocols. And then this is just maybe not obvious, but it's obvious to us because we've been through a few downturns. Our product and services, when I'm talking about smart security generally, has done very, very well through every downturn, at least I've run the company through. So the last downturn, we shared very well. And I think in general, if you think about the burglar alarm security industry, they've done well also as far as attrition goes. I mean I think people historically, when those things happen, they want to protect their largest investment, which is typically their home, their families, the assets inside of those. We provide that. And then with this current environment of COVID, and people working from home, there's this incredible reconnection with the home, investment and kind of thought process around how people live and operate in their home, how they engage with -- and they're engaging with food delivery, grocery delivery, package delivery, increased demand for all of those services and how we integrate with that for consumer, making them safe and comfortable and giving them the knowledge that they wouldn't have without our services. There's all kinds of things that are benefiting our company today, and we're happy to do that because this environment is a little scary sometimes for people, and this provides nice peace of mind with smart security.  And here -- the great thing is, well, one, I hope things calm down on all fronts for everyone worldwide and our country. The -- I think that the engagement with our product and services and app on an individual consumer basis, has been incredible, and it's going to be remembered by our consumers.  And then again, I think you layer on with that, the fact that we are now starting at branding and advertising campaign really describing who we are, what we do, how we're differentiated and the value proposition that we deliver, we think we've got some good wind behind our backs. Erik Woodring : Awesome. That's really helpful. And then I guess my follow-up would just be, why raise your subscriber -- year-end subscriber targets but not your revenue guidance? Just what was the thought process behind that? And any kind of moving pieces that we should be thinking about there? Dale Gerard : Yes. I think, again, we're raising the subscriber targets based upon the fact that attrition is running much better than we had in our forecast. So our revenue guidance, the ranges, are we feeling comfortable?  One, the number of subscribers increasing doesn't impact -- I mean because we've got a pretty good-sized range there and we're given in terms of $1 billion range. We're within that range even if the subscribers are 20,000 or 30,000 or 40,000 more subscribers. So we feel very comfortable.  I mean if you go back, our revenue because this is the recurring revenue, we know going in, even starting to go into next year, we have a really good line of sight into what the revenue number will be. It's a little bit of moving around subscribers in terms of [indiscernible]. I think the other thing is we feel more comfortable today where we sit here in the first week of November than we did before in terms of the subscriber number, knowing how the metrics are working, how attrition has performed into a quarter plus or a quarter or so into the fourth quarter. So that's the reason why we made that guidance change. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Amit Daryanani : Yes. I guess a couple for me as well. Todd. First off, you've talked a fair bit about just increasing your brand awareness and recognition. I just want to get and understand the strategy there. But could you just touch on -- have you tested this in smaller regions, smaller cities? If so, what do those metrics look like to you? And then as you think about scaling this up to the extent you're talking about it, what does that investment look like from a cost perspective in calendar '21? Todd Pedersen : Yes. So we haven't tested the type of branding and advertising that we're going to do. But as you all know, we do -- we have an inside sales group that's about half of our -- half of the consumer adds on our customer base annually. So we do spend money on branding and advertising. It's more lead-gen type advertising. So this is going to be slightly different. We're branding style. So we have not yet done it, and that's why we're not going in full force. We're going to test in but on a national basis. And from a dollar spent on branding, it's much more expensive to be -- to go into a city or region than on a national basis on a spend. So that's what we're going nationally, not just on a local basis. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That's fair. I guess I was wondering if there's any way to dimension what that cost structure or cost will look like around that in calendar '21. And then I guess with Dale, the net service margins improved rather dramatically once again. And I understand some of this is more transitory in nature, perhaps even though on folks who come to the houses as much. But is there way to think -- if I look at the improvement you guys have had over there on a year-over-year basis, how much of that is structural versus something that's more transient that could go away in a post-COVID world if we get that ever? Dale Gerard : Yes. So I think we believe that, again, we've been very focused on this. If you go back 24 months when servicing cost was, call it, high $18 range, $17 range, and this is the benefit of having this fully-integrated model where we own the software, we own the product, we own the hardware, we do the sales, we do the installation, all of that feedback loop that we have, the cost of feedback loop that we have allows us to know, hey, what are the issues. And as we said, one of the big issues and one of the big products that people want in their homes is video, it's cameras. Whether it's indoor camera, outdoor cameras, doorbell cameras, as Todd said earlier, there's lots of uses for the video.  And we knew that with some of the connectivity issues were a big part of that, which were driving up calls into our call centers, which were driving calls in related to driving us to have to roll trucks up to people's homes. Those are expensive, and you have to actually roll -- go out to people's homes and fix those issues. So we believe by rolling out some of the new products -- we rolled out some new camera products, new doorbell camera.  We've rolled out a new hub. We've upgraded the firmware and software associated with that, those products that service, and we've done a lot of work around the technology that we have from our tools when we're installing stuff around, hey, what's the Wi-Fi connectivity in this part of the house or this part of being outside on the start corner of the home and making sure that where we're installing equipment and hardware in those homes that it works and that there is Wi-Fi connectivity, and then we make sure it all works together before we're leaving. And so what I think you're seeing is there's a structural move but the lower -- and in terms of servicing cost will be lower. I'm not -- I can't tell you on the call today how much of that is, but we believe that there's definitely that movement because we're seeing less calls coming in. And then we do know, too, because, again, the feedback loop we have, because we have to own this whole thing, is that we do know the type of calls are coming in, what those -- what are those issues. And we can go actually go work on those issues, whether they're, again, updates to the firmware, software, things of how we're installing the product in folks' home. So we think that's a big part of it.  Again, there's some part of it that's COVID-related. But fundamentally, we believe that we have this product and our services that we really are starting to fine-tune in terms of the cost to service those related to, again, calls coming in related to issues with the products. And again, a lot of that was around video, which we spent a lot of time and efforts to correct. Because ultimately -- and I think this also steps to the attrition that we talked about on an earlier question. If you get on your phone or you pull it up on your computer, however you're accessing the payment system and the cameras aren't on online or they're going offline, you're not going to be happy with the system versus today, you get on and the system works, the cameras are out there. You can go quickly to look at the events or you can pull it. It comes up and says someone's at your front door delivering a package. It works very well. It's seamless, your experience, that's going to drive customers to stay longer onto the platform. Operator : Our next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with RBC. Shweta Khajuria : Let me try two, please. Could you please run through why the subscriber acquisition cost decreased so much? And what -- how we should think about sustainability of that? That was a material decrease. And then the second one is, how are subscribers or potential subscribers responding to your new pricing plan or the change in the pricing plan? And yes. Just those two, please. Dale Gerard : Sure. And I'll start here and then, Todd, you can jump in if I don't cover anything. I think I'm going to start in reverse order. I'm going to take your second question first, and then that drives into the first question. I think in terms of the pricing model that we have -- and we're always looking at this pricing model, by the way, and I think you'll see us make tweaks to it as we roll into '21. We're always -- as Todd said, we test a lot of things. So we tweak things, and we keep tweaking until we find the optimal. But I think in terms of the acceptance from customers, I mean we grew subscriber 14% in the third quarter. Year-over-year, we continue to add new subscribers.  And I think one of the things I'd say is inside sales is where you're getting leads coming from the Internet. So customers are going out on the Internet, for example, maybe they're searching for smart home, smart security, security. And they're going to see other people's offers out there, by the way, as they're doing that. And that channel is growing. I think it grew 32% in the quarter.  So we think customers understand it. They like the transparency of it, by the way. They like to know, hey, this is what I'm paying for the equipment that's going home. I can -- this is the equipment that I want to buy. It's not that, hey, you're getting stuck with the package of things that you don't really want in your home, whether it's sensors or whatever. They're picking exactly what they want, as Todd mentioned earlier. They're taking more equipment today than they've taken in past, and they're taking smart home equipment. It's not just a sensor here and a door or a window, it's outdoor cameras, it's the doorbell cameras, it's door locks, it's response servers. It's really those things that help them have better management of their home, and so that's -- we think it's been received very well in terms of the customers taking that from both of our channels. In terms of the drop in net SAC, and we've kind of hinted to this on the last quarterly call, there's a couple of things going on here. One, we've reduced RICs substantially. If you go back to last year in the third, I think it's down 89% year-over-year in the quarter. And so if you recall, RICs are customers that we were basically financing and putting on our balance sheet, so we got no money upfront from those customers. Versus today, basically, 99% of the customers that we put on today, we're collecting money upfront either. They're -- it's coming from them financing through one of our financing partners, or they're just paying for it out of their own bank account. So that's fundamentally changing the amount of money that we're collecting upfront in terms of those customers.  And what you're seeing is, again, this is an LTM calculation. So what you had when we dropped from 9 -- I think it was about 950 in the first quarter to 630 in the second quarter. Now we're down to in the 208, 209 range this quarter because we're having those quarters that have higher RIC percentages that are falling off as we recalculate this out. So it's fundamentally changed the business. It's really driving the cash production is coming into this. We think it was something that we needed to do, and it's really changed, and frankly, allowing us to do some of this investment Todd's talking about in terms of brand and marketing and some of the other things we want to go do here.  In terms of how that looks, again, we'll tweak things. But I think, again, you'll have another quarter in the fourth quarter that as we kind of report out here in the next -- when we report fourth quarter, they have, call it, 8% to 12% RICs in that quarter, and those will fall off. And if you can kind of go do your math there, but if we have 1% RICs again, that number is probably going to continue on coming... Todd Pedersen : So the answer is it's sustainable. So I think we've kind of danced around this for a few quarters. Our business model is working the way it's working. We've said it was going to come down from 1,000. And we've not pinned a number, but we are very close to cash flow breakeven upfront when we create a customer. I'll just say it. We don't have to dance around or think about in the future. Anyone on the call, it's now public. So which is an incredible dynamic for our business compared to anyone on the call that listen to us, to our earnings call back when we were a consumer of debt. It was $2,200 -- our gross acquisition cost was -- gross and net was $2,200 subscriber acquisition costs.  So this is an incredible turnaround, and you're seeing the cash dynamics for the business, which also is because of the reduction in service costs, which is also because of the reduction in overhead. If you look at our overhead numbers compared to the past years, we've been incredibly focused on being a very lean company spending where we need to reinvest in what we think we're going to get growth, better technologies, better software, better firm work, better service delivery. So we've been busy in the last couple of years, and we're finally seeing those results. And again, back to the -- how do we grow the business more, continue to enhance products and service -- products and services to consumers wanting demand and then really go tell our story. Someone's going to probably ask, I'm surprised no has, who's your competition. Our competition right now is a lack of awareness of business. We did -- we have an incredible business, north of $1 billion of revenue, incredible margins, great service delivery, and nobody knows who we are. Not nobody, but it's -- I mean it's single-digit consumer awareness of our brand.  When people really do understand how incredible it is, what we can do inside of their home and interact and engage with the way they're now living their lives and the value prop that we deliver, we're going to -- we believe we're going to catch some wind from that perspective. And so we're -- and again, it's going to take time. It's not going to be overnight, but we're obviously patient and committed. So we have -- we're excited about what's ahead of us. Operator : Our next question comes from Kunal Madhukar with Deutsche Bank. Unidentified Analyst : This is Akash on for Kunal. I just have two questions. I guess the first question being, looking at third quarter versus second quarter, could we dig maybe a little bit deeper into buyer behaviors? And any changes in product mix that you guys saw in 3Q versus 2Q? And then also on the topic of competition, actually, looking at the landscape, any new trends that you guys are seeing in terms of the competition as it maybe relates to Amazon Ring X System or Google Nest? And any color there would be great. Todd Pedersen : Well, I'm going to talk first about the competition just because I said something and you asked the question anyway. We're always paying attention to what other people are doing out there. There's no question about it, we'd be crazy not to. But this is a tough business. I mean -- and I'm not talking about the single point solution stuff like a doorbell camera or an Arlo camera on the exterior of the house. These are fully-integrated smart home systems on a very intelligent platform, 14 devices installed in a home. And so to do that, you've got to have a very capable installation network, which we happen to own our own, our employees. And then the ability to -- and we've talked about this quite a bit today. Kind of own that whole interaction with customer from the sale process to the installation, the ongoing support, either technical support over the phone or if needs be driving a truck out there if that has to happen to deliver what we say we're going to deliver. So we have not yet seen someone else step up to the level that we're doing this.  People have parts of what we have by way of nice camera design or a nice doorbell or nice thermostat. But we've got an incredible moat because of -- and this is 20 years in the making, incredible moat. To recreate what we've done is not easy. I'm not saying it can't be done, but very difficult to do.  And speaking to Google, I mean they did invest in ADT. And I think the partnership, which we're super happy. It kind of validates -- we believe it's not just sort of it really validates their beliefs and the need for this infrastructure to be in people's homes, beyond the phone, answer calls, install professionally these new technologies that are coming. But you did -- if you've noticed anything, Google also did in their Google Nest security product. So it's even for a Google expense, I think they spend a lot of money. I don't know the number, but it's a lot. I see their ads all the time. It's not easy. People don't just buy this off-the-shelf and just understand how to install it themselves. It's not that easy.  And then there is the DIY component of this industry, which we have that capability. We're testing that. We just happen to like to have really high margins, which we do; and a very long customer relationship, which we do. And as we've tested DIY, which we are, and we're capable of it. I mean that's the great thing, we have incredible flexibility in the services offering, pricing perspective. It's our hardware, our platform. We're not yet convinced that we want to heavily pursue DIY even if consumers demand it because we want to make sure when we get on this call, we say, hey, we had high margins and we have a long customer life and a huge profit pool ahead of us. We want to grow. We are growing at a very nice pace. We intend to grow -- we believe that there's a lot more growth in this space than what we show at this point. But we've got to invest in that and be focused on that, which we are. But we're not growing to grow just to add subs if it doesn't add margin, profit pool and customer longevity. We're not going to just chase that.  And again, we are -- it's a good question. We are absolutely paying attention, and we watch what other people do. But I would say this, we've got 20 years doing this business. And we believe we're the clear leader in the smart home as a service space, a clear leader and a lot of experience. And we're just really excited about the way that consumers are engaging with our platform, the number of interactions per day, the different use cases that they're starting to discover as they -- again, this is me also.  I'm so much more engaged with my home and my family because of the environment that none of us chose, it is what it is, and it's been unfortunate in some ways. But in other ways, we've had to learn how to do that. Enjoy the home is kind of our staycation, I think people are calling it. And it's our work environment for most of us a lot of the time. So we are perfectly positioned as a company that can deliver really interesting services and offerings into consumers' home right now. So we feel like we're a [indiscernible]. Dale Gerard : Mix of buyers [indiscernible]. Todd Pedersen : Oh, so mix of buyers, not much change quarter-over-quarter. I mean not really actually. Sorry, I missed the last part. Operator : Our next question comes from Todd Morgan with Jefferies. Todd Morgan : I mean a great quarter. Good to see, I guess, year-over-year growth in subs, even with COVID. Two questions coming out of that. I guess first of all, is there any way to think about how much better or easier it would be to kind of sell and close and install and service customers without COVID? As you look forward, I know you've talked about continued growth, but how much is that kind of holding you back now, if that's the way to think about it.  And I guess, secondly, you talked a little bit about the SAC cost, this is for costs being on an LTM basis, really only a couple of hundred dollars. I mean if my math is right, you're basically paying nothing to add subs now, and it looks like you kind of suggested the same. Is there any reason to think that, that doesn't continue to be the case? In other words, you can kind of grow with effectively a $0 cash cost of adding that new subscriber? Todd Pedersen : Thanks for the questions. So to the net SAC, that's absolutely at this point a choice. And Dale said, this is kind of interesting. Before we had consumer financing, and the hardware was kind of part of the overall package, it was a little bit confusing. It's so beautiful now because customers really can just pick and choose either to pay upfront with no contract, by the way, no commitment, it's month-to-month from that point or user financing, 0% financing going forward. And the majority choose the 60-month financing. But it's an interesting thing because we now have kind of levers we can pull on where we want to be.  Now at this point, and again, things can change. I'm not -- we're not going to say nothing can ever change in the business environment or financing environment. But as it stands today, we are and can continue to operate at a minimum of breakeven upfront on the subscriber acquisition, which is absolutely amazing.  By the way, I don't -- when we really set out to do this internally as a group 18 months ago, I don't even know if we believe that we could do it, but the same goes true for the sub-$10 servicing cost. We had a goal by -- just so everyone knows on the phone to get down to $10 a month servicing cost about 3.5 years ago. So the fact that it's happened -- and some of it's in the environment that we're in, but others are my choice and investment, we're really excited about that.  So the answer is yes for now. Speaking to some date in the future where the economic environment changes and we are reliant on consumer financing group citizens, which has been amazing, in Fortiva, they've also been amazing, we can continue to do that. We think it's the right way to do this. Todd Morgan : And then the other question is around COVID. The impact of that do you think that's having on sales. Todd Pedersen : Yes. So from a COVID perspective, and I think maybe we have had -- we obviously had to put our direct-on-sales organization on pause. We also -- and I didn't mention this earlier. I want to make sure I do again. We eliminated about 40,000 subscribers we would have put on in the past in the form of RICs. So when you really look at our sales performance, customer adds and revenue, it's not good, it's outstanding. And so again, we have benefited from people being home, being more engaged with their home. Our performance on a per reps or sales per or sales per sales rep per day and revenue per customer, it is up substantially. It's up really nicely, I guess, I would say that right saying. I think we are going to see that trend, at least where we are, maintained because I think there is a lot more awareness in markets about who Vivint is. And as we layer on the branding and marketing campaign that we're doing, that we hope to perfectly describe how elegantly we deliver services to consumers, the quality of product, the design of the product, the value prop that we're going to keep those gains going forward. I'm actually fairly confident of that. Operator : Our next question comes from Marlin Rio [ph] with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Just a quick one on attrition. A few quarters back, you had talked about kind of a 14.5% to, let's call it, 15% level, mainly attributable to lower cohorts coming due. And I was just wondering if you can provide any commentary on how -- given the improvements in the last 2 quarters, if that has changed or if it's been pushed out or if it's maybe been kind of spread over a longer time frame? Dale Gerard : And I just want to make sure in terms of the question -- I mean we think attrition, again, we've seen really, really positive signs of attrition in terms of the number of folks that were canceling that were at their initial in the term. That's been much lower than we had forecasted.  Our payment indicators in terms of payments coming in from customers performed really well. So we're seeing really good performance of the portfolio. I think as we look to the rest of this year -- and again, there is COVID. There's cases spike in all across the country, and we can't -- we don't know how that's going to actually impact or if it will impact our customer base. I think if we looked at this year where I'm comfortable saying it is we're somewhere probably in the a 12.5% to 13% is where we'll end attrition for this year, so kind of in the range we are right now. That's where I think we'll end this full year. And then once we get a better indication of how things look going into next year, will give us an indication of what we think for 2021.  But I think we believe that our -- that the big fundamental change in how our service is performing, how we're delivering that service and the products that we're providing to the customers and the fact that even though they're home, Todd mentioned this earlier, there's just that reconnection that remodeling of their home, upgrading their home, adding the service to their home is something that they're doing and they want that in their home, and so we believe those customers will stay on the Vivint platform for a longer period of time. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And that's what I was getting at, Dale, is that instead of saying x amount of cohorts are coming due, normally, we see this type of behavior, that the past 2 quarters have been much better than my expectation. So it's not that, that 14% or whatever that number was got pushed forward. You could actually maybe even see that attrition or those cohorts coming due maybe spread out over a longer period. I guess my point is, that 14.5% to 15%, is that necessarily still out there and just pushed out? Or based on what you said in terms of people reconnecting with their home, we could actually see a shift in that to some extent? Dale Gerard : Yes. No, I don't -- we don't believe -- again, I'll just kind of give you the range, I think, for the end of this year. We don't -- and we'll give you next year. But we don't believe that 14.5% to 15% is it's -- you could take that off the table, I guess, is the best way to say it. We think we're somewhere again in this 12.5% to 13% range this year. And then we'll see what happens next year. Again, if things continue to perform as they are today, it's been -- we're going to be in that 13-ish range. But we don't think that we're going to see this spike back up to kind of that 14% -- north of 14- ish, 15% range. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Todd Pedersen for closing remarks. Todd Pedersen : Yes. So we just want to thank everyone for getting on the call. We are excited about the quarter that we've had and the year that we've had to this point. Hopefully, we've lived up and beat expectations, at least that we've told you in the market.  I want to make sure you all know this, we're incredibly focused on the current quarter, all of the dynamics of the business. We've got a pulse on everything, where we feel very confident in what we've stated and what we've promised for the year. But as an organization, and I think you'll learn this over time, it's not just the next quarter. We are investing currently in making sure that we make improvements and strides towards better service delivery and everything for the future of the business. We hope to continue to outperform expectations in the future. So thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Nate Stubbs, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Nate Stubbs : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss the results of Vivint Smart Home for the three months and fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Joining me on the conference call this afternoon are Todd Pedersen, Vivint's CEO; and Dale Gerard, Vivint's CFO. I would like to begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including with regards to the company's future performance and prospects. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and are not guarantees of performance. And you should not put undue reliance on these statements. I would direct your attention to the risk factors detailed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2020, which we expect to file within a few days of this earnings call. Please be aware that these risk factors may be updated from time to time in the company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that the realization of any such risk factors could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In today's remarks, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for historical periods to the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are available in the earnings release and accompanying presentation, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Pedersen : Thanks, Nate, and good afternoon to everyone joining the call. I'll start by recapping our terrific results for the fourth quarter and full year. Along with some of the key drivers of that performance, then I'll spend some time outlining some of our future priorities, sharing more of our vision for the smart home and why we think we have unique capabilities to deliver that vision as the premier end-to-end smart home platform company. Starting with the key financial highlights of the business, we had a strong finish to what was a very successful year for Vivint and our first year as a public company. Fourth quarter revenue grew by more than 8% to approximately $333 million. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $147 million up over 17% from the prior year and producing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 44% in the quarter. For the full year, Vivint grew total revenue by over 9% to $1.26 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew by 40% or $589 million. We originated over 343,000 new smart homes subscribers in this past year which was an acceleration from the previous year and the highest we've ever achieved in a year. As of December 31, Vivint had approximately 1.7 million total subscribers, up more than 9% versus the prior year. Dale will provide more specifics on the financials during his remarks, as well as share our outlook for 2021. But I do think it's important to provide some additional context to put our performance in perspective. The fact that we turned in such strong result emits the unprecedented challenges related to COVID-19 pandemic is nothing short are remarkable. We've certainly seen a lot in the 20 years since I founded the company and we performed well through the past economic downturns. But 2020 was altogether different and the challenges we dealt with in maintaining our sales and exceptional customer service, while protecting our employees and customers were profound. Some of these headwinds were self-imposed such as our decision to essentially eliminate retail installment contracts as one of our financing options as well as stopping direct-to-home sales in Canada. But what we could not have foreseen was, having to move our call centers and corporate employees to a work from home environment, and pulling our entire direct-to-home sales team out of their markets, delaying the start of the summer selling season for six weeks during the first wave of the pandemic. Despite all of this we were able to substantially beat our initial guidance for total subscribers and adjusted EBITDA, this attributable to the fact that we were well-positioned as a business heading into the pandemic both operationally and financially. We believe our cloud-based operating platform and the Vivint user experience are better today than ever before. The end-to-end Vivint platform is driven by AI and machine learning. So it's continuously getting smarter and improving. And because each smart home is installed professionally by us, it ensures that those systems work as designed, delivering a delightful and transformational smart home experience to our customers. We believe we have been able to drive significant improvements in our customer experience as well as overall profitability and cash flow. Thanks to our strategic focus in three primary areas. First transforming net service costs through our vertically integrated business model. Second, bringing down net subscriber acquisition costs through Flex Pay and third, scaling overall G&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. As a final reflection on 2020, while we were fortunate that we were able to adjust our process to deal with the most challenging sales climate we've ever seen, we're still seeing the impact of COVID-19 on our business in terms of restrictions in certain markets. Additionally, our unaided brand awareness is in the low-single digits. We began the process of fixing that late last year, investing to drive better consumer awareness of the brand on a national scale. Those investments will continue as we tell the story of who we are, what we do and how we can add value to people, delivering the security and peace of mind they desire. But beyond the brand, we also think that now it\u2019s the time to step things up in terms of overall vision to continue pushing new boundaries and delivering transformative smart home experience to every home. Vivint as an end-to-end smart home platform company with the most robust service offering, our vision is to extend the reach of the smart home experience well beyond where it is today by delivering additional services to the home, bridging even further to a truly autonomous home. Our smart home operating system processes over 1.4 billion daily events. And our proprietary platform collects and controls a massive amount of relevant data delivered through the Vivint devices in the home. There are many logical extensions of our end-to-end platform, including insurance, energy management, aging in place, in home healthcare, pet monitoring services, home inventory replenishment and deliberately home maintenance and repair. These initiatives are completely within our wheelhouse, in large part because we have built a platform that allows us to expand the many services homeowners\u2019 wants. Our expertise has always been in redefining the home experience by delivering intelligently designed cloud-enabled solutions directly to every home. Our proprietary cloud-based smart home operating system, along with our well-trained team of smart home professionals makes it possible to create a completely customized smart home. Today we have over 20 million connected devices on the Vivint platform. And we believe the data collected from those devices puts us in a very unique position to deliver many of the additional services I just mentioned. From the very beginning, we are focused on building products and services that are comprehensive, easy-to-use and affordable for the mass market. Delivering a truly integrated smart home experience requires unique proprietary technology. The expertise to customize and install smart devices in a customer's home and importantly, the ability to provide services through the entire lifecycle of the customer via call center professionals or in-home support. That is why our nationwide workforce of over 10,000 dedicated smart home employees is such a critical differentiator to the Vivint model. We took hold of our first-mover opportunity in this emerging category many years ago. And we believe we remain the leader, while others are busy trying to bundle together multiple apps, hardware sets and interactions across different providers. We're focused on extending the lead we feel we enjoy. I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through the specifics of our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as to provide our initial outlook for 2021. Dale Gerard : Thanks Todd, I'll walk through the financial portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our earnings release. First on Slide 6, we highlighted a few data points for the subscriber portfolio, which were strong across the board. Despite the economic and social challenges that existed in 2020, total subscribers grew from 1.55 million to 1.70 million or 9.2%. And total monthly revenue grew by 8% year-over-year. On Slide 7, we highlighted the revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter revenue grew by 8% to $332.5 million, while revenue for the full year grew by 9.1% to $1.26 billion. The revenue growth was mainly attributable to the aforementioned increase in total subscribers and total monthly revenue. Moving to Slide 8, adjusted EBITDA scaled nicely for both the fourth quarter and the full year. The primary drivers were lower expense, subscriber acquisition costs and scaling of service costs and G&A. For the year, we are proud to have increased adjusted EBITDA margins by another 1,000 basis points to 46.7% of revenue compared to 36.5% in 2019. While we feel we responded well to the challenges brought on by the pandemic, seamlessly transitioned thousands of customer service and corporate employees to our work from home environment. We had already implemented cost reductions even before the full impact of COVID-19 was felt. These actions put the company in a better position as the pandemic gripped the world. On Slide 9, we highlight a few metrics on new subscribers. New subscriber originations were 58,554 for the fourth quarter and 343,434 for the year. Both figures reflect outstanding results from our national inside sales channel and a strong second half of the year from our direct-to-home sales channel, following the multiple week delay at the start of the summer sales season caused by the pandemic. New subscribers grew by 27.7% in the quarter versus the prior year period and for the year we grew new subscribers by more than 8.5%. Furthermore, we reduced the number of Retail Installment Contracts or RICs by 85%. As mentioned on previous calls this has affected our new subscriber growth. But by shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards our financing partners, and pay-in-full arrangements, we have increased the cash collected at the point of sale thus reducing our net subscriber acquisition costs and improving our cash flow dynamics. Moving on to the right-hand side of Slide 10, our net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the year was $139 versus $1,018 in the prior year period, an 86.3% improvement, as we increased our upfront pricing for the purchase and installation of equipment and nearly eliminated the number of new subscribers that were financed via RICs. On the left-hand side of Slide 10, the improvement in the net service cost per subscriber had a major impact on our earnings for the fiscal year 2020. Our net service cost per subscriber declined from $13.73 in 2019 to $10.50 this past year. The solid improvement is due to the work of Vivint\u2019s vertically integrated smart home platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support. As we continue to make improvements in all of these areas, we're seeing continued positive trends in both customer satisfaction and the cost of service. The result is that our net service margins continued its upper trend moving from 73.8% in 2019 to 78.9% in 2020, the provided net service cost explains a large portion of the improvement in adjusted EBITDA that I cited earlier. It's worth mentioning that service costs were somewhat muted during the year as homeowners either delayed service calls or elected and solved the issues over the phone because of COVID related concerns. Additionally, we saw higher service revenue during the year from upgrades and moves, which had a positive impact on the net service cost metric. We would also note that service margins dipped a bit in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter as expected. Based on how we generally put our new customers particularly in the summer, we tend to see service costs increase in the latter part of the year. Slide 11 depicts our typical subscriber walk, illustrates the changes in total subscribers at year end. One of the areas we were concerned about as the pandemic took hold was its potential impact on the performance of our portfolio. And we were presumably surprised to see our attrition improve year-over-year ending at 12.4%, which was 150 basis points lower year-over-year and an eight quarter low. As we have started 2021, our portfolio continues to perform better than expected in terms of attrition and other leading indicators. While we are very happy with the year-over-year growth in new subscribers, total subscribers, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The $448 million turnaround in cash flow from operations is our biggest accomplishment in 2020. We stated that our goal was to get the cash flow neutral in 2020, but with the change in upfront pricing reduction of retail installment contracts and improving operating metrics, we will able to generate $226.7 million in net cash flow from operating activities compared to the use of $221.6 million in 2019. We finished 2020 with the very strong liquidity position of approximately $648 million, including $313.8 million of cash on hand. During the quarter we saw approximately 4.1 million warrants exercised, which also had a positive impact on our cash position and increased our public flow as well. Finally moving to our financial outlook for the upcoming year on Slide 12, the fundamental characteristics of our financial model remain highly attractive, particularly in the contractual reoccurring revenue that provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. We have several initiatives in 2021 that we believe will continue to feel our leadership position in smart home. In terms of guidance for 2021, we expect to end the year with approximately 1.80 million to 1.85 million total subscribers, full-year revenue between $1.38 billion and $1.42 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $640 million and $655 million. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Paul Coster : Yes, thanks very much for taking my question. Let me start with the outlook for the year ahead. You're talking of some new initiatives in the prepared remarks, the written document Todd sort of points towards something that it sounds like you are expanding the scope of your offering. So brand and scope somewhat, they may be the same to the 2021. Could you comment please? Todd Pedersen : Yes, sure. As we had talked about \u2013 and by the way thanks for joining Paul, as we had talked about last year, if we had a clear insight into the fact that we'd be cash flow positive, we were going to start testing some branding exercises. I think we've said this before. We have less than 5% brand awareness in the United States and we're a company with 1.7 million subscribers and literally no brand awareness. So there is massive upside for our company to put ourselves out there in the market with the special operating we have with the fully-integrated professionally installed and serviced smart home offering. So we're really excited about it. We actually started doing that in Q3. Our actual \u2013 we're not going to talk about the exact specifics. We spent less than 10 million on brand in Q4 last year and this year it's going to be somewhat less than 30 million in brand spend. We have a positive enough result, even better than we have expected. From a response perspective, all of these things do take years-and-years to mature and gain momentum but very excited about that. And then the second part of that question is, we're a company that we own our own platform. I think everyone here knows that. And so we developed our platform out, our operating system out, somewhat like it was like eight years ago. So we think that doubling down and enhancing and improving that and kind of revamping that is important with some of the IT and technical tools for on-boarding customers and underwriting. So there's some investment happening on that side of the company. And then we're going to further explore some of the initiatives we have around insurance that we've talked about and then some additional investments in aging in place and the potential that's coming without question for our company, because of our position in the home, the number of devices the amount of data. And kind of figuring out how to approach that market to massive margin, it requires physically installed piece of hardware to collect the right pieces of micro data in a home, which we have in our house. So we have multiple initiatives like that and so there is some spend happening in those areas. And we're really making sure that as a company we're being thoughtful around the future of the company, how we're positioned, taking best advantage of the fact that we've got with this proprietary operating platform with lots of customers growing long life cycle of the customer. So we're actually really excited about it. Paul Coster : You thanked me for joining the call. I got to tell you it's such a delight joining your call. So it just seems so exciting to me. So it's good to be here. Although a more sobering subject, you have filed the shell. And I think those of us who are looking at the stock rather than the business are a little bit irritated by that, we feel like there's an overhang not just fact but we were anticipating a refinancing of the debt. When are these things going to get done? When are you going to issue the equity or sell to \u2013 do the follow-on? And when are you going to refinance? Dale Gerard : Yes, well, hey, this is Dale. Welcome to the bar. I think just to maybe state why we did the shell or what we did here, in connection with the Mosaic transaction that we completed last January, obviously January 2020, certain number of our shareholders or stockholders were granted registration rights, requiring the company to put up shell for registration that would cover those shares. Due to the fact that we were a stack or a shell company or a blank check, however you want to think about, probably emerging with it, we were not eligible S-3 eligible, so just recently and had to fulfill those registration requirements by filing an S-1 shell. As soon as we become or became S-3 eligible we decided to file universal shell on form S-3 to cover those existing shares, registration rights, as well as registration of some additional securities for potential offering directly in the future. At this time we have no present attention to immediately conduct any offering, so to that shell, the purpose itself was to provide flexibility. So that's kind of what we're thinking and unfortunately that's probably the best I can give you at this at this point. Todd Pedersen : It's not imminent, but we're prepared \u2013 the markets we\u2019re in, there's a need for the company to do that, then we can take advantage, so it's more preparation. As far as refinancing the debt, paying down some debt and those are still in consideration. I mean, obviously the debt markets are strong. I think we're now well-positioned from the financial perspective operationally and otherwise to go and execute on that. And so that's coming. Paul Coster : So I guess I'm sort of seeing your comments on the shell just to mean that those with big stakes in the companies still are in the name after all these years, aren't necessarily are keen to sell at this price level. Is that a true statement? Todd Pedersen : Yes, I mean, I can't speak for the major shareholders. I mean, there were some lockup periods that part of the agreement were six and 12 and some are 24 months based on some of the shareholders that they came in through back. So I can't really speak to whether\u2026 Dale Gerard : And look Paul, I can say this, I mean from a liquidity perspective, we wouldn't \u2013 we're open to that if they would like to sell down at some point, because we need more to put into stock. We all know that, so that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. They haven't run to the markets to do a big block trade or anything like that, we all know this. But there is a point in time, in an appropriate sell-down over time would be beneficial to the overall company and the share price and allow more people get into this name. So we're kind of relaxed about that a little bit and they're going to make the decision as they go about, I happened to be a major shareholder and I'm not one of those. Paul Coster : Right. Got it. Okay. The last question is the key performance metrics have improved dramatically this last year. As we sort of roll into 2021, the macro numbers are now perhaps more of the focus than the key performance metrics. Because it seems to me like some of the \u2013 there's going to be attenuating improvements at this point, it is difficult for you to keep that rate of improvement going over the result? Dale Gerard : Yes. So let me tell you the thing that we're \u2013 and I've mentioned this in some of the investments that we're making into the company, the platform, the technical tools that we use to onboard customers in the field over the phone, serve our service platform. Again, it's all proprietary to both. We invest in those because this is what we know. The demand is high, even with all of the things that we changed last year. I mean, remember we eliminated new business in Canada. We eliminated RICs, kind of April timeframe stopped onboarding RICs other than an occasional RIC with system outages. So we're anticipating RICs would be 1% of our business this year. And then we put the direct-to-home program on pause for six straight weeks and then did a slow roll out. And so even with that, we get the numbers we did, there's demand for our products and services. And the more we get our name out and tell our story that we're going to start seeing better and improved top line revenue growth and sub-growth we're confident in that. So part of that invest into the platform to make sure that we can do that and handle that growth and deliver in a way that's kind of magical to consumer. So we're kind of doing some things in preparation of seeing some positive results on the branding side of the exercise of that. Some of the new \u2013 we have some new initiatives that we're doing around just testing out new ways to enter into the market or get into a home and expand in the home. So we have a lot of things, we are really excited that we're doing, we feel positive about and we figured out a lead to know better macro numbers. And then obviously we're always focused on what are the key things in the business like attrition and net service margin and all of those things, which kind of hard to improve, too much on all those very kind of knock those out of the park. But we're thinking about the whole thing all the time, Paul. Paul Coster : Got it. Thank you so much. Todd Pedersen : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. RK Raghunathan Kamesh : Hi. This is RK on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the nice results. I was wondering if you could compare and contrast your paid-in-full contracts, versus your bank financed contracts, any differences you'd call out in terms of proceeds at point of sale or attrition or anything else? Dale Gerard : Yes, I mean, \u2013 Hey RK, thanks for joining the call. Hope you and Rod are doing great. What I would say is, what we see normally on pay-in-full, a lot of times those are customers again that maybe don't qualify for financing, for example. So they still want to get on the platform. They still want to get the services that we offer, but maybe they're not able to take three cameras and two door locks and so they're taking a smaller system. So you're looking on average those are going to probably $1,000 or -ish upfront versus somebody that takes the complete system, 15, 16 devices, six or seven, what I would call smart devices, so those are outdoor cameras, doorbell cameras, cross-over views, door locks access those types of packages. Those are going to be in the $2,500 to $2,600 upfront, so that's kind of how to think about the difference there. And again, the consumer financing that's free for any financing fees, right, so, we do pay financing fees with [indiscernible] do pay those over time or we pay those upfront as their loans grow. So on average, you're seeing that call it $2,500 ish range on a super finance pay-in-full call it $1,000 or something. RK Raghunathan Kamesh : It's super helpful, Dale. Thank you and they're doing well. As a follow-up what's the sustainable level for net service costs and margins and what's included in your 2021 outlook? Dale Gerard : Yes. So I'd say, we've said this all along. We had a couple of quarters, if you think about Q2, Q3, where and we called this out on all these calls saying, hey, we had a lot \u2013 we had fewer service tickets into the home, which is a big part of that service costs. As COVID was really taking hold, a lot of people didn't want people coming into their homes and so we were trying to take care of that most of them at phone. And so we've said, those service costs in those quarters were probably abnormally lower than what they would have been. I think we see service costs, what I would say in the margin range. We've said that probably in the 73% to 75% margin rate, service margin is kind of where we think were normalized service levels in terms of the service we're providing the customers and then the service requirements are what we're pulling in from customers in terms, either calls coming into our call centers or requiring us to actually go roll a truck out to their home, to fix up that we couldn't fix. By the way we fix 85% to 90% of those, those issues that come in from a customer we're able to do over the phone, because of our technology platform that we have. But that's kind of so long and short of the answer is probably that mid-70% range in terms of service margins. Todd Pedersen : One thing I'll say, and may be this is for the future, this is not going to be 2021 impact, but there's going to be a cost factor there in investment. We see some more opportunities and we're constantly doing this because we own the hardware stack, the platform, the installation capability. We're always making improvements to the software and firmware. And then we see gains on connectivity and usability, and reliability of our system and our offering. We were going to be investing even more because of the AI and machine learning into more self-healing capabilities, more awareness around what's happening down to the unit basis on the hardware that we've installed inside of the home. And so we believe there's improvements and better economics to come. Just Dale made the point that its two quarters were kind of abnormally low, even though if you look at kind of on a trend basis over the past four years, when we came to \u2013 we came down from the mid-$18 per month level, down into what somewhere in the $11\u2019s is kind of a normalized number. So we're very confident that that trend can continue over time. Now, there are things that need to be done and we're making investments in those. And part of it is, when we come out with a new hub or a new camera or new doorbell camera or the devices, they get better and better about staying connected and being reliable, which reduces inbound calls, technical support, truck rolls and such. So this is something we're constantly focused on. RK Raghunathan Kamesh : Makes very much sense. Thanks guys and good luck. Todd Pedersen : Thank you. Dale Gerard : Thanks RK. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erik Woodring : Hey guys. Congrats on the quarter, I wanted to ask kind of a high level strategy question and then a finance question. So just to start high level, obviously then last nine months have been pretty unprecedented in many ways. Just curious, Todd and Dale from each of your perspectives and what were some of the lessons that you learned this year about your business and what of that can you apply to the business going forward to make it more efficient, make it more cost effective? Just anything you can speak to that and I have follow-up. Todd Pedersen : So I think this, that I haven't heard that question. You're towards a great question. We had to transition, one thing we learned about the organization is we have the ability with great speed and efficiency to change on a dime. I mean, we like other companies we went from working in the office to work from home and had to change the whole dynamic of how we operate and took care of our customers, which by the way that's the most important thing. It's quality of service delivery or we are customer\u2019s hand. And we as an organization made that happen very, very quickly with very little disruption and making sure that our employees were safe and protected same as consumers. Now the one thing and you saw \u2013 I mean, if anyone's noticed this, but our cash flow turnaround from 2020 to 2021 \u2013 from 2019 to 2020 staggering. In part of that was just deficiencies and spend, less travel, less general spend with some budgetary items that we went through and said, hey, look this isn't driving revenue per se. We thought it might and it's not, let's get rid of that. So we had become more efficient in the dollars that we're spending. And I think as a group \u2013 as a leadership group we've got a great cadence in making sure that those don't creep back in. So just making sure that we're improving with the dollars that are coming through and making sure that they're redeployed in a way that actually adds benefit and grows value to the business or delivers better service to the consumer or develops new product or services they're going to want. So look, I can say this organization, I'm so proud of what happened, how we responded to the year in every way form and fashion. And the most important is we didn't let our customers down and then the demand grew and intensified. And those are the ways you win in a consumer facing space as you deliver on what you say, you're going to deliver on, when you're going to \u2013 when you say you're going to deliver on that, because that the word spreads, we haven't had brand awareness. So it's consumer awareness to build relationships. So that's what I would say. Erik Woodring : Okay. That's awesome. That's really helpful. I guess maybe a relevant question then to touch on would just be on the cost side of things, clearly you saw a pretty sizeable uptick in costs in the fourth quarter, you mentioned brand awareness was less than $10 million. Can you just walk through kind of what drove the growth and costs in the fourth quarter? How much of that was kind of temporary or one-time versus permanent and then how to think about that into 2021? Thanks. Dale Gerard : Yes. Good question. So, again as Todd said, there was brand spending in the fourth quarter, which we didn't have year-over-year. I think the other thing is, we extended \u2013 we were able to extend our direct-to-home program out into the early part of the fourth quarter, which we've never done before, so we have costs associated with that, that we wouldn't have had frankly in the past. So those are kind of the two big drivers of it. And then you did start seeing, again this is really part of the normal process of our service costs as we kind of \u2013 as we normally we'd put in accounts in Q2 Q3, and you'd start seeing a lot of Q3 going into Q4 and see service costs kind of come up because you have, that first 90 days after sales come in, you have some more calls come in, some of it is education, some of it's of helping people get the system set the way they want it set. Sometimes it requires truck rolls back up to the homes. And we started seeing some of that in the fourth quarter. Again, that's normal. We expected that in our numbers, but that's kind of how w3e see it. Thinking about \u2013 just to be kind of, as you think about 2021, it's going to be there'll be some odd kind of work year-over-year comparisons. Because again Q2 of 2020, we didn't start \u2013 really didn't even start direct-to-home April first part of May, we were shutdown really. So you didn't have any costs associated with that and it's popped up. We then coming out of April, we didn't know what the pandemic looked like, we didn't know how it is going to impact the business. So we scaled back and kind of cost. And our employees luckily allowed us to do something that we had to be stopped 401(k) paybacks for example. We didn't get merit for a period of time. We were able as the business went along and got into the fourth quarter, we actually reinstated merits. We actually did some study, reinstated 401(k) and some stuff around that. So we see all of those cost come back in the fourth quarter. That would've normally been there until Q2 and run rate out. But we're excited we put out the numbers that we put out in terms of our guidance. We're excited about, again as Todd said, really staying focused on those key metrics and really evaluating how do we spend our dollars. Travel was one, for example, not to pick on the travel, the travel is one it's like, do we need to travel as much to go see, partners separately, can we do that over Zoom, I mean, it's worked, it worked for nine months and we've done and the results are saying. So there's some of that we'll bring back in, but I think some of this Zoom and some of the other types of way to connect with our partners and our teams, we'll continue to do going forward for a period of time. Maybe broader, I mean, it's kind of part of the new branding. Erik Woodring : That's really helpful if I could, if I could just sneak a last one in here, just in terms of your guidance, it looks like you're implying that you should get annual growth around like 3% next year. Just curious from your perspective or can you help contextualize, why we should expect that to grow? Is that implying new services? I understand you might not be able to tell us some of that, but just why we should think about that growing the way that you've got next year? Dale Gerard : Yes. So let me tell you, what's interesting. Thanks for pointing that out. I don't want to, there's no nothing to be alarmed about with this, but we actually think it could be better. We're trying to be a bit cautious because the supply chain, like everyone else that manufactures products overseas there's concern around supply chain, we're good with the plan we have and we're showing you right here. But the demand for our products and services, cameras, doorbell cameras, they're not \u2013 we have homed 16 cameras in the map, that five years ago they didn't even want camera. And the way we are just connected and how they deploy and how people interact with them and the amount of interaction, I mean on this call, 124,000 live video views are going to happen in our customer base during this call. So the demand is so high, we believe it could have been better. We're working on trying to speed things up from a supply chain perspective. We don't think it's going to disrupt our plan at all, because we've planned quite a bit in advance to make sure we can hit this, but we think there's even. And we would have said few years ago, there wasn't much upside for that to increase. Now we're seeing the opposite. The demand for additional and more hardware professionally installed is increasing substantially. So we're excited about that. We're feeling like that, that's conservative because of the supply chain issue, not demand. Erik Woodring : Awesome. Super helpful. Thank you guys. Congrats again. Todd Pedersen : Thank you. Dale Gerard : Thank you. Operator : Next question. Come from Kunal Madhukar of Deutsche Bank, please go ahead. Kunal Madhukar : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. A couple of I got, one on the subscribers and the outlook there, given the acceleration that you have seen throughout 2020 in the national inside sales and the fact that, hopefully by the time we get into the actual selling season, you'll probably be able to deploy a lot more sales guys into the direct-to-home. Why shouldn't be the subscriber count end up at more than 10% growth on a year-over-year basis in 2021? And then I've a question on branding and brand spent, given the approved financial metrics and the profitability and the cash flow profitability of business, why aren't you spending more? Todd Pedersen : Those are great \u2013 both of those are great questions. Here's what I would say on the direct-to-home program. We're still in the middle of this pandemic. We are being cautious about over hiring, I don't, if you remember that last year, we had a lot more people hired than we actually deployed. Put on pause, there were people that were concerned about going into the neighborhoods, in homes, or even on people's front porches to do consultative sales. The ones that did, we did it with all the safety concerns in mind and protocols. And we did all the proper measures to make sure that they were healthy, but \u2013 and we had a lot of success, but we're still, if we over hire and something, another disruption that happens, it's just very expensive. So we're trying to be not cautious, but just be balanced in our approach with the direct-to-home. And then from an inside sales perspective, it's still growing scam. We are wanting to prove out to ourselves and we think we have somewhat that it's just been a quarter, that the brand spend that we're doing in the specific areas, we're doing really are going to produce the results that all of our shareholders are going to appreciate. And that's \u2013 really what that means is it's going to lead to subscriber growth. We feel that's the case. We actually believe it or we\u2019re in, and we\u2019d say it\u2019s good enough, it probably warrants spending more than 30 million this year, but we're going to reserve the right to do that if we choose throughout the year, if we continue to improve. But for now, we're kind of saying somewhat less than 30 million is a modest amount to spend. But I would suspect you'd see over time, if they continue to show the results are showing that that will increase over the next few years. Dale Gerard : I'd say this \u2013 I\u2019d add one additional point this describes is that, for attrition we finished 12.4% in 2020. Again, we're putting some caution into those numbers and maybe attrition is \u2013 maybe it's in the high-12% maybe even low-13%, but again, we're \u2013 there's a lot of unknowns out there, like still how are the economy is going to evolve, how they can impact the actual consumers. I mean, if there's more government stimulus checks put into the market, how does that impact our customers it seems like it was very good, our customers were in terms of how they performed in 2020. But again, so we're just kind of being taken what we know today in terms of what we see out there. Again, as Todd said around the sales side and then in terms of customer portfolio performance and trying to put out a number that we thing is reasonable. Todd Pedersen : And these things are all things that have to work in constantly, let\u2019s take this is what we know the product and services in the way we deliver them and how magical it is. It's going to gain momentum. We're perfectly suited for this environment. This new environment of working from home, some people back at the office, some that's kind of back and forth, even though with food delivery, DoorDash had more packaged delivery. We're like \u2013 we're perfectly suited for this new home environment. And we can take care of consumers in a very special way. So we're excited about the future. We have that opportunity to have a position to do that. Kunal Madhukar : Thank you. Todd Pedersen : Thanks, Kunal. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Jeff Kessler : Thank you. Hey, Todd? Hey Dale, how are you doing? Todd Pedersen : Hey Jeff, how are you? Dale Gerard : Doing great. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Sitting at home. I obviously have a lot of questions I'll hit you later on when I get you back. If we take this down to the street level so to speak or to the actual customer where your rubber meets the road, can you talk a little bit about, number one, what you do \u2013 what you've done, that's different now in the onboarding process and also in terms of relating to that net service cost, what are you doing in terms of \u2013 in terms of servicing the customer, both of which are showing up in the metrics, but in the real world, I need to know kind of what's changed over the last year? Todd Pedersen : Well, I think the simple fact is this. We own our whole technology stack. We're including sales, installation, monitoring, ongoing service, technical support, the entire feedback loop we own. It's proprietary to build it. Now obviously we will integrate with best-in-class products Google Device or an Amazon device, but we own the technology stack. And so we have the ability to have this incredible quick feedback loop. If a new product or a piece of hardware is causing more cause into the customer care or technical support department or causing more truckloads, we troubleshoot, we can troubleshoot quickly. It's our innovation center. It's our software and firmware engineers. It's our product designers. So this is \u2013 we've said this, and it's now proving to be not just true, but incredibly relevant to this business. And it's not just the margins. It's the consumer experience that's most important. If our service cost has come down with the \u2013 more it's 15 devices in a home, seven of them are smart home devices. These are door window sensors and to keep all in the glass break. Not that we don't have them, but these are really robust systems. I mentioned earlier, I just saw a guy today, 16 cameras at his home on the Vivint platform. He came and showed me, it's like \u2013 this is your company is so cool. Every single one of these are online. He had our system several years ago, four or five years ago when we were first coming out with extra cameras. And they would go offline sometimes. But we've troubleshooted, do all of these things I've talked about to make sure that experience is incredible. By the way drives down calls and service costs. So we think we're going to still continue to see gains from that respect. And when you say from an on-boarding perspective, what's your specific question? Jeff Kessler : The first \u2013 those first conversations in those first couple of several weeks where the customer may have had problems, or may be more expensive to bring that customer on to get them up and ready, particularly if they're taking on a bunch of technology where they've been sold on 14 or 15 different items and being taught how to do it. How do you make sure that customer is satisfied a month or two later? Todd Pedersen : Well, again, this is right back to the same thing. A 100% of our installs are done by our employees. They use our technical tools to do the installation. We have these health metrics with our, we call it the tech teams, our proprietary platform for installation, service and sale, all combined up into our call center and customer service center and ultra \u2013 that's all the data we can track on a real-time basis. I don't know of anyone else that can do that in this space. I'm confident they can't. And so it's \u2013 we just have these huge advantages in the market they're going to continue to prove themselves out more and more as we go on and the space gets more robust and deeper into the home with products and services, which is happening that's we all know that\u2019s happening. And so it's \u2013 this is many, many years in the making. We didn't just decide to do this recently, or because someone else is doing it, this is a decision \u2013 we've made decisions over 20 years to invest in ensuring that the quality of service and the reliability and the magical experience is there. And it has to happen at the point of install. We walk away and things don't work well, that's a bad experience, and it's a cost center, and both of those are bad. And so we're getting better and better, better at those. Not that it's almost impossible to be perfect with technology and lots of devices that are connected wirelessly, but we're pretty darn good at it and getting better and I can assure you that over the next year and years. We have plans to continue to burn down those issues, eliminate them and make them our strong suits. So we're just getting started. Jeff Kessler : But my follow-up is probably directed \u2013 actually probably directed toward Albany, the \u2013 below the cash flow from operations line to get down to what would be \u2013 what some of us would call just pure unadulterated, unfettered free cash flow. What are some of the subtractions that if we're trying to figure that out, we would have to be making \u2013 are you different in any other way than other companies? Todd Pedersen : Not I'm aware of that. I'm glad that I can take a look. I don't have all that bottoming air, but glad to catch up offline we can walk you through that. We'll be final it in day or two. So all of our financials will be out there within the next day or so. Dale Gerard : Cash from operating activities was, I mean, we just and we knew we were going to, by the way, we knew we were going to deal on all things, but we've had tremendous improvements operationally, financially, and that it was on purpose. None of it happened on accident and we're hyper focused on how we operate this business. We want to be known as great operators, not just from a financial metric perspective, but toward consumers, because that's going to be, that is one of the key differentiators. We have professional installed fully on proprietary smart home platform. And that's going to lead to the future of our business, which is what a true smart home is going to be, which is the entrance into the home to what we're doing is going to provide lots of outlets into services and technologies that we're going to be able to provide for consumers. We've got to be great at the first part, just as maintaining these hardware devices having them be stable, reliable, elegant, great experience, low issues, and then we're doing that. Jeff Kessler : All right. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Todd Morgan of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Todd Morgan : Thanks. Good evening, lots of information here. Just one thing that kind of I see is the branding efforts you've talked about. I mean, you've been very passionate about sort of the technology and the experience that you're offering folks yet. When I look at the ads, I kind of see two things and maybe I'm not seeing all the ads, but I see Snoop Dogg explaining, how easy to do it for me, installation model works. And I see the more traditional ads talking about doorbell cameras scaring way package dealers, and so on. Those were different messages than what you've just spent the last period here telling us about, I'm just curious as to kind of how you got to that kind of an advertising message. And is that something that you would expect to evolve even in 2021 or so? Thanks. Todd Pedersen : No, I mean, look, I will here's what I'd say. There's no \u2013 there are no company that's done branding enters in and can tell the entire story with their first entrance into the space. That's just not possible. So we just wanted to say, hey, here we are. This is Vivint. We actually have something that's cool. That's professionally installed. You don't need to worry about it. But I can assure you that, we will continue to tell our story over time and that's going to be something that evolves. We want to make sure it resonates with customers and it doesn't overwhelm them also. A lot of people don't realize that they can get 15, 20, 30, 50 devices installed their home profession at a very, very reasonable price. And to just put that out there, like I say might just have someone tune out a little bit because they would think, well, that's, even though we're saying it, let's say on an advertising campaign, they may not believe it like that, that can't be affordable. So it's just \u2013 here we are, this is simple. Just give us a try little doorbell, put that on there. And then we're pretty good at sales and upsells, and so we can upsell them into a full system. And so you'll see it evolve all the time. We're just the response and how simplistic and it was on purpose. The initial entrance was we had a tremendous response. Todd Morgan : No. Okay, great. Well, that's good to hear and great quarter and thanks a lot. Todd Pedersen : Thank you. Operator : And that's all the time, we have allotted for questions today. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Todd Pedersen for closing remarks. Todd Pedersen : So we appreciate everyone being on the call and via webcast. Again, we want to make sure everyone knows that we're super focused on just making sure that we deliver on what we say we're going to. We think the future is super bright. There's a bit everyone on the phone knows this. It's a big industry, lot of opportunity, and we are best suited to take advantage of that because of this, the ecosystem we've built out technologically our 12,000 employees that are taking care of our customers and expanding our reach throughout North America. So again, we appreciate you all paying attention to us and to invest in this panel. So and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

I will now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Pedersen : Thanks, Nate, and good afternoon to everyone. I hope that life is starting to get back to normal for all of you as vaccine rollouts accelerate until a case counts decline. Today, we will cover the following topics. Discuss our strong financial and operating results for the quarter. Review our robust customer engagement and the performance of our platform. Talk about our excitement over the near-term outlook for Vivint\u2019s premier end-to-end smart home platform as we gear up for what we expect to be a normal summer selling season. And as our customers engagement levels remain high, regardless of whether people are spending time inside or outside of their homes. The momentum around our business that we saw in 2020 as carried into the first quarter of 2021. And we are pleased to report continued improvements in our key metrics year-over-year, including an accelerated revenue growth of 13% along with 60,000 new smart home originations, which represented a 20% increase, all while producing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 47%. As of March 31, 2021, Vivint\u2019s total subscribers grew 10% from the same period in 2020, to more than 1.7 million. Along with the highlights I previously mentioned. We also saw solid improvements across the board and other key metrics for the quarter, including another steep decline in net subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber and the lowest LTM attrition rate in the past nine quarters. I believe that these strong results speak to the fact that our core value proposition proven over two decades of reliably taking care of our customers and their families is as relevant today as ever. Dale will provide more specifics on financials during his remarks, as well as share our thoughts about our full year 2021 guidance. If the past year has taught us anything, it\u2019s that there is no better time for homeowners to have a comprehensive smart home system. The 1.1 billion daily events processed by our smart home operating system across more than 23 million connected devices are the best indicator of the frequent engagement of Vivint\u2019s customer base. We are uniquely qualified to help our customers deal with any environment across the various smart home devices we support. From door locks, cameras, security monitoring, thermostats, lighting controls, garage door controls, and many other connected devices. All of these innovative products are designed to work together seamlessly through our elegant platform that homeowners can control from their in-home touch-screen hub through a single app on their phone, or by simply using their voice. Vivint services also include life saving and life protecting 24/7 professional monitoring, or emergencies such as medical, fire, carbon monoxide and burglary alerts. Our vertically integrated model includes dedicated customer care and monitoring teams to ensure that we respond to alerts within seconds. Our cloud platform and proprietary technology also allows customers to seamlessly manage and protect their homes, regardless of whether they\u2019re socially distancing inside the home, or from somewhere outside of it. Vivint takes care of our customers and their families while providing the peace of mind that people demand during times of heightened awareness, anxiety, uncertainty and mobility. We\u2019ve been securing and innovating smart homes for over 20 years. In our experience since the onset of the pandemic, is only cemented in our minds the fact that our customers will continue to value home security and smart home technology during challenging economic and societal times underscoring the strength and resiliency of the Vivint model in any type of environment. With attention now turning to the reopening of the economy and having this coincide with the onset of our summer selling season. We remain bullish about the near-term demand for the business. Given that approximately 50% of the adult population in the U.S. have now received at least one dose of the vaccine and that by the end of the month, we anticipate that all states will have lifted mandatory quarantine restrictions. The tried and true process of selling door to door and installing new Vivint systems inside of homes is getting back to normal. We believe the pent up demand for travel also plays right into our hands. To the extent last year shelters became this year\u2019s travelers, they still have every reason to remain highly engaged with their smart home systems. Based on interaction volumes with our platform before COVID, during COVID, and now as the country begins to look beyond COVID our systems and services have proven to be just as relevant in all of these environments. We\u2019re still respectful of the fact that we continue to operate in a world actively dealing with COVID-19. We have increased the preparedness of our direct sales team as they head out to markets across the U.S. at full capacity. And they\u2019ll be ready to go with all the right training and necessary PPE to interact with current and new customers. As a reminder, last year at this time, we had to swiftly move our call centers and corporate employees to a work from home environment. Paused our entire direct home sales teams for about six weeks during the first wave of the pandemic delaying the started the summer selling season. At this point, we fully expect to return to a more normal summer sales season this year. Meanwhile, our other sales channel, national inside sales, which onboards nearly half of all new subscribers and the normal environment has turned in robust results through the pandemic. And we believe that momentum will continue in 2021. We have long believed the total addressable market for smart home presents a massive opportunity. And in the not so distant future the vast majority of the 150 million homes in North America will be running on a comprehensive smart home operating system. We believe Vivint is the premier end-to-end smart home platform company with the most robust service offering and as such is the best position provider to take advantage of this opportunity. We believe in order to take advantage of the growth opportunities in smart home, it\u2019s important that we increase our focus and investment in our brand, technology and new product development. On this front, I\u2019m pleased \u2013 early returns we\u2019ve seen from our brand investment rolled out during the fourth quarter of 2020 to drive better consumer awareness on a national scale. Those investments will continue as we tell the story of who we are? What we do? And how we can add value to people by delivering the security and peace of mind they desire? But beyond the brand, we also think now is the time to step things up in terms of technology and our product vision to maintain our position on the leading edge the product development and to continue pushing new boundaries by delivering a transformative smart home experience to every home. Before I turn the call over to Dale to go through specifics of our first quarter results, as you may have seen Vivint recently resolved the matter with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission related to certain historical instances of violations of the company\u2019s policies by sales employees. We are pleased to put this matter behind us. Vivint takes matters of compliance seriously, particularly as customers across the country put their trust in us to protect their homes and families. We have already taken steps before the FTC began its review to strengthen our compliance policies. And we will continue to make this a focus going forward. To that end, we are deeply committed to operating with integrity, doing right by our customers, delivering on our commitments to stakeholders and providing exceptional service to our customers. I will now turn the call over to Dale. Dale Gerard : Thanks, Todd. Before I get into the results for the quarter, just a quick comment on the recent statement by the SEC related to the accounting for warrants issued by SPAC companies. Following the issuance of the statement, we reevaluated our historical accounting for both the public and private placement warrants assumed in conjunction with our merger with Mosaic in January 2020. Like a majority of SPACs, we previously recorded these warrants as equity. However, based on our valuation, we determine that the warrants should have been classified as liabilities and measured at fair value in the closing date of the merger was subsequent changes in fair value reported as non-operating income or expense, and our consolidated statements of operations each reporting period. Of Tuesday of this week, we filed an amendment to our 2020 Form 10-K to restate our previously filed financial statements. As a result of this restatement, we recorded a $109.3 million non-operating loss related to the warrants. And our warrant liability was $83.6 million as of December 31, 2020. I\u2019ll now walk through the financial portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with the earnings release. Looking on Slide 6, we highlight a few metrics for the subscriber portfolio, which continued to be strong across the board. Total subscribers grew 10.2% from 1.55 million to 1.71 million. Average monthly revenue per user our AMRU increase to $67.24 up 3% year-over-year. An increase in AMRU was driven by additional sales of new products, such as our latest generation of outdoor and doorbell cameras, as well as the recognition of deferred revenue. On Slide 7, we cover revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. For the first quarter of 2021 revenue grew by 13.2% with $343.3 million. The revenue growth is attributed to previously mentioned double-digit increase in total subscribers, as well as the increase in the average monthly revenue per user. Adjusted EBITDA grew nicely in the first quarter. The primary drivers for the scaling of service and expense, subscriber acquisition cost. For the quarter we increase our adjusted EBITDA margin by 270 basis points, the 47.2% of revenue, compared to 44.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Moving to Slide 8, we will highlight a few points on the subscribers originated in the first quarter of 2021. A subscriber originations led by a 29% year-over-year growth in our National Inside Sales Channel were 60,127 for the quarter. How and which subscribers we onboard is important to our success today and in the future, and we continue to redefine and boost the underwriting requirements and process to qualify and onboard new subscribers. One of the pauses of the enhanced underwriting requirements is that we are able to reduce the number of retail installment contracts or RICs that are financed on the company\u2019s balance sheet. For the first quarter of 2021, we saw a 77% reduction in the number of subscribers financed through retail installment contracts. By shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards third party financing partners and pay in full arrangements we\u2019re able to reduce our net subscriber acquisition cost and improve the company\u2019s cash flow dynamics. Speaking of our third party financing partners, I\u2019m pleased to announce we recently completed a successful renegotiation of our agreement with Citizens Bank, our primary financing partner under the Vivint Flex Pay program. This renewal resulted in a contract extension of three years in the implementation of a new line of credit finance offering through our consumers, which will streamline the initial sales process and facilitate up sales and upgrades of additional and new equipment during a customer\u2019s lifecycle. Moving to the new line of credit finance offering changes the timing of when the merchant discount rate and loss your fees are incurred, which will impact the amount of cash in the near term. That said, we are fully committed and intend to operate the business on a cash flow positive basis this year and going forward. Moving to Slide 9, we will cover service costs per subscriber and new subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber moving from $11.76 in the first quarter of 2020 to $10.77 in the first quarter of 2021. This reiterates the advantage of Vivint\u2019s vertically integrated, smart home cloud platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation, and ongoing customer support. As we continue to make improvements in all these areas, we\u2019re seeing positive trends in both the cost of service as well as customer satisfaction. Our net service margin continued to be in the high 70% range at 77.7% for the first quarter of 2021. A drop in service cost per subscriber is driving a significant portion of the increased in adjusted EBITDA dollars, as well as adjusted EBITDA margin percentage. On the right hand of Slide 9, we highlight net subscriber acquisition costs for the last 12 month period. For the period ended March 31, 2021, net subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber decreased to $66. That\u2019s 93% lower year-over-year, as we continue to drive down the number of new subscribers that are financed via RICs and shipped to a higher mix of customers utilizing our financing partners are paying in full, the purchase of their smart home products. During the quarter, we also continue to benefit from pricing leverage on the point of sale, purchase and installation of equipment. Slide 10 depicts our typical subscriber walk that illustrates some changes in total subscribers at quarter end. One of the pleasant surprises throughout the pandemic has been the performance of our subscriber portfolio. Once again, our attrition improved ending at 11.8%, which is 230 basis points lower year-over-year, and at a nine quarter low. Our portfolio continues to perform better than expected in terms of both attrition and other leading indicators. In terms of cash flow, we saw a nearly $19 million improvement in net cash used in operating activities during the quarter. We finished the first quarter with $274 million of cash on hand and a very strong liquidity position of approximately $600 million. Finally, moving toward guidance for the year on Slide 11. The top of the page highlight several fundamental characteristics of our financial model, including reoccurring monthly revenue from long-term subscriptions, a highly predictable business model and the ability to thrive in all economic environments. We are pleased with the momentum in the business on the strong start to the year. And we\u2019re bullish about our ability to operate the direct-to-home sales team during this summer selling season at full capacity. We are also aware of potential supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and hiring constraints that could limit further upside. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we are confirming our original guidance as follows. We still expect in 2021 with 1.8 million to 1.85 million total subscribers. Our estimate for 2021 revenue continues to be $1.38 billion to $1.42 billion. And finally, we have firm our previous 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of between $640 million and $655 million. This concludes our prepared remarks on the first quarter. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Paul Coster : Yes, thanks very much for taking my question. You said it sounds like the guidance implies that supply chain risks present upside perhaps, but not factored into the guidance, so the limited from a downside, thinking one of the first sort of tilts in that kind of way. Can you just talk to us about what your biggest sort of component risks are and how it is that you seem to be managing through this problem so well on a relative basis? Dale Gerard : Hey, Paul. It\u2019s Dale. Thanks for joining the call. We look at it a big part of our growth initiative and some of the stuff we\u2019re trying to do is really around camera attach rates. And as, we think that\u2019s one of the big selling points and why people really like smart home as one of the big advantages we think our systems have over others, integrated analytics, and the different things that we can do with that, in terms of notices, and so forth with customers. And so part of what we\u2019re doing with our pricing and how we\u2019re selling and what we\u2019re seeing in terms of take rate, or adoption of additional cameras, we\u2019re in good shape, we believe right now. But if adoption rates are higher than we think, and if there\u2019s any, disruption, in terms of chip manufacturing, and or the big thing, really, one of the big things is logistics frankly, supports and getting and then from the ports, it could be some where we may have to limit the number of cameras, we sell the second, maybe late in the third quarter or fourth quarter. But, we think we\u2019ve addressed that we\u2019re doing some stuff with air spray and shipping. And so, we\u2019re just calling that out as to say, hey, based on, we\u2019re off to a good start. We think that the year we\u2019re going to have a good year. But with some stuff around supply chain, like there\u2019s some inflationary pressures out there, there\u2019s some hiring constraints, what we\u2019re probably no different than other companies as we try to continue to ramp up, especially in the field, in higher and in the markets that we service, have been able to hire enough installers and service professionals to be able to take care of the customers the way we want to take care of them. So, we just kind of put all that stuff together and said hey, based upon on where we are today, and what we see. We think, confirming our guidance, which we think is really good guidance for the year to begin with, is the best path at this point. Todd, I don\u2019t know anything you just want to add? Todd Pedersen : Yes, I was just saying, Paul, you kind of caught that which is based on supply chain issues that Dale mentioned, the potential for upside beyond where we sit is limited to product being delivered to the U.S. and being able to install that. So it\u2019s not impossible that we could see some upside, but it\u2019s going to be quite difficult or just like own house everyone else their supply chain issues out there. Ships mean, kind of front end center, driving most of that. So but we do feel very comfortable this number. We\u2019re fortunate that we have a seasonal business in some regards, because we treat order a lot of the hardware and had done that last year. And so a lot of what we need to attain these numbers, we already know we have a kind of insight. Paul Coster : Gotcha. And a quick follow up, I think investors have been working really hard to try and figure out what\u2019s going wrong, because the stocks been going down and we\u2019re all sort of very anxious, but something obvious here. Let me just sort of try and my luck is the, it sounds like you\u2019ve entered into an extended term with Citizens Bank, but as part of that, there\u2019s different allocation of the credit risk. Does that relate back to this FTC issue? And in passing? Todd, can you just tell us, what is actually the FTC issue identified and when it occurred? Dale Gerard : Yes, I think the first part, Paul, [indiscernible] in terms of the extension with Citizens, we\u2019re very, very pleased with our partnership with Citizens, they\u2019ve done a very good partner. We\u2019ve had a relationship during consumer finance with him since early 2017. And so we were glad to be able to extend it, the changes that we\u2019re making in that program assistance really has, nothing in terms of the FTC. It was really part of the negotiations to move from the installment line into a, what we call a line of credit, which really is better for us long-term and better for our customers. It\u2019s easier for the onboarding process. And then really where we will see the benefit is the additional sales of hardware, either additional products that customers want to take or as we roll out new products, and customers want to have those systems, their line of credit allows for that in a way that the installment loan which was a kind of a fixed loan debt. And so, in reality, the way the terms are set with the line of credit or more standard terms, our terms are ahead with installment loan, we\u2019re probably not what with standard industry? We were able to do that, I think early on. So by moving to the line of credit, one of the things that was part of that was we\u2019ve kind of go to more standard terms around how come, the users of these products pay for that the credit offering from Citizens or from other banks, and then Todd will pick this. Todd Pedersen : Yes, I mean. The first thing I\u2019d say is, we\u2019re glad to have this FTC settlement done. Now, why we have not, we\u2019ve been asked about refinancing paying down debt, and we were not able to do that didn\u2019t feel like it was good timing, in the middle of that FTC settlement happening. So, we\u2019re glad to have that past and in the past. Secondly, we\u2019re a company that we want to provide great service, take care of consumers, our customers, and so this behavior, if it\u2019s not consistent with integrity and doing right by consumers, has no part of this company. But back in 2017, we did have some sales people that got around some systems that we found out and let those people go. And that was part of this investigation by the FTC. And the thing is, we found out we did let those return those people let them go. But again, that\u2019s in the past and done. We\u2019re glad to have that behind us. We\u2019ve definitely made. And we do this every year enhanced improvements on compliance, and systems and controls to ensure that underwriting and everything is up to par and again, compliant with laws of the United States from a financing perspective. So again, glad to have that behind us and done and the settlement over. Paul Coster : All right. Thanks so much Todd. Thanks. Todd Pedersen : Yes. Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is now open. Jeff Kessler : Thank you. And it\u2019s been great working with all you guys. I will hopefully, we\u2019ll continue to talk. Just not in the position I am that\u2019s all. I\u2019ve got really a couple of questions here. Firstly, what are the \u2013 it looks this year from the sound \u2013 look, you\u2019re going to have to the economy looks like it\u2019s opening up, you have \u2013 you are making investments you\u2019re talking about? And you\u2019ve already started with in branding the company. Now, can you talk about what other types of investments and how much that may cost you that you\u2019re going to be involved with assuming that other than that the overall economy opens up is probably timing for you to start pushing on some of the other home, some improving home automation, trying to put some distance as we knew and others in terms of technology, trying to do things, in terms of maybe improving. I don\u2019t know improving your training or focus on how you onboard your new salespeople are spending more money there. Can you just talk about the various types of increased investment you\u2019ll be doing in addition to branding? Todd Pedersen : So, and by the way, it\u2019s been great to work with you to these years. We\u2019re going to miss this, I guess it\u2019s a perfect like that, hopefully relationship continues. Jeff Kessler : I\u2019m sure; we\u2019ll have with my other guys. Dale Gerard : That sounds great. Well, so a couple of things. We are \u2013 we agree that investment in continued product enhancement and quality and technologies is critical, so that we can keep our lead in the market and deliver the best services that we can to consumers and that\u2019s first and foremost. The quality has got to be there. The values got to be there or continue to drive that. We are investing in new tools and technologies from onboarding customers, underwriting customers; we\u2019ve built these tools over the years. Some of them we feel need to be refreshed. You\u2019ll probably end up seeing within a year or so a platform kind of reinvestment in the platform. Again, we built out our operating system seven, eight years ago. And we believe that there\u2019s some updates that can be done and will be done to enhance that, that experience for the consumer, allow us to do more upgrades, have more content for consumers information, consumers and allow us to kind of deliver service to them through those enhanced \u2013 to be enhanced operating system. So, that\u2019s going to happen now we\u2019re super pleased with the results that have been are, it\u2019s early I mean, we started rebranding the marketing, really in Q4. But as you saw with our Q1 numbers, 13%, top line revenue growth compared to \u2013 we\u2019re starting to see some momentum there. Now, we are already mentioned earlier that with some supply chain constraints. We\u2019re not going to be off to the races, because we have to be, if we do add customers, we need product and hardware to be able to install. So although we\u2019re a great year passed out, and we take the numbers and projections we have are strong, the cash flow dynamics of the business, the attrition numbers, our net operating margins, our net SAC are all super strong and improving year-over-year. So, we\u2019re really excited about how the company is positioned. And, what the future looks like for this. Jeff Kessler : This includes an increased investment in SAC? Dale Gerard : What? Can you maybe expand? What do you mean? Jeff Kessler : You talked about new tools for onboarding customers and getting customers trained and things like that? Dale Gerard : Yes, I mean, it\u2019s really within our area of information technology for that area, which we do allocate out the SAC, from that SAC some of that service. So yes, there\u2019ll be some of that there. And then some of the brands then that\u2019s directly contributed to the media that we\u2019re doing is actually being [indiscernible]. But, it\u2019s part of like, as we said earlier, when we did the fourth quarter call and talked about kind of what we expect 2021 said, hey, we\u2019re going to make investments in really three areas of Todd just talked about, you\u2019re going to see those really, you\u2019ll start seeing the impact of those in Q2. In terms of where we\u2019re kind of really starting to get some of the spend in terms of brand is, as we kind of rolled out the summer sales force. And then as we\u2019ve hired up for some of the stuff we need to do in technology, and product development, you\u2019ll start seeing that kind of come through Q2, Q3. Jeff Kessler : Okay. Same question actually is on attrition. And going through the various components of attrition obviously, percentage of customers coming to term on their contracts is obviously an important one mover it is an important one, people who can\u2019t pay were isn\u2019t important when people don\u2019t like your sit or whatever. It\u2019s always someone important; these are all move around depending on the times we\u2019re living in, and the ability to reaffirm to create a better value proposition for your customers. What is going on, when attrition because clearly, you even say that your sweet spot is probably going to be somewhere in the 12% or maybe the high 11% to 12% or 13% to come. In the past, you seem to may be under estimated how far attrition can go up. But now you seem to be under estimating how far attrition can come down? Todd Pedersen : Yes, well, so here\u2019s a couple of things. We \u2013 that we are fully integrated platform, end-to-end solution. We continue to make improvements in the hardware, the installation process, the firmware; we\u2019ve got this incredible feedback loop that we\u2019ve talked about. So, we continue to make improvements and enhancements from that perspective. If these products work and we have 14 or 15 devices on average per home, if they work consistently and the use case are relevant to consumers, they keep the product now there are obviously circumstances where people lose their jobs or have financial changes in their lives that they calls some of these people to cancel. We hope think people it\u2019s not because people don\u2019t like our system, but maybe that happens occasionally. But the other is, if you\u2019ve noticed in the last year, we\u2019ve made them great enhancements to the underwriting the reduction in RICs to the platform is going to have continued impact on efficient overtime. And again enhancements in every little detail of what we do, to deliver service to consumers is going to impact. So, we\u2019re not we\u2019re hopeful we\u2019re not trying to be pessimistic, we continue to see potential gains in that from that side. That\u2019s pretty, for a consumer facing business on a 1% monthly attrition is pretty incredible. And then you add to that our net subscriber costs come down substantially. And our net service costs $10.77 this is a really good story. And real good build up from what we\u2019ve been trying to accomplish in the last couple of years. Jeff Kessler : So that\u2019s the sweet spot, are you are you changing your view of what maybe your long-term sweet spot range should be for LTM attrition? Dale Gerard : No, Jeff at this point, Jeff, no. I think what we\u2019re taught, like Todd said, I think as we get more time in here, and we continue to see how attrition performs, we may picked up, but at this point, I think we\u2019re going to stay where [Technical Difficulty] Todd Pedersen : I would say that we\u2019re super pleased with all of the, all of the results are great, but the $10.77 per subscriber and net servicing costs, that means people are \u2013 our systems are working, we\u2019re not having to roll trucks and fix things as often as we used to work, replace hardware. So again, the better and more reliable the system is, and the more elegant, in fact, the more robust the system is, the more we see attrition coming down over time. So, we\u2019re not done from an aspiration perspective. But we think we\u2019re feeling confident about what we\u2019ve injected to the market for the year. And hope to make gains over that if possible. Jeff Kessler : Great, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Todd Pedersen : Thanks again, Jeff. Good luck in retirement. Jeff Kessler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] on behalf of Rod. Nice job on the results. Could you expand on the difference between the installment line versus line of credit and how it\u2019s better for customers? And you also mentioned some impacts to tax to cash flow. So, could you give us some color on that? Todd Pedersen : Okay. So the line of credit in the \u2013 that what we have as soon as, and what we\u2019ve been putting us this is kind of a fixed term installment loan. And so but that means once the customer finance, what the finance at the initial point of the sale, that was fixed, and if the customer called back, six months later said, hey, I really \u2013 I only bought two cameras, I wish I would bought a third camera, so I can put her out on my back porch, we weren\u2019t able to actually add that to the finance. The line of credit, it\u2019s more like a credit card, the way to think about it. And so that will allow us to actually go back and add to that system and make instead of have to come out of pocket that point for that camera, and the install, they can add that to the line of credit. So that\u2019s the really the big difference. It just allows us that the customer and allows us as the companies to be able to offer that product to them, and the customer then to be able to finance that going forward, as they want new or additional products installed in their homes. In terms of the cash, the way \u2013 the way the installment loan product has worked, we paid the kind of the MDR fee in the last year overtime. And so every month, if there were \u2013 the MDR fee was paid every month and losses were paid as occurred up into the loss based on the loss arrangements that we have the caps that we had in place. The way it will move the line of credit will move eventually, as we transition through the next kind of 24 months, it\u2019ll move to that\u2019ll be like a more standard where we\u2019ll pay that the MDR fee and then the expected losses upfront, and so it\u2019d be a net. So very, very similar to how our program works with Fortiva or other financing partner. Unidentified Analyst : Super helpful. I also wanted to ask about direct-to-home. So the subscriber growth sequentially is a bit weaker than historical trends. And I understand they\u2019re still operating in a COVID environment. But could you talk about how that \u2013 why that is and expand the line on that? Todd Pedersen : Yes, look, we\u2019re basically saying that we believe that will operate in the normal way from a deployment perspective. We\u2019ve deployed the majority of our direct-to-home sales people across the country, they\u2019re still \u2013 some number of them, they\u2019re still coming \u2013 going out to market. We\u2019re having, we are obviously respectful of this social distancing still at this point, even though that is changing somewhat with vaccinations and a percentage of people are being vaccinated across the country, and based on CDC guidelines and suggestions. But it feels like, it will be back to more of a normal type year for the summer selling season, which we\u2019re excited about. Now, we\u2019ve made adjustments that be based on COVID maybe accelerated some of the adjustments on how we underwrite and do approvals for consumer events, we used to do it on our devices. We have salespeople who travel around with an iPad. Now, it\u2019s done on the consumers\u2019 device. So, we can maintain the social distancing, even in the future. The second thing that it really does for us is from a compliance perspective, it really tightens things up. So, this is a net positive all the way around. We\u2019re, again, trying to be respectful of COVID-19, and making sure that we\u2019re not spreading anything, we still checking people\u2019s health on a daily basis in market, wearing the appropriate masks and gloves and that sort of thing. But then, from an underwriting and compliance perspective, with the adjustments, it\u2019s going to be a net positive for the company. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, Todd. And last question from me, could you give us an update on the insurance business? Todd Pedersen : Yes, so we\u2019re still \u2013 I would say we\u2019re still in test mode. We believe, we have great upside potential with that business. And again, this is the great thing about owning our platform and the data that we have. If you think about it super, it\u2019s hyper local data inside of the home based on consumer actions and interactions with the system. So usage patterns, we have all of that collected inside of our data that we collect on a daily basis. We\u2019re not quite ready to start announcing volume or future projections, but we\u2019re trying to make sure that we have everything from a compliance perspective from a financial perspective and underwriting perspective dialed in before we will expand that business out with. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thanks, [indiscernible]. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Erik Woodring : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the quarter, and again, congrats on the attrition rate, really impressive stuff. I guess I wanted to ask an earlier question, perhaps a different way. And that was, would you say that through the end of the March quarter, there was still a bit of what I\u2019d call COVID complacency, driving that metric, meaning, I know you had less than 10% of your base reached the end of term in 1Q, but are people perhaps putting a decision to reevaluate their smart home provider on hold for now, given the environment? Just curious you take on that? And then I will follow up. Thanks. Todd Pedersen : Yes, I mean, look, that could be true with some of the consumers. And then the other side of that is, the better underwriting our systems are working and operating better as we continue to make improvements, like I mentioned earlier on firmware, software, new hardware releases, installation protocols, just every little thing that we do. We\u2019ve been through different types of downturns and issues in the past. And this kind of is proving out again, the fact that what we deliver to people, which is peace of mind in different ways for different people, based on their situation in their living environment, that this is something that people see value in, and we continue to try to push those boundaries and make sure that we\u2019re more and more relevant from a consumer perspective every day. Erik Woodring : Okay, that\u2019s super helpful. And then I guess my second question, selling expenses were up more than 100% year-over-year, smart home subscribers were up 20%. What drove that growth in selling expenses? Should we interpret that as meaning it\u2019s getting more expensive to acquire new customers? And then how do I kind of tie that with Net SAC that obviously continues to reach very impressive new lows? Thanks. Todd Pedersen : Yes. So a couple things last year in the first quarter, if you recall, we shut down kind of direct-to-home. So, part of your year-over-year is the fact that the last, I don\u2019t know the last two or three weeks of the first quarter, there was no spend, when I say no spend, we kind of said don\u2019t spend any more money on recruiting, training, anything so that\u2019s a big variance or a variance to kind of year-over-year in terms of that. And then you have some of that brand spin, also, as I said, we\u2019re pushing some of the brand spin, that\u2019s media directly tied to commercials and so forth into SAC also. So, I mean, we\u2019re in terms of terms of our gross cost, or net gross cost of SAC, it\u2019s in line with where we have been. And again, we keep driving down the Net, because we\u2019re charging more for, sorry, we\u2019re selling more product. So the upfront, basically, the number of cameras, number of devices we\u2019re selling is higher. I think the other thing to say as a call, because I actually look at selling expense or SAC excluding stock based comp. So, when you \u2013 so stock based comp was a big driver in that in terms of the legacy equity that we had that came through in the first quarter that also got expense, plus the new grants that are there. So, that\u2019s kind of a double kind of whammy there in terms of that expense. But if you looked at I think it\u2019s 11%. I think without that stock based comp charge; you\u2019re only up about 11%, around $5 million year-over-year. Erik Woodring : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And then I guess if I can squeeze on the last one. I remember you guys kind of previously guiding to long-term adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-40%. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but is that still how we should think about the long-term? And I say that compared to obviously your current guidance, which would imply you\u2019re kind of already there? And that\u2019s it for me. Thanks again and congrats, again. Dale Gerard : Yes, I think, again, a lot of things we\u2019re seeing improvement across the board, right, we\u2019re seeing better servicing costs, and as we can continue to drive down service costs, but while still providing really of such exceptional service for our customers, again, moderate \u2013 being able to leverage G&A in terms of what we\u2019re spending there. I think overall, we still think kind of in a mid-40s, whether that\u2019s 45% to 47%, is really kind of where we see margin that. For the near-term, I think, as we continue to invest in the business and make decisions that we think will help the business long-term being more successful in terms of products, technology, brand, as Todd has mentioned, so that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re shooting for today. Erik Woodring : Okay, thanks, guys. Dale Gerard : Thank you, Erik. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Marlane Pereiro from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Marlane Pereiro : Great, thank you for taking my questions. I just have two very quick one. One, can you share any thoughts on addressing the capital structure? And two and I apologize if I missed this, but for attrition, how do you think about a normalized level or kind of a steady state for the business? Thank you. Dale Gerard : Sure. I take it through. Our backwards attrition, I think we\u2019ve kind of said, we think 12% to 13%. If I had the group attrition, I\u2019d say attrition somewhere in the high 11%. That\u2019s probably low 13%. So, maybe its 12% to 12.5% is kind of where we think at this point. Again, as Todd said, as we continue to provide a better service, better value to our customer, that they really \u2013 they look at this and say, hey, I need this everyday as part of my life. I mean our interactions that we saw pre-COVID, during COVID, and post-COVID continuing to increase in terms of how many times people are interacting with their system via their app. And so that tells us that and I think one of the things that we actually found in our quarter is that those interactions went up. And I think, part of that\u2019s the being able to answer the door, get your deliveries without touchless deliveries, not have to talk to the person, but you can talk them through your video camera, your doorbell camera, those types of things. So, even when people go back to the office, which, I think people will at some point, they\u2019ve got these uses probably used cases that they\u2019ve discovered why they were at home, that actually it will be beneficial. And so we kind of \u2013 again, attrition, we\u2019re happy where it is. And the thing, I think it\u2019s important about attritional service, as somebody mentioned earlier, we\u2019re less than 10% of our portfolio is at the end of their initial term is that goes up that have the drop \u2013 that has an impact that will lift attrition, automatically, even though attrition is not really performing worse, is just as you the percent of customers at the end of term, you always see a little bit of a higher percentage of attrition related to those customers. If we can drive that down, then we can lower that long-term attrition number. In terms of the cap structure, I think Todd said, we\u2019ll be looking to address that, I think sooner than later, as we you know, want to go ahead and take care, I think we\u2019ve got some 2022s, 2023s for sure that we\u2019d like to take care of the maturities and extend those. And so I think you\u2019ll see us look to be out in the market at some point in the near future. Marlane Pereiro : Great. Thank you, Dale. Dale Gerard : Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll now like to hand it over to Mr. Todd Pedersen, for any closing remarks. Todd Pedersen : We appreciate everyone getting on the call with us today. And again, we\u2019re looking back at this past quarter, which was a build up in the past couple of years, a plan set in place. We\u2019re excited to see the acceleration in top-line revenue growth improvement in LTM attrition, net subscriber acquisition costs, servicing costs everything with the business is performing incredibly well. We\u2019re excited about the future of the business. And look forward to getting on the phone call with you guys again in the next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Ray. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcasts.  Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law.  In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. Just a few weeks ago, we hosted our comprehensive Investor Day. Since then, we have had the opportunity to speak with many of you in detail about our strategic plan, which will position us as the leading energy consumer services company and create tremendous stakeholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results.  Turning to Slide 3. I would like to start with the 3 key messages for today's call. Our integrated platform delivered strong results during the second quarter, up 14% compared to the same period last year. And today, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges.  Next, following Winter Storm Uri, the Governor and Texas legislature acted swiftly to begin to address critical issues and improve grid reliability. The Public Utility and Railroad Commissions are now in the process of implementing these directives to strengthen both the electric and natural gas systems to improve reliability and protect customers. I want to thank the Governor and the Texas legislature for their leadership on these issues.  Finally, in June, we held our Investor Day focused on our long-term strategic outlook, our road map through 2025 and the compelling value proposition of our consumer platform.  Now moving to the financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 4, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. We again delivered top decile safety performance. This is the ninth straight quarter we have achieved top decile safety, an incredible accomplishment for the entire company. As we start to come back to the office, we will continue to adhere to the CDC guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of our people.  During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives with focus on integrating Direct Energy, advancing our capital-light decarbonization efforts and expanding our secondary product capabilities.  Starting with the Direct Energy integration. Through the second quarter, we achieved $89 million in synergies or 2/3 of our 2021 target. Today, we're reaffirming both, the 2021 and full plan targets. Next, we continue to perfect our customer-centric model through advancing noncore asset sales and retirements and expanding our renewable PPA strategy across all of our markets.  Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We are reporting $656 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter or 14% growth year-on-year and $1.223 billion or 33% growth year-to-date. Strong second quarter results were largely driven by the Direct Energy acquisition and favorable weather in the East, further demonstrating the value of our diversified platform of consumer services. Alberto will discuss in more detail the quarterly drivers in his section. Turning to Slide 5 for a brief update on our core markets, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. Following Winter Storm Uri in February, it was clear that market reforms were necessary to improve grid resilience. In the months following the event, we actively engaged in discussions with legislators, regulators and other market participants to introduce comprehensive and competitive solutions across the entire system to address areas that failed and to ensure an event like this does not happen again. The Texas legislature acted swiftly in addressing these issues, passing Senate Bills 2 and 3, which were signed into law by the Governor on June 8, focused on reliability from the wellhead to the lightbulb. Importantly, Senate Bill 3 provides the Public Utility Commission, Railroad Commission and other parties the tools and the need to get it done right. The PUCT and ERCOT are now working to implement the power market portions of the reform. We are focused on supporting them in the implementation of these policies and procedures to ensure the market functions properly in the future. We expect the focus over coming months to be on improving price formation through mechanisms to incentivize reliability. It will also establish clear winterization and maintenance outage standards and protocols for the electric system.  Importantly, the PUCT is focused on customer bills and ensuring these actions do not materially impact affordability, which has been a compelling attribute of living and doing business in Texas. We believe that PUCT will be able to address the key issues of market design, system hardening and modernization this year for the power sector.  Next, moving to the bottom left-hand side of the slide. The Governor and legislature recognized the financial harm of socializing the cost of defaults by regulated entities like Brazos and Rayburn across competitive markets. The legislation also addresses unhedgeable costs due to ERCOT's management of the grid, particularly during the final 32 hours of the event. The Texas legislature passed and the Governor signed into law necessary securitizations to address both default allocations and uplift charges. We expect to have greater line of sight on our costs eligible for securitization later this year.  Finally, our expected net financial impact from Winter Storm Uri remains unchanged at $500 million to $700 million. From last quarter, our gross impact increased by $85 million primarily due to resettlements and bad debt, which we expect to be fully offset through our mitigation strategy.  Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for an update on our ongoing portfolio and real estate optimization efforts. First, during the quarter, PJM held its first capacity auction in roughly 3 years, which provided disappointing results. Subsequently, given market conditions, we announced our intention to retire 1.6 gigawatts or 55% of our PJM coal generation by 2022 and the strategic review of our remaining PJM portfolio.  Next, our previously announced 4.8-gigawatt asset sale remains on track to close in the fourth quarter. Finally, our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress.  On the next two slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Investor Day, beginning on Slide 6 with our strategy and platform. This was our first Investor Day since 2018. And in 3 short years, we underwent a significant transformation : doubling the number of customers we serve, optimizing our generation fleet to serve our customers, building an efficient operating platform and strengthening our balance sheet while returning significant excess cash to our shareholders.  The acquisition of Direct Energy in January marked the next step in our journey as we completed the 3-year transformation plan and began our decisive transition into a consumer services company. While historically, our core product has been electricity, the addition of Direct Energy brought scale to our retail natural gas and services businesses. With consumers increasingly seeking a trusted partner to provide home solutions, our advantaged consumer platform is uniquely positioned to meet our customer needs in ways other providers cannot match. Just yesterday, Green Mountain Energy filed an application to provide its 100 renewable electric product in Arizona. We're constantly on the lookout for new markets and to grow our service offering in existing ones.  As we offer adjacent products and services, we can leverage our existing platform to access cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, result in a better experience for our customers. For NRG, this advantage means broader insights into how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core product. And then the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business.  As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we have provided you a road map of our strategic priorities through 2025. Over the near term, our focus is on optimizing our core, which includes integrating Direct Energy, decarbonizing our retail supply and expanding our current dual-fuel customer base. Next, beginning in 2022, our focus will shift to growing the core through residential power and home services. Finally, throughout this entire period, we will be returning significant capital to shareholders. To summarize our road map, we're starting with our foundation as a best-in-class integrated energy retailer. We will leverage our operating platform to become a trusted partner for power services, and then we will broaden our offerings and partnerships to become a provider of select home services.  Finally, we have quantified for you what I believe is an achievable growth opportunity over the course of this strategic road map. In total, we have identified $720 million of incremental EBITDA growth opportunity, which will be achieved through the Direct Energy integration and the deployment of up to $2 billion of growth investments in both CapEx and OpEx opportunities. This capital will be deployed to the maximum return opportunity, and you can expect transparency as we begin to allocate investment dollars. Given our near-term focus on integrating Direct Energy and growing dual-fuel customers, you should expect this capital to be weighted towards the second half of our road map.  Now turning to Slide 7. Over the course of our strategic road map, we expect to generate $8 billion in cumulative excess cash, which also excludes roughly $0.5 billion dollars of excess cash still to be allocated this year. Applying our 50-50 capital allocation framework, resulting $4 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and $4 billion for opportunistic growth, we have earmarked $2 billion to achieve the $520 million incremental EBITDA detailed on the prior slide. The remaining $2 billion is available to be allocated to the maximum return opportunity, whether it be growth investments or share repurchases. In summary, we outlined a compelling value proposition, anchored by a portfolio of favor brands serving nearly 6 million customers. We are positioned to grow and leverage our existing operating platform to achieve higher margins and longer-tenure customers. We have the financial flexibility to invest capital at attractive returns while returning significant capital to shareholders. And we have the right people and the right platform to create sustainable value for all stakeholders.  So with that, I want to welcome Alberto Fornaro to the call and provide a brief introduction. Alberto joined NRG on June 1, following an extensive CFO search. Alberto is a seasoned finance expert who brings over 30 years of experience and a unique combination of consumer, technology, manufacturing and risk management experience. I believe Alberto's expertise is the ideal feed to enhance our transition into a consumer services company.  Alberto, welcome, and I will turn it over to you for the financial review. Alberto Fornaro : Thank you, Mauricio, for your kind words, and good morning, everyone. I am excited to be with you this morning and to join NRG during its transformation to become a consumer services company.  Now more than ever, customer experience and engagement are key priorities for leading companies, and I feel fortunate to be part of an organization that is completely focusing on the customer to continue to grow. I look forward to the dialogue with our analysts and investment community over the months to come. Hopefully, we will be able to meet in person sometime in the near future.  Moving to the quarterly results, I will now turn to Slide 9 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $656 million in adjusted EBITDA or $82 million higher than the second quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and the related addition of synergies achieved in Q2.  Specifically, by region, these benefited from the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. In addition, favorable weather resulted in outperformance by both our electric and natural gas businesses. Finally, we enjoyed favorable intra-year timing of demand response revenues. Next, our Texas region partially offset these benefits due to lower residential demand driven by milder weather and return-to-work trends as well as to higher retail supply costs. As a reminder, we benefited last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the start of the COVID-driven economic shutdown.  On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability was even more significant. It demonstrates the value of our diversified consumer services platform and its ability to absorb the possible impact of headwinds, such as the current forced outage we are dealing with at Limestone Unit 1, which will extend until year-end.  Our expectation for the net impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $500 million to $700 million with an $85 million increase in onetime costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expected mitigants. This is primarily due to the positive development of the Texas securitization legislation during the quarter. The total negative cash impact is still expected to be $350 million to $550 million in 2021 and $150 million in 2022 due to the estimated bill credits on to large commercial and industrial customers.  Now turning to Direct Energy integration. We are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. We are on track to achieve $135 million of synergies for 2021 with $89 million realized year-to-date. Synergy expectations as well as synergies achieved so far are fully embedded, respectively, in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals.  Overall, we are off to a great start in the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.44 billion to $1.64 billion for free cash flow before growth.  I will now turn to Slide 10 where we are updating our planned 2021 capital allocation. As in the past, our practice on this slide is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left, on the third column, the net capital required for the Direct Energy acquisition was increased by $35 million based on the latest estimate of the post-closing working capital adjustments. We anticipate finalizing the working capital adjustments during the third quarter.  Moving to the next column, and as discussed on the previous slide, the midpoint for net estimated cash impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $450 million. This includes the increase of $85 million for onetime costs in 2021 and similar increase in expected mitigants driven primarily by the latest Texas legislation. As you are aware, the much anticipated securitization bills, HB4492 and SB1580, have been approved and are being finalized by ERCOT and PUCT. Clarity about the expected completion should come later this year. Moving to the next column. To achieve a 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, we expect to deleverage by $255 million plus early reduction fee of $9 million, totaling $2,264 million of capital to be allocated. This leaves $461 million of remaining capital available for allocation. A large portion of this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of the ERCOT securitization processes.  Finally, as a reminder, today, the capital allocation waterfall does not include the impact from our pending 4.8-gigawatt asset sale, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Net cash proceeds will be utilized partly for debt reduction, $500 million to maintain leverage neutrality and the remaining $100 million to $150 million after purchase price adjustments to be available for general capital allocation.  Finally, on Slide 11. After reducing our corporate debt balance for the expected 2021 debt reimbursement and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of the adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio of 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA.  As discussed during the Investor Day, given our growth profile, we have revised our time line to achieve investment-grade metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We plan on achieving a stronger 3.0 ratio by year-end to 2021 and growing into our longer-term targets of 2.5 to 2.75 ratio by 2023 primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and to achieve credit metrics aligned with an investment-grade rating. We are very comfortable in achieving our target and are continuing to maintain a constructive dialogue with the rating agencies.  Back to you, Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Alberto. Turning to Slide 13, I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation. During the quarter, we made significant progress on our priorities : integrating Direct Energy, perfecting and growing our platform and executing disciplined capital allocation. NRG has never been stronger. We have the stability and financial flexibility to thrive and take advantage of opportunities through all market cycles. At our Investor Day, we outlined for you the tremendous opportunity to deliver value for shareholders, and I have never been more excited about the future of this company. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. So with that, Ray, we'll open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just in brief, if you can comment on the nuclear -- federal nuclear efforts, perhaps the best way to define, you can comment on that just in brief, and what that might mean for your specific opportunities here, if you don't mind. Mauricio Gutierrez : I'm sorry, Julien, you were breaking up a little bit. Are you talking about the nuclear PTC? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Exactly. Indeed. And what that might be at the federal level for your asset. Mauricio Gutierrez : Right. Well, I mean the -- so first, let me just say that in terms of regional or market-specific, out-of-market subsidies, whether it's for nuclear or any other technology, we'd rather see competitive incentives in our respective markets. Now having said that, if there is a national PTC, obviously, that changes our perspective. We will look at participating that through our South Texas project facility down in Texas. And obviously, that has a positive impact on our -- on that particular asset.  So that's how I would think about the national PTC, but I need to highlight the national aspect of it. I mean I think if it's just regional, it creates a lot of dynamics, intra markets that are not necessarily in the best interest of competitive markets. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Indeed. Just wanted to get your perspective on that. And if you don't mind, perhaps a bigger-picture question here. Can you comment on the commodity backdrop here? I mean I just -- there's been a lot of movement in the various forward curve. Obviously, your position is not always obvious from a net short or net loan perspective, depending on the specific market. Can you comment a little bit on the overall position today as you think about the later dated years and just how that positions you against the target you articulated earlier? Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure, Julien. I mean as I tried to highlight in the past, our integrated platform really has reduced exposure to the underlying commodity prices. Whether it is increasing in natural gas, which we have seen or increasing in power prices, this tends to affect all market participants, all retail providers. So to some extent, all these increasing commodity prices can be passed through to customers. It's not that it's just affecting us or affecting somebody else. I will say that given the addition of the natural gas business with the acquisition of Direct Energy, that actually has been very complementary, and it highlights the strength of the diversified portfolio. I mean in the East, if you look at it, it's actually even more noticeable. If gas prices are increasing, perhaps that has some impact on -- in the near term on our power business, but it has actually a benefit on our natural gas business, which is incredibly sizable. So that's why I think investors need to think about our business is somewhat insulated from increases in commodity prices.  Now I don't know, Chris, if you have any comments around just the direction of the price move and what to expect as I think I already addressed the impact on our portfolio. Christopher Moser : Yes. The only thing I would add is, I mean, look, gas has been strong because there's a lot of increased demand out there, right? LNG is going crazy overseas with Europe on bid against Asia, that's driving things up. I think that the U.S. just recently became the largest exporter of LNG in the world, passing Australia, which is a hell of a thing. I haven't seen that before. Storage is low right now.  So yes, we're in a bit of an upcycle right here. But like Mauricio said, it's something that we can price in, right? So if we're pricing to our customers off of the curves that we see and we're covering it off of the curves as they happen or off of our generation, we're in a good spot where we tack on the margin, move on our merry way.  So I think Mauricio is right. The integrated platform is a great way to play this, whether it's an upcycle or downcycle. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And just the last quick clarification, if you don't mind. Are you confident with respect to the transition? I know we're still early right after your Analyst Day here. But just with respect to some of the early indications on a strategic pivot on the retail side, any level of comments you can offer? I know it's -- forgetting that as a little bit early here. Mauricio Gutierrez : Okay. Julien, I want to understand your question. I mean any confidence on our people to... Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just early planning as you think about executing against the full $700 million uplift. Mauricio Gutierrez : Okay. Got it. So I mean we are very confident on that. And actually, we have already started a number of initiatives both on power services and home services. But as I said, I mean our #1 priority right now, and I want to be unequivocal about it, is integrating Direct Energy and achieving the $300 million of synergies. That's the least path resistance to value, and we're focused on that. Then we're going to look at the low-hanging fruit opportunities like optimizing our dual-fuel customers. We have good visibility on them. We want our power customers to buy natural gas, and we want our natural gas customers to buy power. So the cost of acquisition is actually pretty compelling.  And then -- and I think that would be the focus for the rest of 2021 and in 2022. You need to think about those opportunities on power and home services as we are testing and learning right now. And if we think that the opportunity is very attractive, then we will accelerate the scale up. If it's not, then we will kill it quickly.  But I expect that most of that investment will happen in the second half of our planning period towards, let's say, '23 and beyond. But we're very, very excited. We actually have a pilot program right now on home solar, which is very exciting, and we're learning a lot about what customers want. So we are waiting -- we're not waiting. We're starting these initiatives. We're very small, deploying very little capital, and -- but we're learning a whole lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. James Kennedy : It's actually James for Shar. Congrats on the results. I just had a few housekeeping questions on the quarter. Can we just unpack the February impact shifts a little bit more? It looks like the buckets moved around $85 million. On the growth side, what's the breakdown there between resettlement and bad debt? And then just on the mitigation side, is that entirely securitization recovery assumption? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So as Alberto mentioned, buckets moved a little. On a gross basis, it moved by $85 million. I mean the majority of it is just resettlements. And I would say 70%, 30% between resettlements and then 30% bad debt. So we feel very confident with the -- now with the clarity that we have around securitization that we're going to be able to offset that.  So net-net, there is no change in the impact of the -- of Winter Storm Uri. Although, as I've mentioned before, I mean things are going to move a little bit up and down. It just happened also in this quarter, but we have the upcoming 180-day settlement and -- just in a couple of weeks, and we're monitoring that. But I actually think that that's going to be very small. But nonetheless, I mean I expect things to move just a little bit, whether it's up or down. But now that we have this visibility on the securitization, it just gives me a lot of comfort to maintain the range that we have. James Kennedy : Got you. And then just on the PJM strategic review, could you provide any guidance on the time line for the balance of the fleet? Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, I mean just to take a little bit of a step back because I think it's -- context is important here. So when you look at the PJM fleet, you're really talking about the Midwest generation fleet. I mean that's the lion's share of it. And as we have quantified for you in the past, I mean that's about 5% of our earnings. So it's important just to put the context and the magnitude of that.  I think everybody has seen the auction results. They were very disappointing. That basically resulted in the announcement of 50% of our coal fleet, the retirement -- the announced retirements of 50% of our coal fleet. I think given the changes in capacity prices in PJM, it's just prudent that we do a deep dive review of the rest of the portfolio. It's ongoing at this point, and we're looking at everything in terms of reliability, if they're needed for reliability, what are the development prospects. I mean we're looking at just about everything for that -- on that strategic review. And I'll -- as we progress, I'll keep you all updated, but that's where we are. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Couple of things. First of all, the biggest investor concern about NRG is your short position in Texas, meaning the fact you don't have as much generation as you might have retail load. How do you anticipate changing your disclosures going forward to help get people comfortable with the short position, meaning whether you'll outline PPAs you have or tolling agreements or the hedging of future demand simply because -- while I doubt there's going to be another Uri, I'm not so -- I'm not a weatherman, so I can't predict it, but I kind of doubt it.  But there will be weather events, summer and winter, down the road, maybe not as violent as Uri, but they'll happen. The Grid just a couple of weeks ago was actually forecasting one in Texas. And clearly, the short exposure is the single biggest risk outstanding for NRG. So how do you plan on changing your disclosure going forward about your long or short position as a mix of contracting physical assets and other hedging? Mauricio Gutierrez : Right. Well, Michael, and let me just be clear here. NRG doesn't have a short position. When I talk about running an integrated model, every megawatt that we are selling to our customers, we're back to backing, whether it is with own generation or whether it is contracting generation in the market or just buying on the open wholesale market. So I want to be clear, Michael, because I think that is a misconception of NRG. We are not short electricity. We're not short of products that we're selling to our customers. We back-to-back them all. So that will be the first point.  The second point is, we don't have to own every single megawatt that we have. I mean that is -- we can actually achieve the same attributes of owning generation by contracting them. We have a number of renewable PPAs that we have. We contract with other counterparties. And whether it is a tolling deal or some physical transaction, we can actually bind the open market in the forwards. So I mean there is a number of things. I would say that the biggest lesson coming from Winter Storm Uri is the diversification of our supply. If I own 1 big power plant, and you will basically say, \"Okay. Well, now they're not short.\" That big -- that 1 power plant will be a single point of failure. That's what we're trying to avoid. That was the big lesson from Winter Storm Uri. So I actually feel a lot more comfortable that we have a best-in-class commercial team that is looking at sourcing those megawatts from our power plants, from other people's power plants and from the open market. That is the best strategy that we have. And if we can do it in a capital-light way that frees off our cash and maintains the strong free cash flow to EBITDA ratio that we have, the better.  So that's how I think about it, Michael. But this notion that you're describing that somehow, the biggest risk is the short position of NRG, I just don't share that same view. Michael Lapides : Right. But can I follow up on that real quick? Just -- I'm going to try and keep it simple. Do you have enough megawatt hours of your own generation or under multiyear contracts to meet expected peak demand, summer and winter? Mauricio Gutierrez : I mean every -- we do. That's what this balancing -- running a balanced portfolio is -- now I expect the commercial team when we go into the shorter term to position the -- our -- to adjust our position based on their -- sometimes based on their commodity, based on weather, based on prices. But you're talking about optimization around the edge, not necessarily a position going forward. So I mean if you're asking me, do we have enough megawatts? I would say yes. On a nameplate capacity, our portfolio is sufficient to cover just as much of the network that we sell. But that's not what we're trying to do. What we're trying to do is optimize our supply to make sure that we put the position -- we have the company positioned in the best possible way given where we think the market is. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Keith Stanley : First, on capital allocation, would you expect the $461 million of cash available from the slide to be fully allocated this year? Or is it more likely a good chunk of that gets pushed to next year just because you need the cash back from the year you offset still? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Keith, I think -- I mean I'll -- well, first of all, we allocate capital when we actually have the cash available to us. So while we have created some financial flexibility given the changes that we did on the glide path to achieve our investment-grade credit metrics, they are still underpinned by when we're going to receive the money from the Uri mitigation plan; and then secondly, from the sale of our Eastern California asset.  So those are the 2 big triggers. As soon as we have that excess cash, I am going to apply our capital allocation principles. I expect to provide all of you another update on the third quarter call, and I expect these money to start coming in towards the fourth quarter.  So as we have always done in the past, and I don't think this should be a surprise to anybody, we allocate that excess cash when we actually have the cash. And that's how I -- that's how you should think about just in terms of timing, Keith. Keith Stanley : Got it. The second question, just can you give an update? Curious how retail margins sort of ignoring the changes in power prices, if you can isolate it, just how retail margins are tracking after the shakeout from the winter storm. Are you seeing less competition in the Texas market given the volatility event? Or just any comment on trends in margins. Mauricio Gutierrez : I think margins have been relatively stable. As we -- even though the winter storm was pretty impactful, particularly on the regulated side, but also on the unregulated. Many of the retail providers have either credit sleeves or back-to-back. So we saw just a handful of people being exposed to the open market, and I think they fell through the process. But they were the minimum number of participants. I wouldn't say that there was a big number of participants that were under tremendous stress on the retail side. So margins have been relatively stable. The competition is still out there, similar to what we have seen in the past. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research. Jonathan Arnold : Can I just ask on the mitigation, the storm Uri? Did -- has any of that been realized already? Or is it all still to come? Mauricio Gutierrez : Most of it will -- is still to come. I mean as you know, the securitization process is still ongoing while they pass the law. What we expect is in August to -- we're going to have a hearing. And then in October, we need to have an order that is going to define how they're going to allocate those -- that money. So I expect that by October, we'll have even more line of sight in terms of the allocation methodology. And so that will be on the securitization.  And then on the other two, the bad debt is a continuous process. And then I think everybody knows that in the heat recall option that we had, I mean that's going to take a little bit more time given the legal route that we're taking. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Great. And then on just -- on a -- looking forward and just thinking about some of the new targets and the strategy laid out at the Analyst Day, should we anticipate that you will start to provide sort of more disclosure around sort of the granularity between different types of customers, single fuel, dual fuel, et cetera, and just some ways to start tracking your performance on that plan over time? And then if so, when do you think we might start to see some of that kind of incremental disclosure? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. No. That's an excellent point, Jonathan. And as I said to you before, we're going to be increasing our disclosures. We're actually working on it right now given the strategic update that we provided to all of you just a month ago. So I think what you should expect to see is transparency and visibility in terms of how we go from the margin that we have today to the margin that we want to have in 2025, the steps that we're taking. We're going to have conversations around the different initiatives to deploy the $2 billion of capital. We're in the test-and-learn period right now. But as we start scaling up in any of these initiatives, we will have a conversation with all of you ahead of time in terms of what the opportunity -- quantifying the opportunity, what is the capital that is required and what is the EBITDA associated to it.  So there is a lot more disclosures to come both in terms of the $2 billion of capital deployment that we expect and the opportunity that, that represents, but also the makeup of our portfolio around customers, what we're seeing around the longevity of these customers in our portfolio. Jonathan Arnold : Mauricio, do you see those as something that will be sort of part of the regular kind of quarterly cycle when you get to that or more something you'll do once a year or so or something like that? Mauricio Gutierrez : No. My goal, we'll make it part of the quarterly updates. And I think that, in earnest, will come probably towards the end of the year and start the new year with fresh financials. We're already working on it now. And I think you should expect a -- more disclosures as we go into 2022. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Angie Storozynski : I was actually about to ask a similar question about disclosures. It seems to me at least that the business has become a bit of a black box for all of us. I don't think that we really appreciate some exposure to gas margins and hence, some increased seasonality of Direct Energy, especially. So we would definitely appreciate the disclosures. And again, I did hear Mauricio's comments about the fact that you guys are not short power. So I understand that at least in the long term. But how can you reconcile the movement in forward power curves and the fact that you are relying on market-based purchases of power on your medium-term margins on the retail side? I mean I understand that you match your contracts with -- in the market purchases, but I don't think that that's -- it's possible to time it just right.  So again, directionally, explain how the move in forward curves should have impacted your retail margins. Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure, Angie. So I mean I think you need to make the distinction between customers that are on their fixed price. And the customers that are on their fixed price, we back-to-back that. So the minute we sign a customer under fixed price, we have the supply, we lock in the margin. And that is very simple. I mean we price every customer based on the forward curve. So I don't think that doesn't create any exposure.  Perhaps you're talking about the variable rates, the month-to-month, and whether or not we can buy that. But keep in mind, I mean a variable rate is exactly that. You have the ability to change the price if the underlying commodity price in the market changes. So that's why I was saying, we have the ability to pass through some of these costs. And we're not the only ones exposed to it. Every single retail energy provider, electric provider, each is exposed to these changes in power prices. So it's not like this puts us in a disadvantage. I mean it impacts the supply cost of all retail electric providers. So you would expect a similar -- a move to offset that increase. That's why I'd say, I still don't understand this concept around why some investors or some of you think that we're short power.  I mean having a variable price customer allows us to change prices. Whether it's up or down, if prices are coming down, perhaps we can move the customers' pricing down. But if prices rise, we can do the same. So in the medium term -- when you're talking about the medium term, I'm assuming you're talking about 12 to 18 months. I mean that's plenty of time to take price actions. And that's what we have done in the past. We consistently see that. So that's how I think about the exposure.  And on the fixed price, it's -- we always do it back-to-back. So I'm not concerned about fixed price customers that go multiyear, particularly for C&I customers. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then just one last follow-up on capital allocation. So I mean I'm really glad to see that you will be restarting your share buyback program. Now is that in any way implicitly stating that your investment-grade rating is sort of delayed inherently given the Uri storm? And as such, there is no point in trying to delever as quickly as possible, hence, you have some more flexibility? Because, again, I would have expected that you're going to try to go back to that, say, 2.5 to 2.75 net debt to EBITDA as quickly as possible. And clearly, buybacks are not going to help with this. Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, I mean I think what we said is, we have adjusted our life path to the 2.5 to 2.75. We haven't changed our targets of investment-grade credit metrics. We changed just the trajectory on how to get there. And that was informed by our conversations with rating agencies in the aftermath of Winter Storm Uri. So it's very consistent with the conversations that we have with rating agencies. I don't control the credit rating timing. That's not on us. That's on the rating agencies. We believe that 3x is a strong -- a very strong balance sheet, but we still are targeting 2.5 to 2.75. But given this change in glide path, it has provided some financial flexibility to -- if we have excess cash, which we anticipate to have by the end of the year, then we will allocate that through the guidance and principles that are very transparent and that we have communicated to all of you.  So that's how I expect to start allocating this excess cash, which includes share buybacks towards the end of the year when we start having some excess cash, but I mean that's going to be contingent on when do we close the asset sale and when do we start seeing the money from the Uri mitigants. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions. I will now pass the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez for closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Great. Thank you. Well, thank you for your interest in NRG and look forward to continue updating you in this exciting new opportunity and phase for NRG. Thank you, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations, to read the Safe Harbor and introduce the call. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Benjamin. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s third quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer, also on the call and available for questions; we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. I'd like to start on Slide 4 of today's presentation. Our consumer services platform performed well through this summer and delivered stable results. We are narrowing our 2021 financial guidance at the low end of the range and initiating 2022 financial guidance. Our platform is navigating the unprecedented supply chain constraints, and we are actively working to mitigate the financial impact. Finally, we continue to make progress on our five-year growth plan. In the near-term, we are focused on the Direct Energy integration, organic growth in power and gas, and expanding our customer base with dual product options. Moving to the financial and operational results for the third quarter on Slide 5. Beginning on the left-hand side of this slide, I want to start with safety. We delivered another quarter of top decile safety performance. This marks 10 straight quarters at this level of performance, a testament towards our strong safety culture. As we continue our return to the office, the safety and well-being of our employees remains our top priority. During the third quarter, we delivered $767 million of adjusted EBITDA, which brings our year-to-date results to $1.99 billion, or 19% higher than the previous year, driven primarily by the acquisition of Direct Energy. We are, however, narrowing our 2021 guidance to the lower half of the range, primarily as a result of unanticipated supply chain constraints impacting fourth quarter results. This will also impact 2022 guidance, which I will address shortly. During the quarter, we made good progress on our key strategic initiatives. First, Direct Energy integration is well ahead of pace, achieving a $144 million year-to-date, or 107% of the original full-year plan. We are increasing our 2021 target to $175 million, which reflects the early realization of synergy targets in 2021. We are maintaining the full plan target of $300 million run rate in 2023. Next, in ERCOT, the PUCT continues to advance necessary actions to improve market reliability. In October, the PUCT implemented phase 1 of the winter weatherization standards, which will be in effect for these upcoming winter. This weatherization standard adopts best practices and addresses weather-related issues that are current during yearly. We are making the necessary investments in our fleet to be in compliance and ready for winter operations. On market design, the PUCT remains focused on our comprehensive solution to improve reliability and incentivize dispatchable resources. At NRG, we support this direction and have taken a leading role in offering ideas for the PUCT's consideration. We have proposed a comprehensive solution to prioritize reliability and achieve it through competitive solutions. The PUCT also approved the final orders for securitization to ensure a healthy and competitive market. I want to commend and thank the governor, legislature, and PUCT for tirelessly working to address the issues Uri exposed and to harden the ERCOT system and protecting the integrity of the competitive markets that have benefited consumers over the years. Now, turning to Home Retail. We continue to advance our best-in-class customer experience during the quarter. Our Reliant brand was recognized with two awards during the quarter. The North American Customer Centricity Award in the Crisis Management category, and the 2021 Innovation Leader Impact Award for the Make It Solar offering, which is our renewable energy initiative that allows customers to support solar energy without installing panels. Now, moving to the right-hand side of this slide to discuss 2022. First, as we detailed during our June Investor Day, 2022 is a staging year for high-grading our business and achieving our five-year 15% to 20% free cash flow per share growth plan. In 2022, we remain focused on integrating Direct Energy and achieving the plants high-quality synergies, removing or streamlining our East generation business that continues to weigh on our valuation, given earnings and terminal value concerns that otherwise would have masked our retail growth, deploying smaller amounts of capital to prepare the platform for growth and returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. With that, we're introducing 2022 financial guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth of $1.14 to $1.44 billion. This guidance reflects our plan to fully realize our planned synergies and to streamline our East generation business. Also impacting this guidance are temporary impacts from unforeseen supply chain constraints, ancillary services charges in ERCOT, and our previously announced Limestone Unit 1 outage through April 2022. But leave no doubt. Now that we have identified these near-term headwinds, we are focused on mitigating these impacts into 2022. Finally, we are also announcing an 8% increase in our 2022 dividend in line with our stated dividend growth rate of 7% to 9%. Now, let me turn the call over to Alberto for a more detailed financial review. And after, I will discuss how we are advancing our Consumer Services five-year roadmap. Alberto? Alberto Fornaro : Thank you, Mauricio. Moving to the quarterly results, I will now turn to Slide 7 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $767 million in adjusted EBITDA, or $15 million higher than the third quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and related additional synergies achieved in Q3, partially offset by the impact of the outage at Tower Limestone Unit 1 facility and other headwinds related to the onset of supply Country constraints. Specifically by region, the East benefited by $89 million, driven by the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition and some incremental synergies and cost savings. This benefit was partially offset by reduced volume in our sale of power, as well as lower profitability through our PJM coal fleet due to supply chain constraints for chemical necessary to ran the environmental controls. Next, our Texas region decreased by $68 million due to the higher supplier cost to serve our retail load. With the outage of Limestone Unit 1, we had to purchase higher priced supply to supplement this lost generation. This increase in supply cost was partially offset by the contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. As a reminder, we benefited last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the COVID-driven economic shutdown, and a favorable mix in usage between home and business customers. The free cash flow before growth in the quarter was $395 million, a reduction of $230 million year-over-year, driven primarily by two factors, a $75 million increase in cash interest due to the $3 billion in Direct Energy financing in late 2020 and second is the movement in inventory. During Q3, 2020, we reduced inventory by $60 million, driven by seasonal trends and coal utilization. While during Q3, 2021, we built up inventories by $75 million, mostly for the seasonal needs of the gas business. This overall resulted in $135 million negative cash flow [Indiscernible]. On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability [Indiscernible] and driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy. Our expectation for the next impact for [Indiscernible] remains at $500 million to $700 million, with the $10 million increase in 1 time costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expecting mitigants now that positive developments at the Texas legislator and increase the probability of recouping some of our Uri losses. The total negative cash impact as shift this slightly as the estimated bill credits or old to large commercial and industrial customer. Have been reduced by higher billings in 2021. As a consequence, that 2021 Uri negative cash impact has increased by 85 million with their current funding movement in 2022. We expect to receive the majority of the securitization proceeds during the first quarter of 2022 with a possible first tranche later this year. Now, turning to the Direct Energy Integration, we are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. During 2021, we have identified farther areas for cost synergies and were able to realize certain synergies earlier than anticipated. Overall, we are on track to achieve $175 million of synergy for 2021 with 144 million realize the year-to-date. Synergy expectation, As well as one-time cost savings achieved so far, are fully embedded respectively in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals. As you are all familiar, supply chain constraints are affecting many industry across the country and they are affecting our operation as well. In addition to our Limestone Unit 1 outage, which has now extended to meet April 2022, constraints in the availability of coal are impacting both costs and volumes. In addition, our Midwest generation coal plants are impacted by shortfall in necessary chemicals to run the environmental controls of the fleet. Due to these constraints, we are now narrowing our guidance to the lower end of our original guidance to $2.4 to $2.5 billion. We are currently near the bottom of this range, but we are working intensively to improve our results. Consequently, we also narrowed our free cash flow before growth guidance to $1.44 billion to $1.54 billion. Moving to Slide 8, we are initiating guidance for 2022 to $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion. This is a significant decrease from our current 2021 results, driven by 3 elements as laid-out on these lines. Plant [Indiscernible] of east and west power plants, and deactivation of our Midwest generation, already highlighted in the Investor Day. The reduction in the New York City capacity revenues and the impact from the transitory costs that are related to 2022. As mentioned above, the contribution from Direct Energy would increase in 2022 by $130 million driven by the anticipated increase in synergies. We have already realized more synergy benefits in 2021, accelerating some action. And Therefore, we believe that we can achieve our target for 2022 of $225 million. Next, we anticipated the sale of our east and west assets to close next month for a net of $620 million in sales proceeds, reducing EBITDA by $100 million going forward. With a retirement of our core assets in the east, in mid-2022, EBITDA will decreased by $90 million in the year. In addition, due to change in New York capacity market parameters, capacity prices have decreased on a more permanent basis affecting our Astoria, And after keel facilities and reducing EBITDA by further -- further $30 million. Mentionable, we are experiencing a onetime extended forced outage at our Limestone Unit 1 facility. And what we believe to be transitory supply chain constraints that are negatively impacting 2022 results and we expect to correct them in 2023. With increased power prices, the extended outage at our limestone facility is increasing our supply cost by $50 million to April 2022 [Indiscernible] constraints on coal and chemical deliveries and commodity price, we expect fuel and supply cost to increase by $100 million in 2022 while returning to normal levels if future year. Lastly with the change in the AdCos market, we are expecting an increase in ancillary charges that were initiated after we contracted customer and were not included in our margin price. In the future, these costs will be included in future contract prices. But during 2022, we will incur an incremental $70 million of ancillary costs. This outcome is negative to us and our management team is working tirelessly to mitigate these incremental costs as best as possible, including further one-time proceedings opportunity. Due to an increased volatility in these environments, we are also increasing the range of our guidance with expectation that we can identify enough mitigants. In 2022 to offset a portion of these costs. The deduction in any EBITDA is the primary driver for the lower free cash flow before growth. I will now turn to Slide 9 where we are updating our plan 2021 capital allocation. In the past, our practice on this large, is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue, starting from the left most column, we have updated the 2021 excess cash with the latest the free cash flow midpoint to $1.49 billion, reducing available cash by 50 million. Moving to the Winter Storm Uri and as discussed before, that midpoint for the net estimated cash impact for Winter Storm Uri remains at $600 million, but given the increased utilization of customer credit in 2021, the net cash impact after assuming mitigants has increased to $535 million in 2021, and decreased by the same amount in 2022 to only $65 million. As you're aware, the much securitization builds HB4492 and SB1580 have been approved and the regulation has been finalized by our [Indiscernible] and the PUCT. We anticipate that the main portion of the financing and release of funds will occur during the first quarter of 2022. Moving to the next column, to pursue our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We completed the delivering of $250 million. Plus early redemption fees of $64 million in Q3, totaling $319 million. Finally, we have added the anticipated sale of 4.8 gigawatt to our generation in the Easter-west regions, the net cash proceeds of $620 million will be utilized powerfully for data reduction. $500 million to maintain leverage and impact. After incremental fees of $16 million, the remaining 104 million will be available for general capital allocation. This leaves $375 million our remaining capital for allocation, and this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of securitization process. Finally, of late after reducing our corporate debt balance for 2021, debt delivering and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio slightly above 3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As discussed during Investor Day, given our growth profile, our goal is to achieve investment-grade metrics or 2.5 to 2.75 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We remain committed with strong balance Sheet, and continued to target it 2.5 to 2.75 ratio, primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy land rate earnings back to you, Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank Alberto. So turning to Slide 12, I want to provide an update on our progress executing our five-year growth roadmap. As I told you at Investor Day, two of our strategic priorities are to optimize the core and to grow the core. Optimizing the core will focus on strengthening our power and gas businesses, completing the Direct Energy Integration and continuing the decarbonization of our generation fleet. The Direct Energy transaction significantly increased our scale and materially enhance our natural gas capabilities. This created 2 near-term opportunities, increasing our number of pure natural gas customers, and expanding our dual product capabilities within our existing network of customers. Efforts in both of these areas are well underway, and we will leverage the collective experience of NRG and NRG Energy teams to execute on our growth in these targeted areas. In addition to natural gas and dual product customer growth, we will continue to invest in our core power business to extend our market-leading position in competitive retail electricity by continuing to meet the customers where they are, and to deliver the innovation that customers have come to expect from NRG, and its family of brands. The Direct Energy Integration is well on track and today, we are reiterating our full synergy plan targets. Upon closing Direct Energy, we immediately begun rationalizing offices in areas with significant employee geographic overlap and completed a number of critical system consolidations without any meaningful impact to the operations of the Company. Given that the integration is being led by the same team responsible for executing the transformation plan, we are highly confident in our ability to achieve the synergy targets that we have shared with you. Our portfolio decarbonization efforts remain ongoing. The 4.8 gigawatt asset sale to ArcLight remains on track to close by year-end with only New York PSC approval outstanding. We have 1.6 gigawatts of coal assets in PJM slated to retire in mid-2022 with the remainder of our PJM fleet under strategic review. We continue to execute on our renewable PPA strategy, having signed 2.7 gigawatts nationally, and expect to procure more renewable power through additional air-force for solar, wind, and battery storage in our core markets. Now, shifting to grow the quarter, our objectives are centered around distinct customer experiences in both Power Services and Home Services. As we work to shape these distinct customer experiences, we will break them down into discrete pieces and apply a test and learn discipline in order to refine our customer value proposition, optimal business model, and go-to-market strategy. By starting small, it allows us to stay nimble and deploy limited capital while gathering critical market intelligence to inform how we approach these new customer offerings for sustained long-term growth. 2022 will serve as a staging year where we will be focused on the test and learn environment [Indiscernible] discussed. Although this staging year will not be as growth capital intensive as the later years, it is a crucial year in which we will need to develop data back conviction in our initiatives in order to have the confidence to deploy more significant capital in 2023 and 2024. We will be sure to share more on our 2022 efforts as the year progresses. Now, as we're turning our attention to 2022 with limited cost on our capital, I want to take a moment to review our capital allocation framework and capital available for allocation. Beginning on the left hand side of this slide, we expect to have over $1.6 billion in capital available for allocation, including 375 million of on allocated cash from 2021. We will apply our capital allocation principles that are outlining the right side of this slide. Beyond sake and operational excellence, our first use of capital for allocation is to achieve and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our focus is to grow into our target metrics of 2.5 to 2.75 times by the end of 2023, resulting in the vast majority of our excess cash to be available for allocation throughout our 50% return of capital and 50% opportunistic frameworks. I look forward to providing you a comprehensive capital allocation update on our next earnings call. But these should give you a good idea of our financial flexibility. I am proud of the strength of our platform that despite near-term supply chain constraints, continues to provide our customers differentiated products and services. And for our shareholders, the financial flexibility to both execute our ambitious five-year growth, plan while returning significant cash to our investors. Now turning to Slide 14, I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation. During the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress on our strategic priorities, but we still have work to do this year. Over the remainder of the year, we expect to close on our announced asset sales and saw consequently execute on our capital allocation priorities. As we move into 2022, I am confident our platform is well-positioned to deliver strong and predictable results and create significant shareholder value. So with that, Benjamin will open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey, good morning, Julien. Alberto Fornaro : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. So just to kick things off real quickly, I understand the markets are dynamic and turbulent here. Can you just walk through a little bit more on the coal supply chain basically. And when are you expecting this to resolve itself? And more specifically, how much of this is realized versus unrealized? I just want to understand really the level of further exposure that could exist here as you think about your level of confidence in getting the supplies that you are anticipating to get, if you will? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Julien. So let me start by \u2013 we\u2019ve all seen and experienced a pretty solid increase in natural gas prices. So when natural gas prices move up, where coal-generation flexes up and that caused a stress in the coal supply chain because I mean, we have been, for the past four or five years, generating at a certain level, not only us, but the entire coal-generation industry. So when you rapidly flex up, your coal supply chain doesn't flex up as quickly as you would like it to be, whether it's the commodity, the delivery, which is rail or chemicals, which is to control the emissions. Now, when that happens, in a normal circumstance, we will use that incremental generation to serve our month-to-month customers that are on their variable pricing. Now, when we are constrained, when we cannot flex up because of the supply constraints, then we have to go-to-market and procure at higher prices, which means then we have to make a decision, how much of these higher cost we pass through our customers. Keep in mind that we are balancing here margin stability and retention. So -- and one of the objectives that we have when we see these sudden increases -- short-term sudden increases, we don't want to cause a bill shock to our customers. We want to make sure that we maintain that we pass some of the cost, but not all of the cost. Obviously in the mid and the long-term, you can pass all the costs. But in the short-term, you really want to avoid bill shocks because if you lose the customer, you're also going to spend money in acquiring back the customer. So that's why this is a very deliberate, this is a balancing act between margin and stability and retention. Now, in terms of the duration of these, I expect these to be primarily in the first-half of the year. I think this will ease off in the second half because supply chain and the coal supply chain will respond to increasing pricing levels. Now to your question around realized and unrealized, most of these right now is on realized, but - because these are month-to-month customers. So, we have some levers to mitigate the impact. I mean, the first one is, obviously, how do we optimize our coal generation? Should we be looking only at running when you have really high-margin hours and then backing down in low-margin hours? We are in constant communication and testing the market in terms of our retail pricing strategy and priorities. I mean, the other leverage, Direct Energy synergies, and we're going to continue looking at if we can expand those Direct Energy synergies. And then finally, as you mentioned, I mean, this is a very evolving story, so things can change fairly quickly, just like the entire system moved up in the back of natural gas. It can come back down to more normal levels, and therefore, this will -- these constraints will ease, and we'll be back to a more normalized, I guess, environment. So I hope that these provides you that that framework and that explanation on what we're seeing today. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent. And just to be clear about this, basically, it was more about the gas price increasing and you wanting to ramp per coal-to-gas switching, your coal gen, such that when you think about the existing commitment that you had on rail, et cetera, those remain intact here, if you will, coming into this fall season and into next year. And also, if I can throw out just the third question super quickly, can you just reaffirm here your expectations on '23? And otherwise I think I heard that already in the commentary, just want to make sure, we're crystal clear on the transient nature of these factors here, especially against your '23? Mauricio Gutierrez : Absolutely. And I think that's what \u2013 that\u2019s how we wanted to lay it out for all of you. I mean, there - we think of this as transitory, specifically for 2022, both some of these supply chain plus the outage in Limestone, I expect that to normalize in 2023 and that's why we wanted to provide you the earnings power of our platform on a \u2013 in a normalized basis \u201823 and beyond. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Okay. We'll leave it there. Thank you, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Just curious you talked about a lot of these things being kind of abnormal or one-off items. As you think about the opportunity set for investing capital, would you be willing to push out the date you get to the 2.25 to 2.75 net debt to EBITDA to use capital for either a gross initiatives that generates a really high return or to use it to repurchase equity, which may generate an equally higher or even higher return? How do you evaluate when the market gives you opportunities that may be transient in nature about the timing of wanting to do debt pay down versus the timing of other more accretive investments? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Michael, I mean, we're always have to be flexible and aware of the opportunities that we have, right? I mean, we cannot be tone-deaf to what is happening around the organization around our markets. I believe that the value proposition of NRG, it is this balance approach of maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning capital to shareholders and growing the Company now. And that we have a tremendous opportunity on growing into these customer service or consumer service opportunities that we see in the market. So we're very, very excited about that. Now, having said that, I expect 2022 to perhaps be a little bit lighter on the investing in growth as opposed to '23, '24, and '25. What that means is, the business -- our business that is generating tremendous excess cash over $1.6 billion. We're going to be using our capital allocation principles, which is going to be returning capital to shareholders and growing. But since we're going to be only deploying, I would say a smaller part in 2022, I think, you should expect our share of returning capital to be bigger than the 50% that we have indicated in the past. So that's how I would think about it. Now, we continue -- we remain committed to our 2.5 to 2.75 by 2023 and we expect what achieve that through growing our EBITDA. And we grow the EBITDA by executing on the Direct Energy synergies and now with the incremental growth EBITDA that we can generate. So that's how I would frame it. Michael, obviously, we'll remain flexible, we'll remain opportunistic and we are not going to be tone-deaf to what we -- the opportunities that we will see in the market. Michael Lapides : Got it. How do you think about for 2022 cash available for allocation? About when you would make the decisions on the other 50%. Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, I mean our plan would be to provide you a lot more clarity in the next earnings call. We would have that point. Identify what goes to growth investments and what we're going to do to return capital to shareholders. But I think -- I hope that the number that we provided you today. Gives you have a pretty good idea in terms of the magnitude of the excess cash that we have and where are we leaning and where do we see the opportunities to create value. I have said in the past, I believe that buying back our shares at discount creates value for our shareholders. Since I took over as CEO, we have bought back close to 25% of all the shares outstanding. So this is something that we're going to continue doing, is part of our value proposition, and we're going to remain opportunistic about it. Michael Lapides : Got it. And hey, last question I'll be quick here. Just curious when the Board, and we can look at the various financial metrics in the proxy that outline with the goals of the Company. But just curious when you have conversations with the Board, what tends to be most important, EBITDA growth, free cash flow per share growth, or is there another metric we should think about? Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, Michael, I will tell you. It's always free cash flow per share growth because that's what matters to our shareholders. The per-share metrics, and we've outlined a 15% to 20% free cash flow per share growth in our 5-year plan. I think that's very, very compelling. We have the excess cash to execute on that both in terms of growing the numerator and then reducing the denominator while maintaining a strong Balance Sheet. So I think this balanced approach serves us well in the long run. Perhaps in the short-term, there may be other things that people want to do but I'm looking at long term value creation for our shareholders here. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you guys. Appreciate it Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey, good morning, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza : Well, sorry to sort of beat on this a little bit, but I just want to get a bit of a stronger sense and I'm still getting questions here on it. The '22 guidance walk is the normalized '22 EBITDA before transitory cost kind of a fair run rate target, as we're thinking about future years and sort of the significant coal supply chain cost, can they be mitigate d if this isn't a short-term headwind? I mean, why assume this is transitory, especially if the gas curve has longevity? And then, the Texas ancillary service charges in bucket 2, what are those exactly again? Mauricio Gutierrez : The ancillary service was ERCOT instituted a short-term increasing ancillaries to maintain their reliable Think of the system. Chris, do you want to provide a little bit more specifically around and before I go into the before I pass it on to you, I just want to make sure that everybody understands our run rate. we actually have it on slide 8. We have normalized that to around $2.32 billion. And we say they're transitory, because the transitory supply chain is, when you're flexing off your coal generation, their supply chain takes a little time. I think about mining railroad sets that are allocated to call and chemicals. You can -- when the plant, can flex up fairly quickly. A supply chain that has been sized for the type of generation that we have experienced for the past five or six years. It doesn't flex up that quickly, so that's why I said it's going to take a little bit of time. I expect this to be in the first-half of the year. I think this is going to ease off in the second-half of the year, so that's why I refer to them as transitory. But, Chris, can you just go into detail around the ancillary service s? Christopher Moser : Yeah. Shahriar, they moved up responsive a little bit, couple of 100 megawatts. But the big change that they made in the middle of the summer last year was then moved up the non-spend requirements and that was by a factor depending on the hour and the day between 2 and three X. So that's been the bigger of the two impacts in terms of ancillary changes that they've made so far. Now, we're still waiting to see PUCT is a hard working sessions. And we've seen a memo from Chairman Lake detailing his thoughts. There is plenty of debate about, hey, what do we want to do on ancillaries going forward and certainly on the ORDC parameters too? Brattle group is coming in. They're going to study various combinations of, at what part of reserves should you start ORDC to kick in, at what slope should incline and whereas the cap, kind of a thing. There's a lot of moving pieces right now in terms of market designs that should be according to the schedule that I've seen nailed down by mid to late December. I think that they're planning on posting something around December 20, which will be their pick of ORDC changes, whether or not they have a winter fuel ancillary in there which is different than these 2 ancillaries I am talking about, what level that they want for the non-spend. And then also we've been advocating for an LSD obligation that would phase in over a couple of years. And Chairman Lake included that in his memo too so -- and there's a bunch of market design stuff that's moving that we'll be getting to here as we get to the end of the year. Mauricio Gutierrez : And now, Shahriar, just to be still to be clear. Some of these ancillary costs that preceded describing a lot of them, we pass them through already, our customers, some of them we -- like I said, we don't want to create a bill shock. So in the medium to long run, all of these ancillaries will be passed through to customers. But in the short-term, we're managing these bill shock versus stability of margin and our retention numbers, just keep that in mind. That's why I call this transitory. Shahriar Pourreza : Right. Mauricio Gutierrez : And over the medium to long run they all make it -- to pass it out. Shahriar Pourreza : And then, just lastly, you added 500 megawatts of PPAs in ERCOT last quarter. Can you maybe just unpack this a little bit? What's behind this? What are you seeing in the market right now? And more importantly, does some of these input cost pressures in specifically the renewable space, could that potentially impact your future PPA opportunities? Thanks, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, once again, I think that's in short term. We are seeing some supply chain issues in the solar, particularly in solar. We are going to be constantly in the market running RSPs to get solar wind and we are actually now looking at batteries. They continue to be very attractive from an economic standpoint. We are probably taking off our feet from the pedal just because it's -- we are aware of the supply chain, so we are slowing down a little bit on these PPAs. We want to see how these works out and then re-engage. I think that's the prudent thing to do. I'm very pleased with where we are today in terms of the PPAs that we have been able to sign and the economics that we have been able to achieve. But I also recognize that there is a transitory issue right now with supply chain that I don't want to be signing PPA's at higher costs. We've been very disciplined in terms of where we actually execute these PPAs. So my expectation is it has slowed down over the past couple of months, I think it's going to continue like that. And we're going to start picking up when we start seeing these supply chain issues ease off a little bit. Shahriar Pourreza : Great. Thanks, guys. I'll stop there. Appreciate it. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Shahriar. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Hi, good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Another [Indiscernible] in cost as gas prices which is also lifting up power prices and you don't mention that as a pressure in '22. Is that something that you feel like you're able to pass along to customers essentially or is that also kind -- because there is some lag and things and everything like how much is that additional pressure? Mauricio Gutierrez : So think about this in 2 markets now that we have a power and gas business. So let me start with the gas business perhaps because that's the newest for all of you on the -- our ownership. Our gas business, think of it as a logistics business. We don't take commodity price risk. Every time we sign a customer, we back-to-back it with natural gas. And as part of that, we get a tremendous amount of, call it assets pipeline, storage, LDC relationships. So that infrastructure gives us the ability to manage some of the volatility that exist. Alberto Fornaro : Less on the price of nymex and more on the basis. So I feel very confident that our team has the ability to manage because of that very large infrastructure network -- natural gas networks that we have. So I'm actually quite comfortable with the exposure of our higher natural gas prices on our natural gas business. And then on the power side, I think we -- I already described it, Steve, in terms of higher gas prices, you have this issue on the coal constraints, but in general, think of these almost as inflationary pressure. We can pass it through and we actually choose to pass some of that. In the long term -- in the medium to long term you pass everything. And it's going to be a balancing act between -- you don't want to Mauricio Gutierrez : cause a bill shock to our customers, at the same time you want to manage stable margins and good retention numbers, which are very, very compelling on our business. So that's how I'm thinking about it and that's why -- I mean, if it's a structurally higher gas prices, I don't have a big issue with that. I mean, the issue it always comes when gas prices move up very, very quickly. And then you have these constraints on the coal supply chain, and that's what we are addressing these here as transitory. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then just more explicitly asking, I think what others maybe were earlier. The -- obviously when you look at debt to EBITDA targets, EBITDA is lower. It affect meaningfully where you are. Just this '22 EBITDA guidance. Are you going to be targeting off of that or are you just going to say this is not normal and we're just going to ignore it? Mauricio Gutierrez : I think you need to recognize that '22 is a transition year and our commitment is achieving this in 2023, which we expect to go back to our normalized earnings. So when you're thinking about our trajectory from where we are today to how we get to 2023, you always have to take into consideration this on anticipated issue that we're seeing on the supply chain. So we remain committed for 2023. We believe that we can get to those credit metrics by growing into them now, not only Direct Energy synergies, but also additional growth EBITDA that we can execute on. And that's how I think about it. So I wouldn't read too much into the number in 2022. I think what is important is our objective in 2023. Steve Fleishman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. I wanted to start with a question about buybacks. And they need to support the stock clarity. Okay. Well, I understand that the Board usually makes those decisions in the fourth quarter. Well, I'll argue that given today's updates, an earlier decision would have been badly needed. Your peer made some unique decisions on that front. You guys -- seems like most of the money that would go to buybacks is not going to materialize anytime soon, and again, there is a need to support the stock. So would you be open to some unorthodox solutions here to again accelerate the buybacks either -- I don't know, either use revolver or something else to just support the stock now? Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, as I said Angie, the first thing is I think the value proposition of NRG has always been this balanced approach between a strong Balance Sheet, returning capital and growing. So what you're describing is basically levering up to buy back stock. And at this point that's not our focus. Our focus is on continued executing on this balanced approach. But like I said, we are generating tremendous excess cash in the next 13 months. We're going to be deploying that consistently with our target allocation principles. That already gives you an indication. I described as the floor on share buybacks because you can clearly see the $1.6 billion of excess cash. You can look at -- if that's a 50/50, then you know what the dividend number is. You can be confident that the share buybacks that gets us to the 50%, that's -- you should think of that as the floor. And then on the opportunistic deployment of the other 50%, that's what we're talking about, right? That's what we're going to be flexing off. We want to be opportunistic about it. But I also want to I want to stay true to the value proposition that we have indicated to our shareholders. We're not going to become the FNG, and we're going to evaluate all the options that are available to us. And I think our record of execution should tell you that if there is a deep discount on our shares, we will react accordingly and we have done that in the past. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then the second question. So my initial take when I read the press release, was that all of these issues that are weighing on that 2.3 to normalize EBITDA are related to generation. But really, if you listen to the discussion so far on this call, it seems like all of them are retail related. And again, I know that you're no longer differentiating between generation and retail but it seems like your pitch is an attempt to protect those retail margins when all of these charges that we're talking about should have been weighing the profitability of the retail book. And again, I understand you don't separate, but again, to me it just seems like there is a weakening of the profitability of that large retail book for various reasons, some of which you do not control. But I feel like you are attempting to make it seem like it's on the generation side when it seems like it's more on the retail side. Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, Angie, it stems from the generation side because when you actually -- if we actually, in a normal circumstance, if our coal generation was able to flex off, we always plan to use that additional megawatts to cover our month-on-month customers. We don't have it and the market indicates that we should, but because we have these constraints, we cannot flex that off. We have to buy it as replacement cost. So I wouldn't characterize it as a retail thing. I think that's the -- I'm trying to connect the two so you understand the reason why this is happening. It stems from the generation side but if I actually had a heat rate call option on gas, I wouldn't be having this conversation. We would be able to flex up those megawatts and serve our month-to-month customers. So, I just want to be careful that I actually wouldn't characterize it as a retail concern. This is basically starts with an issue on coal supply that impacts our coal-generation economics which then impacts how we were thinking about managing those month-to-month customers than your pricing every month on a continuous basis. Angie Storozynski : So just one follow-up here because I guess if the -- I don't quite understand that the hedging strategy here, because I would have thought your -- you had your retail book using economic generation at the time of the hedge. And so in light of the higher power prices they economic generation from has in coal plants has increased. You don't really have many gas plants, so there's not much of a detriment. So there should be potential excess generation from the coal plans which -- okay, it's not materializing because you don't have access to incremental coal supplies, but why would it be a drag versus the initial hedge? Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, because the month-to-month, you don't have an initial hedge on the month-to-month. You hedge against your fixed price low. And like I said, we are passing some of that cost, but not all of the cost. So on the month-to-month, because you have this desirable pricing, you have some but the extent that we have seen in terms of the increase in gas prices that impact power prices, really has put us in a position where we need to make a decision, do we want to pass through all of these at the expense of retention or not? But it all stems from the fact that we cannot flex up our coal generation because of these supply constraint issues. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Angie. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research. Jonathan Arnold : Yeah, good morning, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey Jonathan. Good morning. Jonathan Arnold : Hi. A couple of things. Could you just give us a little more on what exactly happened at Limestone, what caused the extension and how confident are you that they will come back in April. And maybe quantify that what the impact in '21 has been, or is expected to be. Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure, Jonathan, Chris? Christopher Moser : Yes, Jonathan, this is Chris. In terms of what happened at Limestone, the duct that connects the back-end controls to the stack collapsed, and so we've gone through the demolition part of that, still finalizing root cause, but very close on that. And we are well underway on the restoration plan, which is expected to be done in April 15, right in the middle of April. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Mauricio Gutierrez : It will be -- the plant will be available ahead of the summer. Jonathan Arnold : Do you have business interruption what have you insurance on that -- these assumptions? Christopher Moser : Yes, there's property damage and business interruption, but that will take a little while to work through right. But we notified them. They've been working through it with on the process as we've been going in terms of demolition and the reconstruction of it. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And then obviously, you mentioned you're confident that these pressures are going to moderate in the second half, is that what's assumed in the 100 million on Slide 8 or could that number increase if you don't see that moderation in the back half of the year? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So our number incorporates our expectation. What we're right now seeing and hearing from our railroad partners and coal suppliers So this is reflected in this number. Obviously, we're working hard to mitigate this and I already listed a few of the things that we're going to mitigate. We're going to be working harder. I'm not pleased with it and I don't want -- these are not realize, these are unrealized and as long as they're unrealized There is some opportunity to get back to normal number. And then if they, if it gets better, quicker than you can expect upside if it gets worse than we will try to mitigate things. I think we're getting ahead of it, we have a pretty good we believe in terms of how we can mitigate these for 2022. But yes, that's how I would characterize it. Jonathan Arnold : But you're not assuming mitigation currently, right? Christopher Moser : No. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And then finally, on this normalized '22 number, so we're trying to think about what that looks like. Beyond ' 22. We'd add incremental direct synergies, right? Mauricio Gutierrez : Correct. Jonathan Arnold : Which are -- could you remind me. Mauricio Gutierrez : So we have about a $110 million in 2023 in addition to 2. [Indiscernible], I think that's what we -- and obviously, this is just another lever that we're working hard. I'm very pleased to see where we are on synergies year-to-date. But we're always going to be looking at additional opportunities to make our platform more efficient. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. So 110 on top of the 2.32 that you would expect, and you're also hoping clearly exceed that? Mauricio Gutierrez : Correct. And then also keep in mind that you have the remaining of the PJM assets, which is about $40 million, a unit to the [Indiscernible] in order to complete their normalization of your exercise. Jonathan Arnold : I see that. Great. Thank you very much. Mauricio Gutierrez : All right. Great. Thanks, Jon. Operator : It is all the time we have for questions. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'll now pass it to Mauricio Gutierrez for closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Benjamin. Well, thank you, everybody, for your interest in NRG, and I look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Kevin Cole : Great. Thank you, Amy. Good morning and welcome to NRG energy's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcast. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. This is my 25th earnings call as CEO and I wanted to start with a quick look back on what we have achieved. Over the past six years, we have transformed our company from a complex industrial story into one that is much simpler and focused on our core strengths. Along the way, we have made significant progress in our strategy to get closer to the customer, optimize our generation portfolio to serve those customers, strengthen the financial health of our company and created significant shareholder value. We now turn to the next phase in our evolution of growing our business and realizing the potential around the customer. I am excited about the future and look forward to sharing our progress with all of you in the months to come. Moving on to the three key messages of today's presentation on slide four. Our business delivered results in line with the 2021 guidance, effectively navigating supply chain constraints and volatile market conditions, further validating the strength and durability of our model. Next, I am pleased to report that we have successfully executed our winter storm Uri mitigation plan and we are increasing 2022 capital available for allocation. Finally, we continue to advance our five-year strategic road map in moving closer to the customer and our commitment to being excellent stewards of shareholder capital. The 2021 financial and operational results are on slide five. Beginning with our scorecard. We executed on all our priorities. I want to thank all the employees at NRG for maintaining focus during a challenging year, which included a global pandemic, Winter Storm Uri, asset sales and the integration of Direct Energy. Importantly, we were able to operate through these conditions while setting another record for safety. This is the fourth straight year we have set a new company safety record, an incredible accomplishment worthy of recognition. Direct Energy integration remains ongoing and we are on track to achieve our run rate synergies. During the year, we outperformed our initial expectations achieving $175 million versus our original expectation of $135 million. This integration is led by the same team and supported by the same governance of the transformation plan, which gives me the utmost confidence in our ability to reach if not exceed our run rate targets. Following multiple years of rightsizing our business, 2021 marked a significant milestone in capitalizing our best-in-class consumer services platform. We added roughly 3 million customers to our portfolio and expanded the scale and scope of home power and natural gas services. Also during the year, we monetized 4.8 gigawatts of non-core fossil assets in our East and West regions. And now the retirement of 1.6 gigawatts of coal assets in the East and signed an additional 800 megawatts of renewables PPAs. Next, we continue to adhere to our disciplined capital allocation principles. In late 2021, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase program to be completed throughout 2022. We also increased our dividend per share 8% in line with our stated dividend growth rate of 7% to 9%. In June, we held our Investor Day where we revealed our five-year strategic road map to create significant stakeholder value by moving closer to the customer, while also returning significant capital to our shareholders. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for the financial results. We delivered $433 million of adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, 31% higher than the prior year. This brings our full year results to $2.42 billion of adjusted EBITDA, 21% higher than the prior year primarily driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and excluding the impact from Winter Storm Uri. Finally, we are maintaining our 2022 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance ranges. We are seeing promising results in mitigating winter supply chain constraints, and I look forward to updating you next quarter. As a result of our Winter Storm Uri mitigation plan, we are increasing our 2022 capital available for allocation by $212 million, which Alberto will discuss in more detail. Now turning to slide 6 for a brief update on the ERCOT market. Following Winter Storm Uri, it was clear that market reforms from well-head to light bulb were necessary to improve grid resilience. In the months following the event, we actively engaged in discussions with legislators, regulators and other market participants to introduce comprehensive and competitive solutions across the entire system to address areas that fail. In 2021, Texas made significant progress in hardening the electric grid through power plant and transmission weatherization standards, improved market design with changes in scarcity pricing, ancillary reforms and consumer protection improvements. In 2022, we expect Texas to expand its focus on hardening the natural gas infrastructure and implementation of phase 2 of power reforms which includes resource adequacy by establishing a load-side reserve requirement and on-site fuel security. I want to comment that Texas governor's office, legislature, PUCT and ERCOT for taking swift action and accelerating effective reforms that would normally take years and addressing them within months. While our work is not done yet, we believe Texas performance through a tough winter is a strong reflection of effective actions and policies. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for an update on the financial impact from Winter Storm Uri. I am pleased to announce that we have successfully executed our mitigation strategy. Today, we're updating the net financial impact from the storm to $380 million from our prior expected range of $500 million to $700 million. Now turning to Slide 7. It is important that we recognize our ESG principles and highlight a few of our 2021 accomplishments. We created a sustainable framework with a strong foundation based on our corporate values and our sustainability program that brings all stakeholders working together with a common purpose from our customers to our employees to our operations. Our sustainability program consistently upholds a high standard of accountability and transparency across the pillars of environmental leadership, social focus and strong governance. I want to start with an update on our environmental leadership. As you know we committed to a stringent decarbonization path in line with the 1.5-degree Celsius scenario, which has been certified by the science-based target initiative. That means reducing our carbon emissions 50% by 2025 and net zero by 2050. As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide since 2014 we have reduced our carbon emissions by 44% and we have a clear line of sight to our 2025 goal. So just to put this in perspective this is equivalent to taking 5.8 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year. In addition as advocates for the electrification of transportation, in 2021 we set a goal to electrify 100% of our light-duty vehicle fleet by 2030 further demonstrating our commitment to progress. All these efforts have resulted in the diversification of our revenue streams to cleaner solutions. Since 2014 coal generation as a percentage of revenues has decreased by 80% and now represents less than 5% of our total revenues. If you recall not long ago coal made up almost one-third of our revenues. We still have much work to do, but I am confident we are on the right track and have the right team to succeed on our goals. On the social front, our engagement with our employees, communities and customers continues to advance. As I mentioned in my opening remarks in 2021 we once again achieved top-decile employee safety performance. We also implemented employee programs to support financial, physical and mental well-being. Our diversity equity and inclusion value continues to shape our culture and inform our decision-making as we strive to unlock the power of DEI as a way to better understand our customers and the communities we serve, while also making our team stronger. In our communities, we supported more than 750 non-profit organizations through our philanthropic arm Positive Energy. We also focused our volunteer efforts on food security through virtual and in-person food donations and packaging meals for those in need. And for our customers, we are always innovating. We have been a leader in facilitating renewable energy for our residential customers, as well as providing a path for small and medium sized businesses to participate in the sustainable energy transition. And as we all know, more than ever the home is the center of our lives. So we continue to advocate for individual customers choice in the products and services that best suit their values and lifestyle, delivered with reliability and affordability. Finally, regarding our strong governance, I am particularly proud of our transparency in reporting and accountability on our goals. In just this last past year, we released our 11th annual Sustainability Report, our fifth reporting compliance with SASB standards, and 12 CDP or climate disclosure project questionnaire. We also formally issued our first TCFD or task force on climate-related financial disclosure, as a way to improve and ensure our stakeholders have the right tools to make informed decisions and track our progress. In 2021, we issued our second sustainability-linked bond. If you recall we were the first company in North America to do it back in 2020. These bonds tie our financing cost to achieving our carbon reduction goals. As you can see, our culture of sustainability is ingrained in every part of our organization and we continue to play an integral part in our transition to a consumer services company. I am looking forward to sharing more details of our ESG journey with you later this spring in our 2021 sustainability report. Now, I want to provide you an update on our growth program. As I shared with you during Investor Day, our focus over 2021 and 2022 is twofold : optimizing the core and setting the stage for growing the core. In terms of optimizing the core, we continue to remain on track to integrate Direct Energy into our business and have been successful in optimizing our generation portfolio to support our customer-facing business. We are also making solid progress on our efforts around growing the natural gas and dual-fuel customer portfolio. Let me give you a couple of specific examples for both. One, we are seeing early success in achieving our customer count by leveraging our existing and long-standing partnerships with big box retailers to sell natural gas and expand our geographic footprint. Second, we are advancing our digital experience, so customers can easily enroll in both electricity and natural gas plants. These efforts are relatively new, and I will share more details as we make progress later in the year. Now, moving on to growing the core you will remember that our plan is focused in two areas : Energy Services and Home Services. The housing picture on the left really gives you a sense of the various customer solutions that are on our growth roadmap. Some of these solutions are already operational such as power, natural gas and storage, while others such as solar and EV are in the pilot or development phase. The table on the right slide provides the status on each of these targeted customer solutions. The important key takeaway is that, we are not starting our growth program from zero. We have meaningful existing capabilities to deliver many of our targeted customer solutions and we are leveraging those capabilities as we speak. For those customer solutions that are not currently operational, we will use 2022 as a staging period for us to prudently test and learn, optimize our participation model and refine the go-to-market approach such that when we get to 2023, we will have confidence in deploying capital against that growth. Moving to Slide 9. As you can see our capital allocation track record is cycle appropriate and directly in line with our roadmap to stabilize, right-size, redefine and now enhance our company. During 2016 and 2017 our primary focus was simplifying and strengthening the balance sheet. In 2018 and 2019 with the balance sheet significantly improved, we were able to shift to returning capital to shareholders and growth. In '20 and \u201921, the Direct acquisition meant more of our capital shifted towards growth and debt reduction. Now moving to 2022. We turn our focus towards achieving our per share growth objectives and growing into our investment-grade credit metrics through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings and our growth program. And like I said earlier 2022, remains a staging year for growth which provides significant excess cash to be returned through dividends and share repurchases. I will provide you an update on the remaining unallocated cash throughout the year. So, with that I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review. Alberto Fornaro : Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 11 for a review of the full year results. We finished the year achieving our 2021 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth targets in line with guidance realizing more than $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.5 billion in free cash flow before growth. Adjusted EBITDA reflects a $419 million increase compared to 2020, primarily due to the acquisition of Direct Energy in January 2021. This is despite several unexpected headwinds including the extended forced outage at Limestone Unit 1 power plant additional planned and unplanned outages in Texas and increased ancillary charges. The results include the achievement of $175 million of Direct Energy synergies in line with the most recent expectations and in excess of the initial 2021 target set at $135 million. Free cash flow before growth was $1.512 billion -- $22 million ahead of the midpoint of 2021 guidance primarily, to lower capital expenditure. Moving to the highlights. 2021 was a productive year in moving closer to the customer. We closed on the Direct Energy acquisition and successfully started the integration. Next in December we closed the sale of 4.8 gigawatts of noncore East and West fossil generation. We also reduced our debt by $755 million and further linked our financial performance to our climate goals while reducing our interest expenses through refinancing callable debt through $1.1 billion sustainability-linked bond. Moving to the update on Winter Storm Uri impact, we have significantly improved the net impact from the storm. You may recall that at the end of Q3 our expectation for the mitigants was a range of $370 million to $570 million with a net impact of approximately $500 million to $700 million. Today we are reducing this net impact to $380 million as a result of increased mitigation of $708 million as a result of the securitization as well as effective management of customer bad debt accounted by the exposure. From a GAAP income statement perspective we fully recognize these mitigants in 2021 through a reduction in cost of goods sold. The cash impact however, was different and it is highlighted on the bottom left of Slide 11. First, you may recall that the mitigated loss includes bill credits to C&I customers and other items which are going to materialize as a cash flow in 2022. At the end of December the total amount was equal to $97 million. Second the $696 million of proceeds from the securitization while fully accrued in 2021 will be received in Q2 2022. Overall the cash impact of Uri in 2021 was therefore, equal to a net outflow of $979 million offset by a cash inflow in 2022 of $599 million. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide we are maintaining our 2022 adjusted EBITDA of $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion and free cash flow before growth of $1.14 billion to $1.44 billion guidance range. As Mauricio said in his scripted remarks, we are seeing promising results in mitigating our previously discussed winter supply chain constraints and we look forward to updating next quarter following the winter season. Since the last earnings call in December we announced and immediately began executed our $1 billion share repurchase program. We executed $120 million in repurchases to date with $39 million in December and $81 million year-to-date. The remaining program will be completed through 2022. Finally, our Direct Energy integration and synergy plan remains squarely on track. I will turn now to slide 12 for a brief update on our 2021 capital allocation. Moving left to right, our realized free cash flow before growth in 2021 is $22 million above the midpoint of the guidance. Next, we are showing our actual increase in cash of $41 million instead of the $150 million previously planned. Next, during the fourth quarter we finalized the purchase price adjustment with Centrica for the Direct Energy acquisition, resulting in a $25 million increase for the prior earnings call. Next, Winter Storm Uri as mentioned before the 2021 cash out was $979 million, while we expect to receive a net amount of $599 million in 2022 as shown in the next slide. Next, we completed another $500 million of debt reduction during the quarter bringing the full year total to $755 million using a portion of the $623 million of net proceeds received from the sale of the 4.8 gigawatt of generation asset. Lastly, as we mentioned before, $48 million were utilized for share repurchases including $39 million towards the $1 billion share repurchase program. The capital available for allocation at the end of 2021 has been, therefore, fully allocated. Turning to slide 13 and again working left to the right. The combination of the midpoint of our 2022 free cash flow guidance with the net cash expected from the proceeds of the securitization will provide us almost $1.9 billion of cash to be deployed in 2022. Moving to the right, we expect to increase the minimum cash to $650 million to approximately $339 million in dividends and completed the remaining $961 million of the share repurchase. Please note that the dividend amount is based on current share outstanding and we will provide updates on future earnings calls as we progress throughout the execution of the share repurchase program. Next in other investments column, we have committed $170 million at this point, which includes $70 million for the continued integration of Direct Energy business, $50 million for small book acquisitions, $25 million to prepare the land at Encina for an eventual sale and $25 million in other smaller projects. Lastly, we expect to have $310 million of remaining capital available for our location still to be allocated in 2022. Now turning to slide 14. We finished 2021 with a net debt to EBITDA of approximately 3.2 times after adjusting for non-cash items and removing the EBITDA from the recent asset sales. Our long-term financial strategy remains unchanged and we are committed to a strong balance sheet by continuing to target investment grade credit metrics of 2.5 to 2.75, primarily through full realization of the Direct Energy run rate synergies and growth initiatives. We will continue to provide updates on our path to investment-grade metrics as we execute these initiatives. Back to you, Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Alberto. Moving to our 2022 priorities and expectations on slide 16. First, we will always be focused on the blocking and tackling of delivering on our financial, operational and ESG commitments, while adhering to our capital allocation principles. Beyond this, we're focusing our efforts in two key areas, provide additional disclosure to help better model our business and provide greater detail around our growth strategy. First, on our disclosures. Following the Direct Energy acquisition and our move towards consumers, we're working on a comprehensive rework that will enhance your ability to model the value of the customer. In the meantime, I want to start with the new hedging methodology slide in the appendix of today's presentation, which should help shed light on our rigorous risk management and supply optimization program that helps stabilize our business. On growth, as I discussed earlier, we will be transparent in the process and I look forward to updating you on this throughout the year. Finally, while 2021 was a challenging year, today our company is stronger and more promising than ever before. I am very excited about 2022 and the significant opportunities we have to create shareholder value. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Amy, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research. Jonathan Arnold : Hi, good morning guys. Alberto Fornaro : Hey Jonathan, good morning. Jonathan Arnold : Mauricio, thank you for the mention on the new disclosures that you just made. I'm just curious, if you can give us some sort of gauge of when we might expect to see those? Is that kind of midyear, next quarter or later in the year just some framework there? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. No, Jonathan. So, I hope that you find useful the new hedging disclosures. And obviously Kevin will be available if you have any questions since this is a new information. With respect to the disclosures to help better model the value of the customer, my expectation is that, it will be done sometime either later in the year or beginning of next year. We are working hard to ensure that key performance indicators are aligned with our financial disclosures and we want to make sure that they are useful as opposed to rushing and giving you something midyear that you have to reconcile before and after. So, these type of changes I appreciate, they're always better at the end of the year. So you start with fresh slate. So I would -- that's -- I would think that it would be -- we're going to try to time it, when we are ready, when we believe is -- are going to be very useful. And when we don't make you do a lot of work in reconciling before and after. So I hope that this provides you some idea when we're planning to move. Jonathan Arnold : Yes. No very helpful. Thank you, Mauricio. And then, on the -- one thing I noticed was that you're now talking about growing into the credit metrics. I think before you'd said you anticipated being there by the end of 2023. So, is that a change or just me overreading the slide. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, I mean our commitment continues to be up 2.5 to 2.75. Obviously, we need to stay flexible. As you can appreciate there is a lot of things moving around this year. I mean it's a -- it continues to be a transition year because of the growth program that we have, the optimization that we have. So, our goal is to grow into the metrics. But obviously we will -- we have to remain flexible in this environment. And just Jonathan before I forget I wanted to make sure the additional hedging disclosures are available now and they're in the appendix of the presentation okay just to make sure that that's crystal clear. Jonathan Arnold : Actually I had seen those and I was -- maybe I'll just ask a quick one on those while I have you. You're obviously giving a look that shows that you're I guess 15% over-hedged effectively or covered. I don't know how you would best describe it in ACA. Can you give us a little bit of an insight into how does that look by season? Is that sort of skewed winter versus summer? Just anything beyond just that kind of annual look. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes Jonathan. So, obviously, we feel comfortable providing the yearly disclosures. Why don't you start getting into the seasons, it is competitive-sensitive and in conversations with our commercial team, we wanted to make sure that we just provided this level of granularity to make sure that we don't compromise our commercial activities. So, I think that the two big takeaways from my perspective on the hedging slide is number one, we're pretty well hedged against our expected load. And then number two, it is a combination of electricity that we generate plus market purchases and our commercial team is responsible for optimizing between the two. So, that to me is a big takeaway on that slide and we wanted to just show how much our market purchases versus electric generation. One thing to note is this is just the economic generation in the money hedges, so you should assume also that we have some flex capacity that is out of the money both on the generation that we own and some of the tools and options that we buy from the market. So, just keep that in mind. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thank you very much for all the time guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Jon. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. If I look at, Mauricio, over the years when you've done M&A, often we get a year removed from the M&A, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less and you guys start talking about upside to the synergy savings. How do you think now that we're a little more than a year removed from the Direct Energy acquisition and I know it's been a crazy year with Uri and everything else. Whether -- how do you assess whether there's potential upside either on broader cost management or cost management and synergy savings related to Direct? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes Michael. Good morning. So, obviously, the integration of Direct Energy was a three-year integration if you remember, Michael. And I am just very pleased with the performance of the team and achieving the synergies. We actually increase the synergies that we achieved in our first year. As we enter into the second year, I will tell you this I am incredibly comfortable that we're going to achieve them. But being mindful that this was a three-year program and we're literally just entering the second year. I will assess the potential of additional synergies. And I think what you should expect is throughout the year we will give you an update on our performance there. But I feel -- I remain very confident that we're going to achieve our numbers. And we'll give you an update if -- throughout the year we decide to update on that. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one quick follow-up. If I just look at the balance sheet and this is going to get a little wonky, but like current assets is significantly higher than -- meaning if I look at things like accounts receivable and accounts payable, the spread between accounts receivable and accounts payable is about $1 billion a positive meaning AR is greater than AP and the current asset for derivative is significantly greater than the current liability. Those would imply that there's significant working capital cash inflows coming. But when I look at your free cash flow guidance, I don't think that's embedded. Am I just misreading that, or are there other things that significantly offset those items? Mauricio Gutierrez : Okay. Michael, I will turn that over to Alberto. And obviously, as you said, I mean I think this was a little technical and we can always follow up with you. But I mean Alberto is there something that you want to add here. Alberto Fornaro : I just want to point you to a couple of things Michael. First of all, the derivative is obviously -- on the derivative value is a combination of the addition of the gas business and the increase in the gas price. So that has in this case, particularly on the asset side increase the value of that. Regarding the comment on current assets, please consider that we have also the included in the current asset that is the proceeds from the securitization and so on. But having said that, obviously we have acquired another business and it has an increase -- has increased our needs in terms of working capital. We have put that under focus and rest assured that there are initiatives to keep that under control that will be taken. So overall, we are very confident about the projection that we have for it. Mauricio Gutierrez : And Michael, just to remind you, working capital was an area of focus during the transformation and we were very successful on that. We kind of have the road map on how to optimize our working capital and we're going to -- we are applying although those lessons learned through the integration of Direct Energy. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciated. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Zimbardo, Bank of America. Paul Zimbardo : Hi, good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey, good morning, Paul. Paul Zimbardo : I wanted to check in on kind of your achievement on the customer growth strategy and just any insights you can share on customer counts given some of the commodity volatility and if you're seeing any change in attrition recently? Mauricio Gutierrez : I mean I'll pass it over to Elizabeth for the attrition, but I would say it's remained pretty constant. And I think that's what we experienced during the last year, our retention numbers were really good. So Elizabeth, do you want to provide a little color here? Elizabeth Killinger : Yeah. Thanks for the question. We definitely achieved our customer count commitment for the year than what we had planned to achieve. We actually beat it by a bit. But as Mauricio mentioned, retention was extremely strong, really one of our best years ever. And that is a product of some of the efforts over the last kind of five years of increasing the tools and techniques we use, leveraging the data that we have to make sure we're putting the right renewal offers in front of customers that will entice them to stay with us. We did have some opportunity to recover in our sales channels as well with COVID, our face-to-face channels were set back quite a bit. And so we saw some improvements there. And then finally, on the DE integration front, we met or beat our expectations for retaining those customers. As you all know and have seen from us over the years as we acquire customers whether it's through M&A or small books, you do see some attrition in the year or two following that. And as long as we keep meeting or beating what we expect from that, we're going to be really pleased. But I'm super proud of the work the team has done from the frontline folks either face-to-face or in our call centers and the digital teams for all that they've done and I'm excited about the potential for 2022 and beyond. Paul Zimbardo : Okay. That's great to hear. And then a separate unrelated question. I know you all have been very proactive with some of the strategic asset sales as you repositioned the business. Do you see more opportunities to continue that trend and become more capital-light particularly on Texas on that theme? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean, as you know, we completed a pretty large divestiture in 2021 and the optimization of the portfolio is it's a focus of ours. As you remember on the Investor Day presentation, I said that in the growing the core is one of our key strategic priorities. That's going to continue. The North Star of that is we're going to have assets that better help us serve our customers. So whatever those are, they are core. And if not they're not core and we're going to look to optimize. Now with respect to Texas, obviously, we have our capital-light renewable PPA strategy that has been very successful close to 2.60 gigawatts. And we're going to continue to focus on that. We're constantly in the market. We're running RFPs basically on a continuous basis. We're going to be very selective on that. And it already has yielded tremendous value for us. And that's going to continue to be a focus now. As Texas is changing some of the market design changes to incentivize dispatchable generation, we are definitely looking into that. We have lots of sites that we can evaluate opportunities. And as we have done in the East, I mean, we're going to do it in Texas if we find the right partner, we're going to do it. But we're going to do it in a way that is a good use of our capital. So I expect that to continue. I know the teams are completely focused in evaluating additional opportunities that we have to bring additional supply to serve our customers. Paul Zimbardo : Great. Thank you very much. Mauricio Gutierrez : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport Global. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So given what's happening in Europe and your disclosures on gas hedges, is it fair to say that even though there's this wide expansion of the positive gas bases in New England that should not have any negative impact on your gas retail margins in 2022? Mauricio Gutierrez : That's correct Angie. So\u2026 Angie Storozynski : Okay. Mauricio Gutierrez : That's correct Angie. And just to, perhaps put a little finer point on our natural gas business. You need to think about it as a logistics business, okay? We serve -- first of all, we don't take any commodity price risk like, NYMEX Henry Hub. Most of the risk that we have is around basis. And then within basis, as we're serving customers, we have access to a tremendous network of logistics pipeline capacity, LDC relationships. So, that network allows us to manage and optimize our basis risk. So based on the disclosures that we provided we feel very comfortable. Obviously, there is always risk to be managed. But I feel very comfortable where I sit today on that. Chris Moser, I don't know if there is anything that you want to add? Chris Moser : No. I think you hit the high points. Thanks, Mauricio. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then\u2026 Mauricio Gutierrez : Great. Angie Storozynski : \u2026secondly, I know you're going to be providing an update on your guidance, I think on the first quarter call. But just looking at the drivers that you showed us on the fourth quarter call, I mean, it seems like any issues with coal and trona supplies have sort of subsided. Then, power prices in Texas this winter has been really weak. So the outage at your coal plant shouldn't be very painful from an EBITDA perspective. I'm kind of struggling to see what are the offsets to those mitigating factors to the negatives that you showed us on the year-over-year change between 2021 and 2022 EBITDA? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes Angie. So if you remember, we provided you, I think we call it, transitory items on all three, I think they're very constructive and positive signs that we're going to mitigate them. Obviously, we're just in February. So I want to wait for the first quarter call. But Alberto, can you just provide a little bit more specificity on where we are on all these the three items that we highlighted on the last earnings? Alberto Fornaro : Absolutely. First of all, we can confirm that, with regards to Limestone we still expect that Unit 1 will be back running in mid-April and the amount of the impact that we have quantified being $50 million during our third quarter call is basically confirmed. Let me just also remind you that, we have not included in 2022 any reimbursement from insurance coming both for property damages and business interruption, first of all, because it is difficult to quantify, and normally it's a long process to get there. But second, because we expect it to happen in 2023. We are working on it. But again, as I said, it's a long process. Second, regarding the coal supply chain, we quantified it in $100 million of which $60 million taxes and $40 million in the East as Mauricio has said, so far, we have been able to make some progress against [Indiscernible]. We confirm at this moment the same number and we will update you in Q3. And regarding the Texas ancillary services which was an impact of $70 million. We confirm the numbers and the actions that we have taken which is basically we pass through the increases in price with the exception to all the customer with the exception where we have a fixed rate contract and this will naturally happen when this contract will be renewed. Mauricio Gutierrez : Right. And just to, I guess put a little finer point on the ancillary services as the customers that are reopening contracts will be able to pass through these ancillary services. I think of it as a change in law if you remember Angie. So, I think there is an opportunity for those customers that we couldn't pass it through we will in the reopening. And then, I am just incredibly pleased with the commercial team and how they've been managing the supply chain constraints around coal. We're still in the middle of the winter, but so far they've done a fantastic job and we will have an opportunity to provide you additional visibility and quantify that in the next earnings call. Angie Storozynski : Good. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Great. Thank you, Angie. Mauricio Gutierrez : So with that, I want to thank you all for your interest and look forward to updating you on our exciting growth plan and other priorities throughout the year. Thank you and stay safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. Thank you for attending today's Vivint Smart Home First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Nate, and I will be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to pass the conference over to our host, Nate Stubbs with Vivint. Nate, please go ahead. Nate Stubbs : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss the results of Vivint Smart Home for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022. Joining me this afternoon are David Bywater, Vivint Smart Home's Chief Executive Officer; and Dale R. Gerard, Vivint's Chief Financial Officer. I would like to begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including with regard to the company's future performance and prospects. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in the Risk Factors section in our annual report on Form 10-K, which was filed on March 1, 2022, and in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to the extent available without unreasonable effort, are available in the earnings release and accompanying presentation, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to David. David Bywater : Great. Thank you, Nate, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your ongoing interest in the Vivint story. We continue to work hard every day to earn your confidence and your support. To that end, I am pleased to report that our strong track record of execution as a public company continued through the first quarter of 2022 as we grew total revenue by nearly 15% and adjusted EBITDA by almost 26%. We originated over 66,000 new smart home subscribers, which is a record for the first quarter period. Our last 12-month attrition rate was 11.2%, which was a 15-quarter low and a 60 basis point improvement versus the prior year. We believe our attrition rate is the lowest among national smart home companies by a significant margin. Our improving customer retention is a result of years of work and collaboration to improve the overall credit quality of our customers as well as performance enhancements across our portfolio of products and services. We ended Q1 with net service cost per subscriber near all-time lows, a strong indication that we are operating the business efficiently and effectively while delighting our customers. Our recurring revenue model has proven resilient during challenging economic times. And we believe the peace of mind and security we provide is relevant in any environment. We believe the momentum in the first quarter sets the stage for us to meet our full year targets for total subscribers, revenue and adjusted EBITDA that we communicated to the market in late February. Given the challenges presented by rising interest rates and supply chain constraints, we are lowering the bottom end of our guidance range for free cash flow while leaving the top end of the range unchanged. Dale will speak to the specifics of this change in his remarks. We are focused on redefining the home experience with technology, products and services that create a smarter, greener, safer home, while saving our customers' money every month. Our integrated platform is the core enabler that allows us to deliver on this mission. We process more than 1.1 billion events per day across our subscriber portfolio. Our average customer has about 15 devices in their home and interacts with their system nearly 11 times per day and stays with us for approximately 9 years. Our proprietary platform allows us to not only protect our customers' homes and families, but to make their homes more enjoyable and intelligent as we integrate solutions with artificial intelligence to make smart decisions on their behalf. As we work to also bundle Smart Energy and Smart Insurance, we will leverage our integrated, easy-to-use operating system to help customers save money on their electric bills and insurance premiums. We believe our strategy provides distinct advantages that will allow us to increase the lifetime value of our customers, which in turn should drive strong economic value for our shareholders. We expect that the unit economics of our customers should also improve, further enhancing the cash flow generation of the company and allowing us to reinvest in compelling value-accretive initiatives. We are confident in our strategy as our data indicates that at scale, a customer who bundles smart home with Smart Energy and/or Smart Insurance has a greater lifetime value than a smart home customer alone. Moreover, the lifetime value of a smart home customer increases by $200 to $400 with each additional year they remain on the platform. And we believe that customers who bundle services will remain with us longer than the current 9-year average. We believe our broader platform strategy will further cement Vivint as being in a Category of One. And as we leverage the advantages from our intelligent and integrated platform, we will further extend our leadership in the do-it-for-me smart home segment. Of course, executing on our strategy of making smart homes smarter, leaner and safer requires us to focus on operational excellence, continuous product innovation and a commitment to enhancing the experience of our customers. I am pleased to welcome Rasesh Patel, our new Chief Operating Officer, to the Vivint team. Rasesh would join us in mid-May, and he brings to Vivint 20-plus years of experience in building technology service businesses, driving innovation and improving the customer experience, most recently as the Chief Product and Platform Officer of AT&T Business, a segment with $35 billion in annual revenue. He will oversee all of our customer-facing operations as well as our technology and product platform. We look forward to Rasesh helping us refine our approach to expanding the lifetime value of our customers. Turning to our key strategic adjacencies. As one of the first smart home companies to expand into Smart Energy, we are very encouraged by the momentum we saw in the first quarter. Due to the seasonality of our business, we would expect the majority of our sales to come in the back half of the year. And we remain on track to double the 45 megawatts we sold in 2021. Our Vivint sales force and strategic partners who seamlessly bundle a Vivint smart home system with solar are seeing a considerably better sales realization rate than those who are only selling solar. This is an incredible demonstration of the power we bring by offering a bundled solution. And it strikes directly at one of the issues that solar industry struggles with, wasted upfront costs on the sales of a solar system that never get installed. Our long-term vision is to combine energy production and consumption into an integrated platform that uses data-infused AI to manage power consumption more intelligently. Our nationwide footprint and ability to install our award-winning smart home solution within a day or 2 of a customer signing up for solar, we believe, is a game changer for the industry and for our customers. We believe that as we grow and solidify our go-to-market partnerships, we will prove to be a powerful and differentiated combination to grow and retain smart home customers. Even Pack, who I've worked with for several years at Vivint Solar, joined the Vivint leadership team a few months back to lead our smart home energy initiative and manage our relationships with these key partners. I'm confident he is the right person to lead our smart home energy business in this next phase of growth. Surveys show that less than 4% of the addressable homes in the U.S. have adopted solar at this point with our nearly 1.9 million customers across North America. We believe there is a significant opportunity to provide bundled Smart Energy to our existing customers as well as the hundreds of thousands of new subscribers we add to our portfolio every year. Now to briefly discuss our Smart Insurance initiative, we continue to believe that our data-rich platform can help better price the risk of a customer who has a professionally installed and actively monitored smart home system that can potentially mitigate the severity of loss events. We believe Vivint customers present a lower risk than homeowners without a smart home system or with an unmonitored DIY system that was inadequately scoped and poorly installed. We continue to invest in this initiative. And in March, we welcomed Ron Davies to a newly created role as the Chief Insurance Officer. In this role, Ron leads all aspects of the Smart Insurance business, including the development of our marketing strategy as well as the process of becoming a Managing General Agent, which will allow us to develop specific homeowner coverages and enables us to provide proprietary insurance offerings. Ron is a proven leader that has showcased his ability to transform and build insurance companies over a career spanning more than 2 decades at universally recognized brands such as Progressive, Allstate and most recently, Safe Auto, which was recently purchased by Allstate. In closing, we're extremely pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2022, and we're excited about the future. The markets in which we operate are large, they're growing and provides significant headroom for growth. Our business model provides a platform for growth in smart home as well as adjacencies like Smart Energy, Smart Insurance and more. We believe that we'll continue to grow at a much faster rate than our do-it-for-me peers and do so in a profitable way while generating positive free cash flow that we can invest in value-accretive opportunities. With that, I will turn the call over to Dale to further discuss our first quarter results and our outlook for the year. Dale Gerard : Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments will refer to information in our earnings presentation that was posted to the Investor Relations section of our website at vivint.com prior to this call. Following my prepared remarks, we will open the call for a Q&A session. Our key subscriber portfolio metrics continued to perform well and showed year-over-year improvement in the quarter. During the first quarter of 2022, we had growth in total subscribers of 9.6% and versus the prior year period, decreasing from 1.71 million to 1.87 million. Our average monthly recurring revenue per user, or AMRRU, in the first quarter increased 3.1% year-over-year to $67.87. The average in AMRRU was driven by customers purchasing incremental smart home products at the initial point of sale, a trend that we have seen over the past several quarters. The year-over-year growth in total subscribers and AMRRU drove a 12.9% increase in total monthly recurring revenue or total MRR. For the first quarter of 2022, total MRR was $126.5 million, up from $112 million reported in the prior year period. Moving on to revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Revenue grew by 14.7% to $392.7 million in the first quarter of 2022. The growth in revenue was attributable to the previously mentioned double-digit increase in total subscribers and the increase in AMRRU as well as a solid contribution from our Smart Energy initiative. We are very pleased with the first quarter's revenue growth, and we remain on track to meet or exceed our revenue guidance for the full year. Like revenue, adjusted EBITDA grew nicely in the first quarter of 2022, finishing at $202.3 million, up 25.9% from the same period in 2021 with a margin of 51.5%. The scaling of service costs and lower G&A expenses were the primary drivers of the 25.9% year-over-year increase. I would note that in the first quarter of 2021, we incurred a onetime legal expense, and this was the primary driver of the decrease in year-over-year G&A cost. We are happy with the growth in adjusted EBITDA and our ability to increase adjusted EBITDA margin in the face of continued economic challenges and supply chain restraints. Next, I will highlight a few metrics on subscriber originations in the first quarter of 2022, led by 8.9% year-over-year growth in our National Inside Sales. We installed a first quarter record of 66,734 new subscribers. Additionally, our Smart Energy partnership continues to show the benefits of bundling smart home with solar, adding 2,940 new Vivint Smart Home subscribers in the quarter. Nearly all of the customers originated in the quarter either paid in full or financed the purchase of their equipment through one of our financing partners. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, the timing of the payment of fees to our primary financing partner has changed from over the term of the loan to upfront and netted from the gross proceeds received from that partner. Due to this change, we are updating how we report average proceeds collected at point of sale and net subscriber acquisition cost for a new subscriber. These metrics will now include the fees paid to our financing partners for all periods shown, whether the fees are paid over the term of the loan or upfront at the point of sale. Net of fees paid to our financing partners, average proceeds collected grew by $93 from $1,556 in the last 12-month period ended March 31, 2021, to $1,649 in the same period in 2022. Average proceeds collected at point of sale, excluding finance fees, increased from $2,067 in 2021 to $2,185 in 2022. I will next cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the quarter. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvement in net service cost per subscriber, dropping from $10.77 in the first quarter of 2021 to $10.18 in the first quarter of 2022. Our net service cost per subscriber for the first quarter remained near an all-time low. Our net service margin retained -- remained strong at 78.2%. These results reinforce the advantage of Vivint's fully integrated platform, which encompasses the entire customer journey as well as the constant feedback loop that enables us to continuously improve the performance of our products and platform. Before I discuss net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber, as mentioned earlier, we are now including the fees paid to our financing partners in the reporting of this metric, whether those fees are paid over the term of the loan or upfront at the point of sale. Including financing fees, net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the last 12 months ended March 31, 2022, was $618, up slightly from $577 in the prior year period, but down $635 or approximately 50% from the same period in 2019. The marginal year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher equipment and housing-related expenses. Net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber, excluding financing fees, was $82, up slightly from $66 in the prior period, but down $878 from the same period in 2019. Our customer financing model, Vivint Flex Pay, has been instrumental in our transition from using cash, taking on debt to grow the business, to producing cash, reducing debt and having the flexibility to invest in new initiatives that we believe will be value accretive for our shareholders. Another metric we are happy to report is our last 12-month attrition rate. For the period ended March 31, 2022, our attrition rate improved for the eighth consecutive quarter to 11.2%, a 15-quarter low. Our enhanced underwriting standards improved product and service performance and the high level of customer engagement with our platform continue to drive what we believe is the lowest attrition rate among national smart home companies. In terms of net cash used in operating activities, we used $31.1 million -- excuse me, $36.1 million during the first quarter of 2022, up $21.9 million from the first quarter of 2021, which was primarily driven by a change in the timing of interest payments due to the refinancing of our debt last year and a change in the timing of financing fees paid to our lead financing partner. We finished the quarter with $153.2 million of cash on hand and a very strong liquidity position of approximately $510 million. In conclusion, we are proud of our consistent execution across our key financial and operational metrics, particularly since becoming a public company in January of 2020. The fundamentals of the business remain strong. We are pleased with our momentum going into the second quarter, and we are bullish about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. We are also aware of the continuing supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and challenging labor dynamics. Taking all of these into consideration, we are reaffirming our original guidance issued during our fourth quarter of 2021 earnings call for total subscribers, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And we are lowering the bottom end of our guidance range for free cash flow by $17 million to $50 million, while leaving the top end of the range unchanged at $77 million. We expect to end the year with total subscribers within the range of 1.95 million and 2 million, total revenue within the range of $1.6 billion and $1.63 billion, adjusted EBITDA within the range of $725 million and $745 million and free cash flow within the range of $50 million and $77 million. This concludes our prepared remarks for the first quarter. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Max Gamperl : This is Max Gamperl on for Rod. First question would be on just if you could just elaborate on the attrition trends in the quarter and kind of how that compares to your expectations heading into the quarter? And from a longer-term perspective, where we should expect attrition to go from here for the rest of the year and maybe even beyond some of the older cohorts come to an end? Dale Gerard : Yes. I'll start with that. This is Dale. And then, David, you can jump in here and add anything. I think we're continuing to see attrition or retention of our customers perform really well. They're probably ahead of our -- again, our expectation in the first quarter. But again, we think when you have the interaction 11 times a day that individuals are acting with our system -- interacting with our system, they're using the system, they're finding value in it, they're more likely to keep staying with the system they're paying for. And I think that's what we're seeing. And I think over time, our product and our service also continues to get better, and there's more functionality that they're able to get out of it. And so that's leading to, again, customers that are wanting the system and wanting this service that we provide. In terms of what we see, I think we've said, hey, guidance-wise, we expect attrition to probably be in the 12% range for the full year. And I think that's what we said coming into this year in terms of guidance there. I think we still expect that. We're cautious. I mean there's lots going on with the economy, as you know, Max, and why we think the attrition will continue to perform really well, and we believe it will, I think for guidance-wise, what we said we're expecting. A part of that is we have -- we know that the end of term percentage of customers will go up from where it is today as we go through renewals here later in the year. I think we're at 10.2% of customers that are at their initial end of contract for this last 12-month period. We expect that to go up higher than that as we go through 2022. And so that's why we're saying, hey, based upon the hydraulics, when you have more customers at end of turn, the attrition usually of those cohorts at that point in time or higher, then we expect 12% or somewhere in that range for full year guidance. The one thing I would point out and then, David, you can jump in if there's anything else, is the last time we were at this type -- this low was in, I think, the second quarter of 2018, and we had a -- we have 10.8%, like I said, of customers during the term this period. It was 12.2% or 12.3% at that point. So we've got -- we're performing better across the board. And so we're really excited about where that is and continue to perform better than what we expect. And we continue to think that will happen throughout the year. David, I don't know if you have anything more. David Bywater : No, I think that point is just I wanted to make. The other thing is, Max, I do think this is a good illustration of the integrated model. I see the collaboration between our operations teams and our innovation teams. And we own the product, we own the IP. And seeing those 2 teams work well together to root cause anything that is causing friction with the customers and how they collaborate to knock down those issues proactively is great to see. And those 2 teams worked really, really well together. It's very close. So it's not this large disparate set of solutions from across a large array of parties. It's -- the majority of it is what we own and do internally. So I think we're really pleased with the results coming from the integrated model. So, so far, so good. And I think as I mentioned in my comments, from everything we can see, I think we're materially ahead of a lot of our peers. And we're proud of that, and we'll continue to work hard to continue to widen that gap. Max Gamperl : Got it. That's helpful. And then another question would be, just from a macro perspective, how are you thinking about direct-to-home sales heading into the summer? With COVID largely in the rearview mirror for the first time in, I guess, 2 years, I guess that should probably help your direct-to-home sales, but we also have a tough operating environment with rising labor costs. So wondering about your direct-to-home sales strategy for this year? David Bywater : Yes. No, great question. Direct-to-home is a very important channel for us. We launched the summer about 2.5, almost 3 weeks ago. We're off to a great start. Actually, we've been very pleased with the first few weeks. They're performing better than we expected. And it's probably one of our best launches in years. So we're very encouraged by that. It's a collaborative sell. It's an informative sell. And so we're very good at this. I think we're best in class at this. We've been doing this for decades now. And our teams know how to sell, where to sell. They're very pleased with the platform and services that we have to offer. And I think our productivity, we're very encouraged what we've seen in the first few weeks. So we're very bullish, and I'm very, very encouraged by the results we've seen. You usually know within the first 4 or 5 weeks of the summer how the summer is going to trend out. And thus far, all the data seems to be a very strong summer for us. So very, very encouraged. Dale Gerard : Yes. Having COVID behind us is a great thing, but also, we're seeing the sales productivity hasn't really been hurt by kind of the economic chaos going on. So we're still cautious, but so far, so good. So let's see how a few more weeks stack up, and we'll report in August, but feeling good about it. Operator : Our next question goes to Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital. Ashish Sabadra : So maybe just a quick question on the free cash flow guidance. I was just wondering what takes you to the high end versus the low end of the guidance range. And maybe just a follow-up question there. Like why do we see that impact on the free cash flow, but haven't really seen those headwinds impacting the EBITDA or other line items? So any color there will be helpful as well. Dale Gerard : Yes. So with the rising interest rates, we have 2 pieces of kind of debt. I would say we have the term loan that's on our balance sheet. And then the bigger component is really the Citizens financing. As you know, we offer that to consumers for 0% APR. And so our costs associated to do that as the rates rise will increase. And so we're trying to do some forecasting there around what we think will happen around rates in the different swap curves. And so that's why we said, hey, based upon where we see rates today and what we expect, the increases will be at the next 2 or 3 or 4 fed meetings. We factored that into kind of our estimates and said, \"Hey, we think that there will be potentially a greater use of cash than we originally anticipated when we did our models for the beginning of the year.\" The reason why you don't see that into like EBITDA, for example, is when that comes through, it comes through as a reduction to revenue. And so as we put it on -- so if you take the gross amount less the fee, that net amounts what we put into deferred revenue and we recognize over, say, 60 months period of the loan. And so while it will be a lot -- could be $10 million, $20 million in incremental cash, depending on what happens with rates here, it's very small when you look at it on a revenue basis because it gets spread out over, I think, about 5 years. So in any one period of time for revenue, it's not going to be material to change the numbers. But on a cash basis, because it's the cash that we get in this period related to those new sales, it will have some impact there. So that's why we're just -- we're being -- realizing what's really happening in the economy. We're seeing these rates go up, and they're going up a lot faster. I think maybe when you look at the yield curves in the out 2, 3 years -- you've got to remember most of our loans we put on the Citizens are 60-month loans. And so that cost, while the rates have not increased that dramatically when you look at it just quarter-over-quarter, 1 year rates, but the calculation used to figure out what our cost is with them, it uses longer-term periods, and those rates have -- went up higher than what they were the last time when we put out our guidance. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe just on my follow-up. Thanks for that disclosure on the Smart Energy partners and the new subscribers which are generated from that channel. And just given the higher energy prices, it seems to be a strong demand for solar energy. So I was wondering what are you seeing on that front. And how should we think that partnership helping drive accelerated subscriber growth going forward? David Bywater : Yes. We are seeing some strong demand there. I think the work that the team did 2 years ago, that partnership that we really brought to market last summer, was fortuitous because we knew that there was a strong desire to bundle the 2. We've known that for years. But we really saw the benefits of it at the end of last summer and then throughout this last fall and winter. We have forecast that we will double our megawatts. We may do more than that. We also see that there are some challenges on the solar side. There's some challenges with regards to supply constraints to their own panels that is causing some concern. And so we're also just being realistic around the access to panels there. And there's also financing costs that impact solar, just like there is across all consumer products. But having said that, those headwinds are real. They're similar to what we see on the smart home side. But there is this desire, obviously, to control your energy costs. And I think with the rising cost of petroleum, there are people who are saying, \"Hey, net-net, long term, I want to be able to be in control of that.\" And so I think they have that longer vision, and they are pushing forward to adopt solar. There is a strong desire there. And as we mentioned, we're seeing a very -- a much higher pull-through of those sells that actually go to install, which at the end of the day is what really matters when they bundle smart home. We knew from the work that we had done from all of the survey work that there was a strong desire to bundle them. And in fact, in practice, we're seeing a materially higher pull-through rate. So we think we're on to something pretty special, and our partners agree. And so there's a ying and yang and a pro and a con in the current environment. But net-net, we think that the demand for solar will continue to be strong, and the demand to bundle what we have will be even stronger. And those that provide the bundled solution would [like] the customers even more and provide them more value. And as a result, we think we can actually do a better job in winning in that market space. But yes, it will continue to be very strong in solar. Ashish Sabadra : That's great color. And again, solid results and good to see the great momentum in both subscriber and revenue growth. David Bywater : Yes. Thank you. It was a great quarter, and we're optimistic for the full year. Operator : Our next question goes to Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : I just want to echo the congrats, really strong quarter across the board really. So -- and that kind of gets to my question, which is you saw a nice upside in 1Q, kept your full year guidance unchanged. Just want to understand, is that more a function of trying to embed some conservatism in the model for the rest of the year, given what's going on? Or has there been any change in outlook as we think about the remainder of the year? And then I have a follow-up. Dale Gerard : Thanks for the question. It's really embedding conservatism. I don't know if it's conservatism or it's being cautious to what we're seeing in the marketplaces, frankly, right? It was a great first quarter. And as David just mentioned, we're bullish on the full year prospect. But we're also -- there's lots of things going on in the economy that we just don't know how consumer behavior, if it will change. We haven't seen it today. And as David -- we're feeling good about the start of the direct-to-home sales season. That's a couple of weeks in. But for where we are today, we're 5 months into the year, I think we feel pretty good saying, \"Hey, that's where we think we'll be.\" And as we get deeper into the year and we get second quarter credit, if there's a need to make any revisions, and I'm sure we will. But it's really just thoughtful about everything that's going on out there. With supply chain, David, you can jump in this, but I think everyone with supply chain in 2022 -- like we went through 2021 and were like, supply chain, you can't get any worse from that or it's going to get better in '22. And we're not. We're still seeing it's -- every day, it's a battle to make sure we got de-commenced from subcomponents and suppliers, and we've got to work then to get those components recommitted or we've got to go out and find other suppliers to bring us those components. You've got -- they've got labor constraints. I think you got China shut down, which is where a lot of subcomponents actually come out of. We don't really manufacture finished goods in China, but a lot of the subcomponents that go into our finished cameras and panels and so forth come out of there. And so after disruption, we don't know what's -- I don't know what's going to -- how long that's going to go on or what that really will look like. And it's not only in just timing, it does, but it's also in cost. There's got to be more cost. They have to use more air freight. It's going to be higher manufacturing costs because they're going to have to use more labor and overtime to catch -- keep the volumes that we need to come into production. So there's just a lot of things out there that we see, but don't have like full visibility to what those could -- how those could impact us. And so that's why we're kind of leaving that full year kind of where it is today from what we know and what we see. David, I don't know if you have to say anything else. David Bywater : No, I agree. We have a gentleman named [Indiscernible] that runs our direct-to-home. And I've been talking to him. It's interesting, you think about this year, we're encouraged by the start of direct-to-home this year. And the reason why I bring that up is because I think the solutions that we have this year, that we're bringing forth with our sales force to our customers, it resonates. These bundled stations, they resonate. The fact that we're trying to make homes safer, more efficient and also more cost effective, they resonate. We talked about the road map of our company, we're trying to extend how long we are with customers to pull our high service margins we have in our current business plus bundle and incremental margin, and we're trying to create more value for our customers. I mean you take all of that -- and we're encouraged by the year. So -- and Q1 was a great manifestation of that. I mean the work we're doing with our inside sells, our direct-to-home really kicks off in the spring and summer, but our inside sales was relatively strong. So we feel good about the refinement of our strategy and our execution of our strategy. Our operations teams, I mean, they continue to dial in on their ability to execute even in a more leveraged way than they have in the past. So we're encouraged. But yes, to Dale's point, I'm not sure the Ukrainian conflict with Russia, not sure oil price is going to end up. Still I'm concerned about the supply chain constraints. And then interest rates, we have the 3-year curve. Not exactly sure if it goes to try to beat them. So it's that unknown. We just thought it was prudent just the [holds] where we are. And our goal with you guys is give it to you how we see it. We beat -- we've done a really good job performing ever since we did the IPO. We don't want to blow that. We want you to believe in what we say, and that's kind of how we roll. So... Erik Woodring : I appreciate all that color, and I think you're taking the right strategy, so kudos to you. Maybe just my follow-up. David, I think you mentioned a comment earlier where you said the customer stays for 9 years. Is that just a subtle hint that you think your long-term attrition rate, which was originally thought to be closer to 12%, could actually be lower than that because you now see customers staying kind of 9 years versus the high end of 7 or 8 years? That was kind of the prior estimation. I just want to make sure if that was just a comment in passing or if that's something that you think has fundamentally changed, where now the long-term attrition rate might now be lower than it was -- than you were thinking maybe 3, 6, 9, 12 months ago? David Bywater : No, Erik, we're very explicit about this. I mean our aspiration is very much to turn long-term customers into lifetime customers. I mean it's very aspirational. But our goal here is to have it be 12 years, 15 years. A solar relationship is 35 years. If you bring to them a better insurance solution that they benefit from because of their smart home solution, why would they go anywhere else? If we can continue to make their home more efficient today and more enjoyable, and they interact with that whole more and more on, why would they go anywhere else. So it very much is our stated desire and objective to bring them value so that it goes from 9 to 12 to 13, and that would very much reduce attrition. I talk about this internally a fair bit, we're trying to have the entire bundled solution be a lower cost than they have today. And when you do that and you help educate the consumer about the value you're bringing, I really do hope that we're dropping out hundreds of basis points of attrition over time. And by math, you extend that relationship. It's so interesting. 10 years ago, when you were just in the security business, you sold a system and people hoped that they never had to use it. They hope they never got -- had an instance where they had an alarm go off. By default, they never knew if it was really working. And we've completely flipped that. We are trying to drive interaction with them every day. We're reminding them every day of the value that we bring. So we always talk about that 11 times per day. We hope that we can get that to 13 times a day, 15 times a day, where you're so integral into their family. It's so funny, my wife, she hates it. But I will often get on my phone. I will see her on our -- my cameras in the house. And I'll talk to her over the phone, and she's like, David, I hate this, you can now see what I'm doing at home. But I'm interacting with my family at different times if I'm late for dinner. I'll actually -- I'll be having dinner, and I'll be talking to them. There's new ways that I'm interacting with my family that I never thought about a year ago. So we're always trying to think about ways that we can become more central to who they are so that they can't live without us. So yes, very much, Erik, I hope that, that average lifetime continues to go up. And like I said, on just the smart home alone, not even including insurance or so, just the smart home, for every year we extend it, it depends on how big the package is, it's $200 to $400 more of lifetime value. And then when you add in solar and you add in insurance, my goal here is to show you guys over time, the lifetime value of the customer is expanding nicely. So you as investors are saying, wait a minute, this is a superior investment option for us. [Indiscernible] so that's what we're trying to prove to you. Operator : Our next question goes to Paul Chung with JPMorgan. Paul Chung : So just on 1Q, what kind of drove the big uptick there? Typically seasonally slower. What were some pockets of demand, what regions you saw strength? And then how is competition kind of faring? Are more and more people becoming aware of your brand? David Bywater : Well, Paul, it's David. In Q1, most of that was driven through our inside sales. So the seasonality of our direct home, they really kick in as we've diversified our channels. You really see the strength of direct-to-home in Q2 and Q3 and then part of Q4. But -- so really Q1, the majority of that is from inside sales. And I really think that's a function of many things. One, once again, I think our product is getting better. And so that's folks who are researching our product, they're seeing the accolade that we have from our product. We call ourselves a Category of One. We really do think that we have the best product out there for the money. And so I think people see that. The success of our direct-to-home, you see all the advertisers, all the homes that have the signs out front, you know that -- we benefit from that. So there's a symbiotic relationship here between the 2. But that was really around just digital marketing and the effectiveness of that and just the brand awareness. We've done a fair bit of survey work around our brand awareness. It's surprisingly high for how little we spend on brand. And we think that's earned brand. That's from doing this now for 20 years and really earning that on a word-of-mouth basis, which is the most valuable brand awareness you can possibly have. So once again, it's hard earned. And that was really largely from inside sales, which I think stands on the merit of the efficacy of the product. Dale Gerard : The other thing I'd just layer in that, too, is inside sales is really, really strong in the quarter. We did pick up almost 3,000 additional new subscribers from that partnership that we've created. As David said, groundwork was laid 18, 24 months ago, really started coming to fruition in '21, and we're continuing to see that really come full circle, so to speak, in 2022. And so we got almost 3,000 new business from smart homes, from a channel that didn't exist previously. And we think there's lots of -- because solar largely sold year around, right? And the team has helped them understand the value of bundling. And as we train them, and they've seen the benefits, that's true, that engine has also helped us, yes. So inside sales and that new channel coming online. Yes, good point. David Bywater : And you see that in the numbers. Paul Chung : Right, yes. From the solar stuff -- yes, the solar stuff. So nice momentum there. How do we think about kind of the new subs growth relative to the doubling of the megawatts you mentioned and kind of the revenue and margin contribution per sub kind of moving forward on that basis? And then, I guess, the same kind of question for smart insurance, kind of the unit economics per sub there. Dale Gerard : Yes. So I'll start with Smart Insurance and work our way back. Paul, this is Dale. We're not really giving out -- we haven't given out. I think we're still very early into the life cycle of the insurance business and building out. I mean we got 7,000 or so sold policies last year. So that's very early, continue to build out. We're spending and investing there. That's one of the investments that we're making in 2022 to build out the MGA that we're working on. Ron has been in place -- Ron Davies, who we brought in to lead, has been in place for 60 days, I think, at this point. So very early there. We think -- we definitely believe it's accretive to our EBITDA margin and definitely drives extended and increased lifetime value of the customer. But we'll give those down when I think it's appropriate, when we have a better feel for what those really look like because there's a lot of movement there still today. I think on the Smart Energy side, I think that 45 megawatts that we did last year would be -- that's probably 5,000 homes or so. So if you double that this year, you get to 90, you're probably in the 9,500 to 10,000 homes. And we believe that we'll be able to drive incremental value and margin out of that business. And then what I think comes -- there's 2 pieces of that, right? There's the revenue that's generated from the selling of that solar to that customer and we get the margin from that. And then there's also, from this partnership, the development and increased Vivint Smart Home customers that have very strong margins in terms of lifetime value. So there's kind of 2 pieces to that. I think we want to make sure we think of it that way. I think we can drive 10,000-ish or more new subs from that, smart home subs. And then you'll have -- last year, I think we said that 45 megawatts was, call it, $45 million to $50 million of revenue. And so you can kind of back in, if we're doubling where we are this year, then we're probably looking at somewhere between, call it, $85 million and $95 million of revenue from that. And then we're still working. It's early. I think we feel good about where our cost structure will come out there. But it's probably a little still early, but I think it will be somewhere north of 10%, what we'd say, as the margin on that. And I think our goal is to get into the mid- to high teens, but there's -- we're still working on that. David Bywater : On our investments. We're making investments now to make sure that we scale it directly. Dale Gerard : Again, I think, Paul, to make sure it's incremental to what we've done today, so it's positive to whatever we've done today in terms of EBITDA we're getting from that. And I think it's really about, as David said previously, it's about the lifetime value of the customer. And if you can take that customer that has a 75% to 80% service margin from the smart home side, you can add incremental revenue that you're getting to net customer related to a solar sale or the annual insurance premiums coming in from that customer, it really expands out, we believe, the lifetime value of that customer. David Bywater : And pull the margin from smart home in other peers. Dale Gerard : That right. It's really quite powerful. We saw some people were saying, hey, the margin is dilutive. And I'm like, you've got to open your aperture. If you're one of this business on your own, you make your investment because you're protecting and elongating and adding and, most importantly, you're adding value to the customer, which makes you a must-own asset. So as you open your aperture and think about value of the customer, defending your base and incrementally adding margin on a very risk-adjusted basis, it is a no-brainer to do. And the way we're doing it in an asset-light friendly way, it's very, very... Operator : Our next question goes to Brian Ruttenbur with Imperial Capital. Brian Ruttenbur : First of all, in terms of second quarter, can you talk a little bit about where you see G&A going because you had a dramatic drop in G&A year-over-year sequentially in the first quarter. Where do you see that going in the second quarter? Dale Gerard : Yes. So sequentially, it will go up from Q1 to Q2, it will go up. I think when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it's going to be, call it, 5%, 6% growth. So again, one of the things we've really focused on is really trying to drive efficiencies out of the dollars that we're investing. And G&A is an investment. I mean it's like -- it's a capital allocation, like anything else, whether it's new subscribers or technology or products. And so we're really focused on that, Brian, making sure that where we're spending our dollars in G&A, whether that's in finance, legal, marketing, exactly where is it that we're actually getting a return on those dollars. So there will be some year-over-year. I mean there's going to be some -- as you know, Brian, there's going to be some inflationary pressure just on some of the core things that we have in that, whether it's travel. We're starting to see a little bit more travel, David and I have been to conferences and so forth. So there are certain things like that, that we're starting to see. But we're going to try our best to maintain and really drive scale across the G&A. Brian Ruttenbur : Okay. Very good. The other question is more macro. It's kind of your road map. Can you talk a little bit more about the insurance offering, where you are now in terms of the rollout, are you going to be farming this out? Are you self-insuring your customers here? How -- what's the structure? And then maybe what other offerings could you potentially be selling through your channel? David Bywater : Right. Brian, thanks for the question. I'll take that one. So yes, first and foremost, we believe this is a platform play. And we're really seeing that come to fruition last year and then this year. So this ecosystem we have and the home relationship we have with the customers, they're asking us to say, \"Hey, bring us other solutions.\" So we talked about [Indiscernible]. The insurance is a great manifestation of that. So where we are? This last 1.5 years, we really were working on just making sure that we could actually be relevant and the customers [Indiscernible]. We've just been actually just selling policies, reselling policies, just making sure the system is in place, the compliance apparatus to be able to sell to our 2 million customers. And so there wasn't anything terribly creative about that. It was just trying to get the ability to sell correctly through an agency piece. We've been working to actually develop an MGA model, where we can then take the data that we have and underwrite with partners, with a reinsurer to actually be able to have them underwrite a lot of the risks to actually bring data to bear that the customers have on their behalf to underwrite a product that would benefit them. And so this year, our goal is to be into 3 states. We should be into our first state as an MGA later this summer and then hopefully be in 2 more states by the end of the year. And the states we're going into is a function of where our partners want us to go, where we have a large customer base and the risk profile works for our product. So [we want to be thoughtful], Dale mentioned this, this is not be a material piece of our economics probably for a year or 2, what we're trying to do now is just make sure that we do it correctly, methodically working with our partners. There is a very large interest level because we own the data. With our customers, we have the platform. And so we're just making sure we're doing it correctly. We're not relying upon this to be a large revenue lift or a large EBITDA lift or large cash lift or [grain]. We're doing this to be able to prove out value to our customers, and this will be a nice growth engine in the years to come. But most importantly, it's a great manifestation of the platform play [Indiscernible]. The second part of your -- so to answer your question there, Brian, we're partnering with some large, large industry players. We're making sure the risk falls appropriately where it should be, relying upon their expertise and our expertise. We're not trying to play in areas of risk that we're not confident in. We're relying upon them, and we're relying upon what we're really good at to do our part. And that really is the data we have, the installation we have and the servicing we have. And they're helping make sure that we price the risk [Indiscernible]. With regards to where else we can go, we've done a fair bit of work on this, on one of the platforms. We feel right now our plate is pretty full not only with the continued expansion of Smart Home and Smart Energy and Smart Insurance, but also the expansion of channels and how we bring this to market. There's a fair bit on our plate. And for the next 18 to 24 months, we're really digesting and scaling that. But we've mentioned in prior calls that we're interested in aging in place. It's an area and marketplace we think we have a really strong product offering to bring to bear there. And we can really drive out a lot of costs and bring a lot of comfort and value to folks who want to age in their home, where they are happier, healthier and do it in a much more cost-effective way and connect their families. So that's an area that we're doing some work around. And I can see that being an area that we'll probably invest in the future. But right now, we're focused on what we have. And that might be through partnerships -- that may be through partnerships, that may be through organic. And we're still trying to manage exactly how we want to approach that marketplace and when we'll do it. But that's another example of where the platform will most likely go down the road. Operator : All questions have been exhausted. So I will turn the conference back over to David Bywater for closing remarks. David Bywater : Great. We appreciate you guys' interest. Like I said, I think we had a great Q1. We're looking forward to a solid year. We appreciate you guys' ongoing interest in us. We're focused on delighting the customers, taking care of our shareholders, taking care of our employees. I did want to mention to all of you guys that we really appreciate our employees. We think they're world class. I hear often from our customers how well our employees take care of them, whether it's how they sell or how they service them, whether it's calls over the phone or when they're in their homes, a number of incredible employees. And I appreciate how they innovate. I appreciate how they take care of each other and how they come through this COVID crisis with respect to one another and to [help] each other and how they treat our customers. So once again, thanks for your time and your interest, and we look forward to talking to you guys on our next call. Take care.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to today\u2019s speaker, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Felicia. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's second quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcasts. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Liza Killinger, Head of Home; Rob Gaudette, Head of Business and Market Operations; and Chris Moser, Head of Competitive Markets and Policy.  I'd like to start with the three key takeaways of today's presentation on Slide 4. We are maintaining our financial guidance ranges as we continue to navigate through volatile market conditions and are increasing our capital available for allocation by $140 million. We continue to make good progress in achieving our strategic growth priorities particularly on direct energy integration. And finally, our share repurchase program continues with approximately $600 million in remaining capacity to be executed this year.  Moving to the second quarter financial and operational results on Slide 5, we delivered $358 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter. 70% of the difference compared to last year are items that we previously identified, including asset sales and transitory items. The remaining variance is primarily driven by the forced outage of our 610 megawatt coal unit at the W.A. Parish facility. This outage began on May 9th, and is expected to be back for summer operation next year. The unit is covered by both business interruption and property damage insurance. I am pleased to report that we once again achieved top decile safety performance for the quarter and that we published our 12th sustainability report, a testament to our commitment to transparency and accountability.  We also continued to realize strong customer retention which I will discuss in more detail shortly. We continue to make progress on our five key strategic priorities. Integrate direct energy, perfect our integrated platform by better matching retail with supply, grow our core electricity and natural gas businesses, integrate adjacent products or services that will allow us to expand margins and term from our customers, and return capital to our shareholders. I'd like to give you a quick update on those priorities. The direct energy integration is going well and we are on track to achieve our run rate synergies of $300 million by the end of 2023. In late June, we received ERCOT securitization proceeds related to Winter Storm Uri in line with our expectations. We have continued to make progress on our mitigation efforts, and now expect an additional $80 million in recovery, bringing our total mitigation efforts to 70% of the original impact. We continue to optimize our supply portfolio through monetization of the Watson Generation facility in California and retirements of fossil assets in PJM. We have also expanded our capital like PPA strategy to focus on energy storage and quick start natural gas generation. I expect PPA market conditions to improve into year-end, especially if the proposed Inflation Reduction Act is passed.  Our retail brands continue to perform well with the strong customer count, retention metrics, and an unmatched ability to generate insights on price elasticity. We remain focused on expanding our product offerings and improving our digital customer experience. I am proud that one of our flagship brands, Reliant Energy was also recognized as the best electricity company in Houston, our hometown. Last quarter, I spoke about Goal Zero, our resilience and battery storage business and the significant opportunity it represents given growing grid instability and extreme weather events. During the quarter, we launched a marketing campaign in one of its core markets, California to increase awareness for the product and brand with very strong results.  As a result of these targeted campaigns, web traffic increased 400% and the average order increased by almost a third. We continued to make progress in other areas, but remain keenly focused on pacing our investments as we navigate ongoing supply chain constraints and recessionary environment. Finally, we are maintaining our financial guidance range, but due to the impact of the W.A. Parish unit outage, we're currently trending towards the bottom end. We have been focused on taking steps like one time cost savings and incremental direct energy synergies to improve our results. Alberto will provide details on this and the additional capital available for allocation.  Turning to Slide 6 for our market review in Texas. ERCOT experienced record hit during the quarter, 32% above the 10-year average, resulting in record peak demand. However, real-time power prices were mixed versus what the forward indicated, driven primarily by the performance of renewable energy on any given day. As we look into the summer, we expect prices to remain volatile and highly dependent on renewable performance. Turning to the right-hand side of the slide, beginning with retail. We saw a strong performance through the quarter with retention 5% ahead of expectations and customer count increasing 1.2%. We also extended term length of customer offers, which enables new [ph] management and improves margin predictability. This occurred while consumers grappled with inflation, only further demonstrating the resilience of our retail brands and pricing strategy. On supply, the unplanned outage at W.A. Parish Unit 8 impacted performance. While there is an earnings recognition delayed given the time line to receive business interruption insurance proceeds, insurance is an effective tool to mitigate this risk. Beyond that, we have seen strong operational performance from our fleet due to our expanded spring outage maintenance plan and opportunistic maintenance outages, that best positions our fleet to perform through these extreme and extended summer conditions. Finally, our balanced hedging strategy that uses both own generation and third-party contracts further derisks our portfolio through optimizing operational versus counterparty risk, which are important attributes through current market conditions. Now moving to Slide 7. Just like we did last quarter on Goal Zero, today I want to focus on one area of growth that is complementary to our core offerings and presents an exciting opportunity, heating and pulling our HVAC maintenance and installation. Airtron is our Home Services HVAC company, which was acquired as part of Direct Energy. It represents a complementary offering to our existing core products as HVAC systems use the most energy of any single home appliance, responsible for up to 50% of a home energy consumption. The HVAC industry with a total U.S. addressable market of $100 billion is highly fragmented and traditionally served by local providers with limited scope and reach. In contrast, Airtron operates in nine states, which represents a $10 billion serviceable market, including Texas, where they hold leadership positions in both Houston and Dallas with a single recognizable brand and scale that is unmet. Combined with our existing consumer services platform, we can grow both within our existing customer base and through expansion into new territories, creating a significant and compelling opportunity. In the last three years, Airtron has grown revenues 11% per year to $450 million with gross margins of 30% or more. The revenues come from residential new construction, services and maintenance, as well as direct-to-consumer home replacement. Our early insights suggest that there is significant growth potential in direct-to-consumer home replacement, given energy efficiency initiatives and extreme weather that shortens the lifetime of HVAC systems. The ability to leverage our existing consumer base and sales channels to augment the direct-to-consumer growth while cross-selling with our electricity and gas customers is precisely the type of value opportunity that increases margin and retention that we highlighted during our Investor Day. I look forward to providing you updates on their progress as we integrate these solutions closer with our core energy offerings. So with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review. Alberto Fornaro : Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 9 for a review of the second quarter results. NRG delivered $358 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $298 million decrease versus prior year, excluding the impact of Winter Storm Uri. As you can see in the waterfall chart, this decrease is primarily due to the previously guided impact of the 4.8 gigawatt fossil asset sales completed in December, PJM assets retirement in the second quarter, New York capacity revenue, and early settlement of demand response revenue in the second quarter of 2021. In addition, not included in our expectation where the extended unplanned outage at Parish Unit 8 and the modest amount of growth expenses.  From a regional perspective, adjusted EBITDA in Texas declined $61 million compared to the second quarter of last year. As Mauricio said in his scripted remarks, summer came early with record setting temperatures beginning in May raising both market prices and build volumes. On May 9th, a fire at the Parish facility caused an extended outage at Unit 8 and a 10-day outage at Unit center. We were therefore forced to replace the power with the combination of our more expensive out of the many generation hedges, and some opportunistic market purchase, which together impacted EBITDA by an estimated $70 million. In addition, the benefit normally associated to higher build volumes with our home and business customers, affect the impact of additional outages on our remaining Texas fleet and higher maintenance expenses recorded in the quarter. Finally, we were able to fully offset the previously disclosed transitory items, which includes the limestone outage and the ancillary costs for a total negative $61 million with some nonrecurring items of $79 million, which include an earlier-than-anticipated partial insurance reimbursement of the business interruption expenses aligned to Unit 1 and the early testament of an online PPA. Turning on the East, West, and other segments, the year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the $63 million EBITDA reduction from asset divestiture and retirement, as well as by the decline in demand response revenue associated with an early settlement in the second quarter of 2021. Next, compared to Texas where the impact of coal constraints was minimal, generation in this continues to be impacted by coal availability for a $23 million impact during the quarter. After accounting for these previously guided items, the remaining $63 million negative variance versus 2021 was driven by the combination of lower power volumes, reduced profitability at our Watson facility, which was monetized during the quarter, an intra-year timing related to C&I customer hedge monetization, which will be recovered through the second half of this year as we associated to retain hedges cycle and the balance by higher supply costs. Next, I will provide you a brief update regarding our progress in achieving Direct Energy savings and mitigating Winter Storm Uri impact. Direct Energy, incremental synergies from the beginning of the year reached $39 million. We remain on track to achieve our full year target of $50 million in 2022 and $225 million since the acquisition of Direct Energy. We also expect to improve the recovery of our 2021 losses from Winter Storm Uri. You may recall that at the end of the last year, we estimated that the final impact net recovery was going to be $380 million. During Q2, we were able to make progress in several areas where we have remaining gross losses and therefore, we have improved our estimates by $80 million, bringing the net impact to $300 million. Now let's move to the full year guidance. As Mauricio mentioned, we are maintaining our guidance range but based on the recent events, we are trending to the bottom of the guidance ranges. The full year impact from the Parish Unit 8 outage based on current prices, is estimated to be a little over $200 million. The fleet carries both business interruption insurance for lost earnings and property damage insurer to cover the cost of returning the unit to full operation. Given that the outage started at the beginning of May, the second quarter impact reflects the deductible period. As of today, we're assuming the business interruption insurance proceeds will not be collected until 2023. However, the property damage proceeds will more closely match the expenses and the maintenance CAPEX deployed throughout the time needed to restore the unit. Additionally, for free cash flow before growth, we continue to closely manage the impact to working capital from higher commodity prices, primarily in our natural gas business. To be clear, as for the transitory items disclosed at the end of last year, we have taken and we will continue to take steps aimed to improve our position. In particular, we have identified a serious opportunity in managing our costs and operating expenses, including early realization of synergies and onetime reduction of expenses. And as you know, we manage our business for cash so we have also incorporated action to improve cash generation and mitigate our net working capital increases, including through the recovery of property damage proceeds and noncore asset sales. We look forward to providing you additional updates throughout the year. I will turn now to Slide 10 for a brief update of our 2022 capital allocation. Moving left to right, the midpoint of our free cash flow before growth guidance remains unchanged at $1.290 billion. Next, we received $689 million of securitization proceeds from ERCOT related to Winter Storm Uri in late June, which net of the bill credit issued to C&I customers brings the total net inflow for 2022 to $599 million. As mentioned before, we expect to receive an incremental $80 million of cash proceeds from some additional recovery. Focusing next on change from last quarter, since mid of this year we have repurchased an additional 143 million of shares towards our $1 billion repurchase program, leaving a robust $595 million to be completed by year-end. Next, we have reduced the amount of expected other investments by the net cash proceeds of the sale of our interest in the Watson facility for $59 million. Lastly, given the additional Uri recovery and asset sales net cash proceeds, we have increased capital available for allocation by $141 million. As you see in the far right column, the total remaining capital available for allocation is $456 million, of which we have earmarked approximately $100 million to fund the initial project in our $2 billion growth plan, including the initiatives that are being launched to accelerate the growth of our Goal Zero business. The remaining $356 million will be allocated later in the year as we earn the cash. Back to you, Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Alberto. I want to provide some closing thoughts on Slide 13. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on all our strategic priorities. As we have done in the past, over the remainder of 2022, our team will work tirelessly to improve our results. I am confident we have built the right platform and have the right strategy to deliver strong and predictable earnings and create significant shareholder value. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Felicia, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time. How are you guys doing? Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, hey. So Mauricio, I'd love to hear -- I want a couple of strategy questions to you today. As you think about this year, how do you think about the desire to continue with the generation portfolio, have the latest events pushed you towards saying maybe we should reevaluate the integrated strategy and the pivot towards retail or actually, are you even more convinced in this strategy and could we see you engaging in more contracting? And maybe to that end, could you also marry this up with some of the comments around PPA strategy you guys have been undertaking in prior periods, are you thinking about doubling down on that considering the higher energy price environment today? Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. Well Julien, let me start with the retail engine. I mean, as you can see on the numbers, it is incredibly, incredibly strong. Customers are in this environment, I described them as a flight to safety and obviously, Elizabeth can talk a little bit more about that. But when I think about the supply strategy, you really need to think about, okay, what is the retail that I need to serve and what is the supply that better serves that retail. It always starts with that. Now we have been in a path where we don't want to rely completely on our own generation to supply our retail. We want to make sure that we have a supply strategy that is diversified. And that was the big lesson learned from Winter Storm Uri. We don't want to have a single point of play there [ph]. So what you should expect in the future is a combination of our own generation and third-party megawatts to supply our retail loan. Now on the generation side, obviously we are -- we always have invested in the fleet. Right now, I think the maintenance CAPEX that we have on the fleet per year is in the order of $200 million. But we have to recognize that the generation fleet has been going through a period, almost a 10-year period of very low gas prices. And our maintenance CAPEX is sized according to that, right. Not every megawatt matter in a $2 or $3 gas price environment. Now that it is resetting itself to much higher natural gas and power prices we're going to right size our maintenance CAPEX to make sure that every megawatt is available because every megawatt matters at a dollar per MMBtu. So that's the first thing that I will say on the generation side.  Now on the third-party megawatts, we actually use a combination of things. The first one is we have PPAs. We started that with wind and solar and now we have expanded that to storage and some gas peakers. And I can talk to you about the opportunities that we have within our own fleet for those gas peakers and how do we partner with other people on that. We have tolling agreements, we have bilateral physical contracts, we have financial hedges. So it is a combination of things that allow us to just have a very diverse supply strategy. Now remember, the main difference between own generation and third party is that on our own generation, we are exposed to operational risk. And on the third-party megawatts, we're exposed to counterparty risk. But the attributes of those megawatts are basically the same. It is just what type of risk you want to carry.  So as I think about in the future, the strategy of relying on third-party megawatts is completely consistent with how we see things in the future. We're seeing more wind, more solar, we're going to start seeing more storage, and we want to make sure that our supply is keeping up with the transition that we're seeing in the electric grid, right. So just relying on our generation portfolio, is not keeping up with the transition that we're seeing in the market. And that's why this combined strategy of own generation and third-party megawatts, I think, is the right strategy to better serve our load. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just to clarify and boil that down to make sure I heard that essence of the last one. Are you talking about contracting out more gas peakers and could that result in new gas peakers in for instance, ERCOT here, just to make sure I'm hearing this right? Mauricio Gutierrez : Correct. So when you think about the PPA strategy, we started with wind and solar, and this is really bringing new megawatts to the market. We provide them long-term contracts because our retail supply, our retail low, and we can actually bring these new megawatts to market because they can now finance those power plants. We're now extending that to storage, and we actually are running RFPs on storage that gives us a lot of visibility in terms of what's in the market. For now, we have expanded that to gas peaking. And the gas peaking, not only we need to -- we can rely on developers but keep in mind, we already have a lot of brownfield opportunities within our sites. And I will tell you today that we've been working over the last year and half in identifying new projects. We actually have one that is show already fully permitted. Another one is right behind it. And right now, we want to explore potential partnerships where we can bring capital from other entities, we can take the offtake and we can be also the developer since we have a long history of power plant development. So I think it can be a win-win for everybody. So we don't need to use our own capital to develop these plans and still benefit from this incremental megawatts in the grid. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And just to make sure I'm hearing you right, this would be effectively monetizing upfront the development rights that you have on your brownfield to another party that you're developing megawatts, not taking the operational risk, but ultimately enabling new assets to be developed in ERCOT. Mauricio Gutierrez : Exactly. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Alright, excellent. I have asked you enough here, but thank you so much for elaborating on that, really critical here. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you Julien. Operator : Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey guys, good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning Shar. Shahriar Pourreza : Mauricio, as we look at sort of the balance of the year, how should we sort of think about maybe the size and shaping of the lever as you laid out to maybe help get you back to that midpoint, could sort of that synergy upside from Direct Energy health there? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean there will be a combination of things, Shar. As Alberto pointed out, I mean, we're looking at -- and we've been working on this because as part of the transitory items, we wanted to mitigate also those transitory items. So we've been working on this throughout the year. That is -- do we have the opportunity for onetime cost savings, obviously, the Direct Energy synergies, we feel very comfortable with the number, but we are now looking at spicing that and working on it. Obviously, we need to make insurance proceeds and whether we can accelerate some of these insurance proceeds, and Alberto already mentioned some of that. Look, I mean, that's not completely dependent on us, but that doesn't mean that we're going to work hard to accelerate that. And then -- so I would say that some are some of them are levered. I also want to mention that we run this business for cash. And I think the sale of Watson, it is an example of us being completely focused in monetizing the value of our portfolio. And if we can accelerate some of the divestitures of noncore assets, we're going to continue to do that, to bring cash in this year to make up for the cost of the unit insurance outage. So there is a number of things that we're doing Shar to make up for the lost earnings of the Unit 8 outage. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay, perfect, that helps there. And then just lastly, I know you guys mentioned retention is exceeding your internal targets. Just is this split fairly evenly between East Texas or is it skewed? And then just curious how East has held up with a heavier C&I book? Thanks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. I'll turn it over to Elizabeth for kind of the East Texas split, but I will tell you that the -- I mean, the retail engine is really, really strong. And as I said in the previous answer, we're seeing a flight to safety and our brands are that flight to safety. So we're seeing really, really strong numbers, but Elizabeth, can you provide additional detail. Elizabeth Killinger : Yes. Thanks for the question, Shar. We are seeing really strong retention Mauricio mentioned, 5% above expectations. That's really driven by our unmatched analytics and care capabilities. We also have a significant amount of customer and community loyalty and of course, the compelling products. From a Texas versus East, pretty consistent, maybe a slight advantage in Texas, but it's not dramatic. And we're also seeing retention better than expected from the DE acquisition. So really, our -- the strength of our platform right now, especially during the -- with the volatility in the COGS. I mean, we're so pleased with how resilient our platform is through this. And frankly, the strength of our channel, both sales and marketing channels to pivot within regions and between regions. So yes, it really is a strong platform. Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect, that is super helpful. Very good color this morning guys. Thanks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you Shar. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys thank you for taking my questions. And congrats for being able to keep the guidance range during a tough operational time given the Parish outage. Just curious [Multiple Speakers] the history of Texas, shows that there are power price and heat rate blowouts that happened in an unusual time. I mean if I go back in time, you own the Reliant business because of what I thought was an April heatwave blowout that happened 12-14 years ago or so. Just curious, with Parish, one of your base load units out through the second quarter next year, can you just talk about how much gas fire generation you have under contract for next year, meaning whether it's a hedge from a gas-fired unit or whether it's a PPA or a toll from a gas-fired unit, we've seen some periods recently where some of the renewable units were running fine and then all of a sudden due to cloud cover shut down and it caused a price blowout, happened a couple of some days ago in Texas, so just trying to think about how much backup you've got from third-party fossil for the period when Parish is out? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Michael. So I think in the last earnings, I provided an indication of our hedge for 2023. And if you recall, that one had against the expected law that we have for 2023 half comes from third-party megawatts about half comes from our economic generation. And then we have an economic generation that is maintained as insurance, our own uneconomic generation. So there is a co -- it's just a lot of combination in that third-party megawatts. We have some tolling agreements with combined cycle plants. We have some heat rate options with peakers, we actually have some heat rate options with -- or actually out-of-the-money call options from the financial market. So there is a combination of tools that we have to be able to manage weather variability in any given year. Now as you mentioned, I mean, the second quarter was pretty extreme. We always plan for some weather variability but what we actually saw in the Spring and July is record-breaking heat in Texas. And while we manage for some variability, it is incredibly expensive to manage for all weather variability now. Now perhaps one of the lessons learned here is as we think about 2023 and given that we have a lot of time to plan for how to set up the portfolio for that year, I expect that we're going to buy a little bit more insurance for extreme weather than in the past. And I think that's -- I mean, that's going to be the prudent thing to do given what we're seeing in Texas. I mean the peak -- the record peak was broken by, I think, 5,000 megawatts. I mean the old peak was 75,000. Now the new peak is close to 80,000 megawatts. I mean year-over-year 7%, 8% increase. I mean, that's pretty significant. And I think we need to recognize that. Perhaps we're going to see greater weather, extreme weather events, and we need to plan for it. Michael Lapides : Well -- and Texas is showing massive robust demand growth, way above the national average. Part of that is just residential new connect, people moving there. Part of that is [indiscernible] chem industrial demand. Part of it is probably crypto mining, which they're all kinds of dockets that are patents PCT [ph] discussing the impact of that. If we enter a sustained period where Texas load -- peak load growth is in the 3% to 5% range for a number of years, would that alter your power procurement strategy and your asset ownership strategy at all, meaning if demand comes in for a multiyear period, way above what we saw in the last three to five years? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, well, absolutely. So two things on that, if demand is growing at 3% to 4% a year, that's really good for us because if we maintain our market share, that means we're growing our retail business, and that's really, really good, and that's what we want to see. Now obviously, we need to make sure that we keep up our supply strategy with that incremental demand. And the way we're going to do it is, one, as I mentioned, I think there is an opportunity for us to bring new megawatts in some of our current sites and those would be primarily gas peaking and energy storage. And we are -- as I mentioned, we already have at least one project that is being fully permitted and is shovel-ready and now it's just a matter of what's the right partner to bring into the table. We have another one that is right behind it and is in the process of getting permitted. And I'm sure that -- and I will tell you, the team is already looking at other opportunities where we can bring storage there. So I think you're going to see us participate on that new dispatchable quick-start generation opportunity in our sites, but not necessarily with our capital. And we will be the off-taker. In addition to that, we're going to continue bringing new wind and solar and energy storage as we have done already with our current PPA. So we're looking at these in kind of these two ways, bring new megawatts that are viable [ph] cost in the form of wind, solar and perhaps storage. And bring contract also with new gas peaking dispatchable generation in our existing sites, but not necessarily with our capital. Michael Lapides : Got it. And one last one in this probably in Elizabeth question. Just curious, over the last year or so, can you talk about what your Texas customer count has done since the Direct Energy acquisition, so January of 2021, like how much is your mass market customer count up since the Direct deal meaning if I did it apples-to-apples? And then what are you seeing on the residential level at a usage per customer basis? Elizabeth Killinger : So from a customer count perspective, year-over-year between -- since the DE acquisitions, relatively steady, a slight decline. And as I have mentioned before on calls, from a customer count perspective, year-over-year between -- since the DE acquisition, relatively steady, a slight decline. And as I have mentioned before on calls, when we do both book acquisitions and large acquisitions, there's a bit of a settling period in the first year or two. And so we've seen that. But as I mentioned earlier, we're performing better than we expected and modeled from those acquisitions. From customer usage perspective, in the ERCOT market relatively steady, although with weather we're seeing an increase especially in this second quarter versus prior period. So we do expect customer usage to be either steady or growing with the electrification of people\u2019s lives and communities. Mauricio Gutierrez : Right. I mean, I think, Michael, you need to think about that usage in two contexts weather normalize and then weather affected. And I think what you saw in Q2 is a significant increase in usage per customer because of weather. But we're also seeing an increase in usage per customer because of the electrification of the economy, right. So you can point to electric vehicles, you can point to a lot of different things that are driving this electrification that will increase the usage per capita. Michael Lapides : Got it, thank you guys. Much appreciated Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Michael. Operator : The next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport. Agnieszka Storozynski : Good morning. So I wanted to change the topic just for a moment. The pending inflation bill and the benefits that your nuclear plants could get some nuclear PTCs. I'm just struggling to gauge what is the price that STP is hedged at say for the next year or two, as we're trying to calculate the delta between that and the $44 per megawatt hour that this bill would rank? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, good morning Angie. Well, I mean, so clearly, this deal could potentially be a positive for nuclear owners, including us. And as you mentioned, I mean, I think everybody is looking at, okay, what is that trigger that will allow us to get the PTCs or not. So that's a moving target. And obviously, that's a moving target with the market, right, like everybody else. So I'm not sure if I can give you that level of specificity in terms of what price is hedged because we look at it on a portfolio basis. But I mean, this is something that we'll start to -- I guess, outlined as this bill progresses and if passed, then we will need to have that level of clarity to ensure that we can support and justify the incremental PTC, but that's something to be worked on. Agnieszka Storozynski : Okay. And then going back to the hedging of your retail book. So one thing that sort of surprised me is that, I mean, you -- when you hedge your retail book, you always have all kinds of delta hedges and options in order to protect you against unplanned outages also spikes in usage. So I would have thought that Parish was not a big component of the supply stack to start with, given coal supply constraints, and then you should have had those additional hedges, so I'm a little bit surprised that the impact is this big? And then lastly, when you show your drivers for the year, I don't see any comments about any uptick and bad debt expense and we see it at regulated utilities, so I was just wondering how you manage that? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Angie. So as you mentioned, we always plan for some forced outages and some weather variability. I think the impact here is that the outage was in a pretty large coal unit close to 600 megawatts with prices where they were in the forward market starting in May. That unit is pretty deep in the money. So as you mentioned, I mean, the coal conservation that we have was really in the shorter months and perhaps in some of these shorter hours. But in the peak hours, this unit was expected to be there to help manage and supply our load. The unique situation here is both happened at the same time. We had a forced outage on a large coal unit exactly at the time when we had record-breaking heat, and that really goes outside of kind of this planning area that we look at. So this was the combination of these two very extreme conditions. And it's not like we don't plan for it, but we don't plan the intersection of both of them exactly as we're leading into the summer. Now we use some of our uneconomic generation, and it was very effective, but this uneconomic generation that we have, some of the gas peakers, they come at a really high cost given where the natural gas price is today. So if you're at $8, $9 gas and you're deploying 12, 13 peak rate peakers, the cost of that is pretty high, although it -- us from buying the cap, for example, but it's still pretty high compared to where the cost of generation is for our coal plant. Anything to add, Alberto. Alberto Fornaro : Yes, Angie, so regarding your question regarding -- related to bad debt expenses, we are not seeing any pickup in the bad debt expenses considered now the level of receivables is much higher, given the level of gas prices and power. So when we see percentage is absolutely in line. And even we look at late payment fees and so on, and it's pretty normal, particularly in Texas. So for the time being, we are not seeing any sign of deterioration of the quality of our receivable portfolio. Agnieszka Storozynski : Great, thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you Angie. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Yeah hi, good morning everyone. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning Steve. Steven Fleishman : Hey Mauricio. The -- you mentioned increasing the maintenance CAPEX on the fleet from the $200 million, how much higher might that go going forward. Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, I mean we're a value -- yes, Steve I mean we're going to evaluate these. But obviously, if your plants are a lot more profitable than they were, let's say the last five to six years under a low gas environment, they can support incremental maintenance CAPEX. And not only they can support, it's advisable, right. Because right now, every megawatt counts. Before we had a lot more megawatts that were marginal and we don't necessarily need it to have that maximize the output of the plant. Now we really need to maximize the output of the plant. And look, the capacity factors, the amount of time that these plants are going to run are going to be more than they have been in the past, and we need to take that into consideration. So I would say that there will be an increase. I don't think it's a step-up change from the maintenance CAPEX. But it is -- we need to right size it to the amount of run hours that the unit is going to have, number one. And number two, for the profitability of the plant, right. So every megawatt counts, and I want to make sure that we have it available when we need them. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Great. On the Parish outage and the insurance, so I assume you're not assuming you're going to book any business interruption proceeds this year, it will be next year? Mauricio Gutierrez : Alberto? Alberto Fornaro : Yes, it is correct. However, based also on the experience with Limestone, we're trying to accelerate the property damage, insurance proceeds, and link it basically to the expenses and the CAPEX that we're going to deploy this year. So that's the area where we see more opportunity. Steven Fleishman : Okay. So just high level, you have the $200 million plus cost this year. Then next year, there will be some cost that continues in the first half, but then you'll have a benefit for business interruption that should offset -- should be more meaningful than the cost in 2023? Alberto Fornaro : Correct. Steven Fleishman : Yes. Okay. And then just a high level, I know somebody asked about the impact of IRA for the nuclear plant. But just maybe more broadly, could you -- there's a lot of provisions in this bill in different ways that could impact the business, so just could you just talk to anything else that particularly you're particularly focused on? Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. I mean the -- I mean the two big ones is what is the impact on wind and solar, renewable energy, and what is the impact on nuclear, right. So, on wind and solar we can see a reengagement and an acceleration of renewable development which we have benefited from and our team is ready to start the conversation with developers again. And then on the nuclear side, we're going to be looking at what is the benefit that we can have with our SPP facility. And like every other nuclear generator in the country, I'm sure that they're starting to do the math to figure out how do we benefit from these production tax credits. So I would say those are the two big areas where we are focused on and that can impact our business. Steven Fleishman : Okay, thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you Steve. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's program. I will now turn the call back over to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Felicia, and I look forward to speaking with you shortly. Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Katherine. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call will be 45 minutes in length and being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcast. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, please see the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Please refer to today\u2019s presentation. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for your interest in NRG. I am joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home; Rob Gaudette, Head of Business and Market Operations; and Chris Moser, our Head of Competitive Markets and Policy. I\u2019d like to start with the three key messages for today\u2019s presentation on Slide 4. We are narrowing our 2022 EBITDA guidance to the bottom end of the range, as we indicated on our last earnings call and we are initiating 2023 financial guidance in line with our Investor Day plan. We continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities and have now completed the initial phase of our test and learn program. The insights that we have gained from this process will inform our next phase of growing from our core energy business into adjacent essential home services. Finally, as I committed to you, we are announcing our 2023 capital allocation plan, which includes an incremental $600 million share repurchase program, consistent with our long-term capital allocation principles. Our business performed well during the third quarter, which was characterized by extreme price volatility and record load in our key Texas market. I am very proud of our team which once again achieved another quarter of top decile safety performance despite these challenging market conditions. As you can see on Slide 5, we delivered $452 million of adjusted EBITDA entirety of the change compared to last year was previously identified with 60% coming from asset sales and transitory impacts and 40% from the unplanned outage at our W.A. Parish facility. With these results, we are narrowing our 2022 EBITDA guidance to the bottom end of the range. Alberto will provide additional details in his section. We also made good progress on all our key strategic priorities. We have now achieved our direct energy synergy target for 2022 and remain on track to achieve the full run-rate of $300 million by next year. We continue to optimize our generation portfolio by retiring uneconomic fossil fuel plants, monetizing non-core assets and partnering for brownfield development. As part of this effort, we are selling the Astoria side for approximately $200 million in net cash proceeds. On our growth program, we continue to focus on cross-selling power and gas to our existing customer network. And with respect to our test and learn program, we have gained significant insights and are ready to start executing on our plan. I will discuss in greater detail later in the presentation. We also have made good progress on our $1 billion share repurchase program for 2022 with $603 million completed to-date and $397 million yet to be completed. Finally, today, we are introducing 2023 financial guidance of $2.27 billion to $2.47 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $1.52 billion to $1.72 billion of free cash flow before growth in line with our Investor Day outlook. As I mentioned to you, weather conditions in Texas were extreme this past summer, with ERCOT surpassing the old peak demand record 39x driven by record heating the early part of the summer and a strong Texas economy. As you can see on the bottom left of the Slide 6, power price expectations, which are shown in the light blue bars were as wide as I have ever seen them. This volatility was the result of record low, coupled with uncertainty around production from non-dispatchable renewable generation. Importantly, it took record sustained hit coupled with low renewable production to materialize into the high real-time power prices we experienced in May and July. It is worth pointing out that even during these scarcity periods, we never triggered an emergency event, not even once. This is a testament that the Texas grid is strong and working as intended with enough capacity to meet current and future demand. Turning to the right hand side of the slide, we continue to see strong demand from our customers with no notable increase in bad debt levels. Retention has also remained strong, driven in part by our unmatched insights to pricing and customer preference, which enables us to navigate periods of high price and high volatility. We have also been successful in extending the average term of a new Texas customer contract to 2 years. This extension is good for both our customers and our shareholders, given it adds stability and predictability to customer bills and our earnings. On the supply side, our generation portfolio performed well during the summer while the team managed the impact of the W.A. Parish Unit 8 outage. We were able to expand our maintenance program ahead of the summer, which resulted in better operational performance. Looking ahead, and as I discussed in our last call, we will increase maintenance capital in our plants, given higher power prices. Now I\u2019d like to spend some time talking about our ongoing efforts in moving closer to the customer. We introduced the diagram on Slide 7 during our Investor Day to capture our vision of the smart home. As you can see from the table on the right, we have made substantial progress in laying the foundation to execute on our vision to become the leading provider of essential services at home. During the year, we evaluated over a dozen adjacent offerings and engaged in multiple partnership pilots for EVs on solar and other home services. By starting small, it allowed us to stay nimble, while gathering critical market intelligence to inform how we approach these new customer offerings. The result of these programs helps validate our assumptions and provides confidence in how to execute our customer-centric strategy. Now, let me put a finer point on our key findings on Slide 8. First, the Internet of Things is here and is enabling the smart home opportunity. People are connecting new devices everyday with an average of 25 devices per home. This number has more than doubled since 2019 and continues to grow rapidly, resulting in multiple interfaces that don\u2019t necessarily interact with each other. Customers want simple, connected and customized experiences. It is clear that a single interface for the home is of increasing importance and customer attitudes around these services are shifting from nice to have to need to have. Next, the electrification of the economy through smart technology and clean energy choices is real. We are seeing an increasing number of devices and appliances connected like HVAC, water heaters, battery, rooftop solar, and other, in addition to having greater penetration of electric vehicles. Finally, customers are demanding access to cleaner, affordable and more resilient solutions. This is in part driven by a desire to be a part of a more sustainable future, reinforced by a need for resiliency in the face of more extreme weather. And importantly, this has been accelerated by advancements in technology and policy. With this integrated ecosystem at home, there is a significant value opportunity as you can see on the right hand side of the slide. For NRG, we can offer adjacent products and services that leverages our existing energy operating platform, allowing us to access cost savings and provide superior customer experience. This advantage means broader insights into how customers interact with their homes, which translates into additional margin opportunities and increased brand loyalty. Now turning to Slide 9, in 2023, we will increase efforts to grow our bundled expansion products and services through a mix of existing offerings, strategic partnerships and vertical integration. All of them aimed at making NRG the leading provider of essential services at home. We are also providing our capital allocation plan for 2023, which is in line with our long-term capital allocation principles. Our plan is to return 50% of our capital available for allocation to our shareholders with an incremental $600 million share repurchase program and an 8% increase in our annual dividend. For the remaining 50%, we are allocating $331 million to identify growth investments and reserving $620 million to be deployed throughout the year to the highest return opportunity between growth and share repurchases. So with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review. Alberto Fornaro : Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 11 for a review of the third quarter results. Energy delivered $452 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $350 million decline versus prior year. Similar to our Q2 results, this year-over-year decline was the result of previously announced variances. As shown in the chart on the bottom left side of the slide, \u20ac190 million of the decline was from asset sales and retirements, plus the transitory items included in our initial guidance. The remaining $125 million variance is almost entirely due to the replacement power costs related to the unplanned Parish Unit 8 outage and maintenance expenses in the same unit for which we expect reimbursement from the property insurance company in Q4 of this year. Texas adjusted EBITDA declined $263 million compared to the third quarter of last year. July was the second hottest month of record dating back to 1895 which drove extreme price volatility and higher load. This amplified the financial impact of the unplanned outage given the need to replace this power with a mix of higher cost internal generation and market purchases to satisfy the weather-driven increase in demand. Q3 results in Texas were also impacted by higher operating costs in the form of increased maintenance expense. Approximately half of the increase was for work at W.A. Parish Unit 8 that will be reimbursed by insurance in Q4 and the remaining increase from our maintenance program that helped insurers\u2019 strong reliability of the rest of the fleet through a volatile summer. Turning to the East, West & other segment, the year-over-year decline of \u20ac52 million was primarily driven by the reduction from previously announced asset sales and retirement and supply chain constraints. Now after taking those items into account, adjusted EBITDA increased by $111 million compared to Q3 2021 from increased revenue rate, natural gas optimization and operations at Cato [ph]. Briefly referencing year-to-date results, Energy has delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.39 billion, a $671 million decline versus prior year. The drivers of our year-to-date results are similar to that of the quarter with permanent and transitory items, the unplanned outage of W.A. Parish Unit 8 and increased maintenance expenses driving the decline versus prior year. The free cash flow before growth for both Q3 and year-to-date results have been impacted by reduced year-over-year EBITDA levels, as discussed earlier, and an increase in net working capital. Working capital requirements increased progressively during the year due to higher gas and power prices and in Q3 to the combined effect of higher seasonal power receivables and natural gas inventories. We have also seen a $32 million increase year-over-year in maintenance CapEx, driven entirely by spending to repay the Limestone and the W.A. Parish Unit 8 facility. This increased spend will be recovered by year end through property insurance proceeds. Next, I want to update you on the achievement of direct energy synergies. We have achieved our full year target of $50 million during the quarter and continue to remain focused on achieving the full $300 million run-rate next year. Now moving to the full year 2022 guidance, we are narrowing our adjusted EBITDA range to $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion. In line with my previous comment of success in partially offsetting the $220 million negative impact from Parish Unit 8 and planned outage. At this time, we are at the bottom of the range. Now given the implied strong Q4 results, let me provide additional details. We are expecting over a $200 million increase versus prior year, about $100 million coming from direct energy synergies, insurance proceeds for Limestone and Parish and other general cost reduction, the remaining coming from power and natural gas optimization opportunity leading us to make our natural gas fleet fully available in Q4. Now turning to 2022 free cash flow before growth guidance, we are reducing our full year guidance range to $950 million to $1.050 billion with one-third of the reduction from the narrowing of the adjusted EBITDA guidance and two-thirds from the temporary increase in working capital from higher prices and inventories. And so as we head into the winter season, we made a conscious decision to increase our inventory levels for both natural gas and coal to provide contingency against the transportation challenges and the potential for extreme winter weather driving a $50 million reduction in the free cash flow for the year. We have captured the reversal of these higher inventory quantities in our guidance for 2023, which I will discuss later in the call. In addition to the higher inventory quantities, prices for natural gas and power have also increased since the last call, resulting in an additional value of our inventories and net receivables for approximately $140 million. which will be reversed with lower commodity prices. The combined $190 million impact of these factors result in reduced expectation for 2022 and free cash flow before group. I will now turn to Slide 12 for an update on our planned 2022 capital allocation Consistent with past practice we have highlighted change from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left, we have updated the midpoint of our free cash flow before growth guidance by $290 million, $100 million EBITDA guidance and $190 million from increases in working capital. As you know, cash generation is a key objective for energy. And our team has been focused on offsetting this negative impact. We were able to assess a significant portion of those reductions by capturing $212 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of Astoria allowing us to utilize and distribute capital consistent with our commitments. Next, we expect to capture an additional $6 million from winter store remittance related to additional recovery. Next, we continue to make progress in executing our $1 billion share repurchase program. At the end of October, we have $397 million to be completed by around year end. And finally, we have committed $100 million of operating CapEx spend related to our $2 billion growth plan, which when coupled with our investments, other investments leads to $286 million of capital available for allocation. Moving to 2023, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance, we are pleased to announce that our expectation for 2023, in line with previous targets. We\u2019re introducing strong 2023 financial guidance of $2.27 billion to $2.47 billion for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth of $1.52 billion to $1.72 billion. EBITDA guidance includes the full year impact of asset sales and other permanent banks that we captured in our guidance for 2022. Although we expect some continued impact from cold constraints, we are able to offset those and the other transitory items that impacted our 2022 guidance. I will now turn to Slide 14 for the introduction of our 2023 $1.9 billion capital allocation plan. As Mauricio mentioned, in his section, our capital allocation is directly in line with our long-standing principle and cadence of allocation. Today, we are starting the conversation by allocating 50% to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases and allocating a portion of the 50% opportunistic back to identified group, leaving 35% to be allocated throughout the year to the highest returning investments while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Now moving left to right, we start with the midpoint of our free cash flow before growth guidance range of $1.62 billion, plus $286 million of unallocated 2022 CAFA, capital available for allocation, totaling $1.9 million in capital for allocation. Next, we have allocated $220 million identified for our growth program and $111 million for other investment to fund additional investment to support the integration of Direct Energy, innovation projects and Small Book acquisition. Next, on return on capital, we are allocating $347 million to dividends, consistent with our 7% to 9% annual dividend per share growth target and announcing a new share repurchase program of $600 million to be executed immediately following the full execution of our current $1 billion program. Finally, this leaves $628 million of 2023 capital available for allocation to be allocated throughout the year. We look forward to providing you with updates to our progress throughout 2022. Back to you, Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Alberto. I want to provide some closing thoughts on Slide 16. We have made significant progress across all of our key priorities this year, including the direct energy integration, portfolio optimization and our test and learn program and returning capital to shareholders. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the team\u2019s efforts and focus over the last 24 months on executing our strategy. As we look into 2023 and beyond, we remain on track to achieve our long-term goals of high grading our earnings quality by expanding our customer lifetime value. and providing a compelling annual total return to our shareholders of 15% to 20% free cash flow before growth per share and 7% to 9% annual dividend growth. Our platform is well positioned to deliver strong and predictable results and create significant shareholder value as the leading essential home services provider. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Katherine, we\u2019re now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, Mauricio and team, pleasure to speak here. Thank you, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey, good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. I hope the parade made things okay this morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, it disrupted traffic a little bit, but there is nothing like a great celebration after that win. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely, absolutely. Well, hey, listen, I just wanted to start off strategically here. We\u2019ve been at it for a little bit here in the transformation, power prices remained relatively higher. How do you think about this state of the generation portfolio overall, how are you thinking about and evolving your decision tree on that? Obviously, we saw a story here in the quarter. But even beyond that, how are you seeing things, whether that\u2019s tied to or driven by IRA or otherwise here in terms of optimizing your generation portfolio? Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Julian. Well, so let me take a little bit of a step back because obviously, you need to look at the generation portfolio in light of our integrated retail platform, right? I mean we have said that the goal of the generation portfolio now is to help better supply and serve our customer needs. So when I think about our generation portfolio, I think about our overall supply strategy, and that is one where we have decided to diversify our supply to have some internal generation to have third-party PPAs and obviously, market purchases. All of those three things make our supply strategy. Now with respect to the generation portfolio, as you mentioned, higher power prices have led us to basically self-insure to have greater reliability because the value of each megawatt is much higher today than it was just 10 months ago with higher power prices and higher gas prices. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to see an increase in our maintenance capital because we want to make sure that we have greater reliability on our fleet. Obviously, we\u2019re always optimizing our supply. And right now, the value that it provides for our integrated platform is very high. But if there is \u2013 there is always an opportunity to optimize that generation portfolio depending on market conditions and the opportunities that we see in the market. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Alright. Fair enough. I\u2019ll leave it there. Let me dive if I can to the other side of this equation, and that is just the guidance and sort of the cadence of the guidance. Great. Obviously, the implied fourth quarter is reasonably elevated. And certainly, that\u2019s despite some of the ongoing pressure points that we saw in the third quarter. Can you talk about what that implies to the cadence of results into \u201823 here? How do you think about the first half? How do you think about third quarter going forward, given the sort of evolution in your business model? Should third quarter into the future be perhaps a little bit more depressed relatively speaking? Can you just elaborate on what the implications are? Maybe that\u2019s been an Alberto question here? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Well, I\u2019ll turn to at but let me just give a little framework. I mean I think the big takeaway, I hope for everybody is that in 2023, we go back to the guidance or the outlook that we provided during our Investor Day. Our EBITDA guidance and our free cash flow guidance goes back in line with what we provided to you last year. We\u2019re turning the page. And we\u2019re just excited about the opportunities that we have to continue growing our business, our core energy business, but importantly, adjacent products and services. With respect to the seasonality of earnings, I think you should expect us going back to where we were perhaps in 2021. But Alberto, can you provide additional insights here. Alberto Fornaro : Yes. I think more than looking at first half versus the second half, I would say that probably you will see these two critical quarters have been the second and the third. And so you will see probably more balance and more in line, as Mauricio said, with the past and potentially even the fourth quarter that this year is higher than normal. So I would say, again, probably get back to 2021 profile is what we should expect. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Excellent. And that\u2019s inclusive of some of these coal dynamics annualizing here in the first half and some of the outage dynamics still net-net-net \u201821 kind of profile? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean if you think about some of these coal supply issues, we were very transparent last year when we introduced them. And the team has done a tremendous job in mitigating these core supply chain issues, particularly in Texas, I mean we continue to have some things in the East, and team is just working through that. But as I mentioned to all of you when we introduced these are temporary. The call supply chain was significantly stretched because of the very rapid increase in natural gas prices. And I also said with time both coal suppliers and railroad providers scale off again their operations, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in our \u2013 with our key suppliers. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Alright, guys. I will leave it there. Go Stros. Mauricio Gutierrez : Go Stros. Thank you, Julien. Operator : Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Your line is open. James Kennedy : Hey, guys. Good morning. It\u2019s actually James for Shar. Congrats on update, and thanks for taking the question. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey, good morning. James Kennedy : So I guess just starting with the \u201823 capital allocation plan, what are the trigger points of the time line expectations for the balance of the uncommitted capital? Are you potentially looking at more growth as we get through the year? Or is this just simply a function of waiting to see how the business performs through the first half? Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, yes, so two things. The first one is, as I committed to all of you, this year, we\u2019re actually announcing both our earnings guidance as well as our capital allocation. If you remember in the past, we used to provide the capital allocation in the fourth quarter earnings call. So the first thing is we\u2019re now providing these to much earlier than in the past. The second thing is always our capital allocation, we try to \u2013 the cadence happens with the cadence on when we generate cash, and this is not going to be any different. But as I said on my prepared remarks, the additional excess cash that we have available for allocation will be allocated throughout the year based on the highest return opportunity that we have. 2023, we start executing on our plan. We\u2019re evaluating opportunities. But if these opportunities don\u2019t yield a highest return compared to a share buyback, then we will allocate that to share buybacks, just that simple. James Kennedy : Okay. And then I guess kind of a similar question on the growth CapEx. How should we think about the timing and shape of any EBITDA accretion as you ramp up that spend? Is it something that we get more color on in steps as we roll the coming quarters or just any color there? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Well, I mean, remember that as we execute on our plan, we always have three options, right? We either build them or grow organically, we partner or we buy them, we acquire something. So in the build or organic growth, there is always a lag between when you make the investment and when you receive some of those earnings. And in the \u2013 similar to the partner, and I would say the acquisition, that really accelerates earnings immediately, right? So we\u2019re right now evaluating options and our both our business model and our go to market. The one thing that I will say is, as I think about the growth, there are some areas that \u2013 well, first of all, it\u2019s a very narrow scope and I provided that scope in the slide that I present to you today. The second thing is there are some areas where we know that we\u2019re not going to do it, that the business model is such that we will partner, for example, home solar. We\u2019re not going to go into the entire value chain of home solar. We are going to partner. We have a lot of lessons learned here, and I have been very clear about that. So the pace of which the earnings are going to come in, it is really going to be dictated by how do we execute our strategy and we go to market. So it will be provided to you in the coming quarters as we start executing. James Kennedy : Okay, I will leave it there. Thank you very much, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, James. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Your line is open. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So first, on the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act. So I see that there is a $45 million increase in cash taxes in your \u201823 free cash flow guidance. So \u2013 and I know that we\u2019re still waiting for the IRS to provide some more clarity on cash taxes. But can you talk in general how you see it over the next couple of years? Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning. Angie, I\u2019ll pass it to Alberto. Alberto Fornaro : Yes. First of all, Angie, let me say that the increase in the taxes \u2013 the tax payment that you see for 2023 are really due to two factors. One, we are forecasting a higher net income for the year and therefore, higher federal and state taxes. And the other piece is we got a refund for the BE on the DT side in 2022, that will not happen in 2023. And therefore, they are more or less half and of that explained increase year-over-year. We have \u2013 from the IRA, we have factored in our forecast the impact of the 1% taxes on share buybacks. However, there is no impact for the higher \u2013 for the minimum tax because at this moment, we don\u2019t have any indication that the payment based on 2023 net income will be done in 2023. And so when we have more information regarding when this payment, if any, is due, then we will update you. In general, I would say, as we have said in the past that it\u2019s very difficult to do forecasting based on the level of information that we have. But so far, all the indication is for relatively modest impact and also is a temporary impact that will recover after a few years. As soon as we get more details, we will be more precise. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. And then separately, also related to the same legislation, so I am assuming that you are seeing some pickup in renewable power growth, especially in Texas and I am just wondering if that means that you should soon announce some additional PPAs again, given that the availability of specialty solar assets should increase in Texas? Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. I will have Rob address that Angie. Rob Gaudette : Hi Angie, good morning. So, when you think about the IRA, you are spot on, right. It provides clarity to the renewable developers. We are in the market all the time, right. So, it\u2019s not \u2013 we have been kind of at this for a while. So, there is a couple of factors in here that we think about. One is availability for them to get their panels on the ground and get them installed. It\u2019s the developers in the pipeline that they are kind of working through. And then the IRA provides them some clarity around their financing. So, what I would expect, I haven\u2019t seen it yet, but I would expect that some of this clarity starts coming into more certainty around offers into us. And as opportunities show up, we will lock those up as they make sense for our portfolio. But you are right, the IRA should push solar, wind and battery development across all markets in the U.S. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. And particularly in Texas, when you look at the plan that ERCOT provides and what we are tracking, I mean most of the new generation is really renewable energy. So, this should help and accelerate. We have this capability pretty well. It\u2019s a well-oiled machine. We have been executing before there was a slowdown, and our expectation is going to pick up, and we have great visibility as to when that happens and also the economics around it. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And my last question is the maintenance expense, maintenance CapEx in 2023. So, I understand that you are spending more money in light of the higher level of power prices. But is this a level that we should actually expect going forward? Is this just a one-off year with like some major maintenance something that was either pulled forward or catch up from previous years? Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, I mean I will ask Alberto to address some of it. I mean my take, remember, 2023 has two big components, right. I mean the first one is the money that goes into the Unit 8 at W.A. Parish. And then the second one, obviously, is the increase in maintenance because we want our self-insured given that every megawatt is more valuable with higher power prices. I mean that\u2019s something that the market is going to dictate. What I will tell you is Adam incredibly proud of the team that is so near on our generation fleet during years where gas prices were very low, they tightened the belt, they adjusted the maintenance. It was the right decision because not every megawatt was as valuable as it is today. We very quickly pivoted to that. And as I mentioned, we put some capital at work before the summer that yielded really good results. And we are going to continue to do that. So \u2013 but I don\u2019t know if there is anything else you want. Alberto Fornaro : Yes. I just would like to point you to in the appendix, there is a page in which we highlight the impact on our maintenance CapEx coming in 2022 from Limestone and Parish and also for 2023. Long story short, when you eliminate the impact of these specific CapEx that we spend, you will see that there is around $40 million to $50 million increase in the maintenance CapEx, and this is really due to the fact that Mauricio was mentioning that given the current prices, we think that it is appropriate to increase the reliability of our fleet to basically catch all the opportunity that the current price environment is offering to us. Angie Storozynski : Alright. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Angie. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Lapides : Hey guy. Congrats on a good quarter. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Michael. Michael Lapides : I am looking at Slide 14. And I just want to make sure I understand some of this and a little bit of this may be more nuanced. So, the growth plan, the $220 million, can you \u2013 what asset \u2013 is that for one big asset, or is it for lots of little things? Mauricio Gutierrez : No. It is a \u2013 I mean this is really to support our test and learn. So, we have identified a number of opportunities and the scope of those opportunities are actually on Slide 7, Michael. So, when you look at whether it is solar, storage, electric vehicles, energy management, protection, security, I mean the scope is really around essential services, and this is what we have been able to identify today. Obviously, we are working through the execution of our plan and we will provide updates as we \u2013 throughout the year. Michael Lapides : So, let me just \u2013 and this might be one for Alberto. So, the $220 million in the growth plan and the $111 million and the other investments, are these all \u2013 like when I look through the three statements at this time next year, are they going to flow through CapEx or are they going to flow through cash from operating activities, meaning is it working capital, or do some of these actually weigh on EBITDA until they start generating EBITDA? Like your guidance for EBITDA would be higher if you weren\u2019t \u2013 if you weren\u2019t doing the spin. Alberto Fornaro : No. Regarding \u2013 okay, regarding the other investments, these do not impact EBITDA, there outside EBITDA. When you look at the growth plans there is a series of initiatives, and we will update you about what is going to EBITDA or not. But for the moment, it\u2019s still \u2013 as Mauricio said, it\u2019s a series of different initiatives and depending on which one we will prioritize, it will have more CapEx impact or not. Michael Lapides : Meaning some of the \u2013 alright, so the $111 million is all based \u2013 about $111 million is all capitalized. And the $220 million, some of it is capitalized and some of it is flowing through G&A or O&M? And therefore, I am just trying to make sure because like I am trying to think about recurring versus non-recurring impacts on EBITDA. Alberto Fornaro : That is a very good question. And what you said is correct. The $111 million, they will not impact EBITDA, the $220 million. There are some initiatives that could have an impact on OpEx and others that have an impact on CapEx. And we will qualify that in the next quarter. Mauricio Gutierrez : And just to put a finer point here, Michael. I mean the $220 million, and I want to highlight what could impact, right. But as we are in the process of executing and depending on how do we finalize the go-to-market will have an impact on whether it goes to CapEx and OpEx. So, that\u2019s as they say, CBD [ph] to be determined, Michael. But we will provide that transparency as we start executing on the plan. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay. Thanks guys. I will follow-up offline. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Arcaro : Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey. Good morning David. David Arcaro : I am wondering if you could talk a little bit to customer growth trends that you are seeing and any churn in the business? Are you still seeing kind of a flight to safety in this backdrop and this high commodity price backdrop, noticed that there was a slight decline in the total customer count versus the prior quarter? So, I am curious any information there. Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. Elizabeth? Elizabeth Killinger : Yes. Thanks for the question, David. We were really pleased with our performance, the team and the engine during a really volatile third quarter. We did perform, continued to perform in third quarter as we had year-to-date better than our budget. You may recall from prior discussions, we do generally see customer attrition from large M&A, which was DE, which was very large as well as from small book acquisitions, which we have done a handful of those year-to-date. But the good news is we are performing better than expected on both DE and the customer books. From a sales engine perspective, we are \u2013 we have a very strong engine over-performance in the quarter occurred in both our face-to-face and our digital channels. And cross-serve also performed very well during the quarter, better than budget. And from a retention perspective, we also are seeing really strong performance given the backdrop of very high prices from both the cost increases associated with the power to fulfill for them as well as the higher usage during some of the weather that we experienced. So, really pleased with the attrition during the quarter and looking forward to continuing to deliver for you guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. And just \u2013 I mean the team does a fantastic job on balancing customer account and margin. And that\u2019s what we do every day. We have tremendous insights from our customers. And as Elizabeth said, both our retention numbers and our bad debt numbers are pretty well in line, very robust and customer count is just a result of a very intentional strategy around balancing customer account and retail margins. So, I am very pleased with the team. David Arcaro : Got it. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then I was wondering if \u2013 maybe two quicker ones, but does the 2023 outlook include business interruption insurance proceeds coming in? Wondering how much of that might be in the guidance? And then maybe just a little more higher level, Mauricio, is there still more to do in terms of portfolio and real estate optimization with where the business currently stands? Is that something you will be looking at into 2023 as well? Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure, Alberto? Alberto Fornaro : Yes. Regarding the business insurance proceeds, I can confirm what we said in the prior year call and basically the negative impact of Parish 8 in the first half of 2023 will be absorbed by the insurance proceeds, and we have factored in our forecast. Mauricio Gutierrez : And with respect to the portfolio optimization, again, I mean this is something that we are looking on a continuous basis. We haven\u2019t stopped. I mean the Astoria sale in Watson is an example of what we are doing. A couple of quarters ago, I said that we are going to move into evaluating brownfield development, both in our Midwest fleet as well as in Texas. The team has been working on looking at these opportunities. And what I will tell you is also we are looking at potential partnering opportunities because we want to make sure that we \u2013 the capital that we use is the right structure. I don\u2019t want to create friction in the system if we don\u2019t have to. So, both in terms of brownfield opportunities and in terms of partnering opportunities, we have been very busy, and I hope to give you a more fulsome update in the coming quarters. David Arcaro : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Fleishman : Hi. Good morning. Thanks. So, just for the 2022 guidance, the \u2013 I think your Texas segment is down $275 million maybe from the initial guide. How much of that is attributed to the Parish, Limestone outages net of any money you are getting back this year? Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey. Good morning Steve. I will turn it to Alberto. Alberto Fornaro : Yes. And it\u2019s almost entirely the full amount that we highlighted in $220 million, Steve. So, that\u2019s the main, okay. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then the $175 million boost in East-West other. Could you just explain what\u2019s driving that? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Normally, Steve, we are very conservative of when we plan our gas optimization activity this year, given the fact there has been a lot of volatility, the performance has been very good in that area. And also, obviously, we are benefited so from some higher margin from prices coming from our generation fleet in the East. But normally, you will see that if we do better in the East is driven by the gas. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then just as we think about the \u201823 guidance, are you assuming that, that better optimization continues or that, that\u2026 Mauricio Gutierrez : Now, we are more established. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. It\u2019s always \u2013 I mean Steve, we always use market as an indication to guide us in terms of the profitability of our portfolio, right. So, if you look at the heat rates for 2023, we use market prices, market heat rates to inform our guidance. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. And then just the $400 million \u2013 $397 million of buyback, you intend to complete that fully in the market by year-end, not when you are going to do an ASR or something or? Mauricio Gutierrez : I mean our intention is to complete towards the end of the year, and that\u2019s basically our plan right now. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then on ERCOT market structure, I mean it\u2019s kind of gotten quiet, but I think there is a lot about to happen. So, just to the degree that they put in some kind of dispatchable market, separate market, how are you thinking about how that impacts your portfolio and how you manage that through the retail side? Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, I mean, a couple of things. And I think you are absolutely right, Steve. It\u2019s going to get really busy. I think middle of November, there is going to be a recommendation from ERCOT and the PUCT. We have been working with them alongside throughout this entire time. We provided a number of initiatives. I know that they are evaluating. At the end of the day, I think that\u2019s also going to be informed by how the Texas grid has operated. And as I said, I mean we broke the load record 39x this summer. And not even once we went into EA1, emergency situation. So, I think the grid is, well, when I look at the pipeline, it is very robust with lots of new renewable generation, so enough to meet current demand and future demand. So, I think that\u2019s going to inform some of it. At the end of the day, they end up with some sort of dispatchable product. We have been working really hard in terms of the brownfield opportunities on our own sites. And obviously, that will play really well for participants like us who have sites in good locations already connected to the grid. And I think that gives us a cost advantage that we intend to fully utilize and monetize. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. And there is no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to Mauricio Gutierrez, President and CEO, for closing remarks. End of Q&A: Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Catherine. Well, thank you all for your interest in NRG. And I look forward to continue updating you as we move to our next phase in the company. So, thank you all for your attention. Operator : And thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the call.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Josh. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcasts.  Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements which are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law.  In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home, Rob Gaudette, Head of Business and Market Officer; and Chris Moser, our Head of Competitive Markets and Policy. Starting on Slide 4 with our key messages for today's presentation. We have made significant progress in advancing our strategic priorities in 2022. And while our financial results were lower than expected, our business is well positioned in 2023.  Today, we are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance ranges. The Vivint Smart Home acquisition is on track to close by the end of the first quarter. Today, we are providing further disclosures around revenue synergies to ensure you have additional tools to properly value the transaction.  Finally, the core of NRG is strong, supported by favorable fundamentals. The acquisition of Vivint enhances our ability to achieve our free cash flow before growth per share targets.  Now turning to Slide 5 for the financial and operational results of 2022. Beginning with our scorecard for the year, we executed well across our strategic priorities. We delivered our second consecutive year of record safety performance. For me, it always starts and ends with the wellbeing of our people. I want to thank everyone at NRG for staying focused during a challenging year.  Our retail group took deliberate actions to manage price volatility and delivered record customer retention and extended the average term of a new customer to 2 years. Also, our bad debt remained below historical levels despite higher inflation and tightening financial conditions. Our plant operations performance was below expectations, primarily impacted by the outage at [indiscernible] Paris right before the summer.  We are taking additional steps to strengthen our supply and mitigate operational risk during specific conditions.  The direct energy integration is nearing completion and on track to deliver our run rate synergy targets in 2023. We executed on our test and learn program during the year, which culminated in the announcement of the Vivint Smart Home acquisition. We also continue our portfolio optimization with 2 gigawatts of coal retirements and asset sales. Finally, on capital allocation, we executed $645 million of share repurchases out of the $1 billion program. We will execute the remaining amount when cash is available and when we have full visibility to achieve our targeted credit metrics.  We also increased our dividend by 8%. Since it was reestablished in 2020, we have raised our dividend more than 25% and returned almost $1 billion to shareholders this way. I view our dividend as an integral part of our return on capital policy. Moving to financial results. We delivered $435 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter bringing our 2022 full year result to $1.754 billion, below expectations. For the fourth quarter, we highlighted in our last earnings call that reaching the bottom end of the financial guidance included a little over $100 million of optimization opportunities. Specifically, making our natural gas units available to capture value during periods of high power prices.  This opportunity did not materialize as mild weather during the quarter, the power price is much lower than expected. We were also impacted by winter storm Elliott in late December primarily from PJM capacity performance payments, where we risk adjusted downward our bonus payments pending additional information from PJM. Alberto will provide more information on our financial results.  Turning to Slide 6, our 2023 outlook. We are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance. We see improving fundamentals in our business, including more stable supply costs driven by lower natural gas prices, less supply chain issues for coal and chemicals, more favorable retail market conditions in the East and economic resilience in our customer base. In the East, we see opportunity for customer growth given rising rates from public utilities, enabling competitive retailers to demonstrate the value of our services to customers on an equal playing field.  In Texas, the Public Utility Commission proposed market design improvements that will result in more dispatchable generation and greater reliability of the aircraft grid. I want to commend the Texas Governor's office, legislature, and for taking swift action to enhance grid resilience while ensuring the integrity of the competitive market.  Also, retail competition will open in , Texas in the fall, a city with more than 100,000 electric customers. We look forward to having the opportunity to earn and serve customers in that area later this year. In 2023, we will continue executing on our strategic priorities focusing on strengthening our core business while growing ideation products and services, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide. We continue our focus on optimizing our portfolio to better serve our customers. To that effect, we are targeting $500 million in net cash proceeds from asset sales by the end of the year.  Having completed our test and learn phase in 2022, we are now focused on the next phase of our strategic road map, growing the business. This includes completing the direct energy integration and increasing the number of customers that purchase multiple products from us. Today, we have sold more than 1 product to 15% of our customers. We are making good progress on cross-selling and will provide additional disclosures as we integrate Vivint. To support this growth, we will continue to strengthen our power supply by expanding our capital-light PPA program for renewables to dispatchable generation at some of our existing sites.  Finally, we are on track to close dividend in the first quarter with all regulatory approvals received and no shareholder required. We expect to close financing soon and have begun day one integration efforts. I want to provide additional insights on how Vivint enhances our core energy platform and brings additional capabilities at scale on Slide 7. Vivint is a leader in smart home solutions with nearly 2 million highly engaged customers with an average life of 9 years. Their system brings together automation, security and residential solar under a single proprietary technology and data platform. This business is highly complementary to our core energy offering. We will use their smart home ecosystem to connect all our currently isolated products and services, including green power, batteries, EVs and other products into a seamless experience that is highly engaging and personalized. This engagement will provide tremendous insights into pricing, customer experience, a new solutions that create greater brand loyalty and longer average customer lifetime. As we leverage the smart home ecosystem, we expect to optimize energy demand inside the home, providing valuable services to the wholesale markets.  In other words, NRG will be the bridge between the home and energy markets with a unique ability to optimize and monetize value between the two. Vivint will also complement our existing energy product offerings and sales channels by adding home automation, security and residential solar at scale including a proven acquisition engine with a solid track record of growth and nearly 2 million customers.  On the right-hand side of the slide is the virtuous cycle that we have discussed in the past. By leveraging our existing platform, we can access meaningful cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, resulting in a better experience for our customers. All of this translates into a deeper understanding of how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core products and then the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business.  Now I want to disclose the value of opportunities that this combination represents on Slide 8. We have identified 3 main areas of value, growing and optimizing our network of customers, leveraging the platform to achieve cost synergies and improving the value of our core energy customers. With respect to the growth opportunity, we are targeting $300 million of incremental free cash flow before growth by 2025. We are encouraged by the preliminary work we have done on both sets of customers and look forward to fully optimize once the transaction closes.  As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, there is some overlap in our core energy markets, but it's relatively small. This is important because Vivint already has teams ready to be deployed in our core energy markets and because the addressable market opportunity for new customers will be even greater.  We expect to achieve this growth target in several ways as we target Tier 1 customers which we define as single-family homeowners with high credit scores within select urban areas. We will focus on 2 immediate and actionable opportunities. One, cross-selling existing products into our combined customer network of 7.5 million customers; two, selling bundle offers to new customers outside of our network representing 15 million potential households.  In addition, we will grow dividends organically in line with historical levels. These opportunities will be enhanced by optimizing our combined sales channels and best practices, leveraging the strength of both NRG and Vivint.  The capital required to achieve this growth is expected to range $500 million to $600 million over the next 3 years. For gross synergies, we have identified $100 million to be achieved by 2025, primarily from combining 2 public companies. For these, we expect $160 million of onetime cost to achieve.  Finally, on our existing core energy customers, cross-selling means we can have direct access to our customers in the East and the opportunity to expand margin and extend customer lifetime value. In total, we see a $400 million opportunity by '25 and a larger opportunity beyond given the size of the smart home addressable market.  I am confident in our ability to deliver these targets as we have a strong history of integration and synergy achievement. Just to remind you, since 2016, we have achieved significant value on integration synergies, cost reductions and enhancement programs. This effort will be led by the same team as the transformation plan and direct energy integration. I look forward to providing you a more comprehensive update later this year during our Investor Day.  Now turning to Slide 9. We want to give you an update on our pro forma outlook and how the dividend transaction supports our growth targets. On the left-hand side of the slide is a free cash flow before growth pro forma walk from 2023 to 2025, including the expected growth contribution from Vivint that we just discussed on the previous slide.  This illustrates the earnings power of the company and will be further unpacked once the transaction is closed. On the right-hand side of the slide is the expected capital allocation through 2025. As you can see, the combined platform provides the financial flexibility to have a balanced approach between growth and return of capital while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  The acquisition of Vivint and more specifically, the growth opportunity that it represents will better support our per share growth targets while materially high-grading our earnings quality and customer lifetime value. So with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review. Alberto Fornaro : Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 11 for a review of 2022 results. During our third quarter call, we stated that higher profitability in the fourth quarter would enable us to deliver an adjusted EBITDA at the bottom of our 2022 full year guidance range. To realize this, we mentioned that the higher profitability was partly related to insurance proceeds for Limestone Unit 1 and Paris [indiscernible], additional synergies and other cost reductions and the remaining from the opportunity to generate additional gross margin from the planned utilization of our gas fleet. Our forecasting process is based on forward market curves and at the time, the forward curves included higher power prices for the fourth quarter which would make the planned utilization of the gas fleet economical. Unfortunately, prices in the fourth quarter fell significantly below short of expectation.  On peak prices in Texas were 45% below expectation, resulting in lower profitability from our generation fleet. Near the end of December, winter storm Elliott brought sharp reduction in temperature for a short time, December 20-24. During the storm, flood surge was faster and significantly higher at the upper level of the expected range in both ERCOT and PJM for several hours. This drove spikes in power prices.  Our gas generation fleet in Texas, which was largely unutilized in the fourth quarter was called in to action. Given the significant gap between actual and expected load, the fleet was unable to completely match the additional demand. As a result, we portrayed additional power in the market at higher prices.  In the East, higher load led to a PJM reliability core for our units without any notice. Several of our larger units were reserved started the event and have longer startup times, which led to capacity performance, a negative impact given the lack of notice.  The lower-than-expected prices at the beginning of the quarter coupled with the impact of the winter storm drove unfavorable variances to our EBITDA expectation. The fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $435 million was below our implied guidance by $196 million. We estimated that the lower prices experienced for most of Q4 reduced the expected contribution of our gas generation by approximately $115 million. We also estimated a winter storm Elliott caused approximately $80 million in negative impact. This was primarily a result of the net impact of capacity performance in PJM as well as increased power purchases in ERCOT that were partially offset by an expected capacity performance bonds for the [indiscernible] plant.  When we look at the full year adjusted EBITDA of $1.754 billion, fell short of the midpoint of guidance at the beginning of 2022 by $346 million. There were 2 main drivers that impacted this result. First, the extended outage at Parish [indiscernible] with $220 million of lost margin that was partially offset by business interruption proceeds of $52 million; and second, the estimated $80 million impact of winter storm Elliott.  There was also an incremental $44 million of pension expenses resulting from reduced prices of financial assets in the second half of the year and some increased O&M expenses. Additional drivers include $15 million of reduced earnings for the divestiture of Watson and $16 million of growth expenses.  In 2022, free cash flow before growth came in at $568 million, with the deficit to our third quarter guidance driven primarily by the shortfall in EBITDA and two working capital drivers. First, that the insurance proceeds for Parish and Limestone that were forecasted for 2022 were accrued in the fourth quarter but received in January 2023, resulting at the end of the year in a $100 million increase in receivables.  Second working capital as an additional negative impact due to falling gas prices in the quarter which more rapidly impacted the account payables than the account received. Turning our attention to 2023, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. Before we review the 2023 cash available for allocation, I would like to provide updates with winter storm Yuri and direct energy synergies.  The 2021 net impact of winter storm Yuri was $380 million. During 2022, we were able to increase mitigant proceeds and reduced the total net cost to approximately $259 million. For future years, there will still be some cost recoveries associated with Yuri, but within the amount to be immaterial, and we will no longer update to these fees.  For direct energy synergies, we achieved a total of $84 million of additional synergies in 2022 with the related integration cost of $74 million bringing the total synergy achieved from the acquisition to $259 million. We are confident that we can achieve the remaining synergies, which are related to specific projects that will be completed in 2023. Therefore, we will no longer provide quarterly updates on our direct energy synergy process -- progress, but we will provide a final summary at year-end.  Now turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on our 2023 capital allocation. Moving left to right, with blue shading indicating updates. Excess cash from 2022 is equal to $40 million at year-end, plus $209 million in proceeds from the sales of Astoria which totals $249 million in the bottom left. Next, for Vivint, we continue to utilize its 2022 pro forma full year figures provided in our December call. Full year free cash flow below growth of $1.73 billion includes energy stand-alone guidance of $1.62 billion plus pro forma $110 million for EBIT. This includes the expected impact from debt financing. In addition, we included a $300 million of cash available from Vivint.  Next [indiscernible], we are targeting $500 million of leverage neutral net inflow from asset sales. The next investments are higher by $29 million following early realization of previously included winter storm Yuri [indiscernible] in 2022. Now moving to the far right bar, we expect a total of $434 million available for future allocation. This will fund the remaining share repurchase program upon full visibility of the achieving of our 2023 target credit metrics, which are detailed on the next slide.  Now quickly turning to Slide 13. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet. This slide has not changed since our last update. We are focused on achieving 2023 target credit metrics and investment grade credit metrics by late 2025 to 2026 through both debt reduction and growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Alberto. On Slide 15, I want to briefly outline our 2023 priorities and expectations. First and foremost is delivering on our core energy business goals. We will continue to strengthen our integrated platform and further optimize our portfolio. Second, we are focused on closing the dividend acquisition, integrating the business and delivering on our synergy commitments. Finally, we will stay disciplined on our capital allocation plan as we execute on our strategic priorities.  I am excited about this next phase of our evolution and look forward to providing you a comprehensive update at our Investor Day later this year. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Josh, we're ready to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Listen, I wanted to talk to you guys about the '25 outlook and just clarify this. As it pertains to the original conversation around, call it, $12.50 a share of , is this an implicit increase in expectations or roughly in the same ballpark? As I look at sort of what's implied on the numerator and denominator, seems like there could be a slight increase there. I just want to come back and clarify that as best you guys see it. And I have a quick follow-up. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean let me see if I understand the question. The pro forma that we show here could source in line with the free cash flow before growth targets that we provided you at Investor Day of 15% to 20%. So as you mentioned, what Vivint does is complements our share buyback and capital allocation program with a very attractive growth engine that we articulated in the call today.  Now, the Vivint transaction, I'm expecting that it's going to produce $400 million of free cash flow before growth, on top of the 2023 pro forma or guidance for NRG. So when I think about the 2025 pro forma, I will say that I'm very comfortable with the energy pro forma now that we have communicated the contribution of dividend, I will tell you that we have pretty good line of sight to deliver on that commitment of 15% to 20% growth. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And just clarifying this. I know you discussed an Analyst Day here, would you expect to roll that 25 forward at the time of the Analyst Day? Or could we get something sooner with the close and then considering that closed -- just super quick, if I can, we've seen some litigation out there around and what is possible, if you will, in recent days. Can you clarify how that may be impacting the process itself at this point? Just if you don't mind for a moment? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So I think what you should expect is at Investor Day, we'll provide you the 5-year plan that will go beyond 2025. I think that's the right time to articulate it obviously, the close and in subsequent weeks after the close and most likely on the earnings call, we will provide additional clarity in 2023 with respect to event, right? So with respect to the litigation that you're mentioning on the , we actually have looked at that, evaluated it, and we see very little risk in terms of closing the transaction. So keep in mind that this is not only for our industry, this is for all SPAC across all industry. And I see this more as just a clean of process than anything else. So the risk of impacting the closing of the transaction, I would say, is minimal. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Angie Storozynski : So maybe first on the '23 guidance. I mean it seems like it's a pretty good setup for the year. I mean power prices have fallen, you should have an advantage with gaining market share on the retail side, especially in the East, given the collapse in power prices and natural gas prices, there's been an improvement in working capital, there is the cost to replace the power for the WA Parish outage should have come down, and yet you kept the guidance range. So what's the offset to these positive drivers? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. No, Angie, I mean I'm glad that you went down the list because when I think about 2023, I would say that it's more conservative than we have did in 2022. Not only from what we control. So if you think about the characteristics of our plans, the assumptions that we use in our forecast are more conservative we have also -- remember now this is the second year that we have increased maintenance CapEx around our plans. So we expect greater reliability on them. And there is a lot of tailwinds on our guidance.  You already mentioned the dynamics in the East where prices for the default service utility providers are much higher, and I think we're going to have a great opportunity to gain market share. With the falling gas prices, that creates really good environment for us for managing our retail margin. So all of this is positive.  Now, let's just -- it's only February, right? So I want to make sure that we see at least a couple of months, and we have greater visibility on the rest of the year before we can provide you additional adjustments. But I think it's fair to say that I feel very confident that we can achieve our guidance and perhaps we are hearing on the conservative side with the number. But I think it is -- I think it's prudent given the type of volatility and extreme weather that we have seen in the past couple of years. Angie Storozynski : That's good, especially after this whole year. Okay. And then on the PJM capacity penalties. So it's my understanding that the disclosures that the generation companies were provided by PJM on Slide 8 only talked about penalties. So any sort of bonus capacity payments haven't been disclosed or calculated. So I know that, that's a '22 issue. But just talk to us about how you accounted for those offsets to the penalties on the capacity side. Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. I'll let Alberto cover. Alberto Fornaro : Yes. No, I mean it is -- from the penalty side, it is relatively simple because we have considered based on our record, what is the potential penalties that they can [indiscernible] in to account. On the bonus side, there is a lot of variables, including potential bankruptcy that can change the amount that will be distributed. And therefore, what we have done with the limited information available, we have estimated what is the best case scenario, the worst-case scenario and we have chosen a level we are comfortable. And therefore, we have, at the end of the day, risk adjusted the bonus for -- that we could get at the end of this process.  We will know more in the in the next months, but we are comfortable with what we have done. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So I think it's fair to say that penalties -- we have taken all of that into consideration and bonuses, we need more information from PJM. So we have risk adjusted down for that. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then lastly, so when you announced the event, there was a plan to execute on share buybacks a pretty meaningful $360 million. I mean, looking at the share count, you haven't done it. I understand that there is a plan for '23 to finish that $1 billion of the share buyback allocation. So just talk to me about the timing, why it hasn't happened yet. Were you waiting for the proceeds from Astoria? Is it somewhat of a reflection of the weak free cash flow generation for '22? And again, just roughly about when we should expect those buybacks to happen. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. No, I mean that's correct. So my expectation is that it will happen this year and obviously being very consistent with our capital allocation principles, we want to focus first on achieving our credit metrics and then we will -- once we have the visibility in terms of achieving that and obviously, as we get cash proceeds in the door throughout the year, we will be executing on the share repurchases. So my commitment to everybody is that we will execute them, but we need to have first assurance is that we have -- that we meet our commitment on credit metrics and that we have the cash available. So that's how we're thinking about it. Angie Storozynski : So it's not like the fact that you deferred the buyback -- it's in no way does that reduce the amount of financing that you will need to raise for the Vivint transaction. Mauricio Gutierrez : No. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : I was wondering if you could elaborate on what assets might be considered for sale and what the potential timing might look like in terms of executing any processes related to that? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, David. So as you know, we actually have been optimizing our portfolio for a number of years. I think we have a pretty good track record on doing that. And the way I think about it is you have core assets and non-core assets, right? So core assets are whatever helps us best serve our customers. And if there is an asset that doesn't do that function, then it becomes a non-core asset, and we'll look at monetizing that.  There is a second set of things that -- if there is an asset that is more valuable in somebody else's business, we will definitely take a look at that and evaluate all the options. So what I can tell you is, this is an ongoing process. We sold and monetized some assets last year. We're going to do that. What I wanted today was to provide you more specificity around the amount that we are targeting and that this will be executed throughout 2023. In terms of timing, obviously, these will require 2 people coming to an agreement and -- but we will be updating you as soon as we have available information. David Arcaro : Okay. That's helpful. And then I was wondering if you could speak a bit to just fleet reliability and resilience here. Wondering -- just if you could talk to the strategy to improve the risk profile of the business during extreme heat and cold events. Are there further investments that you could make in your fleet to improve their resilience or more you could do to beef up the supply side of the equation? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, David. So when you think about the reliability and resiliency, I actually -- if you take a step back, and you think about our supply strategy to serve our retail loan, I think about it in 3 big buckets. The first one is the generation that we own, the second one is medium-term PPAs and then the third one is obviously, you complement that with market purchases.  Today, we are roughly 50% of the megawatts that we serve, we supply with our own generation, 50% with third-party either tools or purchases. So what we have done on the -- on our own generation is twofold. Number one, we have been a little bit more conservative when we run our forecast and what we use to hedge our node in terms of plan characteristics and that gives us a little bit more push on so we're self-insuring.  The second thing is we have actually invested additional maintenance CapEx to increase the reliability on the units, specifically in areas where we have seen issues during scarcity conditions. So those 2 things really mitigate what I described as the operational risk on our units.  The other tool, we actually trade these operational risk or counterparty risk, credit risk. So while it's perhaps more firmer in terms of the megawatts, it also -- we have to monitor the health of the entities that we're transacting with. So what I like about this approach is that we're diversifying our risk that is not a all-generation, all-operational risk. So we actually diversify the risk. And this one was one of the big lessons during winter storm Yuri. So I feel very comfortable the risk adjustment that we have made. And then lastly, in terms of hedging our loans, we are being a little bit more conservative. So we're leaning perhaps longer than we have done in the past and to make sure that we manage some of the scarcity periods where we see higher load. But obviously, you cannot derisk completely the business because it would be cost prohibitive. So we've been very, very intentional and very thoughtful about. Operator : Our final question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : I appreciate the time. Just a question on the 2023 kind of base pre-Vivint, what are you assuming in there, I guess, obviously, you're expecting a big recovery from '22 and some of the issues, just but what are you assuming in there for outages, any lingering outages and then the related insurance money? And then also are you including any asset sale gains or losses in the guidance for '23? I think you've sold Astoria already at a decent price. Can you talk about that? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So we already sold Astoria. And let me just give you my view on the 2023 guidance, which I started talking to and about it, and then I'll pass it on to Alberto to tell you exactly what's the amount. But the way to think about the 2023 speed is more conservative forecast that we have done in the past, both from an operational productivities of the power plants, how we're managing our retail load but also because of the dynamics that existed in 2022 that don't exist today, like if you remember, we have the supply chain issues on coal and chemicals. That has abated for the most part.  We are falling to stable natural gas prices now that allows us to better manage our retail margins. We have an environment in the East where we feel very comfortable that we can gain market share on our retail business. So I think in general, I would say that 2023 is a lot more conservative. The guidance is right on top of what we provided to you back at the Investor Day when you adjust for asset sales which we provided you the bridge back then. So actually, in the Investor Day deck, you have the ins and outs, given the portfolio optimization that we have done. And we're literally on top of where we should have been so -- 2 things. One, I feel very confident that this is in line with what we provided you. And two, that is taking -- we're taking a little bit more of our conservative approach in so the number. Obviously, we will update you throughout the year. But just keep in mind that we're just at the beginning of the year. But I don't know if there is anything else that we need to add. Steven Fleishman : I mean Parish, part, like outage cost insurance and asset sales. Could you identify what's in the guidance for those? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So in the guidance, obviously, we have the Parish that is not in the first half of the year because it's on average. What I will tell you in Parish and I think that's probably the largest risk. The progress that we have made is pretty significant. As a matter of fact, I think just last week, we've had the generator now on site and has been listed and put in the deck. So we're making really, really good progress on what I'm seeing today, I'm confident that we will come back on time. Obviously, the commercial team is monitoring very closely that with the plan. If there is any delays or there is any acceleration that we either mitigate the risk in the market or that we take advantage if it comes in earlier. But in fact, that it's already embedded in guidance but Alberto? Alberto Fornaro : Yes. And just to be a little bit more specific, Steve, regarding Parish outage, we said that there is no impact in 2023. And the reason is because of the impact of the availability of the plant was matched by business insurance. We have received a little bit more than the business insurance in 2022. However, we are recalculating the margin. And net-net, it's still completely hedged by -- the loss margin is hedged by what we're going to receive as insurance, and therefore, no change compared to the prior scenario, which was in the third quarter when we provided the guidance. Steven Fleishman : And then asset sales? Alberto Fornaro : The upsell, we have factored Astoria basically which happened in January. And we are -- for the moment, until there are news, obviously, we are not adjusting. Mauricio Gutierrez : But it's already -- Astoria, it has already been taken into consideration. Alberto Fornaro : Astoria has been considered because it was a -- should have happened at the end of 2022. It happened just a few days after '23 and we took it into consideration in our guidance. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And how much is that? Alberto Fornaro : It's fairly small at the full impact. Consider that we have a tool for the remaining short period. So it's very, very small. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Great. Appreciate it. So it's really the core business, yes. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you. Thank you for your interest in NRG, and I look forward to updating you once we close the transaction on Vivint. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Kevin Cole, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Kevin Cole : Thank you, Sean. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's first quarter 2020 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcast. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, please see the reconciliation in the back of the earnings presentation. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer; and also on the call and available for questions are other members of our management team, including Rasesh Patel, Head of Vivint Smart Home. I'd like to start on slide four with the three key messages for today's presentation. First, our wholesale and retail businesses performed well during the first quarter and delivered strong financial results. We are focused on our core energy operations and have taken steps to make our platform more predictable and resilient. This brings me to my second point. We are seeing improving market fundamentals that should benefit our portfolio as we head into the summer. Finally, we completed the Vivint Smart Home acquisition and integration efforts have now begun in full. We are also updating our 2023 guidance ranges to account for this acquisition. Moving to the first quarter results on slide five. We delivered top decile safety performance and $646 million of adjusted EBITDA. This is a 28% improvement from last year when adjusted for asset sales and retirements. These results were driven primarily by strong operations in our core energy business, direct energy synergies and the addition of one month of Vivint earnings. During the quarter, we made good progress advancing our strategic priorities. We are on track to achieve the full synergy target for direct energy this year. We continue to be opportunistic on our portfolio optimization efforts with the sale of Astoria and we closed the Vivint acquisition in early March. Integration efforts for Vivint are now fully underway. Day one activities went well, and we have now defined the growth synergy target of $30 million for 2023. We will share additional details for the total program at our upcoming Investor Day. I want to take a moment and welcome the Vivint team to the NRG family. I continue to be impressed with the business and particularly the alignment in our corporate values that focuses on safety and customer experience. Finally, we are updating our 2023 guidance ranges to include Vivint and the alignment of adjusted EBITDA between our two companies. Alberto will unpack this in more detail, but let me provide you a quick overview. We're updating our full year guidance to $3.01 billion to $3.25 billion adjusted EBITDA, and $1.62 billion to $1.86 billion of free cash flow before growth. This includes 10 months of Vivint, expected growth and cost synergies for this year. This also reflects the harmonization of adjusted EBITDA to align both companies more with the consumer services industry. Excluding the impact of these changes, the traditional core energy business of NRG remains unchanged with previous stand-alone 2023 guidance ranges. Now, turning to slide 6. I want to provide a brief market update for Texas. We continue to see robust tenant demand growth on a weather-normalized basis north of 3%, driven by population growth and a strong state economy. We expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. As you can see in the chart on the left-hand side of the slide, the first quarter was characterized by mild weather and much lower natural gas and power prices, which settled well below market expectations. This benefited our integrated platform by allowing us to bring down our power plants during periods of low prices and performed additional preventive maintenance, while buying power from the market cheaper than our own generation. This resulted in margin expansion fully offsetting lower weather-driven demand, and this is exactly our platform was designed to perform. Looking ahead to this summer, our portfolio is well positioned to deliver stable results. Supply chain constraints are for the most part behind us, and our power plants are ready to run as we progress on our second year of increased maintenance spend. We are also more conservative on our hedging and the operating assumptions we're using for our power plants. Importantly, WA Parish unit remains on track to return to service before the summer. As you can see, we have taken steps to make our portfolio more predictable. Finally, I want to provide a brief update on ERCOT market design enhancements. After considering many alternatives during 2022, the Public Utility Commission of Texas unanimously approved the performance credit mechanism or PCM. This is a market-based solution that is widely supported by competitive entities and regulators. The Texas legislature is currently reviewing the PCM and other enhancements. We expect market design resolution by the end of May with the Texas legislative session, concluding on May 29. We anticipate that PCM will take a few years to be implemented. In the interim, ERCOT and the PUCT are considering a bridge solution that enhances the operating reserve demand curve or ORDC to increase online reserves. We applaud the efforts by the governor, legislature, PUCT and ERCOT to improve the reliability of the grid through market-based solutions. We have several brownfield projects in various stages of development, but all of them will require regulatory certainty before they can move forward. Moving to slide 7. I want to provide an update on our consumer-facing businesses. Beginning with our Retail Energy & Services platform, margins were up year-over-year by 7%, driven by lower supply costs and stable customer count. This was somewhat offset by lower load due to mild weather during the quarter. In the East, we grew through our customer acquisition efforts to provide consumers an alternative to rising incumbent utility prices. We continue to see no material increase in bad debt, which is a direct result of the essential nature of the services we provide. Finally, we launched a modernized digital experience on our web and model app that enables customers to manage their energy usage and provide actionable insights that we are uniquely able to generate regarding uses of energy in their home for their EVs and through their solar solutions. While we have only owned Vivint for one month, I want to provide a full first quarter statistics for comparison. Vivint grew customers by 9% and revenue by 14% compared to the same period last year. Like NRG, Vivint continues to experience strong retention and stable bad debt. The company was also busy in the quarter, enhancing their products and introducing innovative offerings, two of which I want to highlight. First, the Vivint app now includes solar production beta so our customers can actively monitor their energy conservation and cost savings. Second, they introduced a do-it-yourself product called driven basics that makes it easy for owners and renters alike to get the starter system for less than $300. Having a viable DIY and single point solutions is key to our strategy of creating more entry points for customers that we can later upgrade to our fully integrated smart home offering. Now, with respect to synergies, we are reaffirming our cost and growth targets for both 2023 and the full plan. Cost synergies are primarily the result of the combination of two public companies and are expected to total $100 million in recurring run rate free cash flow before growth. Growth synergies of $300 million will be achieved through a target for cross-sell, Vivint organic growth and sales channel optimization. In total, we expect $400 million of recurring synergies to be achieved over the next three years. The synergy and integration plan is now fully underway and is led by the same team responsible for the transformation plan and the direct energy integration. On the right-hand side of the slide, you will see the scorecard for Vivint. We have now introduced 2023 growth targets and cost to achieve. We plan to update this scorecard in the coming quarters to provide further transparency and keep you informed on our progress. I know I have said this before, but we are very excited about the opportunities for the combined company moving forward. Vivint brings a complementary business that expands our customer network by nearly 40% and that smart home technology and infrastructure to strengthen our platform. Together, we create the leading essential home services provider in North America, serving a network of nearly 7.5 million customers, and the acquisition also accelerates the plan we laid out at our 2021 Investor Day and creates the opportunity to deliver significantly shareholder value. During the first three years of integration, this value will be created through both cost and growth synergies, which are laid out on the slide. In the medium and long-term, I see even more opportunity to create value through growing customer count nationally, increasing the average number of solutions per customer and materially extending the customer lifetime. So, with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financials review. Alberto Fornaro : Thank you, Mauricio. NRG experienced a good start to the year and delivered strong results during milder-than-expected weather conditions. We entered the winter season seeing high forward gas and power curves. Moderate weather and relatively geopolitical stability translated into much lower power volumes in Texas and in the East and much lower actual prices in most markets with the exception of California. Additionally, NRG liquidity has significantly improved due to global collateral requirements after the winter season and the proactive management of our collateral utilization. We also completed the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home and have included Vivint's March performance in our financial stake. Before we continue, let me provide a little bit more detail about Vivint. At close, the EBITDA metric for the two companies was not identical. Therefore, we have harmonized it. I will go into more detail in the guidance section, but please note that all figures, including prior year reflect a consistent EBITDA across segments. Let's go now to the first quarter results. NRG consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $647 million is $137 million higher than the first quarter of 2022. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, Legacy Energy results include the anticipated negative impact of asset sales and retirements in the second quarter of 2022, totaling $30 million. On a like-to-like basis, Legacy Energy EBITDA increased by approximately $67 million. Last year, transitory items, including the Limestone Unit 1 extended outage, coal and chemical constraints and the temporary spike in ancillary costs impacted our profitability. Our Q1 2023 results show that these items have been fully recovered. We've also included Vivint March results in our first quarter financials, which contributed $73 million of additional EBITDA. The remaining $27 million increase is related to EBITDA harmonization. Going now to segment performance on the top left. Across the different geographical regions, we have in general experienced an expansion of unit margins that have been mitigated by lower volumes and usage. Starting with Texas, adjusted EBITDA increased by $43 million versus prior year and gross margin was $120 million higher. Opportunistic planned outages, insurance premium and pension cost increases and the return on bad debt to historical levels contributed to an increase in operating expenses compared to the first quarter of 2022. In the East, West & Services and Other segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $6 million versus last year, driven primarily by asset sales and retirement similar to Texas. Gross margin increased year-over-year, a lower power supply cost more than offset the negative impact of a volume decline. As said, we have included March results in our Q1 EBITDA, and these results were better than prior year on a comparable basis. While we are not reporting full Q1 quarterly results for Vivint, we are very encouraged by the results. On a standalone basis, all major KPIs, including profitability metrics, having improved compared to the prior year. We have begun integration in cross-selling activities and targets have been confirmed and are expected to be realized as planned.  Energy free cash flow before growth was $203 million, in line with our expectations impacted by milder temperatures that drove power purchases up and power generation down, thus increasing fuel inventory levels. We have identified the initiative to reduce inventories, but expect to defer any action until after the summer season. Lastly, on NRG balance sheet, cash collateral received by counterparties positive mark-to-market of the derivative portfolio and the account receivable and account payables are all trending down. This is an inversion of the trend that we have seen in the last six quarters. Let's move now to slide 10 to discuss the guidance for 2023. As mentioned, we are providing additional detail for adjusted EBITDA. Prior to the acquisition, NRG and Vivint accounted for items within adjusted EBITDA differently, and we are now harmonized what will be included in this metric going forward. Capitalized costs can be split into acquisition costs and fulfillment costs. The amortization of capital customer acquisition costs mostly sales commission paid by both NRG and Vivint will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. The amortization of capitalized fulfillment costs, mostly Vivint product and installation expenses will no longer be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Stock-based compensation expenses will also be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. There are no impacts to free cash flow. Moving to the world at the bottom of the page, Legacy Energy 2023 guidance is substantially unchanged compared to our Q3 earnings call. The only exception is a $120 million increase due to EBITDA harmonization. For Vivint, guidance includes pro forma 2022 EBITDA unchanged from December. This has been prorated for 10 months of owner fleet. We have added $65 million in expected 2023 synergies and growth, minus $35 million from the EBITDA harmonization. Overall, the net impact in 2023 is positive, and we have updated guidance accordingly. Free cash flow before guidance is simply the sum of the Legacy NRG guidance and the $110 million pro forma free cash flow number from December 2022. This has increased by the growth contribution and prorated for 10 months. As a reminder, the original 2022 pro forma free cash flow before growth for Vivint, included the free cash flow before growth, the impact of synergies and the additional interest on the acquisition debt. Lastly, the addition of Vivint to our guidance, we have incorporated a slightly higher range of plus or minus $120 million from the guidance midpoint on a consolidated basis. Now turning to slide 11 for a brief update on our 2023 capital allocation. Moving left to right with blue shading indicating updates. 2023 excess cash equals $1.999 billion. This includes roughly $250 million of excess cash for 2022, including $209 million in proceeds from the sale of Astoria, and the full year free cash flow below growth of $1.740 billion, inclusive of energy standalone guidance of $1.620 billion, plus $120 million provision. This also captured the expected impact of the additional debt finance. There is no change to the $500 million target of leverage neutral net inflow from asset sales. Moving on to cash utilized for Vivint. This includes the additional requirement of $100 million in the cash minimum balance, about $250 million of NRG cash utilization, net of Vivint cash, $545 million Vivint integration expenses and $900 million of expected debt reduction. Next, we have the remuneration of our equity holders and the dividend to the preferred issued in March. The allocation of cash to investments totaled about $190 million, including $90 million for growth initiatives. Now, moving to the far right bar. We expect a total of $506 million available for future allocation. This will fund the remaining share repurchase program upon full visibility of achieving our 2023 target credit methods, which are detailed in the next slide. Quickly turning to slide 12. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet. This slide does not substantially change since our last update, we just updated partially -- we updated a higher energy EBITDA, partially mitigated by lower adjustment and the slightly lower [indiscernible]. We are focused on achieving our 2023 target ready metrics, which include a leverage ratio approximately 3.2 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, and we are on track for investment-grade credit metrics by later 2025 and 2026 through both debt reduction and growth. Back to you Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Alberto. Turning to slide 14. I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation. We delivered strong results for the first quarter and are well positioned for the balance of the year. With the Vivint acquisition complete, we turn our focus to integration, growth and synergies. Our efforts are well underway, and it is now all about execution. I look forward to providing you a comprehensive update on our home business and strategy at our upcoming Investor Day. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Sean, we're now ready to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thank you guys very much for the time. Appreciate it. Nicely done here. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, Mauricio. Pleasure. Just wanted to follow up on the synergy scorecard here and just thinking through Vivint here. I mean you're laying out -- you've got the $300 million and $100 million in revenue and cost synergies, respectively. How do you think about that translating back to consolidated EBITDA for Vivint here again? And/or, how does that fit with the 12% to 15% FCF target as well? Just want to try to tie it out at least $225 million as best you can today, if we can be a little bit more specific. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So Julien, I'm assuming that you're talking about the target that we provide on our free cash flow per share that support 15% or 20% growth. And when you look at the EBITDA and free cash flow generation capability of NRG and then you lay on top of that, the $400 million of cost synergies and revenue synergies, we feel very confident that we're going to be on path to achieve that 15% to 20% free cash flow per share return. As a matter of fact, the acquisition of Vivint now gives us a little bit more control on achieving that. Remember, before we have tremendous financial flexibility, and we generate excess cash will be on what the traditional NRG needed, that we have used to reduce the denominator. The one variable that we cannot control there is at the price that we can buy back our stock. Now with the Vivint engine and the opportunity to create this $400 million of incremental value, we just increased the tools that we have to increase the numerator. And put more in control the achievement of this $12.50 that we have laid out for 2025. So I feel very comfortable that with what we laid out today and in previous calls that we are on track to achieving that $12.50 a share by 2025. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. So -- yeah, clearly 15% to 20%. And more to the point, as you think about layering on additional assumptions rolling out potentially updated guidance with this Analyst Day. Any initial thoughts on what else can be done with the Vivint platform to continue to grow it. I'll note that the commentary here at the outset is really focused on synergies. You talked about revenue and growth here in the first couple of years, how do you think about compounding that beyond the 2025 period that you're providing here today? Maybe any initial thoughts on how far you can go at this prospective Analyst Day. Mauricio Gutierrez : Right. Well, the first thing that I will say is when I think about the Vivint business, there are three big leverages that we're going to be focused on, the Vivint business was high, had high leverage. It has a high acquisition cost and there was also an opportunity on the consumer financing. So these are three specific buckets that we're focused on optimizing. And for me, it creates an opportunity for value creation. Now right now, we're focused on optimizing the 7.5 million net worth customers that we have. We have opened the lines of communication across our sales channels we're going to continue to optimize them. We're going to -- we have introduced bundling. We now are doing cross-sell between our call centers and our digital assets. We are testing in the market bundle. So that is the focus right now. When I think about 2025 and beyond, it's really about how do we bring the energy experience that we currently have with the smart home experience that we have and we create a best-in-class product for customers that is going to drive the growth on 2025 and beyond. This is something that we're going to be talking more about on our Investor Day on how this vision comes together with the two offerings that we have one in energy, one in a smart home. So we will make it more tangible and real for all our investors at the upcoming investor. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. All right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you guys very much. Have a great day. Mauricio Gutierrezk : Thank you, Julie. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn it back to Mauricio for closing comments. Mauricio Gutierrezk : Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you for your interest in NRG. I look forward to hosting all of you in our upcoming Investor Day that we should have in early summer where we're going to be talking about the smart home strategy. We're going to provide additional details on our growth plan and provide you more transparency on our key performance indicators that will help you better model the business. So with that, I want to thank you for your interest and look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions are other members of our management team including the heads of Home, Smart Home Business and Policy. Just over a month ago we held our Investor Day, where we provided an update on our long-term consumer strategy. We outlined the strength of our core energy business, how the acquisition of Vivint further enhances our energy platform and position us to capitalize on the convergence of electricity and smart technologies in the home. Today, I am going to focus on the results for the second quarter, starting on Slide 4 with our three key messages. First, our business delivered strong quarterly results and we are now trending towards the end \u2013 the high end of our 2023 EBITDA guidance range. Next, the Vivint Smart Home integration is well underway and we are realizing early wins in our combined sales efforts. Finally, we are executing on our consumer strategy to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Moving to the second quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered top decile safety performance and $819 million of adjusted EBITDA, a 112% increase from the same period last year, driven by excellent performance on our core energy business and the addition of Vivint Smart Home. Bruce will provide additional details on specific drivers but our business benefited from strong plant operations, our enhanced supply strategy, customer growth and favorable market conditions. During the quarter, we began the integration of Vivint Smart Home, which has yielded solid early results. Our revenue and cost synergy programs are well underway and we are reaffirming the full plan targets. As a result of early wins in our growth initiatives, we are increasing our 2023 growth target to $60 million, doubling our previous expectation. Finally, we hosted our Investor Day in June, which included our five-year strategic plan and an update on our capital allocation framework. As a result of the sale of South Texas Project and our revised capital allocation plan we are executing on a $2.7 billion share repurchase authorization and a $2.6 billion debt reduction plan. Through July we were able to complete $50 million of share repurchases and $200 million of debt reduction. As a result of the strong quarterly results and our position for the rest of the year we are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance with our EBITDA currently trading at the higher end of the range. Now turning to Slide six for an update on our Energy business. ERCOT has experienced record peak demand this summer demonstrating robust load growth in our core Texas region on a weather-normalized basis. The electric grid has been stable through these record demand. During the quarter thermal and wind generation performed close to expected levels which kept our prices relatively muted. As I mentioned during Investor Day we implemented changes to our supply strategy that have worked well for us. We were more conservative on our plant operations and took additional maintenance outages that resulted in better performance from our fleet. We also purchased additional power above our expected low to give us more cushion against extreme weather. All of these have positioned us well this summer and for balance of the year. Parish Unit eight is in testing mode and expected to come back to full service by the end of this month. On the regulatory front the PUCT last week approved a much discussed bridge solution which establishes positive price floors at various levels of operating reserves. This eliminates negative pricing during many hours and should help existing dispatchable units. Looking forward ERCOT and the PUCT are moving ahead with the market design changes stemming from the recent legislative session. These changes were meant to increase reliability and incentivize new dispatchable generation. Key among these programs is PCM the Performance Credit Mechanism which will now go through our rule-making process prior to being implemented.  Another major program coming from the legislator was the Texas Energy Fund a program of low interest rate loans and completion bonuses for new generation. Prior to its implementation the Texas Energy Fund must first be approved as a ballot measure by the public in November election. On Slide 7 we are introducing our new scorecard for the growth and cost initiatives. These will be updated on a quarterly basis with our progress. I have been very impressed with the level of collaboration and integration between our Energy and Smart Home teams. During the Investor Day we discussed the makeup of our $300 million growth program 50% coming from organic growth at historical levels and 50% from cross-sell activities. For the quarter Energy and Smart Home grew at historical target levels and in line with our plan. For the cross-sell activities we have seen some early successes. As such we are increasing our growth target in 2023 from $30 million to $60 million. Our Energy and Smart Home call centers have begun transferring more leads to each other and we are seeing positive customer conversion rates on qualified leads of around 6%. And with the addition of the DIY system introduced during the quarter conversion rates are now moving closer to 10%, as this system is a good entry point to upsell and create more stickiness with the customer. One of the best examples of cross-selling and leveraging capabilities across NRG is the Vivint Protection Plan. This is an equipment protection plan that leverages NRG's current capabilities. Vivint launched this program in the second quarter, and we are already at 120,000 plans sold. This is a new revenue stream with very little cost. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to continue testing different bundles and offers before we scale it up in 2024. We are very encouraged on what we're seeing across the two businesses and the opportunities that are arising inside the home. One of the commitments during our Investor Day was to provide additional disclosures on our Vivint Smart Home business. On slide 8, we have provided key performance indicators, comparing quarter-over-quarter. As you can see, we have performed exceptionally well during the quarter, with subscribers growing 7% and recurring service margins up 9%. Our customers are engaging more with our platform and are staying for a longer period of time. Acquisition costs are higher due to the impact of higher interest rates and more products being sold, but they were more than offset by higher revenue on new subscribers. Overall, the profitability of the business is very strong. On the right-hand side is our Vivint Smart Home pro forma, free cash flow projection through 2025. Our target is to grow customer count in line with historical performance around 7%, while we continue to increase margin contribution and reduce overall cost of acquiring and servicing customers. We expect to more than triple the cash flow generator from the business over the next three years. It will provide NRG an earnings stream that is stable, predictable over a long period of time and importantly, diversified from our current Energy business. Turning to slide 9. Our Investor Day focused on our commitment to operating excellence, disciplined growth, and maximizing shareholder returns. I want to provide you some of the key highlights of the event. We outlined a three-part strategic plan to optimize our Integrated Energy model, grow Energy and Smart Home and increased return of capital, while achieving an investment-grade balance sheet. Our Integrated Energy model has evolved in the last seven years, providing more durable earnings. We have strengthened our supply portfolio with the right mix of assets to better serve our customer load. The recent sale of our interest in South Texas Project is a great example of our ability to optimize our platform and maximize shareholder value, through monetizing an asset whose attributes can be readily replicated and replaced in the market. At the same time, we are signing renewable PPAs and evaluating dispatchable capacity development projects, that better match our hedging needs. We outlined our growth program for Energy and Smart Home, capitalizing on the convergence of electricity and smart technologies inside the home. We are going to use Vivint Smart Home technology platform to connect all of our products and services into a seamless experience for our customers. These will result in higher customer lifetime value. Finally, we announced an update to our capital allocation framework with 80% of capital available for allocation now returned to shareholders. With the acquisition of Vivint complete, we have line of sight to the investment needs of the company going forward with growth investments using only 20% of capital available for allocation. Consistent with this change we increased our share repurchase authorization to $2.7 billion to be completed through 2025. We also accelerated the achievement of our investment-grade credit metrics targets to 2025. I will pass it over to Bruce for the financial review. Bruce Chung : Thank you, Mauricio. NRG built on a solid first quarter with strong results in the second quarter that materially exceeded performance from last year. The company generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $819 million in the quarter, which is $433 million higher than the second quarter of 2022. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, legacy NRG results once again included the impact of asset sales and retirements in the second quarter of 2022 totaling $30 million. The quarter also reflected $60 million of benefit compared to 2Q 2022 from the reversal of transitory items such as coal constraints and increased ancillary expenses. Strong performance in our core Energy business resulted in $186 million of uplift from the prior year. That uplift was driven by lower supply costs and improved plant performance relative to 2022. Finally, the remaining year-over-year increase to consolidated results is attributable to Vivint EBITDA of $217 million, which was not included in our 2022 results. Looking at our segments, and starting with Texas, adjusted EBITDA increased by $241 million versus the prior year on the back of higher gross margin of $273 million. As outlined earlier, meaningful unit margin expansion from lower supply costs, coupled with improved plant performance, were the primary drivers for the increase in gross margin. This increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased OpEx from the timing of planned outages and higher insurance premiums. In the East/West segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $25 million versus last year driven primarily by asset sales and retirements. Similar to Texas, gross margin increased year-over-year and lower power supply costs more than offset the negative impact of volume declines due to mild weather. In Q2, Vivint continued to deliver strong financial results contributing $217 million in adjusted EBITDA. Revenue grew 12% year-over-year driven by favorable retention and higher recurring monthly revenue per subscriber which combined with reductions in monthly service cost per customer drove a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to Q2 2022. Lastly, with average subscriber growth of 7% year-over-year, Vivint recently achieved a key milestone surpassing two million customers. NRG's free cash flow before growth for the quarter was $425 million, a year-over-year increase of $328 million, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted EBITDA. In addition to improved EBITDA, falling gas prices have reduced cash outflows for gas inventory that is typically built in the second quarter. Finally, building on our strong year-to-date results, we are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance for 2023. Now turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on our 2023 allocation, capital allocation. You will notice that the numbers shown on this slide align with the guidance we gave during our June Investor Day presentation. I would call your attention to the progress we have made so far on debt reduction and share repurchases. Through July 31st, we have paid down $200 million of debt and remain on track to complete our target of $1.4 billion in debt reduction for 2023. Additionally we executed $50 million of share repurchases in July as part of our $2.7 billion share repurchase authorization through 2025. Quickly turning to Slide 13. Our credit profile has not changed meaningfully since our last earnings call. As a result this slide has not substantially changed since our last update except for an update to the adjustments to capture the non-cash fulfillment amortization costs that are included in adjusted EBITDA as a result of the EBITDA harmonization we did last quarter. We remain on track to achieve our 2023 targeted leverage ratio and we reiterate our commitment to achieving investment-grade credit metrics by the end of 2025. Before turning it back to Mauricio, I wanted to be sure to augment his earlier comments regarding our commitment to enhance disclosure especially with respect to Vivint. As part of that commitment, you will see in the appendix of the presentation some new disclosure providing key metrics related to Vivint. We will continue to provide these key metrics on a quarterly basis and we look forward to working with you to help you understand how these metrics drive the financial results of the business. With that, I'll turn it back to you Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you Bruce. Turning to Slide 15. I want to provide a few closing thoughts on our 2023 priority score card. As you can see, our team has remained focused on execution as evidenced by our strong results for the quarter. Our core energy business is well-positioned for the summer. The integration of Vivint is off to a good start and we're working towards closing the sale of STP by the end of the year. We will remain focused on executing our strategic plan that creates significant shareholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Jana, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of BofA. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, team. Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it as always. Maybe just first off just -- thank you for all the details on Vivint. Can you talk a little bit about your 6% conversion rate in terms of -- here? Just how does that compare versus expectations, and just perhaps provide a little bit of context? Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. Good morning, Julien. So, in\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: \u2026of KPIs. Mauricio Gutierrez : Right. So Julien in terms of the conversion rates, this is what we've been able to achieve on qualified leads so far. This is higher than what we expected. If you recall our cross-sell target was around a 3% penetration so this is above that. Obviously, this is early, but we're very encouraged by the success that we've had so far. This is Smart Home customers buying Energy and Energy buying Smart Home. With the addition of the DIY system that Vivint introduced we're actually seeing an increase on those conversion rates, because it allows us to have an entry point a cheaper entry point that we can use to up-sell and create more stickiness with the customers. So we're very, very encouraged by what we're seeing so far. At the same time, some of the secondary products like the Protection Plan from Vivint had tremendous success. And that's why when you combine all these with our organic growth we -- I felt compelled to increase our targets for 2023. So we are seeing results faster than what we expected initially. Very, very encouraging. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you so much, again, really appreciate, over the phone. And then related can you talk a little bit about your commitment to building new generation in Texas? I mean, obviously, you want to see this corresponding support from the state here. Just where do we stand on that investment follow through? As well as just the ROFR or any potential commentary around the petition from your coders on STP? Mauricio Gutierrez : So, let me start with the development projects. As you know, we have three development projects that are in late stages of development. I mean, one of them is short already. We have positioned ourselves to capitalize on the market design changes that ERCOT has put forward both in PCM and the new loan program. As I mentioned, we need more clarity on both of these fronts before we can actually move forward with these projects, but I am very pleased with how the team has positioned these projects and they're ready. This is exactly the type of generation exactly the right attributes that we need to manage our loan. This is mid-merit and peaking capacity, so loan following type of attributes. And I'm just very pleased that, the team has put us in this position to be able to make that decision. I think, your second question was around the claims of our partners at STP. Let me be very clear. We believe that, the claims are without merit and we expect to close the sale of our interest in STP by the end of the year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And just to clarify, it says you're not committed yet on making the repowering investments here? Mauricio Gutierrez : No not yet. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Fair enough. I will leave it there. Thank you, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. Just one on STP just a quick follow-up on Julien's question. If -- for instance if there is a delay and we have to book in this right? I mean, obviously, there's a level of confidence. We heard the prepared remarks. Could a delay impact anything on the capital allocation slide as we're thinking about it? So even on the buyback side assuming there could be a delay? A - Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, I mean, I'm not going to speculate on that. Like I said, the claims are without merit. Our plan is to close by the end of the year. I think is \u2013 and as we have done in the past, we will deploy capital when we have it, right? So right now our focus is on the share buyback and the debt reduction program that we have for 2023. As you saw, since we overperformed during the second quarter, we were able to allocate $50 million to share buybacks. If that overperformance continues, we will continue to allocate in capital to share buybacks until we have the \u2013 until we close the sale of STP, which is really an event that will increase substantially, the capital that we have available to redeploy. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then Mauricio, you guys obviously booked some significant margin expansion this quarter. Could we just dig a little bit further into the $186 million, you're calling out? Maybe just both geographically, Texas versus East and/or by function. So does that also include near-term portfolio optimization with trading, or is it really true longer-term margin expansion? So put it all together how durable is that? Thanks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Let me start, and then I'll pass it over to Bruce for the specifics. I think the team did just a fantastic job in managing margins, both in terms of revenue optimization and also the enhanced supply \u2013 diversified supply strategy that we have on our commercial team, allowed us to realize lower supply cost. So really, really good management all around and our plants performed as expected, which I think that's what we expect going forward but Bruce, any other additional details? Bruce Chung : Yes, sure. So when you think about the $186 million, the preponderance of that really came out of Texas, not surprisingly as you think about year-over-year. With the improved plant performance, that's going to translate into a much better setup for us to be able to service our supply obligations appropriately. Just to give you a little bit of context, as you look at the power price landscape year-over-year between the two quarters, you'll see that around-the-clock prices in ERCOT were about 50% lower, which really helped us optimize how we service our load. And then to your point about the question on durability, look, the reality is as long as our plants perform, our margins should be durable and so that's what we continue to intend to do and continue to plan around. So on the East, there was a little bit of \u2013 there was some margin expansion as well on the C&I side. We have seen C&I customers sign up contracts at better margins for us, alongside the optimization activities that Mauricio had referred to. So overall, preponderance of it came from Texas but some amount in the East as well. Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. Fantastic job guys. I appreciate it. Have a good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Shar. Operator : Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Good morning. So you guys maintained the guidance range but is it fair to assume that you are tracking above the midpoint both from the EBITDA and free cash flow perspective? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. Good morning, Angie. So yes we are keeping \u2013 we're affirming our guidance ranges at this point. I have indicated that we're trending toward the high-end of the guidance. Obviously, the third quarter is a very important quarter. We are well positioned for it, our plants are performing well, our supply strategy is working well for us, but we'll have an opportunity to update you on our results in the third quarter call. So far, I am very pleased with how the business has performed across all business segments : Generation Retail Smart Home. And -- but third quarter the summer is very important. Thus you appreciate given the extreme weather that we have seen. But so far, the business is performing very well. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Moving on to the margin expansion on the retail side and I appreciate that most of it comes from Texas. But we've heard from some other retailers comments about the particular margin expansion for full requirement contracts. Remind us please if you actually have any of those? Probably more in the East, but again just -- I don't even recall. Mauricio Gutierrez : I mean we have -- remember the full requirement is really C&I. We share C&I customers across Texas and the East. I think Bruce already mentioned that what we are seeing is higher margins because there is greater volatility in the market right both in Texas and in the East. So greater volatility means higher load following premiums which means higher margins on the customers. This is a trend that we are also seeing in our business and again, the changes that we made to our diversified supply strategy are working really well both for C&I, but also for residential customers. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then on Vivint, why is there such a meaningful increase in the acquisition costs for customers? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yeah. So I mean the increase is twofold. Number one, you have higher interest rates. And then number two, the customers are buying more products and that's a really good thing. Now what you also should be able to see on the KPIs that we're providing you, our revenues are also higher. And by the way much higher than that increase so net-net is an increase on profitability. But Rasesh perhaps you want to just provide a little bit more color? Rasesh Patel : Yeah. Thank you, Mauricio. You said it well. What we're seeing is customers are more engaged in buying more services in the home. I think you can see through the KPIs that the monthly recurring service margin per customer is up 9% and that's 9% across the entire customer base. When we look at our customer acquisition cohort, it's up more substantively than that and so you can think of this as the increased acquisition cost will drive over $250 of incremental revenue over the life of the customer. And so we feel very good about the engagement level and the margin expansion in the base. Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Angie. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, team good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey, good morning, Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, Mauricio. You've answered all the other questions I had. Just maybe real quick, obviously, you're very confident in 2023 here. So Parish Unit 8 probably you don't see that as a meaningful impact, but the in-service is getting pushed. I think the last target was end of July, you moved it slightly to this month. Just can you talk to that what's going on there? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So I mean, we\u2019re seeing top the unit in middle of July. We are working right now through additional testing and as you can appreciate this was basically a rebuild of the entire generator. But I'm confident that we're going to come back end of August. In terms of planning, you're correct. We actually took all the necessary steps to manage our low in the market at really good economics. So I feel that even if Parish comes back at the end of the month, it's not going to have an impact on the guidance that we provided you today. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. That's all I had. I appreciate the color. Thank you, Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Durgesh. Operator : One moment for our next question please. Your next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Arcaro : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, David. David Arcaro : On the Smart Home business, I was wondering if you could speak to what the free cash flow before growth was for the quarter there, or any color on the free cash flow conversion you're seeing from EBITDA? Wondering how you're trending versus the full year $140 million pro forma target there? Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. Bruce? Bruce Chung : Yeah, David. So as you know, we don't report free cash flow before growth for any individual segment of the company. But based on what we are seeing given the outperformance on the EBITDA side, we would expect to achieve the free cash flow before growth guidance that we had provided in our first quarter earnings call. David Arcaro : Okay, great. And then on the retail side of the -- Retail Energy side of the business, wondering if you could give an update on how customer retention and overall customer additions were trending in the quarter? And curious if you've seen any new entrants start to pop up particularly in ERCOT? And any, kind of, change in the competitive landscape there recently? Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. I'll pass it over to Elizabeth, but I will say that our KPIs on our Retail Energy business are pretty much in line with our expectation, including customer growth. But Elizabeth can you provide more details? Elizabeth Killinger : Sure. Thanks David. We actually saw really strong customer retention rates consistent with last year's performance consistent with what we expected in the budget. And for customer acquisition, we have a little bit of overperformance for the quarter and we're really building that momentum to achieve that low single-digit customer growth between year-end 2022 and 2023. As far as competitive landscape, we see a normal healthy competitive market in Texas. It's pretty consistent that every year we'll see a new player add billboards in the market or start doing something different, but there isn't anything materially different. We do see competitors like Shell and others that are larger competitors, which we appreciate, because overall that strengthens the market. But our performance is strong and our leading digital experience and leading customer acquisition and retention help us win in the marketplace. David Arcaro : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s really appreciated. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our last question. Our final question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi. Please go ahead. Ryan Levine : Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Levine : Good morning. What drove the monthly recurring net service cost per subscriber reduction by 22%? And was that largely in line with what you were anticipating, or is there any outsized movements this quarter? Bruce Chung : Yes, Ryan. So, the primary drivers of that reduction, about 50% of that really is a function of fewer truck rolls and reduced supply chain constraints. We probably realized about 25% fewer truck rolls than we had in the past. The other 50% or the other 50% of the favorability really results from the ending of our payments to Alarm.com, which had started towards the -- towards the second half of last year. Ryan Levine : Is Q2 '23 number more likely to continue on a go-forward basis, or are there any trends that we should look for as we look into forecast factors? Bruce Chung : Yes. So Rasesh, why don't you take that one? Rasesh Patel : Yes, you bet. We feel very good about where net service cost per subscriber is and we would expect the current rate at which we are to continue. The favorability we've seen is durable and it's a perfect thing when you see customers buying more products and you see higher penetration of your service, while simultaneously you see the cost to serve going down and that's exactly what's driving the margin expansion. And so, we feel really good about the trends and we think that is sustainable. Ryan Levine : So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you continue to see fewer truck rolls and decreasing number of truck rolls on a go-forward basis as a driver, or am I misinterpreting that? Rasesh Patel : That's right. So, you can see, if we think -- when you look at this on a per customer basis and we would expect to see this lower rate that we have achieved for both contact rate calls, as well as truck rolls to continue. We've recently started a virtual technician pilot, which really allows us to serve the customers' needs without ever rolling a truck and we're seeing very promising results from that. And so, this is sort of a new benchmark for the business. Ryan Levine : Thanks for the clarity. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Ryan. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Mauricio Gutierrez, President and CEO for closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Jana. And thank you everyone for your interest and your time today and I look forward to speaking with all of you in the days and weeks to come. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations to read the Safe Harbor and introduce the call. Kevin Cole : Great. Thank you, Darren. Good morning. And welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcast. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I am joined this morning by Bruce Chung, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have members of the management team. Before we go into the quarterly review, I\u2019d like to start with an overview of our value proposition. Over the last six years we have taken the necessary steps to position NRG at the center of the energy transition. Our Consumer Energy business that benefits from the increasing electrification of our economy, while generating significant excess cash well beyond its business needs. A complementary Smart Home business, that increases the lifetime value of our customers and enable greater optimization of our customer\u2019s energy demand and the financial flexibility to return significant capital to our shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. As you can see, we delivered compelling value today, and importantly, we have positioned our business to deliver value well into the future. So, with that, I\u2019d like to turn to the three key messages of our earnings presentation on slide five. First, we are raising our 2023 financial guidance, driven by strong financial and operational results, both in the third quarter and year-to-date. Second, we are initiating 2024 financial guidance above the plan we shared with you at our June Investor Day. And finally, with line-of-sight to achieving our 2025 growth roadmap, we are accelerating our focus on behind-the-meter load management opportunities for homes and businesses. Starting with our third quarter results on slide six. We delivered top decile safety performance and $973 million of adjusted EBITDA, 103% improvement from the same period last year, driven primarily by strong operational performance across the business and the addition of Vivint. This brings our year-to-date results to $2.438 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a 74% increase above the prior year. On our last earnings call, we indicated that we were trending towards the top end of the guidance range. With strong third quarter performance and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing and narrowing our 2023 financial guidance ranges, which includes the close of STP and that increase in the company\u2019s annual incentive plan given the expected outperformance for the year. During the quarter, we continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities. Vivint integration is well underway and with early success on our growth initiatives, we are raising again our 2023 target from $60 million to $75 million. This is 150% increase from our original $30 million target set in May. Also during the quarter, we continue executing on our portfolio optimization efforts with the retirement of the Joliet power station and the sale of Gregory and our interest in STP. Turning to capital allocation. We are raising our 2023 share repurchase target by 15% to $1.5 billion. We have completed $200 million of share repurchases year-to-date and with the close of STP, expect to execute the remaining $950 million under an accelerated share repurchase program. Next, we have executed $800 million of debt reduction, as part of our liability management program. Bruce will provide more details in his section. Finally, we are initiating 2024 financial guidance ahead of our June Investor Day plan. These earnings expansion is durable and represents high quality growth and overall strengthening of our business. On capital allocation, we allocated $500 million to debt reduction and the remaining excess cash allocated 80% to return on capital and 20% growth. Now turning to slide seven for an update on our Integrated Energy Business. We experienced the hottest summer on record in our core Texas market, breaking the previous peak demand record 10 times. While the power grid was given the record demand, it performed quite well with only a few periods of scarcity pricing when renewable output was low. Important thing, the efforts we undertook in our summer readiness and spring outage program resulted in a significant increase in our plan reliability. In the bottom left hand chart is our in-the-money availability. Indicating the availability of our units during periods when they are profitable, which is the relevant metric for our business and shows a significant improvement. Retail saw strong performance through the quarter with in-line customer growth and better-than-expected retention. We continue to improve our digital experience with customers engaging more, increasing monthly average app usage by 20%. Moving to retail supply. The steps we have taken to enhance our diversified supply strategy was successful in providing predictable supply costs under different load and price scenarios. Beyond investing in our plans, we adjusted our hedge ratios to lean long in key summer and winter months. Finally, we are beginning our efforts in residential demand response and have increased participation by 10% this year. We also manage a large C&I demand response business, with 2.5 gigawatts of capacity under management. I will provide more color on the behind-the-meter opportunity later in the presentation. Our Smart Home Business also performed well with strong customer growth and margin expansion as you can see on slide eight. We continue to advance our technology platform with the launch of new innovative products, improving our customer experience, that is constantly recognized as the best in the industry by consumer publications. On the right hand side of the slide, you will see the key performance indicators that we introduced in our last earnings call. We continue to see exceptional performance in Smart Home, with 7% subscriber growth, 9% revenue growth and 9% service margin improvement versus the same period last year, consistent with the improvements we reported in our second quarter results. Acquisition costs are higher due to the impact of more products being sold and higher interest rates, but were more than offset by higher revenue on new subscribers. Our customers are engaging more with our platform and are staying for a longer period of time. We are very encouraged by the performance we are seeing across the business and the opportunities that are arising inside the Home. Now, I want to provide an update on the opportunity for the management we see behind-the-meter or Virtual Power Plants on slide nine. We have been managing energy optimization programs for commercial and industrial customers for years and now we are seeing the growing opportunity in the residential space. New distributed technologies and a growing penetration of connected smart devices in the home have materially changed the industry, providing greater control to the consumer. Grid reliability has also played a role in accelerating adoption. As flexible demand represents instantaneous peaking capacity when the grid is at peak load or in scarcity conditions. We think the primary pathways for us to create value in these markets. First, through optimizing our existing customer peak demand in ERCOT and PJM, where we can benefit from both energy and capacity value, as well as reduced market risks. Second, through VPP services for Smart Home and Utility customers, both in regulated and competitive markets. We are uniquely positioned to win this space, we have the scale with 7.6 million customers, decades of commercial and market expertise and then Integrated Energy Business that allows NRG to monetize the value without having to go to the wholesale market or requiring regulatory change. We also have that data and insights from running the third largest commercial and industrial demand response program in the country. While our focus in the near-term, continues to be optimizing our core and integrating driven, over the medium- and long-term we see a significant value opportunity from these programs. These value is not included in our June Investor Day plan and. I look forward to providing you updates on our progress in the future. Moving to slide 10 for anomaly by integration efforts. We are making good progress across our initiatives and are reaffirming the full plan targets, totaling $550 million of recurring free cash flow before growth by the end of 2025. Our growth and cross-sell efforts have yielded strong results, allowing us to increase our 2023 growth target, $75 million. On the right-hand side of the slide, you will see the increasing number of customers buying two or more products. I want to highlight that this is not exclusively cross-sell between energy and Smart Home, but includes other consumer products sold across NRG that generate recurring revenues. We have been hard at work executing pilots and collecting critical insights as we prepare to scale energy and Smart Home cross-selling in 2024 and beyond. In the appendix of today\u2019s presentation, you will find our latest growth and cost plan score card. So you can track our progress. So, with that, I will pass it over to Bruce for the financial review. Bruce Chung : Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to slide 12, NRG\u2019s third quarter and year-to-date financial performance significantly exceeded the same periods last year. NRG produced adjusted EBITDA of $973 million in the quarter, which is $493 million higher than the third quarter of 2022. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, even when normalizing 2022 results for transitory items and the WA Parish outage, 2023 adjusted EBITDA still exceeded the prior year, by $350 million. Compared to a normalized 2022, third quarter 2023 performance was driven by $125 million of improved operations and margin expansion in our core energy business and $225 million of Vivint EBITDA which was not included in our 2022 results. Similar to the first two quarters of the year. Our core energy business continued to benefit from expanded margins, near record retention and increased customer count. Our diversified supply strategy and solid performance continue to provide predictable supply costs through a volatile load and freight conditions in Texas. Looking at our segments and starting with Texas. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $356 million versus the prior year on the back of higher gross margin of $378 million. Continued unit margin expansion from lower supply costs coupled with improved plant performance were the primary drivers for the increase in gross margin. This increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased OpEx from higher selling and marketing in Home Energy, where we increased 50,000 customer\u2019s year-over-year. In the East/West segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $88 million versus last year, driven primarily by lower spark-spreads of Cottonwood, discontinuation of equity earnings treatment for Ivanpah and an increase in accruals as part of the company\u2019s annual incentive plan, reflecting the expected financial outperformance for the year. In Q3, Vivint continued to deliver strong financial results, contributing $225 million in adjusted EBITDA. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by subscriber growth of 7%, favorable retention and higher recurring monthly revenue per subscriber, which combined with reductions in monthly service cost per customer, drove a 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to 3Q 2022. NRG\u2019s free cash flow before growth was $355 million for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $983 million. This represents a significant improvement over 2022 totals, driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. As a result of our year-to-date financial performance, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 guidance ranges, $3.15 billion to $3.3 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.725 billion to $1.875 billion of free cash flow before growth. The midpoint of our new guidance represents a $95 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and a $60 million increase in free cash flow before growth to the midpoint of our original guidance ranges. Turning to slide 13 for an update on our 2023 capital allocation. We have updated our 2023 excess cash to reflect the final net proceeds of divesting our interest in STP. The net proceeds from the sale of Gregory and the increase to our free cash flow midpoint for the year. The remaining numbers on this slide are largely consistent with the update we gave on the second quarter earnings call with a few notable exceptions. Moving from left to right, we have updated the capital we will spend on Vivint integration from $145 million to $50 million. This does not reflect lower cost associated with the integration, but rather a shifting of those dollars to 2024 and 2025. Much of the move is driven by systems integration decisions which shifted the timeline for those costs to be incurred. Continuing on, as you can see in the debt reduction column, we have made significant progress toward our target of $1.4 billion in debt reduction, with $800 million achieved through October 31st of this year. With the closing of the STP transaction, we will complete the remaining $600 million of debt reduction by the end of 2023 through a targeted liability management program. Finally, moving to the share repurchases column. You will see that we have completed $200 million of share repurchases thus far in 2023. This includes a $50 million we completed at the time of the second quarter earnings call and $150 million we recently completed on October 31st. With the closing of the STP transaction, we intend to launch a $950 million accelerated share repurchase program imminently. Between the $200 million already completed and the $950 million accelerated share repurchase program, our total share repurchases for the year will be $1.15 billion, which is $150 million more than what we had communicated at Investor Day and 2Q earnings. Moving to slide 14, we are excited to introduce our guidance for 2024. We are guiding 2024 full year adjusted EBITDA with a range of $3.3 billion to $3.55 billion, representing a midpoint of $3.425 billion. We are also guiding 2024 free cash-flow before growth, with a range of $1.825 billion to $2.075 billion, representing a midpoint of $1.95 billion. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, there are several drivers of year-over-year guidance. Incremental Vivint EBITDA reflecting a full year\u2019s worth of ownership is effectively offset by the lost EBITDA from the Greg -- from the STP and Gregory asset sales. Our growth plan and cost synergies contribute $240 million of incremental EBITDA, but it\u2019s partially offset by an increase in the Vivint EBITDA harmonization adjustments. The final driver reflects a continuation of the improved operations and margin expansion, impacting our 2023 results and contributes to $160 million to our 2024 midpoint. As you can see with the impact of improved operations and margin expansion, our 2024 guidance midpoint exceeds the pro forma, we provided in our Investor Day plan. On slide 15, we are providing our 2024 capital allocation plan. As you can see, our capital allocation plan adheres to the 80-20 principal of return on capital versus growth, while ensuring we continue to meet our debt reduction commitments. Our plan currently calls for a debt reduction of $500 million in 2024. As we have always said, we are committed to a strong balance sheet and this debt reduction ensures that we remain on the path to achieving our target credit metrics by the end of 2025. Our return of capital plan is comprised of $825 million of share repurchases and $330 million of common dividends. The common dividends reflect an 8% increase in the common dividend per share from a $1.51 to a $1.63. Between capital return in 2023 and the expected capital return in 2024, we will have executed over 70% of our current share repurchase authorization and return to $2.65 billion to shareholders. In summary, our third quarter and year-to-date results show robust financial performance across the company, and with our increased 2023 guidance, we are poised to close out the year in a strong position and enter 2024 on a similarly high note. We remain committed to executing the Investor Day plan we shared back in June and our focus on maintaining a high level of operational performance will not waver as we head into the end of the year. With that, I will turn it back to you, Mauricio. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Bruce. I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today\u2019s presentation on slide 17. As you can see, we have made significant progress across all of our key priorities and are also ahead of the five-year plan we provided to you during our Investor Day. I want to take a moment to thank all my colleagues at NRG for keeping focused on execution and for their hard work in achieving these results. We have the right strategy and the right team to deliver exceptional value today and well into the future. So, with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Darren, we are now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Shar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Hey. Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. Bruce, can we just unpack the $160 million in improved ops and margins that you are calling out in the 2024 EBITDA guidance, walk a little more? How much of that is margin expansion and how sticky is that overall as we look to refine our models for 2025 and beyond? Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. Bruce? Bruce Chung : Sure. Hey, Shar. Good morning. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. Bruce Chung : So. I would say that, really when you think about the $160 million, it\u2019s pretty much margin expansion across the entirety of the complex. So if we think about our Home Energy business, we are really seeing margin expansion, there is really on two fronts, one is on revenue management and on the cost of supply. So when you think about the durability of that, the revenue management side of it is really a function of the efforts we have done over the past several years around data-driven analysis to really make sure that we are targeting proper revenue rate for customers and then on the cost of supply, that\u2019s really representing the benefits of our diversified supply strategy and just a general better plant performance relative to history. On the C&I side, we are seeing margin expansion there, which we would also believe is terrible. As we know, there has been volatility in the market and customers are locking in higher revenue rates reflecting that volatility, and obviously, those contracts tend to be longer tenor and so that should also provide durability. And then lastly on the Smart Home side. As you saw with the KPIs, we are seeing margin expansion both on the revenue front and higher revenue per subscriber, as well as lower cost to serve as we continue to optimize that piece of the business, and again, given the long duration nature of those customers, we would expect that to also continue to be durable. So, all-in-all, higher expansion on the margin side with durability. Mauricio Gutierrez : So, Shar, I mean, this is really just a reflection of the improvements we have done in the business and I see them as durable sustainable for the foreseeable future. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. And we should -- 2024 free cash flow conversion rate, it looks like it\u2019s in the mid-to-high 50s. I know you have indicated at the Analyst Day, your target is to step-up through the plan into the mid=to-high 60s. Can you just walk us through how you see that stepping up and what kind of shape that may take, i.e., linear as we also continue to update our models? Thanks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. Bruce, do you want to? Bruce Chung : Yeah. I would say, Shar, I think, we continue to remain focused on that conversion rate. I don\u2019t think it will be linear, because if you -- most of that conversion improvement is going to come from increasing the conversion at Vivint, right? And so if you remember, we provided some information that showed a free cash flow growth profile at Vivint going from $140 million to $445 million. by the end of 2025, so that\u2019s a pretty steep increase in the cash flow at Vivint which is really going to help to drive that conversion higher on a go-forward basis. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. And lastly, Mauricio, just on a -- just a strategy question, I guess. Can you just update us on how you are kind of approaching the prospects for newbuilds in ERCOT? I know there\u2019s obviously a lot of the existing assets in the market right now, we have seen in Carolina and we have seen in Texas gen, would you have any interest in second hand plants? Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure. Well, as you know, Shar. We actually improve our diversified supply strategy. Some of it will be through own generation, some moving into rent and to complement with market purchases. So the team is constantly looking at the economics between buying from the market, renting or buying assets from other and creating options internally to develop those facilities either as brownfield development. So we are looking at all of it. We are evaluating the economics. At the end of the day, we are balancing operational risk, market risk, counterparty risk, that criteria permeates the evaluation that we are doing on all of these options. We are still awaiting to see changes in market design and other improvements to incentivize dispatchable generation. That also is going to shape the decisions that we are going to make. So as you can tell, this is not just a linear and a myopic view on assets to be bought in the market and development, we really also need to see what incentives are available given the changes in the regulatory construct in ERCOT. So I have said before that towards, I would say, the end of the year, we are going to have more visibility on those changes in ERCOT that is going to inform the next steps we are going to take. Shar Pourreza : Fantastic guys. Congrats on your results. See you soon. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Shar. Appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the time. Appreciate it. Look, just checking in first on the buyback here just a technicality. Can we talk a little bit -- you have a big portion remaining for what you call 2023? You want to talk about your ability to get that done and then also how that might proves to be additive to kind of 2024 here, especially given the higher numbers that your guidance versus initial plan? Mauricio Gutierrez : Sure, Julien. So\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: \u2026you get it done. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yeah. As we mentioned, we are going to do the ASR imminently, that means as soon as possible. And what I will characterize the execution of that ASR, we are going to do it as fast and as efficient as we can. So I think that\u2019s the spirit and the intent launching this ASR as soon as possible. Bruce Chung : Julien, I would just add that as you know, when you do an ASR, we obviously realize the vast majority of the shares having been bought in pretty much on an immediate basis, but it takes time for the banks to be able to go and purchase those shares properly. And so my guess is, we would probably anticipate that the program will be completed inside of the first quarter of next year. But to us, that\u2019s actually a pretty good situation because then that provides the ability to then roll into a regular way share of repurchase program related to our 2024 capital allocation plan to really continue to maintain the momentum on the repurchase front. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, guys. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Maybe just pivoting a little bit back here. I mean, obviously, very nicely done on 2024, nicely done on the comments on keeping it sticky. And then, Mauricio, next piece of this is, you have talked up this virtual Power Plant distributed opportunity on the call today in prior remarks, how do you see that feeding into, A, what you are talking about in 2024? I presume that\u2019s not really necessarily reflected in size. But at the same time, you talk up an opportunity there, I presume that there\u2019s a certain degree of customer election and choice in that. But how do you see that scaling here? When does that really meaningfully impacting and how meaningful are we talking here? I mean, I have heard some of your comments earlier, if you could elaborate. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yeah. So, well, the first thing that I will say is that, this opportunity is not included in the investor -- in the plan that we provided at Investor Day. The second thing I will say is, just given the focus and the availability of technologies today, we are accelerating the scale-up of this opportunity. I initially thought that this was going to be a five-plus year opportunity. What we are experiencing is that this is going to be able to be implemented and scaled up faster than that. I would say it\u2019s probably a three-plus year. And I provided some initial numbers that I think are very realistic on what we can accomplish. So if you look at a 1 gigawatt VI [ph] position in Texas this past summer, it represented close to $200 million of gross margin. And 1 gigawatt for our portfolio is basically less than 10% of the load -- of the peak load that we currently serve. So it\u2019s very achievable and that gives you just some indication that you are not talking here about a small opportunity, you are talking here about a very large opportunity. The other thing that I will say is that, this product that we are talking about is really leveraging the devices that we use to protect homes plus the distributed technologies available today to help consumers optimize demand. Don\u2019t think of this as a conservation effort -- opt-in conservation effort. This is about optimizing and about convenience for our customers. So it is a very different product from the traditional VI. That\u2019s why we are calling it more as an optimization of the energy demand behind the meter as opposed to a traditional demand response. That\u2019s why we are so excited because this is something that consumers want and this is something that NRG is uniquely positioned not only to provide to consumers, but to be able to monetize that value in the wholesale market. There is no other entity with the scale of NRG that can do that today. That\u2019s why we are an early mover on this. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. Excellent. Thank you. Just a quick clarification from the last question from Shar. When he asked you about acquisitions or divestments on gas, I presume that what we saw with Gregory here is perhaps an indication of the margin of continued divestment on the margin of your portfolio as you move over time, right? We should set the expectation that more of these kinds of transactions are in the wings. Again, I get that Gregory was a very specific pattern here we assume. Mauricio Gutierrez : I think we are, for the most part, done on the optimization front. I mean remember, the optimization of our portfolio is driven by what we need to serve our load in the best possible way. STP, I already talked at great length, it\u2019s block power, it is not necessarily, it is not flexible, it doesn\u2019t move. We can replace that in the market. Gregory was also very specific. This is basically a plan that was built to provide steam to our host. So they really didn\u2019t do provided the attributes of characteristics that we wanted from a flexible asset. I think after Gregory and STP I would say our optimization efforts are largely done. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you. Julien. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Seaport. Your line is now open. Angie Storozynski : Good morning, guys. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Angie. Angie Storozynski : Good morning. So first on Vivint. So one I was just wondering if you have heard any feedback from your activist investor about how holding onto Vivint is working out for you in the stock, so that\u2019s one. And number two is, so you mentioned a number of positive updates on Vivint. One of the main ones, at least that\u2019s stuck-up with me is the, basically lower attrition. So is it fair to say that the higher interest rates and thus lower migration is actually what\u2019s benefiting your platform. Again not something that would everything to link higher interest rates as a benefit for a business like yours, but it\u2019s deals that way. Mauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Angie. So let me take the first one and then I am going to ask Rasesh to answer your second question. The focus of the management team and the company is to execute on our consumer strategy. And I think what you are seeing in the last two quarters is that, we basically delivering on the commitments that we provided to all of you on Investor Day. That\u2019s our focus. I have been in -- on the road talking to investors to help them better understand the strategy, to help them better understand the value proposition that this consumer strategy represents and not just to the activist, but to all shareholders. And that has been our focus, that\u2019s what we can do as a company, as a management team and I am very pleased with the results that we are delivering and I think shareholders in general are appreciating the value of our consumer strategy. And what I will say that also market participants as a whole, whether it\u2019s ISOs or whether it is the regulators, they are starting to see the benefit and the opportunity that demand represents to better manage the entire power grid given the greater electrification that we are going to see in the years to come. So I think thus finally happening. But Rasesh the second question can you address? Rasesh Patel : You bet. Angie, good morning. I think the results reflect the strong value proposition that we provide to consumers. If you think about 7% subscriber growth. We are also seeing an increase in the number of products each subscriber is actually taking into 5% growth in recurring revenue, simultaneously the cost-to-serve customers is down 19% on a unit basis year-over-year. And as you mentioned, one of the most powerful aspects of the value proposition is the near -- I think that a record-low attrition rate for us and this economy to have a nine-year customer life. When you bring these things together, combined with the fact that the average consumer is engaging with our products, 33% more than they were this time last year. It\u2019s a really robust flywheel that results in just improving customer lifetime value and so we feel really good about the business and we think there\u2019s a long runway ahead forward. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Just one follow-up on Vivint. So, Rasesh, you remember, as you said yourself, you are bringing forward this DR [ph] driven this growth on the Vivint side, I thought that the reason why we had expected the growth to materialize on the 2025 and beyond was because you actually needed some software upgrades, some sort of investment to facilitate that growth. So have you put those forward, hence the growth is materializing earlier? Rasesh Patel : Yeah. So, I will say, and we literally just finish a pilot where we are connecting our Smart Home technology to our commercial operations. So let me take a little bit of a step-back. We already cover residential demand response program on our traditional energy business and that is connected to the backbone of our commercial operations to make sure that we optimize the system. What we have been doing the last couple of weeks and then is to connect now the Smart Home technology platform to our commercial operations backbone. That was very successful. That\u2019s why I said that, we are accelerating those efforts and instead of being a five-plus-year opportunity, I see that as a three-plus-year opportunity. The improvements and investments that we need to do on the technology backbone is included in that 20% of growth, we are not going to increase that. What I am saying is that, there is the need and the -- by the consumer and quite candidly by the power grid to accelerate these efforts. So really, really good progress there, Angie. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then the last question, and again, I understand the explanation behind the divestiture of STP and I see that the EBITDA contribution from Gregory was very small, but you are getting shorter and shorter power in Texas. And again I know that not for a given summer because you hedge, but we just survive this the summer, I mean, better than survived, but anyway. I mean, all of these conservation alerts from ERCOT are causing anxiety among us and new investors, I am sure. So just strategically speaking, getting rid of more power plants in Texas, how do we manage this risk of matching the retail load with self-generation in Texas? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yeah. So, Angie, let me just say two things. Number one, we are -- when we serve our customers we are not short. We are actually leaning long. We don\u2019t have to own every megawatt or produce every megawatt that we sell to our customers. That will be the first thing. The second thing is, and perhaps, to your point about, ERCOT. When I think about the market, my view is that, the marginal unit, which means the most cost-efficient today is renewable energy. It\u2019s going to be wind and solar, intermit and generation. That\u2019s zero variable cost generation. What that means is that, for the most part of ours in the market is quite clear at a very low price, except for those periods where perhaps renewable is not performing as normal, because the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining. So you are going to see very few periods of scarcity conditions. But for the most part, the rest of the intervals, the rest of the hours are going to be very low price. So that\u2019s why demand response and the optimizing demand management is so, so important, because that basically gives you instantaneous peaking capacity exactly for the duration that you want, which is very short durations. I think we have the improvement that we have made on our supply strategy is very consistent with what we expect the market will be paid in the future and the opportunity around the management is again completely consistent with that expectation in terms of price formation and market behavior. So I believe we have positioned the company very, very well for the foreseeable future. And I will just say one more thing, we literally experienced the hottest summer on record in Texas and the grid handled it very well. The only time when we saw scarcity pricing was really at phase where we have low renewable output and even there ERCOT was managing the grid very conservatively. So I will say that, for those of you who really wanted to test the ERCOT market and the improved supply strategy that we have at NRG. This was the test and we passed with high flying colors I think. Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our -- please wait one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan of Wolfe. Your line is now open. Michael Sullivan : Hey, everyone. Good morning. Mauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Michael. Michael Sullivan : Hey. Just wanted to follow-on one of the questions from earlier in terms of the growth target realization looks like that\u2019s coming little bit sooner than expected. Does that indicate any potential upsides to the 2025 number of $300 million run rate? Mauricio Gutierrez : I think right now we are comfortable accelerating the 2023 targets, just given the success on our growth and cross-sell. Yeah, I think, it\u2019s early to start thinking about moving the $300 million by 2025. What I will say is that, that roadmap does not include the VPP or demand side management potential and that\u2019s something that we are going to be talking to all of you, quantifying it and how big it be and when can we start realizing it. So that\u2019s more to come there. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great. And then just specifically on the ERCOT portfolio, next week\u2019s vote on the loan bill, does that drive any decision-making in terms of optimization of the fleet or newbuild or anything like that? Mauricio Gutierrez : I mean, it is one more data point that we are going to take into consideration. I think the first step for the loan program, it is the vote and then the second step is the rules around how the loan program is going to work. Obviously, all market participants are looking at it and we will -- again, it will be one more data point for us to inform our supply strategy, but it is only one more data point. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great. Thank you. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our final question comes from the line of Ryan Levine of Citi. Your line is now open. Ryan Levine : Good morning. I am hoping to start off saying more on the strategic side. At the Analyst Day, you indicated an aversion to larger strategic acquisitions. Given that the pre-capsule picture is becoming more favorable and maybe pricing for assets is going down. How committed are you to that vision and you think you highlight some potential VPP and power plant opportunities? Is there any scope around what type of incremental capital that could enable? Mauricio Gutierrez : Well, the first thing I will say is, as I mentioned on Investor Day, we don\u2019t see any more acquisitions. Second, we are completely committed to this capital allocation framework of 80% of return, 20% of growth. And third, the 20% is inclusive of the opportunity that we see on VPP. So, we will continue unpacking what that opportunity is and the investment, but it will be contained within the 20% during the planning period that we provided to you. Ryan Levine : Okay. I appreciate the clarification. And then one more on the modeling side in terms of the Vivint, subscriber acquisition cost coming up and that subscriber acquisition cost coming up, what\u2019s driving that and what do you think from a trend standpoint in terms of customer acquisitions? Mauricio Gutierrez : Yeah. It is really a function of two things. One is the increase in interest rates year-over-year and two is a function of the consumer buying more products when they take our service. And on the second point, we feel very good about both the payback period, as well as the IRR. You see the boost in recurring revenue per subscriber that\u2019s disclosed in the KPIs. I want to remind you that that\u2019s across the entire 2.1 million subscriber base. If you would only look at the new customer acquisition cohort, the revenue increase -- the service revenue increase is even more substantive than that. And so, we feel very good about the payback of that incremental investment in the consumer as they take more products from us. Ryan Levine : Is the customer composition or the customer mix evolving or any comments you are able to make around the characteristics of your new subscriber cost? Mauricio Gutierrez : No. Other than the new customers are sort of taking more product as we continue to expand our product portfolio. There\u2019s no change in the mix. We have a very, very high quality subscriber base and high credit scores. And so it\u2019s a very resilient business from that standpoint. Ryan Levine : Okay. I appreciate you taking my question. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Ryan. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Mauricio Gutierrez for closing remarks. Mauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Darren. Well, I would like to thank all of you for your interest in the company and your support and look forward to providing you updates in the future. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Cole : Thank you. Good morning. And welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcast. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements which are based upon assumptions and we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings.

And with that, I will now turn the call over to Larry Coben, NRG\u2019s Chair and Interim President and CEO. Larry Coben : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm Larry Coben, and I am the Chairman, Interim President and CEO. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer and we also have members of the management team on the call and available for question. While I have been CEO for three months, I have been Chairman for seven and on the Board for 20 years. I have never been more excited about NRG as a company than I am today.  Let's begin with the NRG value proposition on Slide four. We are the trusted partner to almost eight million residential customers earned every day through unique and differentiated offerings that simplify and improve our customers lives. We have 5.9 million energy and 2 million smart home customers and manage the second largest C&I Energy and Natural Gas retail portfolio in the country. We have taken the necessary steps to position NRG to win the energy transition. At the convergence of energy and technology in the home and grid, with the evolution of smart devices and generative AI data centers.  We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in financial flexibility to return significant capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our business and financial outlook has never been stronger. And I've never been more excited about the future of the company than I am today.  Turning to Slide five. First, in 2023 we delivered record free cash flow before growth and near record adjusted EBITDA. We exceeded our Investor Day outlook and our previously increased 2023 guidance ranges. This is the direct result of the strategic initiatives and actions we've taken in recent years to strengthen and stabilize our business. Our outlook continues to get better and better, and today we are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges.  Next, we made significant progress advancing our long term energy transition and electrification strategy. We have line of sight to achieving our current $550 million by 2025. And we are now turning our attention to the next phase of our growth. Lastly, we continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which involves both a strong balance sheet and returning significant capital to you, our shareholders.  Turning to Slide six. We delivered $844 million of adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, 82% higher than the prior year. This brings our full year results to $3.282 billion of adjusted EBITDA, 76% higher than last year, primarily driven by improved operational performance of our Integrated Energy platform and the addition of our Smart Home Business.  Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA was $152 million above our original guidance midpoint, and at the high end of our adjusted guidance, while free cash flow before growth came in above the high end of our increased guidance range at $1.92 billion, or $185 million above our original guidance midpoint. This resulted in $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share in 2023, well ahead of the $8.50 per target provided at our June Investor Day.  Bruce will provide more details certainly, but again, this performance is the direct result of our strategic initiatives and actions taken to strengthen and grow our business. And I know that these took place even with share purchases occurring at higher levels than projected about Investor Day. Turning to our 2023 scorecard, we delivered across our strategic priorities. As you know, safety is our top priority, and I'm pleased to share that we achieve top decile safety performance through a year with many distractions. I'd like to thank all of our employees for their focus, and dedication and hard work to making this happen, as well as the making our financial results happen.  Next, we made progress in our continuous improvement goals for cost excellence. We completed the $300 million Direct Energy Synergy program announced earlier in the year, and we quickly turned our attention to identify and execute our previously announced next phase of cost initiatives $250 million by the end of 2025. Turning to growth, our success in achieving the $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share versus our $8.50 target was primarily driven by faster execution of our growth plan. We are incredibly pleased with the results of our Smart Home acquisition and believe our current growth plan is just the beginning. We are only starting to scratch the surface. Lastly, on capital allocation, we executed over $1.5 billion in debt paid down and returned another $1.5 billion to shareholders.  Turning to Slide seven, let's take a look at our 2024, outlook. Today, we are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges, and our Investor Day 15% to 20% growth strategic roadmap. We are well positioned across each of our businesses to deliver on our commitments. In consumer energy we expect the momentum gained in 2023, to continue into 2024, with volume margins and earnings growing across residential and small commercial as well as commercial and industrial customer segments.  They success will be driven by our diverse and efficient marketing and sales engines, our leading care and retention capabilities, and our best-in-class innovative digital experience. We are also seizing numerous opportunities as they arise or as we create them. An exciting example is Lubbock, Texas, a market of just over 100,000 customers that opened in early January, with 65% of customers having already made their electricity provider choice. So far we are exceeding expectations for our success and winning customers and look forward to bring our innovative offerings and experiences to that market. We also continue to see momentum with Community Choice programs, as a way for customers to experience the benefits of electricity competition in markets that don't have favorable political and regulatory sentiment that would allow customers to have the ability to freely choose their electricity providers.  Next, our diversified supply strategy manages our retail exposure in multiple scenarios to include events, like the extreme summer of 2023 and Winter Storm Heather this past January, well, at the same time handling the mild weather that we have seen most of this winter. Our targeted investments for reliability and flexibility across our fleet led to material improvements in the performance of our generation when we needed it, and we expect to realize continued improvements. We continue to evaluate various ways to enhance our supply strategy.  We have three brownfield sites ready to go in Texas with dispatch flexibility, and we are considering additional storage options for the portfolio, primarily through longer term structured transactions, rather than outright ownership. And finally, the smart home business delivered a strong year driving impressive top and bottom line growth, recurring revenue and margin per customer increased through selling more products and services while simultaneously reducing net service costs per customer, we will continue to drive toward the horizontal expansion of our eight million customers wallet.  Our customer retention is the best in the industry with an average customer life in the Smart Home Business of nine years, driven by unmatched customer engagement and world class, product performance and reliability. We continue to focus on integrating Smart Home and Energy in achieving the initiatives we have previously communicated to you. Turning to Slide 8, for a closer look at growth and cost initiatives. In 2023, we advanced our energy transition electrification, and continuous improvement strategy and delivered $138 million of incremental earnings, which was more times than twice our original $65 million target. We exceeded our goals for both growth and cost savings resulting in more than $100 million of growth in our core businesses and sales channel optimization and more than $35 million in cost savings. This outperformance was primarily the result of realizing synergies faster than originally anticipated. And today, we are reaffirming the full plan target of $550 million of growth and cost initiatives by the end of 2025. Outside of this $550 million program, we have also identified additional attractive initiatives that are in early development, leveraging the significant value creation opportunity from the convergence of energy and technology in the home in the grid. First, is for example, Virtual Power Plants are VPP, where we are uniquely positioned given our customers scale and reach, our data science, proficiency and decades of commercial market -- commercial and market experience. Importantly, VPP will increase in value as the grid tightens, and our Integrated Energy Business will allow us to monetize this value without requiring regulatory change.  Second on data centers and AI. Today, we are one of the largest competitive providers of power to the hyperscalers and other data center managers. And we have been in direct conversations with several of these customers about using more load. We see this as a significant opportunity for NRG and for competitive markets more broadly.  Finally, we continue to evaluate strategic dispatchable new build, with 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield projects in Texas ready to go. As you may know in November, Texas voters approved the Texas Energy Fund, which provides support for new dispatchable generation. We expect the rules for that to be adopted earlier this year with applications beginning mid-year. We anticipate providing an update on these projects over the coming months.  With that I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Chung, for a financial review. Bruce Chung : Thank you, Larry. Moving to Slide 10. For 2023, NRG produced adjusted EBITDA of $3.282 billion, exceeding our original guidance and at the high end of our upward revised guidance range. And free cash flow before growth of $1.925 billion, exceeding the high end of our upward revised guidance range. Our 2023 free cash flow before growth and adjusted EBITDA represent the highest and second highest respectively in NRG\u2019s history. This strong financial performance is a direct result of excellent execution across our businesses, and made possible by the continued focus and effort from each of our employees in a year full of potential distractions.  Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA improved by $1.4 billion as compared to 2022, driven by strong performance in our Texas region, the addition of the Vivint Smart Home Business and execution of our growth and cost efficiency plans. Taking a closer look at the drivers within our segments, and beginning with Texas. Our full year adjusted EBITDA increased by $806 million over 2022. This was driven by higher revenue rates coupled with lower supply costs. Our diversified supply strategy worked as designed throughout a volatile year, lowering our supply costs during the mild start to the year and providing stable pricing through the summer's extreme heat.  As we discussed throughout 2023, the margin expansion we saw across both our residential and C&I energy businesses, was produced through a combination of careful revenue rate management, and providing our customers with differentiated products that address their needs for affordability, comfort and peace of mind. We believe this margin expansion will be durable over the foreseeable future, and this view is reflected in our 2024 guidance. In addition to improved margins, our Residential Energy business delivered strong customer retention of nearly 80%, while maintaining average customer tenure of six years. This is a testament to the strength of our brands, and customer experience. Our East/West services segments were lower by $142 million versus the prior year. This was due to $60 million from asset retirements in sales, with the remainder of the variance from the combination of lower average realized pricing at the Cottonwood facility, as well as a challenging housing market and more conservative consumer discretionary spending impacting our HVAC and Goal Zero services businesses.  Finally, the addition of Smart Home contributed $753 million in adjusted EBITDA, finishing above the high end of our upward revised guidance for this segment. Throughout 2023, Smart Home delivered across all of its key metrics. Most notably, Smart Home achieved 6%, ending subscriber growth in an otherwise challenging macro environment. In addition to improving monthly recurring service margins at 9%, through increasing average monthly revenue per subscriber coupled with a continued focus on cost efficiency.  Turning to free cash flow before growth. NRG achieved $1.925 billion in 2023, setting a new record for the company. This represents an improvement of $1.4 billion over the prior year, primarily driven by our stronger EBITDA performance, along with improved working capital initiatives across our businesses.  At our Investor Day in June, we communicated the 2023 target of $8.50 of free cash flow before growth per share. Our strong performance in 2023 resulted in $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share, even after repurchasing shares, at a 25% premium to what we had originally assumed in our Investor Day plan. Our platform is designed to generate significant cash flow, and based on that $9.25 per share, and our current share price that represents an implied free cash flow yield of 18%. Given this dislocation repurchasing our shares remains one of the best investments we can make. And as such, we remain firmly committed to staying the course with our capital allocation framework.  Throughout 2023, we have demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our strategy, and coupled with the compelling long term macro tailwinds for the increasing electrification of the economy, and convergence of energy with smart technologies, we are confident in the outlook for our share price.  Turning to the next slide, I'd like to provide some additional context for 2023 financial results. On the left side of the page, we highlight the resiliency of our core energy business. Our Texas fleet performed well through the second hottest summer in Texas history, and most recently continued to perform through the volatility experienced during January's Winter Storm Heather. Over the last few years, we have strategically invested capital in improving the reliability of our facilities and anticipation of volatility across both summer and winter conditions. And we are seeing the impact of those investments through material improvement in our -- in the money availability factor. This is a performance measure illustrating the availability of our generation assets during periods when we need them the most.  As you can see in the bar chart, we realized a 14% and 13% improvement in summer and winter respectively in this metric. Furthermore, we saw a nearly 20% improvement in this metric on comparing the fleet performance during a Winter Storm Heather versus Winter Storm Elliott. This level of improvement was and will be critical to ensuring we're able to serve our retail load cost effectively.  Moving to the right side of the page, our Smart Home Business surpassing original expectations, primarily driven by expanded monthly recurring service margins. Notably, the margin expansion was a function of both higher average revenues per subscriber coupled with lower cost to serve. We're also seeing higher take rates on Smart Home products and services at the point of sale, which is a testament to the effectiveness of our Smart Home sales channels, and Smart Home customers recognizing the benefit of increasing the intelligence of their homes through additional seamlessly integrated devices.  Turning to Slide 12, for an updated view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see from the slide, not much has changed since our third quarter earnings call, where we provided our initial view on 2024 capital allocation. We are still planning on $500 million of debt paid down in 2024, and expect to return nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common dividends. Coupled with the 2023 share repurchase program, we will have executed nearly 75% of the current $2.7 billion authorization by the end of 2024. We expect the 2023 accelerated share repurchase program to conclude by the end of Q1 this year, at which point we will begin executing our 2024 repurchase plan on a more regular and programmatic basis throughout the year.  As I mentioned earlier, at an implied yield of 18%, we see our shares as an excellent investment for shareholder capital. And as such, remain committed to the 80-20 principle we rolled out during an Investor Day. In terms of incremental changes since our last earnings call and moving from left to right, 2024 excess cash increased $74 million because of the over performance in 2023. Other investments increased $33 million, primarily from a calendar year shift in integration costs and capital deployed to small book acquisitions in our Residential Retail business.  Finally, we have $41 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024, which we will evaluate the use of as we move along the year. Before I hand it back to Larry, I'd like to point out that we included some new slides in the appendix of today's presentation, which provide more disclosure around our energy business. We believe this disclosure will enable investors to model our energy business with a level of granularity they did not have before. These slides will be updated with each earnings call we have going forward. We hope you find them helpful, and our Investor Relations team is more than happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the new disclosures.  With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry. Larry Coben : Thank you, Bruce. On Slide 14, I want to provide a few closing thoughts about 2024, our priorities and our expectations. We are laser focused on delivering on our financial and operational commitments and adhering to our capital allocation principles. We will continue to integrate Smart Home with our energy businesses and deliver on our growth and cost initiatives. All while advancing our energy transition and electrification strategy. I have never been more excited about the future of energy. We are seeing signs of step change improvement in fundamentals across our platform, including the convergence of energy and technology in the home and grid through smart devices and generative AI. We believe this will put a spotlight on the scarcity of the critical products and services we sell and the durability of our platform.  Said bluntly, I believe this step change will signify a change in the depressed valuations for NRG in our sector that have resulted in 20% plus cash flow yields. This will be good for NRG and the sector and its very exciting times. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. With that thank you for your time and your interest in NRG. We're now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent. Good morning, guys. Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it. Look, I know you said it somewhat explicitly in the comments. But I wanted to come back to this. Obviously, with the shares materially higher here, how are you think about where you're positioned relative to the 15% to 20% FCF per share target through the forecast period? I just wanted to kind of tackle that, obviously doing very well against those targets here out of the gate year 1. I just wanted to elaborate on that.  And then secondly, just wanted to come back to '24, here. Start of the year, looks like probably robust load. How do you think about that positioning you and as you think about reflecting that within what you've provided -- what would you have out there on targets, just in terms of the colder weather in Texas, specifically? Bruce Chung : Sure, hey, Julian, it's Bruce here. So with respect to the 15% to 20%, we still are committed to achieving that 15% to 20% growth in free cash flow before growth per share. We believe that we're increasing both the free cash flow and the EBITDA, as you know. If you look at the '24 number, that's about $150 million above what we had already kind of indicated, as part of the Investor Day plan. So we are seeing drivers, both in the numerator, and then obviously, we remain committed to the capital allocation plan. And so, we're going to also be driving that denominator. So we still remain committed to that 15% to 20%.  With respect to the other question, as we think about 2024, we are basically positioned in the same way as we were in 2023. And so that gives us a lot of comfort, in terms of being able to handle what may be on the -- what may be coming for us from a load perspective. Winter Storm Heather, we performed very well, the fleet performed very well. And so we're pretty confident about where we stand at this stage. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Wonderful, excellent. If I could just nitpick a little bit on the comments from the -- you provided a second ago. You talked about longer term storage contract opportunities, this would presumably be an offtake arrangement, which you're an offtaker to some sort of battery investment that someone else makes. If I'm hearing you right, I just want to make sure I understood how you are thinking about batteries, and presumably are ERCOT here? Larry Coben : Look, I think that, yes that is the answer. But we'll always come back and take a look at the capital that we do have to allocate. But there's an awful lot of people here in Texas who are willing to spend their money on putting -- on providing storage for us. And that will probably be the optimal use of capital. But as you know, Julien, we always evaluate and reevaluated as we put our supply strategy together to optimize our capital structure. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent. All right, guys. We'll leave it there. Thank you guys very much. Congrats again. Nicely done. Bruce Chung : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Thank you, one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Shar Pourreza : Hey, Larry. Good morning. Larry Coben : Good morning, Shar. How are you? Shar Pourreza : Not too bad. Good morning. I wanted to ask a bit of a higher level question and it's obviously building off of Bruce's due disclose your comments and in light of the sort of maybe that step function change in valuation we saw with one of your peers yesterday. Have you given any consideration to maybe transitioning to EPS at some point in the future and providing maybe a bit of a longer range look? Larry Coben : Yes. Shar Pourreza : All right. I'll leave it at that one. Larry Coben : The answer, sorry, is yes. Yes. Stay tuned. Shar Pourreza : Right. I love it. And then, perhaps maybe just going back to the CEO search process. I mean, obviously, it's gotten a little bit more competitive recently with sort of on the power and utility headhunting side. Can you just give us some more color on where things stand today in terms of down selecting and curious if you're now a bit more focused on a power person, or retail consumer person? Thanks. Larry Coben : Sure, Shar. I won't take it personally that you seem to be anxious to get rid of me. Shar Pourreza : I want you to stay. But there\u2019s no reality. Larry Coben : No, look Shar, I don't think -- I think we're still looking for a bit person who spans the two types of things that we're doing, consumer and energy, as we said before. We have a terrific committee that's working exceptionally hard. And as I said to you, we had a huge list of candidates when we started, and they are whittling away at that. I think when we talked three months ago, I said three to nine months, and I still would stand by that time frame.  So I guess that would be 0 to 6 months from now, if I do the math correctly. And there's a tremendous number of people who are looking at NRG, are excited by the prospects, are excited by the ability to drive valuation given the incredible cash flow yield given the incredible prospects that we have at the confluence of NRG and Smart Home. And so I'm excited by the people that we're seeing, and I think you will be, too. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. And thank you guys and for the record, Larry, I personally would like you to just stay, but that's not reality to be sure. Larry Coben : Thank you, Shar. Operator : Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Your line is now open. Angie Storozynski : Good morning. So just also a big picture question. So -- I mean if there's one thing that we've learned over the last couple of weeks is that investors increasingly value physical power plants, especially those that don't get a participation medal for just showing up. So I'm just wondering how does that fit in your strategy of being asset-light on the generation side in light of the tightening supply demand fundamentals and power. Again, I understand that there is the demand response and other ways to probably fit in, in this new picture. But I'm just wondering, just simplistically speaking, how do you deal with that? Larry Coben : Sure. Angie, I'm going to let Rob expand on that, but I've never -- I don't think we're asset-light, we're asset optimal and will always be asset optimal and that maybe semantics, but I think they're important semantics. We have three brownfield projects that are ready to go, and you'll get some updates on those pretty soon, but that's 1.5 gigawatts of dispatchable capacity, and we have some more potential in the pipeline. Maybe, Rob, you want to expand on that, please? Robert Gaudette : Sure. So Angie, look, we're excited by the growing demand for power. Like I think that it's real. We know it's real because we talk to a lot of the growth guys, so it's the hyperscalers and others that you've all heard about. We talk to them a lot. And it's exciting for NRG for a couple of reasons. One, we sit in competitive markets, which is where I believe most of this demand growth is going to be. We're going to see expanded margins on our existing fleet, right? So as the product goes up, we're going to see more earnings off of our generation, and we've spent and invested inside of those plants so that we can capture that.  Like Larry said, we've got the three projects that are ready to go. And the other thing to think about, Angie is we've got 21 plant sites across the country. So if this growth continues and we see it mix economic sense, then there's an opportunity there. But ultimately, these guys are going to turn to partners like NRG. As the market tightens, they're going to look for people who've got the expertise that we have. So it's going to be good for the industry, but it's definitely going to be good for us. Angie Storozynski : But does that mean that in a sense you're shifting a bit of the growth on the energy side towards C&I customers? Because I remember that historically, that was a very small portion of the business and not -- well, meaningfully lower margins than the rest of the business. So anyway, is there like a different earnings or margin profile for those tech companies versus the traditional C&I load that you used to serve? Robert Gaudette : So generally, C&I margins themselves over the last few years have gone up. The difference in the margin from a hyperscaler versus a traditional C&I customer, there isn't -- we haven't seen a growth in margin on the hyperscalers. The way you should probably think about it is if you're going to get a bunch of demand into the system, which we believe is real. That's going to create tightness for all customers. And so C&I customers across the board not just data center customers are going to be looking for expertise, which means they're going to turn to the bigger players who can help them manage the risk in a higher price, tighter commodity environment. Does that help? Angie Storozynski : Okay. Yes. Thanks. And then changing topics and your IG aspiration. So I obviously see the metrics or the targeted metrics at the end of '24. Can you tell us if you've had any discussions with credit agencies how they see the business risks besides just hitting the numerical thresholds vis-a-vis the investment-grade ratings? Larry Coben : Larry, Angie. So just to clarify, we are not chasing an investment-grade rating. As we've always said, we are making sure that we want to hit the metrics that we believe correspond with an investment-grade rating, but that's not to say that we're necessarily going to be chasing it because ultimately, that is up to the agencies. We talk to the agencies very regularly and they like the path on which we are heading from a credit perspective. It's important to note that when you think about our credit metrics, it's not just debt to EBITDA that the agency is focused on.  They obviously also look at cash flow driven metrics. And so we're kind of triangulating around all of that. Ultimately, whether we get the rating or not, like I said, is not necessarily within our control. But what is within our control is being able to hit those metrics. I'd say, as we sit here today, given as you note where we're going to end up at the end of 2024, we think there's probably some flexibility in 2025 with respect to what our original deleveraging plans were as part of the Investor Day plan, but more to come on that as we move along in the year. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. I just wanted to kind of go over the cost improvements and the growth opportunity, the $550 million target that you have by 2025. So obviously, this year, you've kind of hit the ground running, exceeded expectations. Maybe can you sort of help us break that apart, the $100 million in growth opportunities? How much of that is cross-selling versus how much of that is actual margin expansion within your existing services? And then as you think about cost improvements, there's a big step change from $37 million this year to about $100 million. Maybe just walk through the drivers of that? Bruce Chung : Yes, you bet. So in terms of the growth synergies, we feel obviously very good about where we set one year into the plan through 2025. You can think about the mix as roughly 50% is actually driven by organic growth in the business units. We had obviously a strong year in the base business. And the other 50%, driven by a combination of cross-sell and think of it as a share of wallet type initiatives that improved the revenue and margin profile per customer. And so we've had a strong start.  We have a very high degree of confidence for the $300 million given we exceeded our initial guidance in year 1. And then as it relates to the cost side of things. The $100 million in cost synergies are really a function of elimination of two publicly traded companies, and we also exceeded our year 1 target for the cost side. And we have full line of sight to the $100 million by 2025. In fact, we will probably exceed our 2024 target towards that $100 million. And so as we sit here, we feel good on both ends, Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just a 1.5 gigawatt dispatchable generation opportunity. Can you maybe walk us through your thought process here? It sounds like you'll be making decisions in the second half of this year? How do you kind of gauge that versus buying back shares as I'm thinking about the long-term outlook, 2025 and beyond? Larry Coben : Look, let me just say, it will not impact one iota our capital allocation strategy or the buyback of shares. I want to make that clear again and again and again, and you can put that down as a headline. So very, very clear on that. Strategically, it's really -- we have a supply strategy that Rob has laid out on several occasions and looking at how these plants fit into that supply strategy, both for our existing customers, but also for the customers who are coming online with things like data centers like generative AI and some of the other things we've been talking about that are growth and tightening opportunities. Rob, do you want to add anything? Robert Gaudette : So the only thing I would tell you is, recall, we've been working on these for a while. We continue to work today. So we continue to get closer to being able to make final commitments in March, the rules for Texas come out. And then you can expect people to put their names in for the Texas Energy Fund probably June. I would expect that you guys will hear from us as to what we decide. But like Larry said, we're going to -- our capital allocation plan sticks and it all comes down to the financial opportunities that we see in either building the plants or doing something different. And right now, and as you guys have all seen, those plants have flexibility, which is good for how we manage our portfolio and ultimately good for what the grid needs in Texas. Durgesh Chopra : Very clear. Thank you again. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Arcaro : Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe on the Smart Home side of things, again, strong KPIs in 2023. I was wondering if you could comment on how you're expecting a couple of those like subscriber growth and recurring revenue. How do you see those trending now heading into 2024? Robert Gaudette : Yes. Thank you. We feel really good about how we exited the year end '23. As you mentioned, with 6% subscriber growth, 11% revenue growth, 17% adjusted EBITDA growth. And really, that's a function of a few things. First is the unit economics of the business are in great shape. If you look at the revenue per customer, the service cost reduction per customer up 21% that really drives an expansion of our service margin. And we expect that increased elevated margin to continue into 2024. As it relates to retention and brand loyalty, we are -- we had amongst our best years ever in terms of retaining our customers with a strong and durable customer relationships. We expect that to continue as well.  And then in terms of the subscriber growth, we expect to be in the mid-single digits from a subscriber growth perspective as well. So we feel good about how the business is set up in '24. If you zoom out, we operate in a large, growing and fragmented market. And our products and services have a very high degree of engagement and loyalty relative to peers. And so we think there is a lot of room ahead for us to continue to grow the business. David Arcaro : Okay. Got it. Thanks for that color. That's helpful. Then I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a bit more on the data center impact to the business. Am I understanding you correctly that as you see load growth from these data centers happen in ERCOT, for example, you could see, I guess, potentially higher pricing, more volatile pricing. And over time, that could lead to higher margins across the board, higher retail margins across customer classes for your business. Is that the right way to think about it? Robert Gaudette : It's Rob. Yes. So generative AI is going to load or created additional demand across the markets. The way to think about how that affects the businesses generally is let's start with that expands the margins on our existing generation portfolio and also makes that 1.5 gigawatts more interesting. And then when you think across the other parts of the business, C&I, you're going to see people turning towards bigger players like us, where we've seen it historically, when things get tighter, they run to quality providers.  We're there. And then from a home perspective, a consumer perspective, we've had a retail platform that has historically and will in the future, manage through different commodity cycles. And as prices move, our retail platform, because of the experience we have beyond just being a commodity provider, we do well in those markets, too. David Arcaro : Okay, great. Thanks for that. Much appreciated. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe. Your line is now open. Michael Sullivan : Hey, everyone. Good morning. Appreciate the new disclosures on the Energy business, by the way. But I wanted to just go back to Texas and new build there. And just maybe if you could just frame the broader political dynamic there, where things stand just in light of the Lieutenant Governor making some comments, I think, asking for new bill, do you kind of continue to see these headlines noise around the ECRS. I know we're not in a legislative session this year, but just kind of where the politics stand on market structure and the like? Larry Coben : If I could understand Texas politics, I'd be in a different business probably, Michael, but there's not a legislative session. I think it's fair to say that people are now looking to see whether everything that was passed in the last session is actually going to generate capacity in the state before people start breaking it up again and starting over. The PUC has a lot -- awful lot of work to do just to implement the many things that were passed in the legislature. And I think a combination of those measures plus the tightening market and the improving economics in the market and the expanding margins will probably generate the capacity that Texas will need to meet growth in the foreseeable future. At least that's our view of what's happening in politics. That doesn't mean that people from time to time won't try to use the energy business as a political football. But on balance, we actually see a fair amount of stability on the legislative front. Michael Sullivan : Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that's a tough one. And just if you do move forward with these brownfield plants, how long would it take to complete? Robert Gaudette : So the -- if you recall, the portfolio is 3 different projects, the speakers, we could get in, in 2 years and starting from whenever we broke ground and then a CCGT takes about 4. So you could expect if we were to go soon 2026 and 2028 would kind of be good years to think about from an additional capacity perspective. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great. And then just last 1 quick. You mentioned the new Lubbock market, any like rough sense of size of the opportunity set there? And is any of that baked into your plan? Or is that all upside? Elizabeth Killinger : Yes. So this is Elizabeth. Thanks for the question. So we are really excited about the Lubbock opening. Two things about it. One, 65% of consumers made a choice. And if you have a reference point like when the Texas market opened, 5% made a choice. So demonstrating that consumers actually care who they do business with in Energy. NRG participated in the presale process. That's where the 65% made the choice and those customers will come on flow in March, and that is baked into our 2024 and beyond growth plan. The only other thing I would say is so far, NRG is over performed, we have about 39% share of customers in Texas on the home front, and we are over performing relative to that. So again -- and Larry mentioned it, but about 100,000 customers in the marketplace that are making a choice. And so they'll start and be our and other retailer customers in March. Michael Sullivan : Great. Thanks for all the color. Appreciated. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. Your line is now open. Ryan Levine : Good morning. I am hoping to touch on retail energy gross margin outlook. It looks like your guidance is assuming about 100 basis points degradation there. How much is that weather normalized for '24? And is there any conservatism embedded in that forecast in light of your comments? Any color you could share around potential upside there, in particular, in Texas? Bruce Chung : So Ryan, it's Bruce. The 2024 number is certainly on a weather-normalized basis. But the '24 number does reflect a higher assumption on COGS for the retail business. And so there's just a bit of a timing lag between the realization of that COGS relative to when that gets pushed through in revenue rate.  But Elizabeth, if you want to provide a little bit more color to that? Elizabeth Killinger : Yes. So we've demonstrated margin stability over the years in the home space. And that comes from -- and most of you were there, from some of the AI machine learning revenue management tools and models we created back in the transformation program and since have continuously improved them. The other thing I would highlight is that over this, call it, the last decade, we've been able to deliver stable and growing margins in a variety of supply cost environment. So this one, Bruce mentioned, where costs have significantly increased over the last few years, and we've either grown or held margins through that time frame, aside from the weather normalization that you mentioned. Ryan Levine : How much cost escalation are you assuming for 2024 that's being offset by these other measures? Bruce Chung : Ryan, that's probably one that we'll have to just get back to you on to make sure that we get you the right numbers on that. Ryan Levine : Okay. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now pass it back to Larry Coben for closing remarks. Larry Coben : I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call today and for your interest in NRG. And I think you can see we are at the most exciting point probably in NRG's history. I think you can hear in the voices of the management and in our actual results, what we have and are planning to achieve going forward. We look forward to speaking with you more in the days ahead. We'll be at the conferences in New York next week. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to Kevin and Brendan with any further questions that you might have. Thank you all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Cole : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Larry Coben, NRG's Chair and Interim President and CEO. Lawrence Coben : Thank you very much, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning also by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer. And we also have members of the management team on the call who are available to answer questions. Let's begin with the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, our business performance exceeded expectations in the first quarter. I'm incredibly pleased with our strong start to the year and in reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges. Second, electrification trends compounded by Gen AI data center growth forecast a signal of transformative rises in power demand. As a result, we expect competitive markets to realize outsized benefits driven by business-friendly environments, available resources and the ability to cite projects quickly. Finally, NRG is well positioned to capitalize on tightened supply and demand in our core markets. Our technology-led consumer platform, our diversified generation portfolio, our leading business energy platform and a real estate site portfolio present a unique opportunity to create significant shareholder value. I'm going to give you visibility into this later in the presentation. Let's move to Slide 5 because I want to share again our value proposition, which may not be familiar to those of you who are new to NRG, and I understand there are several of you on this call. We serve nearly 8 million residential customers and operate the second largest C&I energy and natural gas retail business by volume in the United States. Our company sits at the intersection of energy and technology in the home and the grid. We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in the financial flexibility to grow earnings while returning significant capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The strength of our business and financial outlook has us uniquely positioned to capitalize on what we believe to the beginning stages of an exceptional time for our industry. It's an exciting time for our company. We remain on track to achieve our 15% to 20% free cash flow before growth per share CAGR target, even as our rising stock price means buying shares at higher prices than projected a year ago. Turning to Slide 6. In recent months, we've received numerous questions about the impacts of the forthcoming power demand growth super cycle on the industry and in NRG in particular. Today, I'd like to talk about what we are seeing. Bruce will then discuss the first quarter results later in the presentation. Starting with macro trends. We're seeing clear signs of a step change in the long-term fundamentals of power demand from multiple catalysts. This marks the departure from an extended period of stagnant power demand during which energy efficiency outpaced usage growth. For the first time in decades, and perhaps in my 40 years in this business, we are experiencing fundamental improvements driven by demand rather than commodity prices. We, along with every other forecasting expert I have read, are now expecting a step change in long-term power demand. This increase in demand is attributed to several factors, including electrification, manufacturing, onshoring, LNG, crypto, greater industrial loads and data center growth. Recent advancements in Gen AI are compounding and accelerating these factors, leading to the formation of the next power demand super cycle. At the same time, the U.S. power supply that is expected to accommodate this growth will increasingly depend on intermittent resources, which highlights a growing and unprecedented imbalance between dispatchable supply and demand. To be clear, it takes only a fraction of what is being forecasted to not just into this super cycle. And this super cycle will require an all-of-the-above supply approach, including retaining existing generation assets, developing new generation, and approaching supply and demand differently through the adoption of technology by shifting large loads, residential VPP and other forms of demand and energy management. This is a transformative opportunity for our sector and for NRG. If you turn to Slide 7, you'll see why competitive markets such as those in which NRG operates are best positioned to realize outsized benefits of this large load growth. It's due to the competitive framework that offers speed-to-market, affordability and resource availability. We see Texas and portions of the Northeast as the most favorable markets. Texas stands out as it is already a preferred destination for large loads including crypto, LNG and manufacturing onshoring, which all have experienced substantial growth in recent years and are exhibiting strong outlooks on the future. Texas benefits from its business-friendly practices, favorable regulatory environment, tax incentives and large land footprint, positioning it as a winner in the era of generative AI and other large load growth.  Furthermore, coupled with our ability to cite projects years faster than in regulated markets and its proximity to main fiber channels, I expect Texas to continue to be a leader in load growth. On Slide 8, I'd like to highlight 4 of the many key opportunities for value creation that exists across our platform. To leave no doubt, each of these opportunities represents upside to our June 2023 Investor Day growth plan, and it's not relying on potentially transitory subsidies or inflation reduction act funding. First, we are the only company to have residential energy and smart technologies at scale with nearly 8 million customers. We're a trusted provider and have the unique capability to provide novel energy management through our smart home ecosystem, a capability that will be necessary and increase in value in a tightening market. Second, you may not be aware or fully cognizant of the opportunity that it represents, but we are the second largest business-to-business electricity and largest natural gas provider by volume in North America. Beyond selling customers more of our products, we are a leader in premium services. We offer tailored energy management solutions that focus on optimizing and stabilizing energy costs. We're also able to commercially help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. These customers include many of America's largest industrial players and corporations as well as the hyperscalers. Third, our Texas generation fleet mix is a diverse set of assets that enable us to deliver stable supply costs while maintaining insurance for volatility through higher cost units that are not economical in the current year. These uneconomic units are primarily higher heat rate natural gas assets and in recent low price times may have run for only a few peak hours per year. We primarily use our generation fleet to supply our residential retail portfolio with customer fixed price contracts typically lasting a year or 2. As a result, our generation fleet is mostly open 18 to 24 months out. This creates a significant opportunity to swiftly capitalize on rising power prices and rising demand. As the value of our product increases and equally importantly, units that have historically operated only a few hours annually could now see increasing run times and, of course, profitability. Lastly, our real estate portfolio has several potential development sites for colocation of large loads or power plants. We own 21 sites with 21,000 acres at retired and existing generation facilities that generally have existing or access to grid interconnection. They are in competitive markets and given the extreme focus on project speed, potentially provide another avenue of value creation. Let's try to unpack each of these a bit. Turning to Slide 9. We operate 1 of the leading business-to-business power and natural gas platforms in North America. We serve nearly 100 terawatt hours of electricity and almost 1.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually. As demand growth scales, we anticipate increasing electric and natural gas sales volumes. Through our business platform, we help large load customers accomplish their intended goals through tailored plans, including stabilizing their energy costs, delivering specific attributes for their sustainability commitments and optimizing their usage through services such as demand response. At heart, these customers are looking for a partner to help them navigate complicated energy markets while minimizing their risk. We stand ready to provide the services they need as a large market participant with a best-in-class commercial operations platform and a track record of high-quality customer experiences. With respect to data centers. It is still the early days, but we are seeing signs that they are planning to ramp up capacity in the current years. As an anecdotal example, a data center customer approached us about increasing their capacity by 3x at an existing facility in the next 36 months. We are seeing and experiencing demand growth in real time. Moving to Slide 10. Our Texas generation fleet is diverse in technology, age and merit order. We operate 8.5 gigawatts of generation capacity in Texas, supplemented by 1.6 gigawatts of long-term power purchase agreements. We also have 1.5 gigawatts of shovel-ready brownfield projects in development. This strategic diversification across technologies, fuel types and merit orders ensures near-term stability and positions us to capitalize on opportunities from medium- to long-term margin expansion driven by higher power prices. On the right hand of the slide, we provide our Texas generation open growth margin sensitivity to changes in around-the-clock power price scenarios. This sensitivity provides insight into our generation portfolio's earnings power as economic generation increases in value and currently, uneconomic generation becomes not only economic but very profitable. On Slide 11 -- provide a more detailed look at our Texas generation gross margin sensitivity. This analysis focuses on changes in power prices, assuming flat natural gas pricing and normal weather. On the left side of the slide, we have included Texas as around-the-clock and peak pricing forwards for July 2023 and April 2024, which represents the assumed pricing in our 2024 guidance and are compared to today's forward. As you can see, ERCOT forward pricing has moved up significantly. The only explanation for this is that the market is starting to reflect increased power demand from large load growth. Also noteworthy is that the curve is no longer backward dated, suggesting a view and a long-term view of sustained tightness in the Texas power market. Building upon last quarter's additional modeling disclosure. On the right side of the slide, we have provided the necessary components to directionally model the gross margin opportunities for our Texas fleet in a dynamic pricing environment. We begin with the 2024 Texas generation base gross margin and include expected hedge positions of nearly fully hedged in year 1, roughly half in year 2 and less than 25% in year 3 for economic generation, respectively. We have also included an open gross margin scenario, which assumes no hedges. You will observe that our price sensitivity doesn't follow a linear pattern. Units becoming economically viable at different price levels, resulting in disproportionately larger benefits from increases in power prices compared to decreases. With ERCOT forward pricing rising $10 in the outer years on an open gross margin basis, this complies more than $400 million of margin benefit compared to 2024. Assuming we are 25% hedged in the year that, that move occurs, it translates to approximately $350 million of upside compared to 2024, and this is simply the beginning. This sensitivity analysis demonstrates that our portfolio is well positioned to capture significant margin upside in a rising price environment and that the underlying fundamental value of our fleet has materially increased. Supported by our diversified supply strategy, we have the agility and flexibility to leverage these market dynamics and translate them into significant and durable shareholder value. On Slide 12, I want to close by providing details of our site portfolio. Driven by the need for more capacity in the highly valued attributes these sites possess, we are incredibly excited about their potential value. We have 21 sites with 21,000 acres of land within competitive markets that are prime locations for new large loads and power plant development, with colocation opportunities both behind and in front of the meter. These sites offer a mix of valuable and critical access to infrastructure, including transmission, interconnection, water, abundance of land and proximity to long-haul fiber networks. Of particular significance to data centers, these attributes offer expedited construction time lines measured in years of time savings. We have established a dedicated team focused on maximizing the value of our site portfolio. When the analysis is complete later in the year, you can expect to hear more information from us regarding the potential for these sites and what would be required to turn them into new capacity, data center locations or behind the meter projects. With that, let me turn it over to Bruce for the first quarter review. Bruce Chung : Thank you, Larry. Turning to Slide 14. Our top decile safety and strong operating performance resulted in first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $849 million, exceeding the first quarter of 2023 by $203 million. This represents a 31% increase in our adjusted EBITDA from the prior year. $150 million of the year-over-year increase was the result of the inclusion of a full quarter's worth of Smart Home EBITDA. The remaining increase was attributable to outperformance in our East and West segments, driven by lower realized supply costs, partially offset by a slight decline in our Texas region due to mild weather. Our consumer energy and smart home platforms increased customer counts year-over-year by 8% and 6%, respectively. Most notably, we added 35,000 customers from the newly opened Lubbock market in Texas, representing a healthy share of the available customer base. This is a testament to the hard work of our consumer energy team over the past 2 years to position NRG and its brands as the electricity provider of choice in Lubbock. Similar to 2023, our Smart Home platform continued to demonstrate strong execution. In addition to growing customer count 6% year-over-year, service margins increased 5% year-over-year, and monthly recurring revenue per subscriber grew 5% over the same period. It is clear that customers recognize the value of our Smart Home services as evidenced by our growth in the face of various macro headwinds affecting the consumer discretionary sector. Our diversified supply strategy continued to deliver, ensuring that we sustain the level of margin expansion we saw in 2023 while also providing the necessary coverage against potential volatility in the winter months. As we discussed in our last earnings call, our fleet performed well in the first quarter, demonstrating a 12% improvement in our in-the-money availability factor winter-over-winter. We have taken advantage of the mild winter in February and March to conduct our maintenance activities more proactively, and we feel confident about fleet performance heading into the critical summer months. Next, I would like to highlight some of what we have focused on as an organization through the first quarter as well as what we continue to remain focused on through the balance of the year. During the quarter, we concluded the $950 million accelerated share repurchase program we launched in November of last year. Through that program, we repurchased nearly 19 million shares at an average price of $50.43 per share, or almost 10% of the shares outstanding, at the time that we launched the ASR. We remain committed to our capital allocation plan, and we are reaffirming our 2024 return of capital amount of approximately $1.2 billion, comprised of our common dividends, which we increased earlier this year and a further $825 million in share repurchases. As Larry discussed, we continue to advance our 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield development in Texas. We will be filing our Notices of Intent for the 3 projects to the Texas Energy Fund in the coming days, and we anticipate filing formal loan applications in early June when they are due. Our brownfield development portfolio comprised of 2 peaking plants and 1 combined cycle project, with CODs ranging from 2026 to 2028 is shovel-ready, and represents some of the most real natural gas-fired development opportunities in the ERCOT market. We have been developing these projects since 2021 and we believe that the advancements we have made on the permitting and equipment procurement fronts should position these projects at the front of the queue for consideration by the PUCT for funding out of the loan program. Next, we continue to remain on track to achieve our $550 million program of growth and efficiency initiatives across our business platforms. As I mentioned earlier, our consumer platforms continue to drive strong stand-alone growth, and we continue to see positive momentum in our ability to generate more margin per customer. A great example of this is the tremendous progress we've made in selling the Vivint protection plan. We started selling this plan shortly after closing the Vivint acquisition. And to date, we have about 15% penetration of the existing Smart Home customer base or over 300,000 active plans, with each plan generating approximately $9 of monthly revenue per customer. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance for both EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. We have tremendous momentum in both our consumer and business platforms and the measures we are taking in our diversified supply strategy should set us up well for the balance of the year.  Turning to Slide 15 for an updated view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see from the slide, there have been no substantial changes since our last earnings call in terms of the quantum of capital allocated to liability management and capital return. As you may recall, we had planned $500 million of debt reduction in our last earnings call as part of the 2024 capital allocation plan. As you can see from the slide, that has changed slightly given our efforts in Q1 to address our outstanding convertible notes. Through April 30, we repurchased $343 million of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes, resulting in $257 million of additional premium paid to retiring noteholders. Given the cash allocated to settle the convertible note premium, that reduced our net debt reduction to $243 million planned for the year. Our strong share price performance over the past year made the convertible notes one of the most expensive pieces of paper in our capital structure. Therefore, we believe that made the most economic sense to pursue a retirement of that instrument before it would get even more expensive as our share price continues to reflect our fair value. Moving a few columns over to the right, you will see that the share repurchase column is $865 million versus the $825 million we showed in our last earnings call. The reason for that is because we now include $40 million of cash allocated to settle tax matters related to our 2023 share repurchases and Employee Stock Compensation Plan. This would include the excise tax on share repurchases instituted as part of the passage of the inflation Reduction Act. Previously, we had bucketed that allocated cash in other categories, but we decided to move those dollars into the share repurchases category in order to more accurately reflect what the cash is being used for. Finally, similar to our last earnings call, we continue to show $41 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024, which we will evaluate the use of as we move along the year. With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry. Lawrence Coben : Thank you very much, Bruce. On Slide 17, I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2024 priorities and expectations. We remain laser focused on execution and on delivering on our financial, operational and safety commitments. We are seeing a step change improvement in fundamentals across all of our platforms. We believe that this will put a spotlight on the scarcity of the critical products and services we sell and the durability of that platform. We are uniquely positioned to deliver significant shareholder value for years to come. Again, we are the only company to combine residential, energy and smart technologies at scale, with nearly 8 million customers and the necessary capabilities to create sustainable value through both tightening and loosening power market conditions. We operate the second largest business-to-business electricity and largest natural gas platform in North America, positioning us as a leader in premium services and tailored energy management solutions. Our integrated supply strategy provides incredible capabilities to stabilize near-term earnings while capturing medium- to long-term margin expansion opportunities from higher power prices. And we own a large Latin portfolio with premium attributes for what is to come in the super cycle of power demand. In my 20 years at the company and over 40 years in power, I have never been more excited about the future of our sector at NRG. The step change in demand should lead also to a change in the depressed valuations for NRG and its peers. These depressed valuations have resulted in double-digit cash flow yields such as ours. This revaluation will be good for NRG and others in our space, and it's very exciting times. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. With that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. We're now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Just Larry, on the curves themselves. There's, obviously, a lot of chatter in the industry right now about some large generators like nukes to go behind the meter. Is this something, I guess, that concerns you as you look at your length in the Eastern markets? So as you go out to the market to match load, are suppliers raising any kind of concerns there? Robert Gaudette : Shar, it's Rob. Like it doesn't raise any concerns for us as far as trying to purchase supply so that we can meet retail obligations. Even if they do go behind the meter, there's plenty of players in the East. It's a very liquid market. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. Got it. Perfect. And then maybe just a little longer dated. But as you're kind of highlighting the Texas fleet heavily here, it seems warranted. How would you -- the recent sort of the EPA regs as they stand, impact your generation profile maybe over the next couple of years, right? Is it just additional CapEx? Could we see an acceleration of gas development work beyond the 1.5 gigs that, obviously, Bruce was highlighting of shovel-ready proposals. Just more color on how these items are kind of interacting. Robert Gaudette : Sure. So when you think about the regulations that were promulgated, the first thing I would say, Shar, is that they're all going to be litigated, right? AG, states, ISOs, consumers, everyone has a view and a reason to make sure that these rules get set in place in a way that works for the system and provides reliable and affordable power over time. As far as specifics around us, some of the rules will have to see how they pan out at the end. But what I would tell you is that our decisions to invest around the gas fleet or the 1.5 gig that Bruce talked about earlier, have nothing to do with these regs. It's all about the opportunity that we see in the markets, and we'll continue to drive that way. Does that make sense? Shahriar Pourreza : Yes. That was perfect. And then, Larry, it sounds like you're having a really good time on the job right now. So maybe you're not in a rush. But is there anything as far as any updates on the CEO search? Or are you having too much fun? Lawrence Coben : Well, Shar, I am having a lot of fun. But look, it's a great team, and it's a great company and it's -- look, it's a fantastic job. The committee continues to do its work. I think they're still on the time frame that I talked to you about, but there's no rush. I've told them that, to take their time and that I will continue in this position as long as necessary, until they find the right person that they're happy with to be the next CEO of NRG. But given all the opportunities that we have and everything that we've been talking about on this call, you're right, Shar, I am having fun. And I think you're supposed to have fun. Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. Really big congrats to Elizabeth. She's been such a fantastic phase for NRG for some time. Operator : The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Agnieszka Storozynski : So first, for the last maybe 20 years, you were trying to convince us that you are power price-agnostic. Clearly, not any longer. That's number one. So how do we think about it, this new backdrop, how it impacts your retail business versus wholesale business? Is this additional margin going to be realized by selling this more expensive power to the retail arm? So that's number one. Number two is, so this is gross margin. Is there like an additional O&M layer, we should think about or on maintenance, both on the cost side and CapEx side? Just to get a sense of how big an impact you will have on the EBITDA of the sway in power prices. Lawrence Coben : And let me have Rob talk a little bit about the CapEx and repair side. And then I'd ask Rasesh to talk a little bit about the margin side . Robert Gaudette : Angie, when you think about taking the gross margin expansion that you see on the chart and then trying to translate that across over to EBITDA, I would point out -- so think about it in 2 pieces, right? So on the plants that are the generation that's currently running today, right, the stuff that we've built into our numbers and are running today. When you see a step change in power that has zero impact on OpEx for those megawatts because they're already running. The place where you'll pick up additional OpEx and translate that down to EBITDA is on the stuff that's running more. So we talked to you guys historically about an increase in run times on some assets, given a change in price. It's those additional hours that actually cost you more. And the way that I would translate that down would probably be at the same kind of rate, which is Bruce, correct me if I'm wrong, 80%. Bruce Chung : Yes, we would probably see something like an 80% translation to EBITDA and then probably like a 75% translation of the free cash flow. Robert Gaudette : Does that answer your question? Agnieszka Storozynski : Yes. Rasesh Patel : And then, Angie, on the retail margins, I mean, I think we've proven our ability to maintain strong retail margins over time. Increasing power prices really affect our competitors as well, and they historically proven to be rational in pricing. And so when you look at quarterly move up of the curve like we're experiencing now, it gives us ample time to pass that through to consumers. And in fact, energy prices have gone up almost 75% caused from 2017 to 2023. We've actually been able to increase margin over that period. And so we feel confident in our ability to do that. Agnieszka Storozynski : Okay. And then one other question. So you're talking about the gas-fired new build. I mean I was just doing some -- running some simple math here. Given growing supply of renewable power, right, you probably can't necessarily count on very high capacity factors for these assets, which would suggest that power prices need to be multiples of what we are seeing in the forward curve, in order to justify construction of these new gas plants. So I'm just wondering how you see it. Even in Texas, those peakers and combined cycle gas plant that you're pitching. Even with subsidized loans, it's hard to imagine that these assets would be economic at a $60 around-the-clock or north price. Robert Gaudette : Angie, it's Rob again. I would tell you that the assets are economic. The way to think about the beauty of peakers, or CCGTs, is that they can flex meaning they can move. And they can capture the value in the hours that matter. We've been trying to transfer our portfolio to something like that for a few years now. And so when you see prices move, right, so as you see the curves go up, particularly in ERCOT, it doesn't mean that every hour goes up by that same amount. It's the very tight hours that go up those exponential amounts that you're talking about. Is that cleared up? So think about the afternoon in Texas in the summer. That is going to go up 5 or 6x versus morning of that same day may have gone up once. And peakers are the things that make money in that [ work ]. Rasesh Patel : Yes. Angie, let me just add that every one of these projects, even on a sort of -- without thinking about lots of rising pricing, without thinking about [indiscernible] instruments costs or things, pencils out to be -- they all pencil out to be over our stated hurdle rate. And everything I just mentioned and the things that Rob just mentioned or upside on top of that. Agnieszka Storozynski : So but in light of that, I'm sorry, I'm asking [indiscernible] line questions. But in light of that, the fact that the new build is materializing at these prices, wouldn't that suggest that there's a cap on the upside to power prices? Because that's usually what it suggests, right, that the new build materializes and that sort of deflates the tightness of power markets. Rasesh Patel : Angie, I think if you look at the tightness versus the 1.5 gigawatts, the tightness far exceeds it. And so yes, at some point, of course, if there's enough new build that might exclude the tightness. But if you look at the number of projects that are on the books, not just ours, but everybody's, the time it's going to take to complete those, I don't worry about that tightness being loosened in any significant way for the next several years. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : So just, I guess, following on Angie's first question, I just want to try to reconcile kind of NRG in the old world of low prices for longer versus NRG now in this new world. I don't recall you talking about hedges rolling off and then suddenly being exposed to low power prices. There was the integrated model and the customers kind of side to kind of hedge the low prices. So just how do I -- why wouldn't I still not have to think about some kind of integrated model and maybe the retail margins coming down against the lower, against the higher power prices? Or just how do we reconcile the two? Lawrence Coben : Steve, I think what it has to do with really is the step change in the market. I mean before we have prices moved and really commodity-driven, those were sort of transitory, and we were managing for the steadiness. I think what you're seeing here is a step change where the flexibility of the integrated model allows us to gear ourselves, in order to take advantage of the higher prices. So the model hasn't changed. It's one of the things -- the reason we never talked about it is we never saw a step change like this. But one of the benefits of the integrated model that we've been pursuing is that it allows us to gear to price increases like this. Steven Fleishman : Got it. Okay. And then on the kind of sites opportunity and also on the new build generation. Could you give us maybe a little bit more color on how you're thinking about funding for those opportunities? And how much might come from NRG versus kind of third-party buying stakes or making the investment? Just maybe some kind of broader overlay how you're thinking about that. Bruce Chung : Yes. So Steve, it's Bruce here. First, on the new builds. Obviously, from a funding perspective, we intend to access the Texas Energy Fund. So that's going to be 60% of the capital costs related to the new builds right there. The other 40% of equity, we feel confident that we can fund that from our own cash and cash flow, without impacting any of our capital allocation commitments, in terms of share repurchases and deleveraging. So from our perspective, we feel pretty well capitalized to be able to handle all of that by ourselves. Obviously, as we've always said, to the extent that these projects are getting built and there's a unique opportunity to potentially attract third-party capital at a very attractive proposition, then we would certainly give that some consideration. But right now, as we sit here today, we feel good about our ability to fund those projects on our own. As far as the 21 sites, it's still early days. How it is that, that ultimately translates into what sort of opportunities that results in are still to be discovered. And so don't really have a perspective on any capital need in that regard as we sit here today. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And just last quick one. Obviously, the higher stock price, you mentioned still reaffirming the 15% to 20% growth. So that, I assume means you're expecting a better numerator there in terms of free cash flow to support that? And what is driving that? Is that mainly the higher power prices? Robert Gaudette : I always have my opportunity to give you a warmer answer [indiscernible] Larry Coben but -- well, the first part of your answer, yes. Look, I mean I think we see, obviously, not only continued execution against our $550 million growth and cost program. But I think as you can see here, based on the sensitivities we provided you, there is going to be -- we do see upside as a result of the forward curve. Operator : The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Just maybe can you help us just frame very high level on the 21 sites that you discussed. How many -- if there's a way to think about how many potential gigawatts that you can add over time? And then also address how quickly you can add the gigawatts. Just the reason being that the demand, like you just said Larry, this is a step change in demand. I'm just thinking about how quick the response can lead to that. Robert Gaudette : Yes. It's a great question, Durgesh, and it's one that we're working on and it's why we've set up this sort of new group to deal with data centers. I don't know the answer yet. I don't -- we're trying to figure that out. We see ginormous potential, but obviously, there's a ton of work to do in terms of -- to figure out exactly how quickly, what's best on this site? Is it better for a data center or a power plant? Is it better for colocation behind the meter, in front of the meter? So we're spending a lot of time working through those. And I think when we have more color on them, we'll certainly provide that to you all, but I'm not sure that will be in the next 2 or 3 months. It will probably be closer to the end of the year. As you know, the power plant development is an awful lot of work. Durgesh Chopra : That makes sense. I appreciate that, Larry. And then maybe just -- I know this is going to be another tough question, but just can you share your calculus or how you're thinking about buybacks here, given how the stock has kind of gone up in valuation versus investing in these in these opportunities, which obviously, have a tremendous run rate. How do you think about that? Robert Gaudette : Let me begin by repeating what Bruce said, which is we are reaffirming our capital allocation that we promised everybody. Obviously, when your stock is trading at a 25% free cash flow yield, it's an easy decision, but we still believe we have enough capital to both do our investing and return capital to our shareholders. And I don't see that changing in the short or medium term. So I think we're going to just continue to be disciplined in terms of returning capital and given -- especially given the rises that we've been talking about here will likely should actually have more capital to invest ourselves. And it won't surprise you to hear that there's an awful lot of people who also now want to co-invest with us in a lot of these kind of projects. So I think the possibilities for doing accretive generation and related projects are there, regardless -- irrespective of our capital allocation principles. Operator : Next question comes from David Zimmerman at Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : Dave Arcaro here. Following up on one of the earlier questions. I was wondering, just on the ERCOT market and pricing in the market and the forward curves. Do you have a view from here on where ERCOT prices could go? Is there still room for upside? Do you think in terms of where the forward curve is currently pricing? Robert Gaudette : David, it's Rob. Yes. The markets can definitely go up. If you look at the large loans that are coming to the state into the system, ERCOT is already beginning to monitor and take a look at it. It's a lot. And you're seeing that price in. There is more upside in the curves from here. David Arcaro : Okay. Got it. And does that -- as you're kind of hedging into that, then, is that a view that you're embedding as you start to layer in hedges and firm up some of your out-year EBITDA forecast? Robert Gaudette : So when we think about our out-year EBITDA, remember that a big part of our hedging program is through the retail book, right? So as we sell to our 8 million consumers, that ultimately takes a lot of that value and translates it over through the retail revenue rates. We're always looking way out the curve, David. If I thought that something was really high and out of whack, then I would say that we could take something off the table. But we like the position, we like the trend and we like where our portfolio is. David Arcaro : Got it. And could you touch on what the competitive dynamics are that you're seeing in the retail energy business right now, in terms of any pressure from new entrants or pricing pressure in the market that might push margin one way or the other right now? Robert Gaudette : It's been a very stable performance. As you saw, we had strong performance in terms of customer growth year-over-year. We saw similarly good performance and load growth and our margins. And so we feel very good. I think there are a couple of new entrants in the market, but as we look at our outflow reports, we don't really see any meaningful traction there. Operator : The final question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan Levine : A follow-up on some of the capital -- just a follow up on some of the capital allocation framework. Is there a price where you would reconsider buybacks? Or are you not trying to take any view on the value of the energy security? Lawrence Coben : Brian, there is no price that we would necessarily sit here and tell you is the absolute line at which we would stop buybacks. We're always going to be looking what is implied in the share price with respect to our free cash flow yield, and we'll make the termination from that standpoint. But as we sit here today, we see plenty of room to run for us to continue to be buying back shares. Ryan Levine : Okay. And then as you're looking at on investment opportunities related to power generation growth in your service territory. Are you are you focusing -- you mentioned a number of opportunities for new build and partnerships. Do you have a preference for partnerships? Or would you prefer to own the assets out right? Lawrence Coben : I think for us, it's just a maximization and optimization process. And so I don't think we have a preference, one way or another. It's related to cost of capital, operational flexibility. And at the end of the day, what falls best to our bottom line. Ryan Levine : Okay. And given the economic outlook that you suggested was attractive for these new builds, are there any customer commitments or duration of demand that you're looking for the data centers to commit to, to underwrite some of these new builds? Robert Gaudette : It's Rob. The answer to that is no. The new builds that we talked about are not set up for data centers or forward to meet that load. The conversations we are in early days with around colocation or use of our sites. Those will be a case-by-case basis as to whether or not it's a long-term deal or not, right, with a data center or other large load. But that's going to come as we evaluate each opportunity. But the things we've talked about thus far are for our book and our portfolio. Ryan Levine : And just one last question in terms of retail margin on electricity. The movement in ERCOT forward prices, do you think that will have any impact on the margin that you'll ultimately be able to realize on that part of your business? Lawrence Coben : Well, we've proven the ability to maintain strong retail margins through various curves. And so we have a very sophisticated analytic engine that gives us insights into the price sensitivity of customers. And when you have sort of these orderly shifts in power prices, we're able to pass them on to consumers over time. So we feel good about our muscle there. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Larry Coben, Chairman and Interim President and CEO, for closing remarks. Lawrence Coben : Thank you all very much for joining us. I think you can hear the palpable excitement that we all feel here at n NRG for the potential, and we look forward to continuing to deliver great results and executing on that upside in the days, months and years ahead. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",

After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Cole : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call will be 45 minutes in length. It will be broadcast live over the phone via webcast, which can be located in the Investor section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcasts. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Larry Coben, NRG\u2019s Chairman and CEO. Larry Coben : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I\u2019m joined this morning by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the management team on the call and they are all available to answer questions. First, I just want to express how excited I am to be leading NRG as Chairman, President and CEO. I\u2019m grateful for the outpouring of support I\u2019ve received from the investment community, employees and other stakeholders over the last nine months, and again, in the last week following the Board\u2019s announcement of August 1st. We are laser-focused on delivering exceptional shareholder value by meeting the growing and evolving needs of our customers, while returning billions of dollars in capital. We believe we have the right strategy and the best team to fix the depressed valuation of our company once and for all. Let\u2019s begin with NRG\u2019s strategic positioning. For those new to NRG, we have the largest energy and smart home platform in North America. We\u2019re the trusted partner to over 8 million residential customers, offering tailored energy and smart home solutions. We are also the second largest energy and energy services provider, as well as the largest natural gas provider to commercial and industrial companies. If there\u2019s been one takeaway from today\u2019s discussion that you should have, it\u2019s that our business and financial outlook has never been stronger. We are witnessing a structural long-term tightening in power supply and demand, driving a step-change improvement in fundamentals. Customers across our platform are using more of our products and increasingly requesting premium customized experiences, as well as innovative offerings focused on convenience, sustainability and cost. Our integrated platform enables us to stabilize and increase our near-term earnings, while capturing medium- to long-term growth opportunities. We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in the financial flexibility to grow earnings, while at the same time returning substantial capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The strength of our business and financial outlook has positioned us to capitalize on what we believe to be the beginning stages of an exceptional time for our industry and an exciting time for our company. I have never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us than I am today. Let\u2019s dive into the key messages on Slide 5. Our business performance exceeded expectations in the second quarter and year-to-date. We are reaffirming our financial guidance ranges and trending toward the upper end of that guidance range. Next, electrification trends compounded by GenAI data center and other large load growth continue to materialize. We expect competitive markets, such as ours, to realize outsized benefits from this trend, driven by business-friendly policies, available resources and the ability to cite projects quickly. Additionally, we have made progress on the strategic priorities discussed in our last earnings call. This includes submitting our brownfield development projects to the Texas Energy Fund and continuing to advance with our portfolio of sites. Finally, we continue to fulfill our capital allocation commitments with our share repurchase program underway and line of sight to achieving our balance sheet targets. Turning to Slide 6, we delivered $935 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, a 14% year-on-year increase. This brings year-to-date adjusted EBITDA to $1.784 billion, up 22% from last year. Following this strong first half, we are reaffirming our financial guidance ranges, and again, trending toward the upper part of that range. All of our businesses are excelling and demonstrating strong performance across the Board. Our consumer segments demonstrated strong year-on-year growth. Home energy subscribers increased by 8% at stable margins. Smart home had a 5% increase in subscribers and 7% growth in revenue and delivered industry-leading retention rates and expanded margins. We continue to make substantial progress toward our Virtual Power Plant offering and look forward to sharing more about that by the time of our third quarter earnings call. On the supply side, we continue to experience significant improvements in the availability and reliability of our generation assets, thanks to the investments we have made in them in recent years. We are well-prepared for the summer and winter seasons across our fleet after successfully completing our spring maintenance outages. This level of preparedness helps ensure we can meet demand and consistently deliver exceptional service to our customers. A shout-out to our incredible team of plant operators as our assets delivered 97% reliability during Hurricane Beryl in July with no storm-induced or caused outages or lost generation. I\u2019m also happy to report that our cost and growth synergies are on track. Today, we\u2019re reaffirming our plan of $550 million in synergies by the end of 2025 and we remain on track to achieve our 15 to 20% free cash flow before growth per share growth target, even as our rising stock price means repurchasing shares at higher prices, much higher prices, than projected a year ago. On share repurchases, we\u2019ve completed $176 million of the current buyback program with $649 million to be completed over the balance of the year. Lastly, we are announcing the sale of Airtron HVAC, which will result in $400 million in net cash grosses. Turning to Slide 7, I\u2019d like to provide you a little additional context on the strong demand outlook we are seeing in Texas. In the first half of the year, Texas experienced over 3% weather-normalized load growth, setting new record peaks in January, April and May. Looking ahead, ERCOT continues to anticipate substantial load growth in the coming years. ERCOT\u2019s latest projection indicates that more than 60 gigawatts of growth through 2030 will take place, driven by on-shoring, data centers and other large load customers. Notably, many of these new loads are backed by contracts with the transmission and distribution utilities in ERCOT or have been confirmed by an officer of a TDU, adding credibility to the projected growth. Within our own portfolio, we continue to advance our 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield natural gas development in Texas. We filed applications for all three projects with the Texas Energy Fund in June. We anticipate the PUCT will announce later this month which projects are advancing to the due diligence phase, which is expected to last four months to eight months, depending on the quality of the projects and their applications. Following that, loan agreements will be executed. We believe our projects are well-situated for a timely approval, given their shovel-ready nature and the completeness of the applications that we submitted. Finally, we\u2019ve received numerous questions about our site portfolio since our first quarter call. Our singularly devoted development team is diligently working to maximize the value of these sites. As a reminder, our portfolio includes 21 sites encompassing 21,000 acres of land in competitive markets. These sites are ideally suited for new large loads and power plant development, offering co-location opportunities both behind and in front of the meter. To identify the sites best suited for data centers, key factors include access to water for cooling, premium fiber channel access for low latency, and existing grid access and infrastructure for rapid market entry. As you can see, our sites possess these attributes, but also have potential for other large load applications. In this appendix, we provide several paths to value under consideration. I look forward to discussing this more with you as we progress. With that, let me turn it over to Bruce Chung for the financial review. Bruce? Bruce Chung : Thank you, Larry. Turning to Slide 9, NRG delivered another strong quarter of financial and operational performance with adjusted EBITDA of $935 million, an increase of $116 million over the prior year. Free cash flow before growth was $663 million, exceeding prior year results by $238 million. Each segment of our business performed well, with much of the performance underscored by positive momentum and growing subscriber counts, increased volumes and margin expansion. Starting with our results in our East/West/Services/Other segments, we saw strong performance producing $282 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $184 million increase over the prior year. $132 million of the year-over-year increase came from the East segment, where an increase in subscriber counts and lower realized retail supply costs were the primary drivers of performance. The remainder of the year-over-year growth was driven by a decrease in realized power supply costs in the West. Adjusted EBITDA in Texas for the second quarter was $452 million, a slight decline compared to prior year. Texas performance was driven by favorable hedging activity, along with increased volumes and subscriber counts in the region. This favorability was offset by an estimated $40 million due to the impact of last year\u2019s STP and Gregory asset sales, as well as $50 million in higher maintenance costs from the extended plant outage program we deployed in the quarter to ensure our plants are well positioned for this summer\u2019s operations and beyond. This marks our third year of enhanced preventative investment to improve reliability and flexibility across our fleet. Our plants have performed well through the year, and we expect them to continue to do so as the summer rolls on. Our smart home business has continued to execute well, growing subscriber count by 5% and service margins by 4% year-over-year, and generating $201 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. While that represents a slight decrease from the prior year, it is important to point out the decrease was primarily driven by an expected increase in the amortization of fulfillment expenses, which began impacting EBITDA after we closed on the acquisition of the business. Absent this non-cash impact and other non-recurring adjustments, adjusted EBITDA for this segment would have shown an increase of 6% year-over-year. Key performance indicators for the smart home segment continue to remain strong, as the average smart home subscriber interacts with their systems more than 16 times per day, and we see this high level of engagement carried through to our best-in-class retention, which is nearly 90%. Our free cash flow before growth came in at $663 million, $238 million higher than the prior year, and driven by our significant growth in adjusted EBITDA and favorable working capital. We are reaffirming our 2024 guidance of $3.3 billion to $3.55 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.825 billion to $2.075 billion for free cash flow before growth. Our strong year-to-date performance, coupled with the investments we have made in our plans, give us confidence that we are trending towards the upper end of guidance. We continue to see growth and momentum in our business platforms and the continued execution of our diversified supply strategy positions us well through the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 10 for a current view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see, there have been few changes since our first quarter call. We are on track to deliver on nearly $600 million of liability management initiatives and $1.2 billion in return of capital through share repurchases and the common dividend. As I mentioned last time, the strength of our share price performance has made our convertible notes one of the most expensive pieces of paper in our capital structure. And we subsequently seized the opportunity to mitigate that through strategic repurchases as part of our liability management program. We repurchased $343 million or approximately 60% of the original issuance. For the remainder of these notes, we have fully hedged the premium we will pay when the notes are retired. Turning briefly to share repurchases, we have completed $176 million of the $825 million share repurchase target for 2024 via open market repurchases, bringing us to over 40% of our total $2.7 billion authorization. We see tremendous value in buying our shares and will continue to take advantage of our currently depressed stock price through share repurchases. The only substantial change to our capital available for allocation relates to the sale of our Airtron HVAC business for $500 million, which will yield approximately $400 million of net proceeds. We expect the transaction to close before the end of the year. Finally, we now show $441 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024 after taking into account the incremental $400 million of net proceeds from the Airtron transaction. We will evaluate the use of this unallocated capital as we move into the latter part of the year and after closing of the Airtron sale. With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry. Larry Coben : Thank you, Bruce. On Slide 12, I\u2019d like to share a few closing thoughts on our 2024 priorities and expectations. During the quarter, we\u2019ve made significant progress on our strategic initiatives and I\u2019m confident we have the right platform and strategy to deliver on our commitments to both our customers and our shareholders. As CEO, I\u2019m deeply committed to driving NRG forward to create significant additional shareholder value. We are seeing a long-term step change improvement in fundamentals across our platform. You can expect a continued heightened focus on operational excellence, prudent growth and being good stewards of you, our investors\u2019 capital. I have never been more excited about the potential of our company than I am today. Thank you for your time and continued interest in NRG. Operator, we\u2019re now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Good morning. Larry Coben : Good morning, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza : Good morning. Good morning. Larry, since we last spoke, we\u2019ve seen something like 40 gigs to 60 gigs get in line for the Energy Fund. Do you think the state could do a second fund if this one helps meet the demand? Do you think this means the curves could revert to backwardation and could you get involved with more generation, assuming an expanded program next year, so do you have more bandwidth? Thanks. Larry Coben : Is that one question, Shahriar, or three? But they\u2019re all great questions. And look, this state has talked about, I think you probably saw the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor talk about adding a second tranche to the TEP, and I think they\u2019ll then see what happens and what the availability is. I think the bigger question, Shahriar, is, first of all, how much of these are real? And we don\u2019t know yet. We know that ours are shovel-ready. But if you look at people who\u2019ve applied for transmission studies and the like, it\u2019s an awful lot less than 40 gigs. I think it\u2019s about 12 gigs, to be exact. And so, there\u2019s a long way to go before a lot of those projects become real and ready to go. Some of them, I\u2019m sure, will, but many will not. So I don\u2019t see the curve -- while in the short-term we\u2019ve seen some fluctuation in curves, I don\u2019t see what we\u2019ve seen from the TEF filings to have a major impact on what the long-term market is going to look like. I\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s a second half to your question, Shahriar, I think. Shahriar Pourreza : Just assuming, like, you see an expanded program, do you guys have, like, kind of bandwidth to do additional generation? Larry Coben : Absolutely we do if, our customers and clients continue to need it and it\u2019s optimal for our portfolio strategy. Though, remember, as we\u2019ve talked about before, the lead times for development, primarily because of turbines and other equipment is several years. So if you don\u2019t have a place in the turbine queue today, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re getting a new project online before 2030 at the earliest. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. And just lastly, Larry, just on transitioning to EPS, I mean, I know I asked you this on the last call, but has your thoughts evolved around just maybe changing disclosures and guidance a little bit? Larry Coben : My thoughts have evolved. I\u2019ll let Bruce expand on how my thoughts have evolved. Bruce Chung : Shahriar, I guess, in short, Larry\u2019s thoughts have evolved such that there hasn\u2019t been no change in terms of what we\u2019re thinking about. I think what we had indicated last time is that we are working towards making that transition. We see our third quarter earnings as being the optimal time to be able to do that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re currently working towards. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. That\u2019s a perfect call. Thanks. Larry, big congrats. I know a couple of quarters ago I highlighted that we didn\u2019t want you to leave and just stay as the CEO. So we\u2019re glad the Board listened. Thanks, guys. Larry Coben : Well, Shahriar, when the thing has taken off like a rocket ship, you want to wait until you get to the stars before you get off. Shahriar Pourreza : That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. Congrats, guys. Larry Coben : Thanks, Shahriar. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. So maybe, I mean, we\u2019re all trying to be as excited as you are, Larry, about the prospect of power markets. I mean, clearly the curves disagree, and I\u2019m just wondering if you can explain to us why do you think we\u2019ve had this sharp pullback in Texas power curves given the load outlook you see and we see? Larry Coben : Good morning, Angie. I\u2019m going to let Rob kind of take you through that, because it\u2019s something we talk about a lot. But Rob, maybe? Rob Gaudette : Yeah. So, Angie, obviously, we\u2019ve seen the same moves and curves that you have. As well as I do that to start with the long-term curve gets impacted by the noise of whatever is going on in the front end of the market. We\u2019ve had a warm but not very pricey summer and that\u2019s kind of impacted things out the curve. What I would tell you is as we look at these curves, regardless of whether or not you see a bunch of demand come into ERCOT or not, the back end of the curve actually looks like a place where we would be buyers, right? So 2027 and 2028 summers look cheap. The market itself is constructive or would be constructive and we think these are the right levels for us to step in because we think they\u2019re undervaluing what the curve looks like and that\u2019s before you add demand. So I\u2019m pretty bullish on what you -- what the market looks like. We feel very strongly about where our portfolio is and we think that our retail business will continue to churn out the earnings that it\u2019s done over time. So I\u2019m not very concerned about that curve. Angie Storozynski : Speaking about retail business, if you could talk to us about what\u2019s happening in New England, any potential reviews to the retail electric market and how that could impact your business? Rasesh Patel : Good morning, Angie. This is Rasesh. To put the context of what\u2019s happening in the Northeast, our retail business overall performed a really -- it was a very strong quarter, right? 8% subscriber growth, double-digit growth in volume and strong margin performance. In the Northeast, there are a couple of things going on that we watch very carefully. The regulatory environment and some of the changes in the specific states. As an example, Massachusetts ended up not making any changes. In Maryland, where we have seen some changes as a result of SB1, that\u2019s a very, very small part of our overall earnings stream, and so the impact of that will be negligible to our results. but we watch the environment very closely. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then back to the generation assets. So, I mean, this whole discussion about newbuilds and the need to actually supply additional generation capacity, I\u2019m just wondering, those are assets with 40-year lives and you guys are making decisions based on two to three-year visibility into the profitability of these assets. So, one is how you approach the newbuild, given that previous cycles were very painful for IPPs. And two, I mean, is there a way to basically maybe pursue newbuilds through a long-term contract as opposed to a truly merchant newbuild? I mean, if the demand is truly there, one could argue that the demand should be comfortable with signing PPAs to support newbuilds as opposed to just truly merchant assets, both actually in ERCOT and PJM. Larry Coben : Angie, I\u2019m going to let Rob expand on that, but remember that we have the ability to contract and use all of the power. This isn\u2019t a merchant build for us. We have the ability to cross it to ourselves or utilize it ourselves and so we\u2019re not doing speculative merchant builds. That\u2019s not the business that we\u2019re in. This is part of the supply stack that Rob and team are really crucially putting together to meet all of our customers\u2019 needs going forward. But I don\u2019t know, Rob, do you want to? Rob Gaudette : Larry covered it. This is for our portfolio. These assets were designed, built and planned to support the retail portfolio, regardless of what we see kind of long-term. We have a long-term consumer-facing business and we support that. Angie Storozynski : And nothing about potential long-term contracts. I\u2019m clearly fishing for some comments about those brownfield sites, if the monetization of those could come through a newbuild backed by PPAs? Rob Gaudette : So, Angie, as we consider the sites and the strategy that we do with the sites, right? So, as we disclosed before, two-thirds of those, at least, are up in PJM, where we don\u2019t play with generation quite as much as we do down in Texas. All of the answers that Larry and I just gave were in reference to the three newbuild projects that are on the way. When I think about the sites themselves, if we have an opportunity to build generation on one of those sites, and it\u2019s for a customer, then we obviously will be thinking about PPAs and different structures to support the capital for those. Angie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Rob Gaudette : Sure. Larry Coben : Thanks, Angie. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Antoine Aurimond from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Antoine Aurimond : Hey, guys. Hope you\u2019re doing well. Congrats on the results. Larry Coben : Thank you. Good morning. Antoine Aurimond : And Larry, congrats on the permanent appointment. I guess on that note, just more broadly, taking a step back, how do you think about the strategic trajectory of the company under your new leadership? So, again, over the past year, NRG to de-emphasize physical generation, asset light strategy. Do you think that\u2019s still the best positioning in the current market conditions and any other strategic shifts we should be considering? Larry Coben : I mean, Antoine, I think our strategy isn\u2019t changing, but I don\u2019t -- I\u2019ve never really liked the description asset light. I\u2019ve always considered it to be supply optimal. I mean, a good mix of our own generation and other instruments or tolls in order to be able to do that and that\u2019s continuing. One of the reasons we would like to have more iron than we did a year or two ago is because our customers and clients are demanding more electricity. And so, as we construct the appropriate supply portfolio or supply stack, and we optimize that, having more hard metal in the ground is a good thing for us and so we\u2019re doing that. But we\u2019re also going to have more of the other types of instruments that we use as well, because as you can see from this presentation and I know you follow the industry, so you don\u2019t need me to tell you, the growth in power demand is continuing and we need to be in a position to meet our clients\u2019 needs to do that. Antoine Aurimond : Yeah. That makes sense. And then I guess on the data center opportunity, can you maybe comment on status of any discussions you may have with data center providers, type of contracts that you may be contemplating, how advanced you are in the negotiation process and how should we think about sort of timeline, potential announcements? Larry Coben : Look, Antoine, one of the things we did was we were getting so many inbounds that we just kind of pulled back for a strategic review of it all. And you can see the kinds of things we\u2019re contemplating on that slide in the appendix, say, is it 18 or? Bruce Chung : 21. Larry Coben : 21, sorry. And I think as we\u2026 Antoine Aurimond : All right. Larry Coben : \u2026land on a strategy, we\u2019re obviously going to share that with you and I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll be sometime probably before the end of the year. But we were getting lots of people sort of throwing us bids for our sites, and we\u2019re like, well, we know they think we\u2019re just a bunch of power guys who don\u2019t know anything about data centers. So, if that\u2019s what they\u2019re bidding us, we really need to look at this, because it means there\u2019s a lot more value in there than the bids that we\u2019re receiving. So, can\u2019t really comment too much more on it now, but look forward to sharing more with you as we have it. Antoine Aurimond : Fair enough. And then lastly, under $400 million of net proceeds from HVAC divestiture is somewhat unexpected. Where do you expect to allocate that extra cash? Bruce Chung : I\u2019m sorry. Can you just repeat that last part, Antoine? Larry Coben : [Inaudible] Bruce Chung : Oh! Yeah. So, look, yeah, we\u2019ll -- from an allocation standpoint, we\u2019ll certainly provide more visibility around the allocation once we close and we get the proceeds in place, but you should expect that we\u2019ll remain consistent with our capital allocation principles. Antoine Aurimond : Okay. Great. Thank you so much, guys. Talk to you soon. Larry Coben : Thank you. Bruce Chung : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Hey. Good morning, and congrats, Larry. Larry Coben : Thank you, Steve. Appreciate it. Good morning. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. So, just a couple kind of near-term questions first. The -- how should we think about if we do end up having a kind of a milder, lower priced summer in Texas? You\u2019ve done a lot to kind of make sure you were ready for a high-priced hot summer, just protection from the opposite and I assume that\u2019s kind of embedded in saying to the upper end, but just how should we think about that? Rob Gaudette : Hey, Steve. It\u2019s Rob. We don\u2019t talk about it often, but we also do manage to the downside. The great thing about our portfolio is that we have those assets that we can turn down in markets that aren\u2019t constructive, like you\u2019ve seen for the last two quarters. As far as the way we look forward into the year, we contemplate both up and down scenarios in where we feel we\u2019re going to land on guidance. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then also, just kind of more, we had this PJM auction outcome. Just how should we think about that capacity price flow through the retail business? If -- I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve already contracted or it\u2019s just not enough of a scale to matter much. Rob Gaudette : Yeah. So when you -- so the BRA print for this last auction is indicative of kind of the supply demand structure that we kind of see across the country. So it\u2019s going to provide additional dollars towards generation. We don\u2019t have a very large portfolio in PJM, so it is what it is. On the C&I and retail sides, think about our consumer business is very short-term, so don\u2019t expect a lot of impact there. And then on the C&I side, we contract with these guys and depending on what changes in the markets, we can use change in law depending on what happens if we chose. But as we look at the impacts to the book on the retail side, it\u2019s de minimis state. It\u2019s nothing that I would even talk about. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. And then just, sorry to go back to Texas newbuild, but so obviously the ETF has the low cost loans and performance bonuses and the like. But then, you do have to kind of have a market price for return on equity. So just, I mean, is your messaging that basically, hey, this works for us at any forward curve and just how should we think about kind of protecting equity? Larry Coben : I wouldn\u2019t say any forward curve. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Larry Coben : I know you don\u2019t mean any forward curves. Steve Fleishman : I don\u2019t, but I\u2019m just -- it is\u2026 Larry Coben : Look, look\u2026 Steve Fleishman : I\u2019m just trying to understand the thought process on. Yeah. Larry Coben : If we actually believe that a depressed curve was reality, that would, Chris heard from here was reality that would obviously impact our decision. But as Rob discussed earlier, what we\u2019re really seeing in terms of increased demand is somewhat belies the short-term blip in the curve. But we look at that all the time. And there are -- there is a place where we wouldn\u2019t do the project. I don\u2019t think, we\u2019re not there today. Go ahead, Rob. Rob Gaudette : Yeah. No. Obviously, the one thing I would add to the math or as you think about like the value of these assets, flexible gas generation is a function of both power price, but it\u2019s also a function of volatility, right? And so the volatility curves, which are not very transparent, you can\u2019t see them by looking into megawatt daily, those are still up. And so the value of these projects as something that can move around with our load continues to support us developing them and putting them into the portfolio. Steve Fleishman : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Then one last quick one just on the Q3 disclosures. You\u2019ve talked about the earnings and DPPs, just the site, the 21 sites. Do you think we\u2019ll get some update on kind of the Q3 call or is that more kind of late year or next year? Like what timeline on that? Bruce Chung : We\u2019re pushing to do that, but it\u2019s a slow and iterative process a bit, Steve. So I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have some updates. It may not be as complete a one as you all would like. That may have to wait until the first quarter of next year or some conference in between. But we are working expeditiously, but it\u2019s more important that we get it right than do it fast. Steve Fleishman : Understood. Thank you very much. Larry Coben : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Neil Kalton from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Neil Kalton : Hi, guys. Just a quick question on, yeah, economic outlook. How do you think about, so we\u2019ve seen a softening in the consumer side? Like how do you think about the impacts to your business? Thinking both the home security business, retail energy as well, are you seeing any evidence that the consumer is stepping back, weakness, et cetera? Rasesh Patel : Hey, Neil. This is Rasesh. Good morning. We delivered a really strong quarter with 5% year-over-year subscriber growth, 7% revenue growth for the smart home business. And that\u2019s sort of, think of that as that\u2019s in an environment where we have high interest rates and a slowdown in housing activity. As that normalizes, we would expect that to potentially deliver a tailwind to the business. And I think it\u2019s largely a function of the fact that we\u2019ve got a business that has a very high quality customer base with an average FICO score of greater than 700 and so you saw we posted near all-time record results for retention, customer retention, which is almost at 90% on an annualized basis and we\u2019re still largely in an underpenetrated market. And so we see opportunities to not only continue to grow the customer base at the mid-single-digit rate, but also grow the number of devices and services we provide to the customer within the home. And so we feel really good about our position and with a potential for a tailwind if rates normalize and housing activity picks up. Neil Kalton : Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our last question. Our last question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISS -- ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Thank you. Larry, congrats. I\u2019ve got two questions. Larry Coben : Thanks, Durgesh. Appreciate it. Durgesh Chopra : Sure. Thanks. Two questions. First, just for housekeeping, August 29th, will we get a list of projects? Will that be formally announced or how will we know which ones kind of made it to the second round of due diligence by the PUCT? Chris Moser : Hey. This is Chris. Yeah. What we\u2019ve been led to believe is that the PUCT will have either an order or a draft order which would list the assets, the projects that are moving forward towards due diligence and that has been targeted for the August 29th meeting. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just, Larry, back to you. As you take the permanent role, obviously, there was this transaction announced here. Are there other non-core assets that we could potentially see being liquidated for cash proceeds back into the core portion of the company? How are you thinking through that? Larry Coben : Look, I mean, we always look to optimize everything we own. There\u2019s nothing on the horizon that I see that would be divestible. But sometimes people walk in the door with very attractive offers for things that we own and we would be silly not to take a look at those, especially given we have a broad and amazing range of opportunities, number one, in which to invest capital. And number two, we have a very undervalued stock in which to invest capital as well. So when we look at those two things, if we can make a transaction that makes sense, we\u2019ll obviously do that. I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon today. But if the opportunity arises, we will certainly look at it hard and try to take advantage of it. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have one last question. The last question comes from Dave Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dave Arcaro : Oh! Hey. Thanks so much. The last question here. Hey, I was just curious on the PJM market, just reflecting on the capacity print that we just saw. Is there an opportunity for you to look at newbuild there? Like, does newbuild economics work at this point and do you have any opportunities to look at that market in terms of power plant expansion? Rob Gaudette : Hey. It\u2019s Rob. So, the print is constructive as it comes to actually highlighting the supply-demand picture in the market. So I think that\u2019s a positive. We have newbuild sites, which regardless, or we have sites, regardless if you newbuild them or not, that print is definitely supportive in the overall value as we think about them from a development perspective, whether that\u2019s for load or for generation. The one thing I would tell you, David, is that one print isn\u2019t going to get a bunch of generation running into the market. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a whole bunch of people applying to build generation based on one PJM print. But we do have another mark in December, which I expect would be supportive and so the supply dynamics in PJM aren\u2019t going to improve anytime soon. But I believe that ultimately competitive energy players are rational and will build when it makes sense. Dave Arcaro : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just maybe expanding on that a little bit, do you have a sense as to when new gas plants could realistically get built in the PJM market given the supply chain challenges that you mentioned and your outlook for energy prices\u2026 Rob Gaudette : Yeah. So\u2026 Dave Arcaro : \u2026 too in the context of that. Rob Gaudette : So there\u2019s two challenges in PJM. One is PJM specific and that\u2019s the interconnection queue, right? It\u2019s very deep and very slow and so it\u2019s probably frustrating a lot of people. The second piece is the one that is a global issue, which Larry alluded to earlier, which is if you want to build a power plant today and you\u2019re not in the queue, you\u2019re not going to get anything on the ground before 2030. So demand is coming faster than that supply window. So I expect tight markets, both from a capacity and an energy perspective, over the next several years. Dave Arcaro : Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thanks for the color and congratulations, Larry. Larry Coben : Thank you, David. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I will turn it back over to Larry Coben for those remarks. Larry Coben : Thank you all for being on the call and for your interest in NRG. And on a more personal note, for all the kind words and congratulations on my appointment. I\u2019m here and we\u2019re all here because we are super excited about the future of NRG. I think you all know that I\u2019ve been here for 20 years and I\u2019ve never been more excited or more optimistic about the prospects. So I hope you\u2019ll stick with us and join us as we continue to execute well and take advantage of the amazing strategic opportunities and initiatives in front of us. Thank you all very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded. I will now hand the conference over to your speaker host, Kevin Cole, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Cole : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's third quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length. It will be broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investor section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcasts. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Larry Coben, NRG's Chair and CEO. Larry Coben : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, our CFO; and Rasesh Patel, Head of NRG Consumer, who will share an exciting update on our virtual Power Plant initiative. Other members of our management team are also on the call, and available to answer questions. Let's start with today's three messages as shown on slide four. First, our strong performance this year led us to raise our 2024 financial guidance by $175 million in late September, the second consecutive year we have surpassed our original earnings target. Today, we're reaffirming this elevated outlook for 2024 in initiating strong guidance for 2025. Second, we're excited to announce a strategic partnership with Renew Home and Google Cloud, supported by Google's AI platform to accelerate our Virtual Power Plant efforts. This partnership strengthens our ability to meet evolving customer needs, and marks the beginnings of our effort to scale VPP. Finally, we're enhancing our guidance framework by introducing adjusted EPS. We're also presenting a multiyear outlook supported by a new organic growth program, and highlighting additional opportunities to exceed those targets and drive further shareholder value. On slide five, let's review our 2024 performance and 2025 guidance. Our year-to-date results and increased guidance are driven by strong plant operations, effective supply risk management throughout the summer, margin growth across all of our business segments, and continued success in smart home. These results underscore the strength of our business model, and position us exceptionally well for the future. I'd also like to note that in response to investor feedback, we are now including all amortization costs related to Vivint Smart Home and retail home energy in the depreciation and amortization line of the income statement. Bruce will provide more details and clear disclosures on this change, which is non-cash and has no impact on our cash flow metrics or adjusted EPS. This updated enhances transparency and simplifies financial reporting and modeling for our shareholders. We're initiating 2025 guidance, now including adjusted EPS alongside our usual metric of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. For 2025, we expect adjusted EPS of $7.25, adjusted EBITDA of $3.85 billion, and free cash flow before growth of $2.1 billion. This reflects a 14% increase in adjusted EPS from our raised 2024 guidance, and a 28% increase from our initial 2024 guidance. Our 2025 guidance incorporates the achievement of our key 2023 Investor Day commitments; reaching $550 million in run rate synergies, achieving investment-grade credit metrics, and delivering 15% free cash flow before growth per share growth. This achievement is significant as our June 2023 projection of 15% to 20% free cash flow before growth per share growth was based on a 2025 share price of $46.00 or less than half today's trading price. Through operational improvement and excellence, accelerated growth and synergy achievement, we have stayed on and achieved this target. Today, we are also announcing that we are increasing our share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion. In short, 2024 has been an outstanding year, and 2025 will be even better. Market conditions are highly favorable. Our operations remain superb, and our outlook has never been stronger. It's an exciting time to be part of NRG. On slide six, with the introduction of adjusted EPS, we're presenting our multiyear growth outlook, targeting at least a 10% CAGR through 2029 based on our raised 2024 guidance. Staring from our original 2024 guidance, this raise would approach 13%, reflecting the extraordinary operations and opportunities in our business. To provide a clear view of our EPS drivers, we've divided this outlook into two categories; organic business earnings growth, and capital allocation. This business earnings portion only incorporates the organic growth plans of our core businesses, with no value added for such opportunities as the tightening of the Texas power market or datacenters. I will return to these additional opportunities shortly. Our long-term outlook includes an annualized $750 million in adjusted EBITDA organic growth through 2029, largely driven by our consumer businesses. Key drivers include customer growth in smart home, initiatives to increase home energy wallet share and advancements in our virtual power plant. We're also strategically expanding our commercial and industrial energy services footprint. In terms of capital allocation, we plan to return $8.8 billion to shareholders with $7.1 billion dedicated to share repurchases. Looking at potential opportunities to significantly exceed this outlook, we have not factored in any rise in Texas power prices, which we've held at $47 through 2029, despite expected market tightening from growing demand. We have provided growth sensitivities for your additional visibility into our gearing, and to allow our investors to reflect on, and sensitize their expectations. Our projections also include contributions from our 21 site development portfolio and two shovel-ready Texas brownfield projects that were not selected for the Texas Energy Fund. Each of these represents additional upside to our baseline growth expectations. I'll explore these elements in greater depth over the next two slides. Our long-term outlook emphasizes the strength of our platform and shows that we're well-positioned to capture emerging opportunities in our sector. Moving to slide seven, let's break down our $750 million growth plan, driven by disciplined investments and high-value initiatives. Our growth is expected in each of our primary businesses, around 30% from home energy, 50% from smart home, and 20% from commercial and industrial energy. In home energy, we're focused on leveraging our strong Texas market share to expand wallet with our customers. We have been testing a home essentials bundle that provides energy customers added value while increasing margin and retention and the results have been very encouraging. This initiative also enhances our ability to scale our virtual power plant offering. We will provide details of these initiatives later on in the presentation. For smart home, growth is driven primarily by continued customer base expansion, which we have a strong record of achieving historically. We will also attract a broader segment of customers through new and less expensive bundles. In Commercial and Industrial Energy and NRG business, we're enhancing our platform by incorporating AI into both sales and customer care, which will increase speed, improve service quality and reduce costs. We're also expanding in our existing markets by offering advanced products such as load management and reduced carbon options. Additionally, we're broadening our highly successful strategic client services for both electric and natural gas customers resulting in incrementally higher unit margins. To meet our $750 million annualized EBITDA target, we plan to invest up to $1.6 billion over the next five years. That's the total investment, implying return on investments approaching 50%. We expect these initiatives to convert to free cash flow before growth at a rate of approximately 90%. These initiatives align with our 80 :20 capital allocation framework; reinforcing our commitment to you of disciplined high return growth. I'm very confident that we will meet and likely exceed these base targets. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Now, let's look at some of our other opportunities on slide eight. On the left, we show our 2025 Texas generation open gross margin sensitivity to various around the clock power price scenarios. This analysis assumes stable natural gas prices and normal weather conditions. For further details on multiple hedging scenarios, please refer to the appendix. This highlights the substantial value potential of our Texas generation under different price scenarios. As markets tighten due to rising demand, previously uneconomic generation can become not only economic, but highly profitable. The table also highlights the asymmetrical nature of our gearing to power plight rise fluctuations. Texas remains the country's most attractive power market, drawing major demand growth. For instance, the largest Houston transmission company recently reported an 8 gigawatt queue of data center demand, a 700% increase from pre-summer levels. By comparison, northern Virginia, the largest U.S. data center market, has a total installed capacity of around half that. This demonstrates the kind of structural load growth in Texas that could drive significant value beyond our base case. On the right, we feature our portfolio of 21 development sites at current or former power plants, all located in competitive markets. These sites offer desirable attributes and key infrastructure, making them ideal for projects that prioritize speed to market. In Texas, we also continue to evaluate the best use for our two shovel-ready brownfield projects that total 1.1 gigawatts in capacity. Since they were not selected under the Texas Energy Fund's one asset per developer allocation, we have the flexibility to explore other value-enhancing options for these projects, such as directing them to hyperscalers. Together, these opportunities present two of the many high-quality tangible paths to creating additional value well beyond our baseline expectations. On slide nine, we outline what this means for the substantial cash generation we anticipate in the coming years. Our capital allocation plan balances disciplined growth with substantial capital returns to drive sustained value well into the future. Our growth initiatives exceed our hurdle rates, and we invest only where we see exceptional value. Importantly, these investments also exceed the implied return of repurchasing our own stock, which currently trades at a low teens free cash flow yield. That is an extraordinary value in my view. With that, let me turn it over to Rasesh Patel, the head of NRG Consumer, who will provide an exciting update on our virtual power plant initiatives. Rasesh Patel : Thank you, Larry. Turning to slide 10, I am thrilled to announce our strategic partnership with Renew Home and Google to develop a 1 gigawatt residential virtual power plant or VPP in Texas. This partnership brings together leaders across the energy and consumer technology industries to develop an innovative energy management solution for NRG and our customers. Our intention is to combine NRG's consumer reach and supply management expertise with Renew Home's residential demand response capabilities and Google's advanced AI technology. This will enable us to deploy smart thermostats and other devices that will allow our customers to optimize their energy use and save money while enhancing the stability and flexibility of our supply strategy and the Texas grid. On slide 11, you will find the key components of our partnership. We will develop a compelling personalized energy management platform that provides near real-time dispatch of capacity at a fraction the cost of a generation plant. Renew Home will provide the demand response capabilities and will fund a significant portion of customer acquisition costs, minimizing NRG's capital outlay. This collaboration also positions NRG as the partner for all new Google Nest VPP enrollments in Texas. NRG will manage the customer relationship, experience, and dispatch of VPP events. As illustrated in the VPP capital efficiency metrics at the bottom left of the slide, this is an economically attractive approach to supplementing our generation portfolio. The upfront investment is roughly one tenth of a new peaker plant while delivering an IRR greater than 50%, which is significantly higher than traditional alternatives. On the right-hand side of the page, you can see our plan to scale this program with the goal of reaching 650 megawatts of dispatchable capacity by 2030 and a gigawatt by 2035. Now, let's turn to slide 12, where we outline our strategy for bringing the virtual power plant program to market with an exciting new offering. To accelerate our VPP efforts in Texas, we're introducing the Home Essentials bundle, which includes a Vivint Smart Thermostat, doorbell camera, and professional installation, all provided at no cost to customers enrolled in a VPP plan, as long as they remain an NRG Energy customer. Should they choose to leave, they can continue to receive the smart home services for a monthly fee of $14.99, allowing customers to continue enjoying the benefits of smart home while protecting our investment in their experience. We have tested this new value proposition with select energy customers in Texas, and the results have been very encouraging. In our pilot, we're seeing strong adoption of this offer and a step change in customer engagement with the average household using our smart home app more than 160 times per month. Moreover, 20% of these customers have opted to purchase additional smart home products and services that generate incremental recurring revenue. Over time, we see this bundle becoming a powerful entry point that will deliver enhanced value to customers, build scale for VPP, and encourage customers to explore a broader suite of smart home services. We are leveraging our strong market share in Texas to expand our share of wallet with customers with Renew Home co-funding up to $150 of customer acquisition costs through our VPP partnership. This go-to-market strategy focuses on making smart energy solutions accessible, valuable, and deeply engaging. We're meeting our customers where they are, with solutions that empower them to take control of their home and energy experiences while strengthening their relationship with NRG. We will make home-based essentials broadly available in Texas spring 2025. Moving to slide 13, let's take a closer look at how our virtual power plant generates value and delivers strong economics through two distinct value streams, consumer and supply. On the consumer side, where we retain 100% of the economic benefits, we expect margin uplift and increased tenure for customers adopting the Home Based Essentials Bundle, as well as incremental recurring revenue from customers opting for additional smart home services. The home energy industry, relative to other consumer services, has elevated customer churn, and we expect this initiative to improve customer retention due to the enhanced value, engagement, and savings from this integrated offering. On the supply side, where we retain over half the economic benefit, we've provided an illustrated breakdown that shows how VPP creates margin opportunity based on the number of events per summer and the implied in the money power price. Beyond direct value, this asset also provides critical risk mitigation, allowing us to dispatch the VPP to further stabilize our supply portfolio during periods of volatility. At scale, for a 650-megawatt VPP, we anticipate approximately $110 million in annual recurring margin for NRG, $80 million from consumer value, and $30 million from supply value. Looking ahead to a 1-gigawatt VPP, we project the total annual incremental margin to exceed $160 million, making VPP a highly profitable and flexible asset that strengthens both our financial and operational resilience. If Texas supply becomes more constrained in the coming years, as many expect, the value to NRG and our customers will only increase. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we execute this plan. With that, I will turn it over to Bruce to provide the financial review. Bruce Chung : Thank you, Rasesh. Before I discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to provide a few updates on our key financial performance and valuation metrics. As you can see on the slide, we are introducing adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as part of our reporting framework. These metrics offer additional context for NRG's profitability and growth, capturing both underlying business growth driven by investment into our platform, as well as the impact of our robust capital allocation program. For 2024, we are on track to deliver $1.3 billion of adjusted net income, equivalent to $6.35 per share of adjusted EPS. The midpoint of our raised adjusted EPS guidance represents a 12% increase over the midpoint of our original guidance, reflecting the strong business performance. We are pleased to provide these additional tools for investors to use in their evaluation of the investment merits of NRG. We believe these new metrics, coupled with our preexisting metrics, such as free cash flow before growth per share, will continue to shine a spotlight on NRG's attractive valuation. We will continue to provide adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth alongside these two new disclosures for the foreseeable future. Going forward and including today's third quarter results, adjusted EBITDA has been updated to recast all amortization of capitalized customer acquisition costs from SG&A and cost of operations into the depreciation amortization line item. This change addresses a point of common confusion that investors have given us direct feedback on. This is part of our ongoing commitment to provide better visibility into our businesses and simplify the modeling process. More details are available in our 10Q, as well as in the Reg G tables appended to this presentation and this morning's press release. As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, this change results in an upward adjustment to the midpoint of our 2024 guidance by $130 million from $3.56 billion to $3.73 billion. We have accordingly recast adjusted EBITDA for historical periods to conform with this methodology and to allow for direct comparison of our results across reporting periods. This is simply a geography change of non-cash items and therefore has no impact on any of our reported free cash flow before growth or adjusted EPS metrics and outlook. Turning to slide 16, NRG delivered another strong quarter of financial and operational performance with adjusted EBITDA of $1.055 billion, an increase of $68 million over the third quarter of the prior year. Texas delivered $584 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, $32 million higher than Q3 of 2023. When adjusted for asset sales executed in 2023, our outperformance was approximately $80 million. This improvement reflects the strength and resilience of our integrated platform. Unlike last year, Texas was marked by a lack of power price volatility and generally lower pricing despite warm temperatures. Our integrated supply strategy and the ability to turn off units during periods of low pricing enabled us to maximize margins as we served our retail load. The ability to cycle our plans on and off as part of our overall supply strategy is what gives us confidence in delivering consistent financial results through a variety of market conditions. Our east, west, and services segments also demonstrated improved year-over-year outperformance. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $214 million, representing an $18 million increase from the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by lower power and natural gas supply costs resulting in margin expansion and an increase in average customer counts of 7%. Finally, our smart home segment delivered $257 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, an $18 million increase from the prior year. This was driven by mid-single-digit growth in our subscriber count and continued net service margin expansion of 6%, reflecting the embedded operating leverage of the business as the subscriber base continues to grow. As you can see on the table, we have added disclosures for adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. For the third quarter, NRG produced $393 million of adjusted net income, equivalent to $1.90 of earnings per share. This represents a 21% increase over Q3 2023 results, primarily driven by higher gross margin and share of purchases. Free cash flow before growth for the quarter was $815 million, a $460 million increase over Q3 2023. This reflects higher gross margin, favorable working capital, and lower CapEx given the completion of the Parish restoration work in 2023. Lastly, we are reaffirming our revised 2024 financial guidance and have provided our guidance ranges across all the key reporting metrics, including adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Turning to 2024 capital allocation on slide 17, we continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. There are only a few minor changes to the capital allocation waterfall from our second quarter earnings call. On our last earnings call, we announced an agreement to sell our Airtron HVAC business. That transaction closed in late September. As a result, we are updating the net cash proceeds from the Airtron sale to approximately $425 million. We are also increasing free cash flow before growth by $100 million. For liability management preferred dividends, we've reduced our 2024 allocation to $420 million from $602 million. Our aggressive debt reduction over the past few years, coupled with improved financial performance, will result in achieving our target credit metrics by the end of 2024, a full-year earlier than originally intended. As a result, we have reduced the amount of liability management we had intended to pursue in 2024 and have reallocated that cash to our remaining unallocated CAFA. We have increased our share repurchase total from $825 million to $925 million, which reflects the increase in our 2024 FCFbG guidance. Through October 31, we completed $544 million of repurchases, and we expect to complete the remaining repurchases by year-end. Inclusive of our year-to-date activity, we have executed over $3.8 billion in share repurchases at an average price of around $50 since 2019, representing nearly 30% of our shares outstanding. In our other investments, we have allocated $122 million for other growth, including updated spend associated with our ERCOT New Build project. Finally, we expect to end 2024 with approximately $605 million of unallocated capital, which we have rolled into 2025 for application towards continued share buyback programs. Turning to the next slide, we are excited to introduce our financial guidance for 2025. We are guiding 2025 full-year adjusted EBITDA to a range of $3.725 to $3.975 billion, representing a midpoint of $3.85 billion, or an 8% increase from our original 2024 guidance midpoint. As you can see from the chart at the bottom, this is driven by the completion of our previously announced growth and cost synergy programs, margin expansion from higher power prices, and partly offset by the loss EBITDA from the sale of Airtron. We are also guiding 2025 full-year free cash flow before growth to a range of $1.975 billion to $2.225 billion, representing a mid-point of $2.1 billion, also an 8% increase over the midpoint of our original 2024 guidance. In addition to adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth, we are initiating guidance for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. For full-year 2025, we are initiating guidance on adjusted net income to a range of $1.33 billion to $1.53 billion, representing a midpoint of $1.43 billion, and a range of 675 to 775 for adjusted EPS, representing a midpoint of $7.25 per share. Moving to the next slide, we are providing a five-year roadmap with the major drivers of our adjusted EPS and free cash flow before growth investment outlook on a per-share basis. As you can see on the slide, we are targeting long-term adjusted EPS and FCFbG per share growth of greater than 10%. These growth rates are pegged against our recently increased 2024 guidance. More modeling disclosures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. Our five-year outlook is underpinned by visible organic growth resulting in $750 million of incremental run rate adjusted EBITDA and a robust capital return program of nearly $9 billion over the 2025 to 2029 period. I'd also highlight that this five-year outlook assumes flat power pricing and does not include any of the additional upside opportunities Larry touched on earlier. As you can see on the slide, our organic growth plan and share of purchases comprise nearly $4 of EPS growth and nearly $6.50 of FCFbG per share growth. Offsetting this growth is an increase in taxes as available tax credits expire in 2025 and as NRG continues to generate strong earnings that utilize its NOL balance. In addition to taxes, we are projecting the impact of higher interest costs on earnings and free cash flow growth as maturing low-cost debt is refinanced at higher rates. Turning to 2025 capital allocation on the next slide and starting on the left side of the chart, we are showing approximately $2.7 billion of cash available for allocation, which includes the carryover amounts from 2024. As I have already noted, we will achieve our target credit metrics earlier than originally forecasted. And as such, our liability management program in 2025 will be comprised of selling the convertible note hedge and preferred stock dividends. As you can see, the primary focus of our 2025 capital allocation activity will continue to be share purchases with $1.36 billion planned for 2025. Together with the planned 8% increase in the common dividend to $1.76 per share, our total return of capital is currently expected to be about 85% of CAFA after liability management and integration costs. Importantly, for those keeping a scorecard, we're on track to significantly exceed the original return of capital commitment shared as part of our 2023 Investor Day, with more than $4.5 billion to be returned from 2023 through 2025. Given our outstanding performance relative to the 2023 Investor Day plan, our Board of Directors approved an increase in total authorization for repurchases from $2.7 billion to $3.7 billion. As of October 31, approximately $2 billion is remaining under the total authorization inclusive of this increase. In 2025, we have allocated $165 million to other investment, which includes continued progress on our ERCOT new build program, and investment in near-term actionable initiatives related to our long-term organic growth plan. Finally, we are showing $235 million of unallocated capital, which we will allocate over the course of 2025. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Larry. Larry Coben : Thank you, Bruce. Turning to slide 22, we provided you today a detailed view of our compelling five-year financial outlook enhanced with additional disclosures for clear insights into our earnings and growth trajectory. Our plan is simple, transparent, and backed by durable recurring cash flows and a strong balance sheet. We're confident in achieving our long-term targets of at least 10% growth in adjusted EPS and free cash flow before growth per share, with numerous opportunities to significantly exceed these goals. In closing, on slide 23, 2024 has been another year of strong execution, where we have delivered financial, operation, and capital allocation results well ahead of guidance and expectations. I'm exceptionally proud of the work of our 18,000 employees across all of our organization who have driven these results. I'm deeply committed to driving NRG forward to creating additional significant shareholder value. We are seeing a long-term step change improvement in fundamentals across our platform. You can expect a continued and remaining heightened focus on operational excellence, prudent growth, and being good stewards of our investors' capital. I have never been more excited about the potential of NRG than I am today. Thank you for your time and continued interest. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey, guys, good morning. Larry Coben : Morning, Shahriar, how are you? Shahriar Pourreza : All right. Quite an update, Larry, quite an update. Let me just start just, I want to touch on the process around the sites. Some of your peers this week mentioned portfolio approaches to hyperscaler deals. You have the ability to provide a degree of additionality with the gas units. Is it still your plan to update the Street in January, and how are you seeing -- are you seeing more interest in one region versus the other? Thanks. Larry Coben : Yes, and yes -- no, sorry, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza : [Multiple Speakers] -- before, by the way. Larry Coben : It worked. Shahriar Pourreza : I got tongue-tied for the first time. Larry Coben : No, we are -- so, we are going to provide an update, as we said, by the fourth quarter call. And we're seeing a lot of interest across our sites, both in PJM and in Texas, both in portfolio approaches and in individual approaches. Look, I think it's a very complex process, rapidly changing. We're still figuring out exactly it is that we want. And I think by stepping back, as we did, and now diving back in, we're really in a position to optimize the value of what we have, so still super-excited. We've done a lot more site analysis, as you can see in the appendix here. And we look forward to updating you when that time comes. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And then, as we get more disclosures, you plan on layering in the optionality into the numbers through time or how do we get an update -- Larry Coben : Yes, I mean I think as we know what the numbers are, we will layer them in. Now, remember how we talked about before some of this may be things that we never ever disclosed because someone comes to us and they want an extra 1,000 megs of something, and then we decide we're going to build the plant and some hyperscalers may or may not want those two events tied together. So, one of the ways that you may see that we're doing this is all of a sudden raising our estimates, raising our CAGR, all of those kind of things rather than one-off announcements. Could go either way, but that's where you'll see it. Shahriar Pourreza : All right, perfect. And then, just lastly, coming back to sort of the identified growth component of the plan, appreciate obviously the breakdowns between the segments through '29. Some of these are obviously familiar to investors like the C&I margin, customer counts, but some aren't. Where do you see kind of the most room for variability within these three verticals? And then, any color on cost to achieve? Appreciate it, guys. Larry Coben : Sure. Look, I think we've put out a plan that we're really excited to and feeling really good about signing up for. And I think we see bias to the upside across all of these things. I mean, if there's a world recession or something, are people going to move less and maybe purchase less energy or fewer smart home? Anything is possible same in the industrial sector. But we feel really good, Shar, about what we've signed up here for. And to achieve this $750 million of annualized EBITDA over the next five years, we're going to invest $1.6 billion in total. So, that's the cost to achieve. Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. I appreciate it guys. Congrats on the results and it's good to see that Bruce was busy. Appreciate it. Larry Coben : Once a year whether he needs to or not, Shar. Thank you, Shar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, Larry, team. Good morning, guys. Nice to chat. Just following up a little bit on -- hey, good, good, good, pleasure guys; nicely done. Maybe just following up a little bit on what Shar picked you on first here. Let me needle you a little further on this in terms of, just the update timeline and more specifically what that could look like as you think about, what to set expectations around. Should we say January or otherwise here, right? Is it principally are your efforts geared principally towards this additionality and leveraging those two additional sites, or are you still thinking it seems earlier that you were principally focused on the Midwest portfolio, the site value there? We've seen a lot of excitement in the Midwest. Is that more of where we should be thinking about again? I know there's 20 plus sites here. Tell me what permutation may be. Larry Coben : Julien, I think it's both. I mean, I think what's happened is we were obviously still laser focused on the 21 sites and we remain so. But when the TEF decided that they were only going to give one loan per customer as they did that we felt for us that opened up the additionality potential for those two shovel ready projects. And so, we kind of just put them into the mix post the TEF announcement which was around the end of August you'll recall. And there's I think a fair amount of interest because as you know, I think you've written about additionality is going to be critical going forward to the development of these kind of sites and to have shovel ready additionality is rare. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Yes, indeed. And actually just to clarify that even, with respect to TEF, would you expect TEF part 2 here to include those sites here? I mean, is sort of the idea to double dip, if you will, between TEF and additionality next year potentially with the customer? Larry Coben : We haven't put out any guidance at all about TEF II. We don't know if it's going to occur. So, we're going to push forward right now as if there is no TEF II for those projects. But if that shows up, obviously that's one option that we will consider. I don't know that you'll be able to double dip. We'll have to wait and see what the rules are. But we don't need to double dip to make those very attractive to somebody who's looking for additionality. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Okay, excellent. Thank you. And VPP, out of that $1.6 billion I think, how much does it cost you to do the VPP? I think you said $100 a kilowatt, so it's like $65 million for the 650 kilowatt? Larry Coben : Yes, Julien, one of the unique things about VPP is we don't have to wait to get the benefit as we acquire customers and put the assets to work. We actually start to realize the value. And so, think of it as, we ramp up investment, and it stays below $50 million for us because we start to gain benefits from the deployed assets. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Excellent, guys. Thank you so much. All the best. Larry Coben : Thanks, Julien. Talk to you later. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, guys. Thank you so much. All the best. Larry Coben : Thank you, Julien. Talk to you later. Operator : Thank you. Now, our next question is coming from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Your line is now open. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. It's kind of funny that all these questions are focused on what else do you have to say, even though the entire call was filled with announcements. Larry Coben : Well said, Angie. Angie Storozynski : Anyway, the bar is set really high, I guess. So, my question is about the VPP, Virtual Power Plant. So, we're seeing some cooling off in, like, battery investments in Texas, right? I mean, there is this realization that existing batteries are starting to cannibalize on peak power prices and that eats into the pricing arbitrage that these batteries rely on. And so, why shouldn't the same be true for the VPP? And I understand that the biggest component of the profitability of this business is basically customer retention, so the energy component is relatively small, but why shouldn't that be true that in a sense, the curve gets sort of flatter and your ability to actually capture this additional energy benefit is lower? Rob Gaudette : Hey, Angie, it's Rob, and great observation. What I would tell you or remind you is, because we serve consumer energy customers, we're always building our portfolio and we're including that component that I've called insurance, right, the options on the back end. What VPP does is it self-provides that, right? So as we think about the customer and as we think about how we insure against an extreme event, the beauty of VPP is it is the perfect hedge for that kind of exposure. So, when I look out the curve and as we're building the portfolio over time, what VPP does is it helps me manage the risks of a consumer energy business without having to go to a third-party or dropping a lot of money to build massive peakers to meet that same obligation. So, I feel really good about the economics that we've got here and as far as the long-term perspective, this is absolutely the best tool to manage the risk of a home-based energy book. Does that help? Angie Storozynski : Okay, so basically it's the most cost-effective way to hedge against spikes and super peaks, right? I mean -- Rob Gaudette : Absolutely. Angie Storozynski : Not that we've seen it, and that's my other question, is that we -- I mean, keep hearing those incredible announcements. It's almost hard to even believe that they can be said with a straight face, right, 80 gigs of load in Texas from non-core. I mean, and yet the curve is just not reacting at all. It's almost as if -- and again, could it be that this load is not going to impact '28 or even '29, and that's why we're not seeing any response or how can you actually reconcile the lack of response in forward power curves in Texas? Rob Gaudette : Yes, so I look at both of those things. And what I would tell you is that I am with you. I don't believe that the curve reflects the load that we expect or the supply-demand picture that we would expect in the future. As far as how we think about it and whether or not it's going to show up, I believe that the load is coming. I don't know if it's 80 gigs and honestly, we don't need 80 gigs. But part of the curve, remember, in the reaction inside of pricing is pretty short-sighted viewing or just looking a little bit into history. This summer was a little less warm than last year. We didn't have any real price formation like we did last year, and then everybody kind of lost sight of what could happen. If you look into the future and you think about, okay, well, if you just add a little bit of incremental load into the ERCOT market, you have a real opportunity giving a renewables profile and call it just abnormal weather to really get price formation. And then, everybody will be excited again and the curves will go to the moon and we'll be managing through it. You've seen this before. We've all seen it. I just don't think that these curves in '28, '29 and beyond reflect reality. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And the last question. So, maybe to both Bruce and Larry, so is there a free cash flow yield that below which you think that the share buybacks are just unwarranted and there is some other way of capital return or maybe M&A or some other strategy change? Larry Coben : Angie, there is one, but I don't think we're anywhere close to it. I mean, we're still in the double digits. So, when we get to the mid-single digits, maybe we can have that kind of a look again, depending on what the opportunities in the world looks like. But right now, given the undervaluation of the stock, it's still a pretty high hurdle rate for us. But we all look forward to the day, and I'm sure you do too, that when the stock is trading so high that that becomes a real question for us. Angie Storozynski : Yes, to infinity and beyond. Okay. Thank you. Larry Coben : To infinity and beyond. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Rasesh Patel : Thank you, Angie. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Michael Sullivan : Hey, good morning. Larry Coben : Good morning. How are you? Michael Sullivan : Good, good. Congrats on all the announcements here. Just, I know, so you gave this 10% plus and said it can vary year-to-year, but just to clarify, does that mean you can go below it, below 10% in some years, or it's just going to be 10% or better in every year and how much better can vary? Larry Coben : Yes, I mean, Mike, I think the reality is there may be some years where it might go below, there might be some years where it's going to go above, but generally speaking on a long-term basis, we see visibility around that plus 10% over the long-term. Michael Sullivan : Okay. And just specifically on that, so if we go to slide 19 with the tax impact, does that all fall away in '26? So should we think of like '26 as being a lower year and then you kind of catch back up again in the out year or? Larry Coben : I mean, there is an incremental increase in the tax rate after '25 because of expiring tax credits. I think the way that we think about that growth is to the extent that there's a drag as a result of an incrementally higher tax rate, we probably see some business performance and business growth offsetting that drag. Michael Sullivan : Okay, great. And then, yes, the VPP announcement, good to see there, and maybe just -- is it fair to kind of bifurcate it as you broke out the 80 million component as being more stable and then locked in, and then that 30 million component, it looks like would have been a lot better in '23 if you get a summer like that, and then if we got this summer, maybe wouldn't have been around that level. Is that fair? Rasesh Patel : Hey, Michael. This is Rasesh. Yes, that's a good way to think about it. The customer value is going to be stable and very sustainable. The supply value, which Rob can add a little more color on, that can be significantly higher in years of tighter markets. And so, I think that's the right way to think about it. Rob, would you add anything? Rob Gaudette : Yes, so the thing I would have you think about from the supply perspective, remember that we're using this in lieu of some form of insurance, right? So the values on the page represents what it would cost me, right? On the top part of the slide, this is what we would have, this is what we save by not having to go and replace this with a heat rate call option or something like that, the representation down at the bottom where we talk about the different years. So, in '23, the value of that insurance would have been considerably more valuable than say this year, where we didn't have any real price formation. But when you think about it long-term with NRG and how we build it in the portfolio, I'm going to buy that insurance regardless. So, I'm building the book 12 to 18 months out. We're putting in the insurance to protect our business. And so, we're going to capture the values up at the top. And then, the representation at the bottom is just the value that, that protected me from, right? So, I bought insurance in '23. It was really valuable. I bought insurance this year, and I didn't need it. That's the examples at the bottom. So, the value that we see around VPP is consistent year, every year, regardless of the circumstances, because I'm going to buy that insurance to protect the portfolio anyway. Does that make sense? Michael Sullivan : It does. Thanks, Rob. That's really helpful. Okay. And the last one, just to round it out there too, I mean, it's pretty sizable. Can you maybe just give us a sense of, are there any competitors out there or other people looking to do this or how big does that VPP market get in Texas overall, outside of what you were doing? Larry Coben : That's a great question. And one of the reasons I think NRG is so uniquely positioned is we have a skilled customer base. We have the supply management expertise. And now partnering with Renew Home and Google, we're partnered with the largest demand response platform in North America. The partnership also gives us exclusivity to all new Nest thermostat enrollments and to demand response in Texas. And to give you context around that, there are already a million Nest thermostats deployed in ERCOT, almost 300,000 of which are overlapped with the NRG customer base. And so, this is a very unique opportunity for NRG. And two, everything that we've outlined today is showing you the thermostat opportunity. But we will be working with our partners to tie in batteries, electric vehicles, other things onto the platform where we can leverage already deployed resources into this platform. And so, Michael, I think it'd be very hard for anybody else to replicate this at scale. Michael Sullivan : Okay, awesome. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Arcaro : Hey, thanks so much. Good morning. Larry Coben : Hi, David. How are you? David Arcaro : Good, good. Hey, I was wondering if there's an organic growth kind of opportunity at the retail energy business that could be potential upside from here. How is that incorporated in there? I mean, it seems like we're seeing pretty good residential growth in Texas over time, plus all of the C&I growth potential from new data center load. I didn't really see that maybe clearly called out as one of the components of the EBITDA growth opportunity. So, wondering how you're thinking about that? Rasesh Patel : Yes. It's a great question. The way I would really think about this is we have very strong market share on the residential energy side in Texas. Nearly 40% share of the market. And so, the larger opportunity we see is how do we leverage that household relationship to actually expand share of wallet with customers. And through the launch of Homes Base Essentials, we're giving our existing skilled customer base a lot of incremental value. And in the trial that we've seen over the summer, where we've provided customers this new bundle, 20% of them have already bought incremental smart home services from us. And that's very attractive. So, I would just characterize that as there will be opportunity, obviously, with modest household growth. But, the larger opportunity for NRG is to expand the share of wallet, leveraging the near 40% market share we have in home energy. David Arcaro : Yes, got you. Absolutely. Makes sense. And maybe on that data center side, is there growth coming to your service territory that would boost the commercial and industrial side of the business in terms of retail contract opportunities and retail growth? Are you seeing data centers show up in the retail business coming to you with multi-year energy contract opportunities? Larry Coben : Short answer is yes. We are definitely seeing data centers coming with long-term contract requirements. And then, the way to think about how it affects the rest of the C&I marketplace is that in a market where there's growing tightness and there's competition for those megawatts, I've said it before and we've talked about it, there's a flight to quality that occurs amongst large industrials and commercial customers where they want additional service. They want skilled operators on the other side of their contracts. And so, we see an uplift into our opportunity set as we see this trend continue in ERCOT and honestly in PJM. David Arcaro : Got it. Okay, great. Thanks so much. Larry Coben : Yes, sir. Rasesh Patel : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing up for the questions in the queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Larry Coben for any closing remarks. Larry Coben : I want to thank you all for your interest in NRG. As you can tell from our releases, our slides, and our presentation, we are all super excited about our business. And, we look forward to keeping you up-to-date on it going forward. Have a great day and have a great weekend. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect.",
